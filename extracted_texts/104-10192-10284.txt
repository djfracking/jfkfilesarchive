3. THE MRP WAS PRESENTLY SHORT OF ARMS. AND EXPLOSIVES BUT THE
POSITION WAS IMPROVING. (A MILITIA CAPTAIN WAS RECENTLY
SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR PASSING ARMS TO THE MRO).
NO HELP WHATSOEVER MAD BEEN RECEIVED BY THE INTERNAL RESISTANCE
FROM THE "SOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHO PROVIDED SUPPORT.
FOR THE INVASION". THESE-SOURCES WERE STILL THINKING
INEFFECTUALLY IN TERMS OF A FURTHER INVASION.:
4. THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE RESISTANCE IN CUBA TOWARDS
THE EXILES WAS ONE OF INDIFFERENCE MOUNTING TO CONTEMPT FOR
SPECIFIC MOVES SUCH AS THE PROPOSED PROMOTION OF A CUBAN GÖVT
IN EXILE. WHAT THE RESISTANCE WANTED WAS FUNDS AND THE RETURN,
BY INFILTRATION, OF TRAINED EXILES, PARTICULARLY COMMUNICATION
EXPERTS.
5. ON THE TIMING OF CASTRO'S OVERTHROW, RAY SAID CASTRO WOULD
NOT LAST ANOTHER YEAR. HE ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN CUBA
IMMEDIATELY AFTER CASTRO'S DOWNFALL WOULD BE DANGEROUS AND COULD
DEVELOP INTO A. CIVIL WAR.
6. FIELD DISSEM: STATE. CINCLANT, CINCARIB.
