FROM:
SUBJECT
OSO Representative, CIA Defector Committee
Army Disposal Action on Defector to Chile.
1. On 17 August 1951, CIA received a priority cable (IN 21787)
from Santiago advising that the Chilean Consul in Frankfurt, Germany,
had requested authority from his Foreign Office to issue an "ordinary
visa” to Sociala ärœdez, a Russian defector (actually a Polish defoo-
tor), ctating that American Intelligence had requested the visa on the
same basis as in the case of earlier defectors. Santiago indicated that
Chilean officials did not look on this with favor.
