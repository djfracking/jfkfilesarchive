Mr. Kirbow. That kind of relationship is something that
we should stay away from because I don't see any harm in it,
nor do I think the record demonstrates any harm in it. I don't
see I don't know how in the world this person doing that
taints the minds of the American reading public, which is
apparently what you are trying
you're not trying to protect
the newsman. You are trying to protect the reader who doesn't
know that what he's getting is being spoonfed to him from the
CIA, and I don't know why we would be so concerned about
protecting newsmen from working, or prohibiting them from
working, because I think they have a right to do that as
12 American citizens, just as they do to work with the Department

Mr. Kirbow.
Well, perhaps I misunderstand the extension
that you, your full recommendation.
Do you want to go beyond where the administration is in
their position?
Mr. Bader. I am recommending to go beyond where the
Administration is at this stage, to extend the operational
prohibition on the part of CIA to use American -- Americans in
the media
Mr. Kirbow. Wherever located.
Mr. Bader. Where they are using them undercover, at this
stage, to the extent that it is a cover proposition.
Senator Huddleston. Even if they are in foreign media?
Mr. Bader. Yes, sir.
Senator Huddleston. And even though all of their
activities are related to foreign; they are not writing for
American news services.
Mr. Bader. Alternately; they could be with American
media organizations.
Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, I don't think there is a single
shred of evidence on our record that that is in any way wrong-
doing or in any way adversely affects the rights of American
citizens. Clearly it will prohibit or could prohibit in the
future the proper use of an individual that could be essential
to the intelligence collection processes of the CIA, and it
singles out a specific agency which is not doing any harm to

Mr. Kirbow. But if he's in the Paris Trib, that's an
affiliated U.S.
Mr. Aaron. Well, suppose he writes for the Financial
Times?
Senator Mathias. Well, you could work out an echo program
if you wanted.
Senator Huddleston. Well, the basic point, instead.
of picking instances, it seems to me, is whether or not as an
official policy of the United States Government we want an
institution such as the press with all it means and all it is
supposed to be in American with its constitutional provisions and
whatever, to be subverted to the secret, clandestine operation
that it can; Anytime we put any prohibition anywhere, we are
eliminating somebody as a potential agent. You can't use
that as a guideline.

time for the Communist Party paper in Italy or Portugal or

Now, that obviously would be covered by the example that
Bill has provided as a prohibition.
There are two questions. One is whether the person has
any real operational use that you want to preserve, and second,
whether it goes to the question that David presents, which is
the possible contamination of the American press, which seems
a difficult extension in that example, as well as the possibility

And the second problem seems to be, with an example like
that, is that it seems to there is very little stock in the
argument, because the argument about distortion of what goes
on in foreign countries and people's perceptions is at the heart

American, regardless of status, or who they write for or what
they are doing.

institutions, it is clear that they are subject to some
manipulation or at least questionable manipulation, and there
are issues in people's minds as to its integrity.

collection under cover as a roving international news corres-
pondent, a CIA officer under cover as a European representative
of an American company while working as a stringer for a
United States publication engages in intelligence collection

CIA relationship while the publication is not. Bona fide
journalists who regularly provide the CIA with intelligence,
some are paid regularly while others are not. In one case

was one of the possibilities of the whole list.
Senator Huddleston.
But the recommendation at the top
of 64 doesn't cover an American citizen who is using the
foreign media as cover.

Senator Huddleston. The assumption is if the media of
the press is subverted, that it will affect the citizens, or
they will suffer.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, in the interest
of expedition, I move the passage of these three recommendations.
Senator Huddleston. All right. Let's see what the three
are.
Mr. Aaron. Well, let me summarize the first one. I think
we have agreed the first is that the prohibition on distribu-
10 tion of CIA funded, supported, subsidized and so forth, that
11
that be prohibited within the United States.
12
Mr. Inderfurth. Printed.

Mr. Aaron. The word "printed" dropped out for the following
reason. One, it makes it easier to prohibit the distribution
if you don't identify where the printing is taking place, and
secondly, while there is no printing going on here, the
question really goes to distribution. I think that was the
concurrence of the Committee.
The second point is that the prohibitions of that the
Agency now has upon itself, be made law.
Mr. diGenova. On the use of media personnel and
institutions?
Mr. Aaron. On the use of media personnel and institutions
and the third point is that it be extended to say by statute

the CIA should be prohibited from using American media organiza-

Senator Huddleston.
Well, the style of this ought to
be changed, it seems to me, because one of the recommendations,
instead of listed under recommendations, is the last paragraph
on 63, is that correct?

felt that this, the first step they took was the one that was
dealing with what the public was demanding.

Senator Huddleston. What this does is extends beyond
the practice of journalists to any other person, be it an
executive or clerk or typist or whatever, on the assumption
that you can't be a little bit pregnant. If the agency is
going to be subverted anywhere, not the agency, if the insti-
tution of the press is, that it is going to be subverted..
Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, the Agency has accepted the
basic principle, because it has removed from its list of
operational assets a rather larger number than this would
call for.
Mr. Kirbow. But if I hear correctly what you are saying
then, we are out to protect the American media from being made
24
25
pregnant by the CIA and not worrying at all about the reading
public or the other, but just the media.

instance, we welcome this policy which they intend to put into
their operational prohibitions, and the recommendation that
we bring to you is a very simple one, in addition to that, is
that it be extended from contractual to all operational relation-
ships, paid and unpaid.

Mr. Kirbow. The other thing is the Committee may want
to support legislation that is already pending.

the position that it has no covert arrangements with American

they have relationship of a clandestine character which don't

Mr. Bader. Yes, as of February 10, 1976.

our findings, and it explains it better than I can.
Mr. Bader. This has not been, obviously you can see,

Senator Huddleston. I don't think you can prohibit all
those kinds of people. I think some kind of definition should
include the primary occupation of clergy, clergy itself.
Senator Mathias. Well, why don't we commit to staff for

Senator Huddleston.
I think we will have to do that.
Okay. Are we ready to move on that?
Mr. Aaron. The recommendation is that whomever or however:
we define them and that's obviously an important question,
that they either be prohibited by statute. The other alternative
is to simply prohibit any further or recommend the prohibition
of any further CIA recruitment in this field.

Mr. Maxwell.
There may be a First Amendment argument
here, particularly in fundamentalist groups whose religious
beliefs are committed, are directed toward opposition toward
Godless atheism.
Mr. diGenova. Except that the control of religious organi-
zation has historically been subject to governmental regulation
in this sense: the Supreme Court in light of Senator Hart's
question last night, I did a little bit of research. The
-
9 example, the prime example of regulation doesn't deal so
10 much with prohibition of the Government dealing with someone,
11
12
13
although there are vast areas where the government is not
permitted to get into. The question is, for years the Supreme
Court has ruled that there are certain health regulations of
14
states that religious sects must comply with, and they have
15
to comply with it even if it conflicts with their basic religious
16
belief, that they have to comply with it, like quarantines
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
or things of that nature.
So there is clearly an area where the First Amendment of
religious freedom concept falls in the face of a greater good,
the need of the general public, and that has generally been
in the health area, where there is some practice of the
religion which conflicts with some standard which has been
set in the community at large, and that generally has dealt
with health.
Mr. Kirbow. Maybe the HEW Act can bring the CIA under one

Mr. Maxwell. The problem is that's not quite applicable
to this, and one has to argue in the past the Court has ruled
on things that are found to be a threat to the personal liveli-
hood or health of the individual rather than something that
could be construed in a fundamentalist sense.
10
Senator Huddleston.
This doesn't preclude a sect that
may be anti-atheist and as such anti-Communist from pursuing

its principles, but the restriction would be pursing them through

Ms. Culbreath. Would this prohibit, then, somebody who was
a member of one of these sects that was in an area where they
gained information that would be helpful from them being sources?
Senator Huddleston. I wouldn't think so if they wanted
to write letters to the CIA.
Ms. Culbreath.

Well, just in terms of the debriefing kind

would be of any value to assert in our report that we recognize
that the Agency has to find proper cover for its agents, that
restricting that cover is a matter of some importance, but there
are certain institutions that the Committee feels because of
their nature and because of their standing in the country, and
because of the need for the public to have confidence in them,
that they should be, in effect, off limits, and because of that

At the bottom of page 67 is a bracketed quote about

Well, here's what happened here. This
paragraph deals with the fact that when the Agency disposes or
dissolves a proprietary, it tries to avoid conflicts of interest.
However, when noted that sometimes pressures were brought
to bear on the Agency to dispose of the entity as a favor to
someone, so that it would benefit someone else.
Now, the most glaring example of this was this activity
of the former Director, Admiral Raborn, who actually became
involved in negotiations on behalf of a client, Overseas

undue influence on those people.
Senator Huddleston.
Joe, is it accurate to say that
pressures were often brought to bear?
Mr. diGenova. We changed that to say sometimes. This is
a rewrite. Someone else wrote this after I had submitted it,
and we had a meeting today, and we changed several things in
there.
So I leave it up to the Committee. This was a matter that
I wanted to flag it and leave it there. The explanation

this that would contain all the facts.
Senator Huddleston. I am concerned now whether any other
instances of someone may be, of similar standing as Admiral
Raborn.
Mr. diGenova. Yes. There are instances in the record
which do not deal with proprietaries, of John McCone interceding
on behalf of Pan American directly with the Director of
Central Intelligence, and it is not mentioned in the report,
and it should be, and it is a problem that we have had, Mr.

suppose the same arguments could be used here on this matter.
Mr. Kirbow. But the point I raised at the staff meeting
just before the Committee came back, when the subject was

currently in a civilian status, although he was former

had violated, and none is apparently cited in the record.
Pressure was brought to bear, there is no doubt about it, by
Admiral Raborn. I think there's another example. I'm not
sure whether Joe described it to me or someone else, of a
very senior official out there dealing back with the Agency.
Now, the military, as Senator Hart knows, is prohibited
from this by regulations and I think by law. I know that as a
regular military officer, you are not allowed to do contractual
business with your agency forever, but with the other military
departments and the Department of Defense, I think you have to
have a cleansing period of five to seven years.
I don't believe there is any such provision in the Act
that applies to former Directors, and probably what the Committee
should do is consider this action without necessarily naming
him unless he was in violation of some really serious
wrongdoing, and make a prohibition, drawn similarly, with what
now applies to senior officials going back and kind of exerting

phone calls and overtures, and it is a former Director trying to
gain a benefit. It is an unseemly situation, and they labeled
it as a conflict of interest which they sought to avoid, and
in fact they did, and they are praised for it in the report
because they were really under tremendous pressure.
So I have no feeling one way or the other. I think to
leave out his name unfairly impugns the other. To leave it in,
also, is only the second time in the whole findings and conclusion
that we mention anybody's name, so I don't care.
Senator Huddleston. And you've got one, Recommendation
No. 5, related to the disposal of the proprietaries, that the
Justice Department approve?

That work has been done. It has not been pursued vigorous-

Senator Huddleston. That happened after he left.
Mr. diGenova. That's right, after Mr. McCone left the
DCI, he had frequent contacts, according to the records, with
the Agency, with high level Agency personnel, and in one instance
instance
he interceded personally with the Director of Central Intelli-
gence to avoid actions which would be taken by another govern-
ment and its airline which would adversely affect Pan American
World Airways.

I think we've already said that
pressures sometimes were brought to bear and we make recommenda-

Ms. Culbreath. Mr. Chairman, could I suggest that maybe if
we do delete that, that we perhaps redo that previous sentence-
to make it a little stronger, and perhaps in some way
indicate that these were serious pressures, and they were, I
think, hard pressures to withstand when somebody in that kind
of position
cut.
Senator Huddleston. They were withstood, though.
Mr. Maxwell. They would get lost the way the sentence is
Mr. diGenova. I think what we will do is David and I
will get together, and Elizabeth, and we will change this
"however" sentence, the sentence that precedes the one that
has just been deleted, and we will expand that sentence to
more accurately explain that the pressures came from high sources

come to this overally conclusion based upon your total concept
of the Agency and its procedures and everything else in view
of the findings.
Mr. diGenova. The only thing I want to do is David,
I know you have gone through this, but the Senators may want to
look at page 68 through 70, which deal with cover, and particu-
larly with Mr. Welch.
Ms. Culbreath. I had a point I wanted to raise on that.
Mr. diGenova. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think the Senators
want to read this.

judgments, but they have some problems with cover in general,
but I don't think this is going to be part of that problem.
Senator Huddleston. I have some problem with this page
70 relating to Welch because it seems the whole implication of
9 that is that he was murdered because his cover was blown, and
so far there has been no evidence that that is the case. It
highlights the argument, I think, correctly, but it seems to me
it leaves the impression that here is a case where a fellow's
cover or lack of cover resulted in his death.

I think the Agency people have specifically said to us

terrorism and incitement for these kind of people to take the

terrorism or the vulnerability it makes of people

this was an added danger, but because they've got a job to
do, they're not going to really do too much about it. It's
a real risk they are just going to have to bear.
Senator Huddleston. That's an occupational hazard, but we
are talking about how to protect their cover, and our recommen-
16 dation is that they use have an official cover.

These statements here, Senator, this is a

we should maybe in the findings and recommendations shorten
this and maybe
Mr. Kirbow. I think the part of the record which is an
unknown fact is why Dick Welch was killed, and we should stay
away from any quotes or other pronouncements in our paper which
attribute his death to any particular thing unless we know
something.
Mr. Aaron. I think that is a good point. We might put
in here a statement which says the Committee has no information
as to the reasons, purposes or cause, specific cause, of his
death. The point is to get at the question of cover, to
step out to the question of cover in the report, as we do, I
think, appropriately, but not have talked about the one case
where this all came out in public, rightly or wrongly.
Mr. Kirbow. Why don't we use the cover for the gentleman
in London, then, where as the tour buses go by, of course, you
know this is the home of the CIA chief, and he hasn't been
24
killed yet or anything like that. If we want to use that

kind instead of using this death example, which, by the way,

Mr. Kirbow. The very highest, including attending the
funeral.
Mr. diGenova. Well, I think one of the things we wanted
to pinpoint here, and first of all, I think we can summarize the
"
Agency's testimony a little better. The Agency said, nothing
this Committee did, first of all, had anything to do with his
death, as far as they know.
Ms. Culbreath. But they don't know.
Mr. diGenova. As far as they know, they don't know one
way or another, but the impression that was created in the
press was, and was pandered to by the DCI and the President,
was that the general actions of exposure of Agency operations
were responsible for the death of Mr. Welch, and they pandered
that by inviting Committee members to the funeral as if they
bore some responsibility.

Now, the obvious public relations value of Mr. Welch's
death, the first time in history the DDO and the DCI go to
a funeral in public, they never did that, and there is no doubt
that they tried to make political hay out of his death. I
think it is only fair that the Committee ultimately say
Senator Huddleston. Right, but I think you've got two
7 different problems. You've got a problem with whether the
00
Committee wants to present its case and exonerate itself on the
basis of everything that is known about the death of Welch,
10 and whether that is pertinent to the problem of cover.

under nonofficial cover. It seems like what we need, there's
a statement here is that official cover has not proved to be
effective, and if we mention Welsh at all, I think the point we
16 mention there is that his name was carried, that while he was
there supposedly under cover, his name was in fact carried in a
15

newspaper, the name of his newspaper had been carried in a
foreign newspaper, and he was living in a house that was known

to be the house.

Mr. Kirbow. His true identity was widely known.
Senator Huddleston. We can cite him as an example without
23 indicating why he had been killed, of here is a case that
24 everybody knows about, so-called official cover was not in
25 fact very deep cover.

instances we could recommend fairly strongly whatever we want
the followon people to do to ensure that the recommendation
does not create havoc within the Agency or does not leave the
rights of citizens unprotected.

talking to Joe about defining the small business, and I think
we fairly well understand what the concern is, or do we, Joe?
14
Mr. diGenova. Senator, I was going to suggest, if you
look at Recommendation No. 3, while it doesn't define what a
15

large proprietary is, the Senator was concerned about what
17
was meant by "should be kept small, and I tried to indicate

employees of the CIA, both in Langley and abroad, and then
another 8000 employees of the Air America complex. That is
big.
But I think what we should say is, organizationally small,
and organizationally and numerically small, because what we are
really talking about is when they get big, whether it is in
numbers or finances, and larger in terms of people usually means

Mr. Aaron. It's not mentioned specifically, but it might
be possible to say, you know, maybe you can put a footnote on
the first paragraph which simply said
Mr. diGenova. You mean on the findings of page 66 that
"too often large proprietaries have created unfair"
Mr. Aaron. "Unwarranted risks of unfair competition with
10 with private business in compromising their cover." You should
11
say, "for example," "Air America, for example, which had 8,000
12 employees," and so forth, ran into both of these problems.
Senator Huddleston. I think that would be all right.

Then you've got the review and the

Mr. diGenova. Yes.
Mr. Inderfurth. Why not take out the first as well and

just go to Recommendation No. 2 as No. 12.

Mr. diGenova. Well, I think can I just say this

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering if it could be
designed in such a way as care should be taken, that it not be
any larger than necessary to achieve the objective for which
it was established.
Mr. Kirbow. Excuse me, Senator. It would not get the
Air America thing because at the time they needed one twice

The reason this language is in here is that

other words, a small number of employees, small operation.
Senator Huddleston. What about their insurance business?
Mr. diGenova. ~That's kind of an exception, although
actually that is an example of a lot of money with only a few

Mr. Kirbow. Here, Mr. Chairman, I think again the point we
made yesterday, that we should say at least annually, so that
they don't put you in a box if you want one every two months
because of circumstances, "at least annually."
Senator Huddleston. You could add in Section 3, at least

Perhaps the better thing to do, since these proprietaries
are for a specific need at a specific time, and since we have
got the review procedure, is sort of trust it- to the oversight

that may be, and leave it to them, maybe just delete that

May I raise a question to the second
recommendation, as to the reason why by statute there would be
an annual review rather than recommending that to Congressional
Committees.
The second part of that is, my understanding of a number
of the proprietaries is that they are not operating, and to
require GAO audit of a whole group of in a sense notional
organizations may be preempting the kind of review that the

Mr. Aaron. No. 2 is rewritten so it is not required by

The only thing I had in mind of

taking out of 2 was just the independent GAO audit being

the Committee, but leave the rest of the review, right?

Mr. Aaron.
That's it, consisting of a report to the over-
sight Committee of an internal CIA audit, is that rigt?
Mr. Kirbow. What you are trying to do is to require
the CIA to reveiw it, to conduct a CIA audit, and to report
fully all of the review entailed.
Mr. diGenova. Not just the audit themselves. There are

summarize where we stand.
Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, where I think we are at the
moment is taking the three major issues before the Subcommittee
in the order they were presented, and discussed this morning,
the first being the academic issue, and as I heard the Subcom-
9 mittee this morning, then I will have another go at the

publishing houses. We discussed two recommendations:

one which
I believe here the Committee has agreed to, and that is a
prohibition on the distribution or subsidy of any books,
magazines or other publications not attributed to the CIA in-

No, no, Charles, because the point they

proprietaries appeared in the budget presentation. They have
been hidden, and the object is to identify them in the budget.
as a line item, for example.
Mr. Maxwell. One suggestion might be, be listed, that
implies a list of proprietaries.
Senator Huddleston. Where does this list go?
Mr. Kirbow. What you want to do is to require them to
include a discussion of the proprietaries in his annual report
to the oversight committee is what you want to do, isn't
it, because they don't have that now. They don't report to
211
the Armed Services Committee. They only report to Appropriations.
Senator Huddleston. How would it be listed in the budget

to be asking, but the thrust of this was to make sure that
proprietaries found their way into the budget, and that Senators
knew what they were authorizing when they authorized the budget.
Now, how it gets in there, I am not a budget expert.
Mr. Kirbow. That is what I am trying to supply here because
in this process there is a procedure that when you say there shal
be authorizing legislation, where the line items are discussed.
before the authorizing committee and not before the budget
committee, which is the appropriations committee, and if you

proprietaries in his annual report to the oversight committee,
you will accomplish what you are trying to do, and not exclude
it only for the presentation before the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. Maxwell. The oversight committee should require that
the DCI's budget presentation to the Appropriations Committee
and the oversight committee include a specific discussion of
the financial aspects of CIA proprietaries. I mean, we are
trying to bring them out and see what the impact is on the
budget, where do they fit in.
Senator Huddleston. Can they do that, though, without
identifying the proprietary and where it is located and whatever.

They have indicated they could.

the first sentence in No. 1, and after we say the external
and internal controls, the oversight committee should require an
annual report of all proprietaries by the CIA, including an
internal CIA audit and all intercessions that the CIA may have
made on behalf of proprietaries.

That almost has a word of art

thing which the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the
CIA makes to the Appropriations Committee.
Mr. diGenova.. We are talking about an authorization,
aren't we, an annual authorization here?

Mr. Inderfurth. Look on page 26 and you'll see the
definition of that under (b). The DCI shall have responsibility

for presentation to the President and the Congress.
This
20

is the budget presentation that's being referred to under
this.
Mr. Kirbow. Well, now you come to the real question,
proprietaries being listed in the DCI's budget presentation.

Most of his proprietaries neither use any money up nor make

any money or anything. They are just shelf items.

In effect, the proprietary was earning money which was
financing the proprietary organization.
Mr. Kirbow. But they can no longer do that. What they
earn now must go into the general Treasury.
Mr. Aaron. No, gross earnings do not go into the general
Treasury. Their net, and part of the cost of doing business
would include the cost of some of their operational purposes.
I think the point of this inclusion here was to see if
one could require in connection with the budget, not just in
general, with an audit of what it does specifically, but in
terms of the entire activity of the CIA, to get a spelling out
of its sort of macrobudget implications in terms of up or down,
and secondly, its budget implications for the certain categories
of operations which were involved, such as, if you are talking
about the conduct of the support for the activities in Laos.
15
16
Mr. diGenova. Paramilitary operations.
17
Mr. Kirbow. Well, leave it like it is if that is what you
are trying to do, because they will be sure to report it to
18

20
21

the Appropriations Committee in excruciating detail, but they
won't report it to the authorization committee unless they
require it to get money.

Well, where will it disappear

Mr. Aaron. Proprietaries as a category?:
Mr. Maxwell. I would assume it is going to be a subsection
of operational support in covert action.
Mr. Aaron. Not necessarily. I think they are struggling
with that at this point trying to define it properly and how
it should be presented. I mean, I really don't think we know.
They have an intention to do it because they recognize that
potentially it is a source of real question as to how much
money is being spent on clandestinc activities that is self-
generated by the Agency because of its proprietary
activities.
Mr. diGenova. The impact, Senator, was also to show that
the Committee had looked at this broadly, was aware of possible
budget and authorization implications of various entities,
including proprietaries, and that it wanted to say something

captioning this properly, Joe, but I think the point here is
that proprietaries either earn money or cost money, sometimes
a little of both, and it has an impact, therefore, on the
overall CIA budget, particularly in the past when income from
the proprietaries could be placed in either the contingency
reserve or used to finance, in effect, operational purposes
of the proprietary. In other words, Air America was earning
money on its operations, and yet it was costing them more
because they were engaged in certain risky operations.

Mr. Aaron. Well, let me see if I can read out what I would
propose along the lines I think we discussed.
The oversight committee should require that the fiscal
impact of proprietaries be made clear in the DCI's budget
presentation to the oversight committee.
If you want to add
the appropriations committee, you can, but I think the point is
that that happens.
Mr. Kirbow. If you'll listen just one minute, Mr. Miller
knows and I believe the Senator knows that "in the Senate there
11
is a formal budget presentation:
made to the Appropriations
12
Committees." They are not made elsewyere.

they don't do it for anybody else but the Appropriations
Committee.
Senator Huddleston. I think that's reasonable enough.
It ought to be clear.
to oversight committees on the status and all of these other
things, and if they request any money for those proprietaries,
they would request that before the authorizing committee.
If
you are just trying to accomplish getting it made known to the
oversight committee, drop the word "budget presentation" and
adopt the common usage of the annual report of the Agency or

Director's what?

Mr. Kirbow. The Agency would not report separately. They
should make their presentation a part of the DCI's report
to the appropriate oversight committee.
Mr. Maxwell. While we are on that, could I, on No. 6, we
have already, I thought, by statute prevented any covert action
being funded other than by (a) appropriation to a covert action
budget, or (b) the contingency reserve.
Mr. diGenova. That's right.
Mr. Maxwell. Does that make No. 6 redundant?'
Mr. Kirbow. Yes.
Senator Huddleston. The only comment I would make is
25
that the other is not an accomplished fact yet. This might
be accepted and that might not.
Mr. Maxwell. Well, the reason I say that is that the
way this reads, I would have or would be opposed to it because
it provides an exception with the approval of the versight

Mr. diGenova. Why don't we say this by statute, and then
have the rest of the sentence an addendum which would just
allude to the fact that funding is to be accomplished to the
method we set out if you want to eliminate it.
Well, this was the problem that was raised, or an issue
that was raised during the study, and this is set in here
for that reason. It can easily be removed if it is inconsistent
with another recommendation of the Committee.
Mr. Aaron. Well, we have two or three different earlier
provisions that relate to this. The first is that re-
:
programming authority, defining reprogramming authority, the
possibility that something used for a program covert action X
& .
which involves a proprietary that generates a certain amount
25
of money, can be used for program Y.

The second issue is we have proposed that covert actions
be funded either by line item or by the contingency reserve.
The third thing we proposed is that the contingency reserve
be replenished, if I am correct, only by appropriation, concur-
rence of the oversight Committee.
Now, what this in effect does, I think the question that is

Well,
and this
would be a fair point to make here, as part of its definition
of limitations on reprogramming, it is recommended that the
oversight committee proscribe the allocation of profits from
any proprietary to a covert operation without their express
consent. And this is really kind of if it doesn't go through
the contingency reserve, it really goes to the question of
reprogramming.
Now, I realize that we have said that our other recommen-
22 dation by implication would prohibit this, but it is only by

Mr. diGenova. And the reason for that is every other
government agency is subject to the rules and statutes of the
Federal Disposal of Property Act, and the CIA isn't.
Mr. Kirbow. Do you see this could be an abuse area?
Mr. diGenova. I could see the Attorney General, if he
knew that Admiral Raborn or some other Director is putting
pressure on the CIA to dispose of a piece of property, would
want to know about that, since they are not subject to the
10 | Federal Disposal of Property Act like every other government

I don't think I think the record clearly shows, and
the General Counsel indicated that he was not opposed to having
outside review of their disposals, provided it was classified
or done in a classified way since they have never had any
problem.
Mr. Kirbow. What you are doing here, approving the final
disposition of disposal, if you are intending that he review
18
the disposal process or participate in it, he wouldn't have known
about Raborn. He wouldn't have known about Raborn at all
19

because he didn't dispose of it to his client, and this would
not pick up that kind of abuse that you have discussed here.
Suppose it had been disposed of to Admiral

Raborn, and they knew about it, and the AG said, why is this

Mr. Maxwell. It's not that you create a channel, but you
aid the, increase the temptation for the proprietaries to try
to generate funds, and secondly, I think it is the easiest way
for the oversight committee to have a handle on covert action,
and particularly its funding, is to say there are two ways you
can do it. You can do it either by the regular appropriation
process, or you can do it through the contingency reserve fund.
But if you start to build in the ways that the contingency
reserve fund can be replenished, I think people I think there
may be a loss of control.
Mr. Aaron. Well, this is a way it can be replenished,
and this is not prohibited by anything we have recommended
yet.
Mr. Maxwell. I understand that, but I guess I was trying
to clean up the organizational structure.
Mr. Kirbow. I think this is the problem with recommending
the legislation piecemeal, is that the insurance company out

They just say

heck of a lot.
The recommendation, the way it is phrased, is sort of a
push to them to see if they can find better ways. It also
probably tells them that maybe they should use proprietaries
abroad a little more, which are very, very efficient, according
to Eric, according to both things, operations and cover.
Mr. Aaron. I think we have got to be careful on this
point. I mean, we ought to wait until the staff director
returns because I think he has a particular interest in this
suggestion, but we are talking about moving more people into
unofficial cover. I would like to express my own persional.

place somewhat greater authority in the hands of the ambassador
and the missions overseas to know what is going on. That is
something that they can do when it is in their house. It is
something that's extremely difficult for them to do when it is
off in the forest someplace.
So it is
and as Joe just said, it looks like a recommen
dation to use more proprietaries, in part because it is in the
same section, but in reality because that is one of the ways
they might do it, and I just wonder how much we have thought
through for ourselves where the balance of our recommendations
lie, particularly since most of the stuff is derived basically
from operational experience anyway.

There was a period, toward the end of Mr. Bissell's

began to try to put more people in unofficial cover, and it
wasn't a very good experience for them.

Mr. Kirbow. David, how does the ambassador lose control,
whether it is official or unofficial, except that he has got

over which he has absolute control.

Mr. diGenova. The John McCloy exceptions to that rule, they
are the only ones that are protected.
Mr. Aaron. That justifies Charles' view that there are
some similarities between Ford Foundation and Government
sponsored activities.
Mr. Bader. Where our discussion was left before lunch
was on the question of the covert use of U.S. journalists and
media institutions, and as it was laid out, it was indicated
that the CIA's intended internal prohibition on the use of the
media extended to the internal prohibitions on the use, opera-
tional use of individuals, American and foreign, who were
accredited to American media organizations.
As I heard it this morning, what we were discussing and
moving to was to extend that prohibition to cover all American
individuals and media organizations, and that the question then
was whether this would be recommended to be something done in
law or a recommendation, or an insistence, if you will, to the
Agency that it further amend its internal directives, its
50-10, to put all media personnel, American media personnel on
the prohibited list, and that is I think where we were.
