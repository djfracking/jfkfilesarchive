SUBJECT: Promotion for Horton Scott Hiler
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
DATE: 21 June 1946
1.
It is recommended that Mr. Newton Scott Hilor, Operations
Officer, Mukden, China, ESD station, be promoted from CAN-7 to CIF-9.
Mr. Liler his been carrying out the functions and responsibilities of
a CAF-9 officer for sometime. Records indiente that he was put in for
promotion to CAP-7 August 1, 1947. Thron delays caused by the long
route from Mukden to Shanghai to Washington and by the reorganiretion
of our promotion policy lust wintor, Er. Eiler was not promoted until
March 2, 1948.
2. He has performed with distinction as an operations officer in
kukden, discovering an important, highly organized North Anien political
He is in the U.S. on
movement and making operational contact with it.
TDY at this time on he is greatly needed in the Lukden operational area
to hosile the operation referred to end then at Feiping when Makdon is
no longer tenuile.
3. Mr. Kiler feels that he has been in grale longer than the
record shows recuise he was under the impression that action in tie
field set the date of the new grade. While this is in error, tho
field practice of giving a detailed notice of what would result from
promotion.in way of deductions and not pay toiled generally to give
employees the impression that promotion actions were definite long
Refore they actually were. This paper work has since been stopped,
4. Because this operations officer has performed in an out-
standing way, because he is tuily needed in the field, and tocmuse hơ
has great long term value to the organization should be encouraged
to develop, it is recommended that he to promoted to CAP-9 effective
on the completion of his TDY when rawly for return to Chine,

With the exception of Mr. Hoover, it is requested that transfer of the

Captain Olson, acceptable to Colonel Noscrip, and will materially clari-
fy all personnel records.

it is requested that the Commanding Officer, ESD # be advised by pouch

Dear Scotty
Enclosed please find personal action papers for your promotion, FleasO
Bign all four copios and return as soon as possible. Also, please prepare
* job description in rough draft. I will have it edited and typed on the
form,
A Cable WAB Bent to Washington asking for your transfer and promotion and
An Answer came back advising that it was impossible to transfer personnel
from one branch to another in the field. The only place possible would be
Washington after you return to the States. They advised that all personnel
in the field were assigned to SRO and that we were free to use personnel
in whatever capacity we deemed best and that promotion papera be gouched
to Weanington for their consideration. This evidently is their policy because
Reneman and moover have both received reises and are working for Services
though originally sent out for Commo work by masnington.
You are doing a good job, keep it up and don't forget to have a good time
while Holl is there.

Dear Scotty:
On the occasion of retirement, it has
been the custom to semi a letter to our
employees in appreciation for their services.
While your retirement has been stretched a
bit by your willingness to help us on the
transition to your successor, I do not want
the occasion to pass without this recognition.
I sincerely regret the publicity which
surrounded your retirement and the circum-
stances under which it occurred. These should
not, however, conceal the fact that you have
made a real contribution to your country, to
this Agency, and to the intelligence profession
in your many years of service. We do appre-
ciate this contribution and wish you the best
of satisfaction and enjoyment in the years
ahead.
Sincerely,
M. E. Colby
Director

1. Mr. Miler is a uniquely qualified senior officer who has
specialized in counterintelligence. He has particular competence in
background and management of sensitive counterintelligence cases of
the Agency and of the other elements of the U.S. intelligence com-
munity.
He is independent and aggressive in viewpoint, articulate,
and personally deeply involved in the current conduct and future of
counterintelligence as an operating function. He has excellent
potential in the exercise of leadership and command in the counter-
Intelligence specialty; in this respect I regard him as being without
a peer among the younger officers in the DDO.
2. He has been a most dependable worker and counselor in the
reorganization that has taken place in the DDO over the past year.
He has been an unfailing source of constructive, forward-looking
suggestions and ideas, not only with respect to the problems in his
own specialty, but in the work of CIOPS as a whole.
contributions to the formulation of the CIOPS Charter (DON 1-1180)
He made specific

of the reorganization of C1OPC, be has been designated as an Asso-
clate Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations for Operations.

In con-
component accordingly and commands resources consisting of 17 officers
and junior officers and six clerical personnel [one GS-15, five GS-14s,
five GS-13s, three GS-125, two 69-11s, one GS-08 1.A.; one GS-07
clerical, tw) GS-065, three (5-05s) through which he covers Penetra-
tion operations, Double Agents, Soviet and Bloc operations against
Americans overseas. Disinformation and Deception, and Counterintelligence

priate Letters of Instruction. he is meticulously informed of the
work going on in each of his charges. Under his quidance and instruc-
tion there has been significant end measurable production and results
during the past year. His pertenence of this task has been a model
of conception and execution and reflects most favorably on his capacity
to exercise command and leadership.

in paragraphs one and two of Mr. Miler's Fitness Report for the

a. Conduct counterintelligence review of FI, SA,..

Newton Scott MILER. (012773)
Reporting Period 1 February 1973 - 31 January 1974
.
Mr. Miler is a case specialist in sensitive counterintel-
ligence matters. He has a career accumulation of exposure, recall,
and operational insight into past and present activity along these
lines with the FBI, State Department, Department of Defense, and the
military agencies. He is skilled in the conduct of counterintelli-
gence and security liaison on a senior level with these agencies. It
is noteworthy that he has the confidence of the FBI leadership and in
the past year he has worked on sensitive counterintelligence cases
involving the Soviets and Bloc with the FBI in a highly productive
and professional fashion. In addition he has taken the initiative in
developing and conducting productive liaison on counterintelligence
cases involving Penetration and Disinformation with the British
Services, MI-5 and MI-6, and the RCMP, the Australian, and the New
Zealand security, services. Mr. Miler's work with MI-5 and MI-6 has
involved the production of studies and the chairing of meetings
among liaison specialists in Soviet clandestine agent radio communica-
tions. He is a working committee member of the national inter-agency
organization-dealing with the planning and execution of deception in
Double Agent operations, working directly under the Chief, CIOPS in
this respect. This task brings him into close and continuing rela-
tionship with the appropriate component of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
and other interested Federal agencies. Because of his grasp and
appreciation of the day-to-day problems of the charter responsibilities
of CIOPS, he takes part actively and effectively in the training and
doctrinal presentations within and outside the Office of Training (OTR).
In particular, he participates in senior-level OTR training activities
(the Mid-Career Course) and during the period under review in a special
advanced counterintelligence course sponsored jointly by OTR and CIOPS
for senior officers of the Office of Special Investigations/Air Force
(OSI/AF) and in FBI retraining of its field officers in counterintel-
ligence matters.
4.
In addition to his managerial and advisory functions outlined
above, Mr. Miler is charged with the management of specific live opera-
tions under the direction of Chief. CIOPS. Among other things, he is
charged with the handling of a difficult and complex Soviet defector
contact. This relationship requires the dedication of very much of
his own time, and the presentation of detailed contact reports on a
continuing basis and the maintenance of a very high order of personal
and professional discipline.
It is impossible to say too much in praise-worthy description
of the performance of this officer. He is one of the hardest working.

1. During the current rating period Mr. MILER was transferred
from his previous position as Deputy Chief of the Special Intelligence
Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to the position of Chief of the
Operations Group of the same Staff. This was a new position and as such
required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done.
Mr. MILER approached his task with imagination and energy. He inherited
an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of
trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, to
weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated
guidelines and to provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving
better counterintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the
area divisions and the operational components of the CA Staff.
J
2. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under
the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of
extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and
developmentally. The cases required not only keen operational sense in
their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved
frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components of
CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments. In fulfilling these
responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his
personal convenience. He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of
the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is
handling. He has also given mature, insightful supervision and encourage.
ment to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations,
another important innovation in the Staff's organization.
3. As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con-
tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the programs
of the operating components within the Clandestine Service. He, together

willing to accept responsibility.
He is imaginative and creative in
his approach to operations. A practical example of Mr. Miler's
work along these lines was his presentation on CIA's role in opera-
tional deception at the JCS Strategic Planning Seminar held from
17-21 April 1972.
4. I rate Mr. Miler in the overall performance of his

OPE
:
For 28 years Mr. Newton Scott Miler contributed
greatly to the Central Intelligence Agency; in
earlier years as an operations officer in China
activities, starting off in 1947 in Mukden, lator
Shanghai, ` Hokkaido, Yokosuka, Subic Bay, Bangkok
and Addis Ababa, and in recent years (1964 to 1974)
ho has specialized in counterintelligence; his
particular competence being in the management of
sensitive counterintelligence cases of the Agency
and of other elements of the US Intelligence Community.
An aggressive, independent, articulate officer, he
was personally involved in the current conduct and in
planning the future of counterintelligence as a
function. He has exercised leadership and command
in his specialty and has left his imprint on the modus
operandi of his field. Ho has dealt with penetration
operations, double agent operations, and in Soviet
and Bloc operations targetted against Americans
overseas, as well as in disinformation and deception
operations. His performance in these has been a
model of conception and execution. He has been a
hard working and gifted officer who often made solf-
sacrifices to get his tasks accomplished. On his
departure into retirement it is appropriate to award
Mr. Miler the Career Intelligence Medal in recognition
of his years of superior performance.

(1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969)
1.
Mr. Miler's performance as a counterintelligence
officer and supervisor of both officer and clerical per-
sonnel has continued to be outstanding in every respect.
He has continued to carry a major portion of the work
load of the office. Highly favorable comments made in
previous fitness reports by me continue applicable in
every respect for the current reporting period. He is
cost conscious and economizes in the expenditure of
government funds.

with other members of the Panel have striven to devise a formula to
give management a clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and
what we are doing and have done to make those intentions reality.
-
4. Mr. MILER has maintained contact with a number of key
foreign intelligence officials with whom he has worked overseas. His
home has been available to them during their visits to the United States.
5.
While being able to adjust his own thinking when and as
required by a given situation, Mr. MILER has strong personal con-
victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his
opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.
.6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes
in its complement one GS-16 and GS-15s. He is also responsible
for the career development of IGHT
more junior case officers. The
above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group
staff. In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-
mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of
senior officers.
7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems
remain for him in his current assignment. He would also readily ack-
nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these
problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has
been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.
MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GS-16 in 1969 was
deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This is
an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-
starter, he works and thinks realistically. He speaks his mind when
he has something to say - including critical things, yet retains a good
sense for the craftsman's side of the CI job. He is not adept just at
identifying problems, he finds the solution.

Section C cont., Newton S. Miler
coordinating agency operations with the overall policy
objectives of the Embassy, the rating officer believes that
Mr. Miler must be given the benefit of the doubt on this
point.
The station under Mr. Miler's direction has been suc-
cessful in developing CA operations within the field of
labor, and liaison operations have improved considerably
in recent months. Mr. Miler has been particularly successful
and cooperative in servicing requests for operational support
from other field stations. He has provided valuable support
and coordination in Africa Division's efforts to penetrate
and influence an effective and moderate all-African organization.
Mr. Miler has satisfactorily performed his supervisory
duties, supervising nine persons within the station, as well
as providing guidance for communications personnel located
in a large communications base in Ethiopia. He is cost con-
scious and fully understands the need for economy.

MAIL ROSM
Mr. Miler is an alert, intelligent, and experienced officer
who has worked hard to produce results in what has proved over
the past years to be an extremely difficult area in which to
operate. With some notable exceptions, the station under his
direction has failed to surmount these environmental problems
and to develop productive operations against high priority
targets. This should not be interpreted as meaning that the
station has failed to mount new operations; merely that fewer
key operations have been mounted than Headquarters would have
desired.
Mr. Miler has been rated as adequate in his liaison with the
Ambassador and other members of the country team despite the fact
that the Ambassador, in a private conversation with Headquarters
officers, indicated his dissatisfaction and that of the Deputy
Chief of Mission with what the Ambassador described as Mr. Miler's
failure to participate in country team activities and his failure
to establish a satisfactory working relationship with the Ambas-
sador. On the basis of the Ambassador's comments Mr. Miler might
have been given a rating of "Weak" on this point. However, in

Subject has been at his present post for about eighteen montifs.
He has been working aginst most difficult targets involving a govern-
ment and a society enormously frustrating to deal with.
in the light
of this situation, it can only be said that the results of his efforts
have been gratifying. Subject's performance, in any case, has been
highly professional. He has succeeded in effecting a great amount of
clarity regarding some fairly long-standing and complicated operational
activities. He is particularly strong in the CA field. This is
Subject's first assignment as a Chief of Station and it is interesting
to observe that he possesses a great deal of natural managerial skill.
In supervising subordinate personnel he has also considerable competence.
Although he has experienced difficulty in the handling of one officer,
there is no evidence that Subject has fallen short of doing his duty.
Morale at his Station is high. Reference should be made to Subject's
highly-developed sense of integrity and intellectual honesty. Another
strong and useful attribute is his innate sense for anticipating possible
Agency-Embassy problems and to act upon them before they evolve. If
there is any weakness in Subject's performance as Chief of Station, it
is probably the occasional belated communication to Headquarters. This
Branch considers itself fortunate to have. Subject in his present position
and supports his desire to extend for one year beyond the expiration
of his present tour, Subject's promotion during 1962 is further evidence
of Headquarters' confidence in him.

Honorable William E. Colby
Director

Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Colby:
I would like to take this opportunity to express
my appreciation to you and through you to Messrs. N. Scott
Miler, Bruce Solie, Jerry G. Brown, Ernest Tsikerdanos,
Richard Sampson, George Fill, and Oleg Keikuatov for
assistance rendered to this Bureau in a matter of mutual
concern which occurred recently in Mexico City. The manner
in which Messrs. George Fill and Oleg Keikuntov carried out
their assignments is particularly noteworthy and indicative
of the professionalism employed by representatives of your
Agency.
This situation is another example of the cooperative
attitude which prevails among members of the American
intelligence community and I look forward to continued
mutual reciprocity in matters of this nature.
Sincerely yours,

As an exception to the recommendations made in item 15, it is the reviewing officer's
opinion that subject may well have a contribution to make in the CK field on a
continuing basis. This is based on subject's performance in CE during the period
covered by "A" and "5" of item #7 when subject worked under the reviewing official's
supervision. It is felt that subject is genuinely interested in CE, and because of
the high degree of specialization required subject might probably be encouraged to
concentrate on this feld.

CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFI
WASHINGTON
3 May 1972
Dear Dick,
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recently.
concluded a Strategic Planning Seminar to
which your agency made significant contribu-
tions. I would like to take this opportunity
to express my appreciation for the outstanding
assistance provided by Messrs. James Angleton,
Raymond G. Rocca and N. Scott Miler..
Kindest personal regards.
Honorable Richard Helms

Subject is a highly qualified operations officer with demonstrated executive abilities.
His primary shortcoming is his lack of self-discipline as far as his personal self is
concerned. This has resulted in subject's inability to observe normal working hours
IN
as fame reporting for duty smarned. It is not meant to infer that subject has
been lax in total number of hours devoted to his job, rather he is inclined to set his
own schedule, claiming illness as the cause. In considering the above, it should be
kept in mind that subject has been in the field over three years, and is overdue for a
montal and physical rest. It is reccommended that subject be considered for a Head-
quarters assignment in a senior operations capacity.

Subject's grades speak botter than any comments could. There is no question
but that he brought more to the course and assequently had less to gain
from it than any of his fellow students, which makes his performance the
more worthy. His assistance to the instructors with Far East material es
much appreciated.

The Office of Security is most grateful for the excellent
presentation you made at the recent seminar of Special
Agents.

Participating officers were certainly alerted to the very
real challenge we face in maintaining personnel security.
Your lecture was most enlightening to this group and should
put their work into a new perspective.
We hope you will be able to assist us in our future train-
ing sessions.

Letter of Appreciation
JUL 26 1368
-
During the week of July 8 12, 1968, the Office of Security held
a seminar for selected State Department overseas security officers.
Among the multitude of subjects on the agenda, I considered none
more important than personnel security. I was, therefore, immense-
ly pleased that Mr. Deott Milor accepted our invitation to speak
on "Foreign Intelligence Operations Against U. S. Personnel."
Citing statistics from his extensive research, Mr. Miler impressed
us with the magnitude of hostile targeting efforts against Americans
overseas. After this informative briefing, he engaged the confereeg
in a productive excrange of views on solving problems of mutual
concern.
I am most grateful to you for permitting Mr. Miler's participation
in our Regional Scoring Officer Seminar and hope that you will
extend to him my appreciation for his excellent talk.

SUBJ:
Expression of Appreciation (U)
0182-06-19
:
:
1.01 hereby express my appreciation for service of the highest degree
of excellence provided to my office during the past several months.
You displayed professional competence that can only be described ag
exemplary in nature.
2. It is unfortunate that the work on which you performed is of such
a nature that it precludes a specifle description herein, but that
need not detract from the significance of this message of approbation.
Of all the attributes displayed, the two most worthy of note are your
use of imagination and persistence. These two qualities enabled you
to produce results-witch-others had not been able to obtain. Near
failure was transformed into success.
3. Not to be ignored is your administrative ability. The marshaling
of resources available to you and coordination of the efforts of your
available personnel contributed materially to the degree and quality
of results obtained as well as the expeditious manner in which you
proceeded. Also, selflessness was manifested by your willingness to
ignore assigned working hours and press on as long as any hope existed
for obtaining results.
4.(C)As you are aware, the results achieved by you have significance
beyond the boundaries of the Navy. The full import cannot be com-
pletely evaluated at this time but it is known that the lives of many
persons will be enriched by your efforts. It is regretted that all
persons affected will not have the opportunity to express their thanks
to you in person for the part you have played..
5,0) On behalf of all persons who will benefit from your efforts, and
on behalf of the Navy and myself, I again express my deepest appreciation
and say to you a most hearty "Well done".
6.0If it is consistent with the policy of your Agency; it is requested
that a copy of this letter be made a part of your official record.

4. Mr. Miler's performance overall has been outstanding.
Furthermore, we regard him as an individual with outstanding poten-
tial for counterintelligence in the Agency and in the U.S. intelligence
community. We believe Mr. Miler's performance as Operational
Group Chief warrants the earliest consideration for promotion to the
Grade of GS-17,

Re:
Newton S. Miler
Dear Theo :
You have by now received our unclassified cable, TOICA 1408,
advising of our acceptance of the resignation of Newton S. Miler who
has served since December 29, 1956, as Chief of our Criminal
Investigation Branch, Public Safety Division, USH/T. It was with
deep regret that I accepted the resignation since his departure on or
about April 15, 1958, will be felt very keenly by both the Chief of
the Division, Mr. Al DuBois, and myself.
Were it not for the prossing need of stateside medical
attention for his wife and the fact that he should be with her
during this period, I should have endeavored to prevail on him to
take an alternative course of action. However, I am satisfied that
there was no alternative and, hence, did accept the resignation
effective April 15, 1958, it being noted that he is returning with
his family to the states at his own expense.
This letter is to advise you of the facts leading to what
would appear to be a suiden resignation. I also want to inform you
that Miler's job performance here has, in my estimation, been of high
order and can very easily be summarized by stating that he has
performed most satisfactorily.
He has shown himself consistently to be tactful, considerate,
and objective in his approach to his responsibilities and in the
performance of his duties. I have at all times found that his judgment
has been sound and mature, He has had warm and mutually satisfying
relationship with his opposite numbers in the Thai police.
In furtherance of my statement of my confidence in him, I
unhesitatingly designated him as Acting Unief of our Public Safety
Division during Mr. Bois' absence on TUY in washington for the period
March 9 through April 5, 1958. I naturally had continuing personal

Mr. Constantine Broutsas
Clandestine Service Senior Seminar
1. I have been some time getting around to expressing my
appreciation to you and through you to the other officers who
participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well
because, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings
of the Senior Seminar have been, in one form or another, acted
upon. In some of the cases, action that was already underway
was accelerated. In others, the Seminar produced useful insights
on the basis of which action was taken.
2. I know that it was a considerable labor for you but I
would like you to be aware of the fact that I and the other officers
in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the
Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.
3. It is probable that we will want to do another running of
the Seminar later this year. If so, I know that we will benefit from
the excellent pilot run which you conducted.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board
SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion
Newton Scott MILER
->
1. This is a recommendation for promotion for Mr. Miler
from Grade GS-15 to GS-16.
2. The career of this officer has been notably marked through-
out with relatively important responsibilities for his age. His youth,
intense drive, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, natural
talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem,
organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising
the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has
worked. Years of service during which he has steadily matured has
resulted in a recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow-
workers alike of his unusually wide experience, proven soundness of
judgement, organizational administrative and executive talent coupled
with powers of expression both oral and written and demonstrated
capacity for work. He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.
3
3. Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October
1946 following an A. B. degree in Economics from Dartmouth College
in a Navy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to Shanghai where he
remained a short period before a TDY assignment to open the communi -
cations station in Seoul, Korea, . He was assigned to Mukden and
Antung, Manchuria from April 1947 to June 1949 where despite being
barely 21 years of age and an official designation as Code Clerk as
Grades GS-5/7, he conducted Agent operations into Korea, USSR and
China. He handled liaison with Chinese officers and counter espionage
cases with X-2 officers. His talents were recognized and after TDY
training at Headquarters, he was assigned to Shanghai as an Intelligence
Officer. There he performed as a Case Officer and engaged in stay
beyond planning, supervision of other junior Case Officers, and assisted
in the evacation of other CIA officers. Before he was 25 years of age,
he established the station and served as Chief of Sapporo, Japan, for
some 20 months (1949-51).

SEC. 17.
In the Spring of 1940 I was questioned by a
Postal Inspector about a letter I hwo mailed
approximately on year previous for a Hr. Holren.
He wan the Display man for Allen and Jericon birdwo pe
.
working with
Co, in Theerloosa, Ale. I had been working
hia for some time dressing windows, painting and
decorating.
The letter in question was oddreaned to Mre.
Hɛlren, who was out of town, and supposedly con-
tained some money. I believe It was a doller. The
letter 9 received but there was no money in it.
I stated that 1 bed know nothing of way money
and that I also had had a fel ow with me when the
letter whs mailed. I wrote to Mr. Halven bout the
incident but never het re from him.
There were apparently no further Inquisies
i
n. I have heard nothing since the Postal Insector
questioned me.

Mr. N. Scott Miler
Letter of Appreciation
1. On 25 February 1965, Mr. N. Scott Miler of your Staff
presented an excellent lecture to participants in Security Officers
Field Course #15 on "Security Support to CI Activities." Mr. Miler
made the talk very interesting and stimulating, and, judging from
.the class comments, it was very well received.
2. I should like to take this opportunity to advise both you
and Mr. Miler that his cooperation and efforts on behalf of the Office
of Security are very much appreciated.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. N. SCOTT MILE
VIA:
SUBJ:
Director of Contral Intelligence
Expression of Appreciation (C)
1.0) I hereby express my appreciation for service of the highest degree
of excellence provided to my office during the past several months.
You displayed professional competence that can only be described as
exemplary in nature.
2.(wit is unfortunate that the work on which you performed is of such
a nature that it precludes a specific description herein, but that
need not detract from the significance of this Dessage of approbation.
Of all the attributes displayed, the two most worthy of note are your
use of imagination and persistence. Those two qualities enabled you:
to produce results which others had not been able to obtain,
Hear
failure was transformed into success.
3.W)Not to be ignored is your administrative ability. The marshaling
of resources available to you and coordination of the efforts of your
available personnel contributed materially to the degres and quality
of results obtained as well as the expeditious manner in which you
proceeded. Also, selflessness was manifested by your willingnety to
ignore assigned working hours and press on as long as any hope existed
for obtaining results.
4.C)As you are aware, the results achieved by you have significance
beyond the boundaries of the Navy. The full import cannot be cop-
pletely evaluated at this time but it is known that the lives of many
persons will be enriched by your efforts. it is regretted that all
persons affected will not have the opportunity to express their thanks
to you in person for the part you have played.
5.00 On behalf of all persons who will benefit from your efforts, and
on behalf of the Navy and myself, I again express my deepest appreciation
and say to you a most hearty "Well dona".
6.Hf it is consistent with the polley of your agency, it is requested
&
that a copy of this letter of your official record.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, CI Staff
SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion of
Newton Scott Miler
:
1. It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.
2. During the two years that he has been an officer of the
Operations Group of the CI Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an
exceptional ability to interpret counterintelligence experience and
practice in guiding operations in this area throughout the divisions
of the DD/P. He has applied field experience gained in one area,
combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to
intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S. security in a
variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western
Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and sureness of
judgment. He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly
to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance to officers of
less experience. In personal relationships throughout the
Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked.
His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major
fashion to increased effectiveness in carrying out the C1 mission.
It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15.

1.
It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.
2. Since July 1958 Mr. Miler has been serving in the Soviet/
Satellite Branch of the CI Staff, Operations Division. In this
position he has made a major contribution to the CI mission in his
daily contacts with elements of the DD/P, Office of Training and
Office of Security. Mr. Miler has excellent motivation, works long
hours, readily accepts responsibility, and is highly effective in
expressing his views both orally and in written form. He is
resourceful, imaginative, and his operational judgment is superior.
The frequency with which his professional advice is sought on an
informal and personal basis is clear evidence of the high regard
with which he is held by many individuals in the Clandestine
Services. I strongly recommend him for promotion to the next
higher grade.
The Miler's record

Recommendation for Promotion
-
Newton Scott Miler
1. It is recommended that Newton Scott Miler be promoted
from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15. Miler was assigned
to the Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present
position of Chief of Station, Addis Ababa, in September 1961.
He has been in grade since 24 March 1957. In accepting his
present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com-
plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation
and modification. In a short time he has been able to give
purpose and direction to operations which previously had been
the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P. It is
worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost
entirely new team, few of whom had any previous experience in
African operations.
2. Under normal circumstances, the Supervisor would be
inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further
opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the
individual. It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception
to this rule. Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,
Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor
who is presently Deputy Chief, CI-CE Staff. This man had
apparently felt so strongly about Miler's performance that he
had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who
should be given a jump promotion to supergrade. If necessary a
memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.
3. In addition to the above, the Supervisor has been
associated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1946.
The only gap in continuity was from the period 1956 to 1959.
It
is felt, therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's
knowledge, ability, experience, and potential bears weight.

Dear Thes:
You have by new received car unalassified cable, TOICA 1408,
advising of our acceptance of the resignation of Nowten 9. Miler who
has served since December Ft, 1956, as Chief of our Criminal
Investigation Branch, Public Safety Division, 130. It was with
deep regret that I accepted the resignation aises his departure on er
about April 15, 1950, will be felt very keenly by both the Chief of
the Division, Mr. Al Dessis, and myself.
Here it not for the pressing need of stateside modical
attention for his wife and the fact that he should be with hor
during this period, I should have endeavored to prevail en him to
taku in alternativo. course of action. However, I am satisfied that
there was no alternative and, hence, did accept the resignation
effective April 15, 1958, it being noted that he is returning with
his frally to the states at his own expraes.
This letter is to advise you of the facts leading to what
would appear to be a sudden resignation. I also want to inform you
that Hilor's job performance here has, in my estimation, been of high
order and can very easily be summarised by stating that he has
performed most satisfactorily.
He has the kisself consistently to be tactful, considerate,
and objective in his approach to his responsibilities and in the
performance of his duties. I have at all time found that his judgment
has been round and nature. He has had warm and mitually satisfying
relationship with his opposite mbars in the Thai polite.
In furtherance of my statement of mildones in him, I
unhesitatingly designated his as seting Chief of our Public Safety
Division during Rr. Usis' absence on TUY in Mashington for the period
Harch 9 thruagh April 5, 1959. I naturally had contiming personal
