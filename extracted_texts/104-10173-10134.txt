against terrific odds in defense of their very lives;
nor the norolo struggles waged by peasants all over the
country; nor the fight of the Red Armies against the
Kuomintang, I merely respect the cold, indisputable fact
that these struggles are defensive, not offensive, that
they are isolated, desperate and unorganised.
with very
few exceptions a few small strikes here and there and
the larger exception of the Red Army - they are without
organized revolutionary leadership. Moreover the develop-
ment of this leadership, the task of the C.P., in proceed-
ing at a tragically retarded pace owing to the false
policies and inept tactica of the party.
1
In denying the presence of a mighty revolutionary
upsurge (1.6., a vast, organised march toward the seizure
of power) I respect facts made still clearer perhaps when
compared to the facts and figures of the monster mass move-
ments of the 1925-27 period. The tragio errors of the
Communist leadership in 1927 were primarily responsible
for the decapitation of that great movement and because
no lessons have been drawn from those events to this very
day, these errors, monstrously accumulated, are still re-
sponsible for the tragedies of today. But for the purpose.
of our comparison here, let us for example take the single
fact that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai there were 257
strikes. In 1933 there were 82. Let us remember that
on the eve of the workers' seizure of power in Shanghai
in March, 1937, there were more than 800,000 workers,
handicraftsmen and petty traders out on the streets fight-
ing with arms in hands for demands of a far-reaching po.
litical character. A close check for the entire country
in the latter half of 1933 showed me that less than one-
thirtieth of that number were engaged in strikes and other
disputes during any given month and that almost invariably
the demands were defensive demands against wage outs and
lockouts. Moreover, the lack of cohesive leadership
often in departments of the same factory or in one or more
of a group of factories - or even sometimes lack of even
the most elementary organization _ has in almost every
case led to deadening failure and relatively easy betrayal
by the yellow labor leaders" and "mediators of the
Kuomintang. In 1935 the shooting of thirteen students.
by British police in Shanghai was the touch-off for a
general strike which paralyzed the city and which was
seconded by vast sympathy strikes which broke like a
series of tidal waves over the entire country. In Janu-
ary, 1932, when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Settlement as a base for operations which
cost the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a
single strike interrupted the normal course of the pub-
lic or other services in that settlement. In the factories
there were no strikes but a large scale lockout to which
the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's workers submitted
without protest.

Chinese workers. It is not evidence that a revolutionary
seizure of power is on the order of the day. It is evi-
dence, along with the heroio sacrifices of thousands who
have lost lives and liberty in Chinese revolutionary
struggle during the last seven years of Kuomintang re-
motion, that it is possible to fight the monstrous white
terror which Chinese Communists frequently cite as a
reason for the insufficiency of their work. Yet it is
largely because this terror has not been fought effectively
that the Kuomintang regime, despite the fact that it is
rotting and crumbling, can still keep the lid down on the
boiling, simmering hatred of the people it rules. Unless
the martyrdom of thousands of China's finest workers,
peasants and revolutionary intellectuals is to be in vain,
we must turn resolutely away from the folly of calling to
insurrection when what is needed is painstaking education,
organization and the sponsorship of day-to-day struggles
of the masses for democratic demands, the slow building up
of a party and mass organizations and a movement which
will be able to command the forces capable of carrying out
an insurrection.
"
In the case of the widespread but isolated and in-
dividual cases of peasant uprisings, and this includes
the Red Armies in Kiangsi, these struggles await the
leadership of a strong working class movement before they
can have a successful issue. The Red Armies in their re-
stricted and surrounded areas and with their meagre re-
sources have fought heroically against the Kuomintang
attacks upon them. But until the Kuomintang is shaken
from its bulwarks in the imperialist controlled working
class centres, their prospect of revolutionary triumph
remains necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose is
served by taking refuge in the fiction that these armies
have proletarian leadership because individual workers,
•undoubtedly leaders of superior quality and courage, have
been torn from their factories and their fellow-workers
and sent down to occupy key positions in the Red Army
districts and in the Red Armies themselves. Indeed, this
common practice of extracting the most conscious and pro-
gressive working class elements from their working olass
environment and sending them down to the Red districts is
a good index to the oriminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the cities. If the White Terror doesn't carry off the
workers' leaders as they arise, the C.P. does and has done
so in hundreds of cases. This helps in no small part to
explain why it has also been impossible to mobilize a
genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the fact of mili-
tary aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuomin-
tang has succeeded, by filling mass graves and innumer-
able prisons with the martyred dead and living, in down-
ing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the
organization of such a movement and paving the way for
the ever increasing encroachments of the imperialists.
The party has not yet gripped and directed the deep and
bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of the
people for their oppressors and this includes large seo-
tions of the lower petty bourgeoisie who could be won by
Buccessful mass pressure from below. This is because the

CIRCULATION OF MERDIA
B
Asked about present clroulation of MERDEKA, Mr. Diah replied
with the following; MENDERA is the largest Indonesian newspaper on
the island of Java. At present it is printed only in Batavia, with
a dally total circulation of about 13,000 copies. Of this number,
approximately 6,000 copies are sent out of the city by train to
Bandoeng, Soerakarta, and Djóklakarta, leaving a Batavia circulation.
of between 10,000 and 14,000 coples. Source exprossed the opinion.
that while the Indonesian population of Batavia is in the neighborhood
of 500,000 persons, the literacy rate is perhaps only twenty percent
of this figure. Thus, to admitted, MERDEKA is probably reaching less
than four percent of the total Indonesian population of Batavia,
despite the fact that Batavia is probably the most literate area on
the island of Java because of concentration here of all the govern-
montal functions, prewar and present...
When questioned as to why His eirculation was so inconsistent
with the potential reading population, source replied that he was
Handicapped by lack of panor. ne expressed the opinion that a

THE HAYAS News Agency. Shortly after this, in Shanghai, he carried VICLA ROBINSON,
who was, like HAROLD, a wide-eyed intellectual. This marriage probably took place
in 1932. VIOLA was a great friend of AGNES SHEDLEY, the author of the Battle Hymn
of China and of other books dealing with the Chinese Revolution.
An organization called the China League for Civil Rights was formed about
1932. YANG CH'IEN was the head of this for Central China, and Dr. HU SHIH (later
Chinese Ambassador to Washington) was the head of it for North China. YANG was at
that time Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica. YANG was soon assassinated
by the Blue Shirts (at that time CHIANG KAI-SHEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISAACS had
been an enthusiastic member of the Chins League for Civil Rights, and in the
- atmosphere of turmoil, after the killing of YANG, when all Leftists were under
attack by the Kuomintang, HAPOLD became the editor and publisher of the China Forum
a magazine that published a number of controversial articles. The magazine was
protected by the fact that the editor was an American, and therefore had extra-
territorial rights. Yet the magazine was regarded as a "thorn in the flesh" by Mr.
CUNNINGHAM, who was at that time American Consul-General in Shanghai. There were
various controversies
the printing shop was broken up by Kuomintang strong-arm
men; the mails were refused to the magazine; but he continued publication for some
time, and smuggled the copies out to the subscribers.

:
In 1933 or 1934, ISAACS had a fight with AGNES SMEDLEY. It was an ideological
fight, and therefore especially bitter. ISAACS and his wife left Shanghai after
this, and moved to Paking. There he acquired a Chinese translator named LIU, and
there he settled down to write his book, The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution.
This book "nails the Stalinists to the mast" and shows that they were messing.
around with a situation in China which they did not understand. Very many people
who have read the book consider it excellant.

ISAACS, Inrols Robert
HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS is now the correspondent of Newsweek magazine in
China. His headquarters are in Chungking, but he evidently travels to Kunming,
Kweiyang, and other places in the course of his duties. He seems to have arrived
in China in his present capacity during the summer of 1944, probably in July.
Subject was born in 1910, and is a member of a wealthy family. He became
a firmly convinced Trotskyist in his youth, and remained one till the time of
PearlHarbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotskyist colleagues,
because he has disavowed the principles of world revolution, turned away from
Trotsky's teachings, and since 1939 has been writing patriotic propaganda for the
United States Government.
He went to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese
politics, Five Years of Kuomintang Reaction (1932), and The Tragedy of the Chinese
Revolution (1938). Both of these volumes expressed the author's Trotskyist
point of view. The first was published in Shanghai, and the second in London.
Neither was ever published in the United States, and ISAACS said that the
Stalinist Communists were so powerful in this country that they were able to
prevent the publication of the Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution here. This
book received high praise from many serious students of Far Eastern affairs,
including G.P. Hudson, Fellow of All Souls College at Oxford, and author of
The Far East in World Politics, who said that ISAACS' book was the best one ever
written on the Chinese Revolution. Hudson is now an official of the British
Ministry of Information.
ISAACS' non-Communist and non-Trotskyist friends say that even during the

The book was completed, and ISAACS and his wife returned to the United States
about April or May 1935. Immediately after this, ISAACS made a papid trip to
Oslo, Norway, to see his hero, LEON TROTSKY, who was living there at that time.
It was on this occasion that he must have undertaken to translate TROTSKY's book,
Whither France ? ISAACS then returned to New York, and went to work for the
HAVAS News Agency once more.
At some time in the late 1930's, he became interested in New York politics,
and he worked hard for NORMAN THOMAS.
By 1940, however, he became disgusted with New York politics, and became
interested in the war, and in bourgeois life." He and his wife had a baby at
about this time (their first), and ISAACS found he could write radio scripts and
get good money for them. Up to 1940, he had been living chiefly off his father,
but from 1940 on, he began to make money. In 1942, he did a "Report to the Nation"
for CBS.
Soon after this, he joined the Staff of News-Week, and in 1944 was sent to Chungking
by that magazine. There must have been a certain amount of trouble in convincing
the Chinese Central Government that ISAACS had really changed since the old days
in Shanghai; but this convication was evidently accomplished, or ISAACS would not
have received permission from the Chinese Covernment to go to China.
E
•
ISAACS is a very smart man indeed. He knows a lot about China, and he knows a
lot about people in general. Moreover, he is a great deal "smoother" and more
diplomatic now than he was ten years ago.

27 March 1945
Mr. GEORGE N. KATES of 083, h, has just returned to the United States
from Chungking. He reached Washington yesterday. He claims to have known
HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS quite well in Chungking, and has the following observations
to make concerning Mr. ISAACS:
HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS is about 35 years of age. He attended Columbia
University, and received the degree of A.B. there in 1930. He is the son of
an orthodox Jewish merchant, who is very wealthy, and who has always supported
HAROLD, even though he did not approve of the radical views that HAROLD expressed
in the 1930's.
HAROLD went to China immediately after graduation from Columbia, partly,
atleast, out of a desire to see strange parts of the world and to experience
"adventure." He went out by way of Hawaii, and stowed away for part of the
voyage either between San Francisco and Honolulu, or between Honolulu and
Shanghai Mr. KATES does not remember which. Anyway, this was part of the
-
"adventure."
13
In China, HAROLD met a South African named FRANK GLASS, who was an "intellectual"
and a very interesting person. GLAS3 was a Leftist, but not at all a Communist.
HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtse with CLASS in 1930 or 1931. At about this time,
HAROLD became a convert to Trotskyism, partly, at least, under GLASS's influence.
He felt that "suffering humanity" required a "revolution" to set things straight.
Communism was too organized, and HAROLD was a complete individualist, and reacted
strongly against the organizational set-up of Communism, and so espoused Trotskyism.
He returned to Shanghai from the western part of China, and went to work for

height of his Trotskyist career, ISAACS never accepted money from the group. Ho
was always open and above-board, and never engaged in any conspiracies to overthrow
established government. He was attracted to the movement, they say, by sheer
idealism.
For a time in China, ISAACS lived with Tillman DURDIN, the China correspondent
of the New York Times, who was then the managing editor of the China Press. ISAACS:
returned to the United States in the late 1930's, and was for a time employed by
the havas News Agency, until the fall of France in 1940. In 1943, he was employed
by Newsweek magazine in Washington, D.C., and resided at 4938 Newport Avenue,
Freindship Heights.

EXTRACT FROM THE NEW INTERNATIONA 3:07
(PLULISTED IN NEW YORK).
I Break with the Chinese Staliniats
To the Central Committed of the Chineus Communist Party:
The two-year period of my extra-organizational collaboration
with the Chinese Communist party has come to an end and
the China Forum which I founded and edited during that time
has been forced to suspend publication. In the interest
of our whole movement as well as in my personal interest,
I consider it necessary to record here and publish the
history of the China Porus and the circumstances of its
suspension...
XXXXX
From almost the vory beginning of my active work
which I date from the time I began reporting events in
China in a communist way - a number of questions presented
themselves to me in increasingly forcible form. These
arose originally from my discovery of the gross distortions
and exagrerations which I found to be characteristic of
communia propaganda in China and abroad. I define pro-
pagunda as the skillful, clear, accurate and wholly truthful
reporting of the facts linked to an incisive, purposive
interpretation and a plan of action for dealing with the
facta in a revolutionary way. I leamed. this from the life
and work of Lenin and his Bolshevik comrades who taught
us that the truth comes from the masses themselves and that
only disaster can result from telling them lies. I have
never learned to the contrary that it was my revolutionary
duty to work in any other way, although I soon found that
the present-day Communist party press, makes a practise of
distinguishing between propaganda and truth.
Examples of exaggeration and distortion most striking.
to me were naturally those which applied to China, because
here I could check allegations with known facts. I first
wrote these down to the ignorance or incapacity of indi-
viduals. I felt that communist editors abrac zguld
públich accurate facts about China if they could get them.
Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up an independent
mail news service and sent weekly bulletina to papera all.
over the world giving brief, sharp, factual accounts of
what was going on. This was in the fall of 1931 after my
return from the area of the great Central China floods of
that summer. I scarcely understood then why this service
failed to secure any response from the communist presa,
abroad. After about three mon the I had to suspend it for
lack of support. It simply didn't get published except
in a few organs which were not official Communist party
papers, including the New York Militant.
•
It wasn't long before I began to perceive, with a
deeper study of international events and the history
the Chinese revolution, that a consistent thread ran
through the distortions and exaggerations which I found
not only in brief casual reports of current events but
in the solemn pronunciamentoes made by delegates before
plenums of the B.C.C.I. I discovered that these departures
from the truth were made necessary by the official premise
that over since the catastrophe of 1927 a mighty, upeur-
ging revolutionary movement has been marching forward in
China to the very brink of 6aizure of power under the
leadership of the Quinese Communist party. I discovered
that these exaggerations were necessary because the premise
was false and along with it all the basic tonete of the

for the fate to which he and his wife were condemned.
I ask you to recall the whole period of the organisa-
tion and activities of the China-League for Civil Rights,
from December, 1933, to June, 1933, in which I took an
notive part. I gave full play to this hybrid League and
it's work without once publishing the basic criticisms
which I often voiced to you and which in the end were
wholly confirmed by what happened after the Kuomintang.
murdered Yang Chien in June that year.
I ask you to recall the views I set forth in August.
and September, 1933, on the subject of the "anti-War Con-
gress" which at your specific request I did not publish.
Instead, to my regret, I published the foul rot of Mar-
ley & Co., without freely giving play to the true facts
about that farcical junket which had convinced me that
the policies which gave it birth do not one single whit
advance the international struggle against imperialist
war.
On one occasion 'and this at least I can take com-
fort in `- I passively resisted when you requested me to
write and publish a slanderous attack on Chen-Tu-hoiu
when he was condemned to 13 years imprisonment by the
Kuomintang. Your request was specific. I was not to
deal with the issues which had brought Chen Tu-hsiu from
being the leader of the C.P. in 1937 to being leader of
the Chinese Opposition in 1933. I was only to string to-
gether a vile series of labela in an effort to explain
why the Kuomintang even imprisoned the leader of the
Left Opposition. As you know, that attack was never
written or published.

Again in December, 1933, upon my return from Fukien,
you specifically demanded that I set aside the results of
my own personal investigations in Foochow in order to
write on your behalf (but over my signature!) an utterly
baseless and slanderous attack on the Left Opposition.
You will recall that you charged at that time that the
"Trotskyists" were prominently identified with the new
government set up in Tukien by Chen Ming-shu and Taai
Ting-kai. You lumped the Left Opposition with the Third
Party and the so-called Social Democrats among the petty
bourgeois satellites of the Fukien militarists. It was
as much to satisfy myself on this very point as to per-
form a mission for you that I went down to Fooohow and
spent two weeks there and learned through direct contact
with dozens of people prominently concerned that the Left
Opposition were stoutly and clearly opposed to the Foochow
regime. I haven't place bare to discuss the relations of
the C.P. to the short-lived Fukien Government or the char-
ncter of the "negotiations" which were going on down there...
The important thing here is that on my return you demanded
that I write elanders which flew in the face of everything
I myself had learned. It is interesting, as a oldelight
on your methods in factional strife as you conceive it,
that your representative in Foochow sent back a report,
through me, ironically enough, that one of the most prom-
inent of the youthful pseudo-radioals in Foochow, Bu

politics being pursued by the Communist International
and the Communist party in China. I cannot bagin here
to give a sunry of some of these distortions (which
I velbally, eated to you by the dozen), ranging from
: particular incidents (the wilfully false picture givon
of the cotton mill strike in Shanghai in January 1932,
dron to the point of trans.osing it to February to
heighten the impression given of the workers' role in
the Shanghai war) to high-flown generalizations like
the statement recently made before the plenum of the
B.C.C.I. that the C.C.P. has "won over the majority
of the Chinese working ones and the peasantry".....
In
denying the presence of a might revolutionary
upsurge (1.6., a vast onganized march toward the sel-
zure of power), I respect facts made still clourer
perhaps when compared to the facts and figures of the
monster mass movements of the 1925-27 period. The
tragic errors of the communist leadership in 1927 were
primarily responsible for the decapitation of that
great movement and because no lessons have been drawn
from these events to this very day, these errora,
monstrously accumulated, are still responsible for the
tragedies of today. But for the purposes of our com-
parison herë, let us take for example the single fact
that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai, there were 257 strikes.
In 1932 there were 82. Let us remember that on the ava
of the workers' seizure of power in Shanghai in March,
1927, there were more than 800,000 workers, handicrafts-
men and petty traders out on the streets fighting with
arms in hands for demands of a far-reaching political
character. A close check for the entire country in
the latter half of 1933 showed me that less than one-
thirtieth of that number were engaged in strikes and
other disputes during any given month and that almost
invariably the demands were defensive demands against
waga outs and lookouta. Moreover, the lack of cohee
sive leadership often in departments of the same.
factory or in one or more of a group of factories
or even some time a lack of even the most elementary
organization has in almost every case led to deadening
failure and relatively easy betrayal by the yellow
"labor leaders" and mediators" of the Kuo Min Tang.
1925 the shooting of thirteen students by Britian
police in Shanghai was the touch-off for a general
strike which paralyzed the city and which was seconded
by vast sympathy strikes which broke like a series of
tidal waves over the entire country. In January 1932,
when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Bottlement as a base for operations ·
which cost the lives of tone of thousands of Chinese,
not a single strike interrupted the normal course of
the public or other services in that settlement. In
the factories there were no atrikes but a large scale
lookout to which the overwhelming majority of Shanghai's
Workers submitted without protest...
In
In the case of the widespread but isolated and
individual cases of peasant uprisings, and this includes
the Red armies in Kiangal, these struggles await the
loadership of a strong working class movement before
they can have a successful issue. The Red armies in
their restricted and surrounded areas and with their
moagre resources have fought heroically against the
Kuomintang attacks upon then. But until the Kuo Min
Tang is shaken from its bulwarks in the imperialist-
controlled working class centers, their prospect
of revolutionary triumph remains necssourily dim.
No revolutionary purpose is served by taking refuge
in the fiction that those armies have proletarian
loadership because individual workare, undoubtedly

loaders of superior quality and courage, have been torn
from their factories and free trair fellow workers and
Bent cow to occupy key positions in the Red army dis-
tricte and in the Red armies themselves. Indeed, this
common practise of extracting the most conscious and pro-
gressive working class elements from their working class
environment and sending them down to the Red districts is
a good index to the criminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the cities. If the ite Terror doesn't carry off the
workers' lenders as they arise, the C.P. Goes and has
done so in hundreds of cases. This helps in no small
part to explain why it has also been impossible to mobi-
lize a genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the face of
military aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuo
Min Tang has succeeded, by filling mass grave and in-
numerable prisons with the martyred dead and living, in
downing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward-
the organization of such a movement and paving the way
for the ever-increasing encroachments of the imperialists.
The party has not get gripped and directed the dong and
bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of
the people for their oppressors and this includes large
sections of the lower patty bourgeoisie who could be won
by successful mase pressure from below. This is becaube
the party has failed to translate the realities of every-
day events into its program and tactics.....

But precicely because ut all costs I desired to
carry on the Forum's open struggle against the common
onemy - against the Kuo Min Tang and the imperialiste
I seduloualy avoided bringing these issue into the
columns of the paper, increasingly against my botter
judgment. I leaned over far backward in this respect.
This expressed itself in many of the current issues with
which we had to deal.

'
I ask you to recall the whole uphill fight which the
Forum waged on behalf of Paul and Gerturd Ruegg in the
spring and summer of 1932 during which time I repeatedly
warned against the emphasis which was being placed on th
"legal" aspects of the case and the "negotiations" with
the Kuo Min Tang to the detriment of mans pressure and
the capitalization of the case for political purposes
You paid lip service to the need for mass pressure -
particularly here in China - but in fact the "legalities”
and futile negotiations remained the major pillars of
the defense. Until in the very end I finally rebelled
I wasn't even permitted to give Ruegg his honorable and
rightful title secretary of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union
Secretariat! Yet although I felt the struggle for the
Rueggs was being seriously handicapped by the tactica
being pursued, I carried on the fight with all the energy
at my command and you will recall that it was I who created
the local defense committee and was chiefly responsible
for the widespread press propaganda campaign and the
för
-considerable sympathy which we aroused. Yet the strictly
non-political attitude which Ruegs was forced to assume
at the trial (in contrast to the highly political attitude
of his prosecutore!) was in my opinion one of the major
reasons for the fate to which he and his wife were condemned.

Neverthalces, abruptly in January of this year you
forced an ultimatum upon ze and subsequently forced the
break in our relationship because I could not and would
not, at your demand, devoite the China Forum to policies
which I could not and do not believe compatible with the
interests of the Chinese revolution and the international

were being a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic

questions which strike at the roots of our work and the
whole structure of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

the entire International today, you denied my right to

and
To my questions on Germany you quoted Heckert,
Piatritsky and the B.C.C.I.'s famous resolution declar-
ing that the collapse of the German party and the slaughter
of the German workers were based on the past, present and
future correct policies of the C.P.G.! You declared I had
no right to offer critical comment on the danger usly
opportunistic foreign and domestic policies of the U.S.S.R.
incst notably on the entry of the U.S.S.R. on a straight
nationalist basis into the disgusting corridore of im-
perialist intrigue. To the contriry, I was livingly,
fawningly to foudle and hail the policies which have meant
disaster in China, Germany and elsewhere and are rapidly
loading the U.S.S.R, into the vacuum of nati nalist
isolation from the world-wide proletarian movement!
I was to do, to begin with, by publishing Stalin's face
on the front page and columns of the customary penegyrics
to his infallibility. Above all and before all, I was
to take up cudgele against "counter-revolutionary
Trotskyiem". That was to be the main point of my re-
formation - to raise no questione myself and slander any-
body else who did so.

In reply to your demand that I submit to an editorial
beard in order that these editorial policies should be
effectively put into practise, I offered (1) to continue

differences with you in discussions on the side: (2) to
throw the columns of the Forum open to a general discussion

when we trample down the defenses of our enemies we shall
crush underfoot everything and everybody that stunde in
our way. No sycophantic, blind allegiance to a name,
an empty facade, a tom and shredded preatige can lead
us forward. Only unswerving fidelity to our goal and
active struggle toward this end with the weapons of a

anti-imperialist struggle, and in so doing fulfilling at
least a partial function as a revolutionary organ.

avoiding these issues. How could I write of Germany and
How could

I write of America's recognition of the U.S.S.R. and still
fail to say that the Communist International had virtually

dangers of imperialist intervention in the U.S.S.R. and
still not point out that Soviet foreign policy was in

people who are facing these problems today in a fearless,
revolutionary way. You demanded that the China Forum

In reply to my questions on China you simply quoted
back to me the lies and half-lies I've been so used to

were correct, I argued, it would be a distinct advantage

the seanwhile I throw the Forum oven to your editorial
board. My other proposals were unthinkable! Give the
Forua's readers a chance to hear counter-revolutionary"
viewpoints? Never that! I could only display my revo-
lutionary purity by acceding to your demands. We would
talk things over until Spring, then if all went well (1.0.,
if I showed a satisfactory adaptability to your view-
point) I could paok up for an educational trip to the
Soviet Union where I would certainly become convinced
of the error of my ways. In other words you wanted my
signature on a promissory note with the amount left
blank for you to fill in. You put this in the form of
an ultimatum and you told me that if I did anything but
accept I would forthwith enter the camp of the "counter-
revolution".
I had to refuse these terms. I had to refuse to
lend myself to a slanderous and baseless struggle against -
the International Left Opposition. I had to refuse to
lend space to the nauseatingly fawning praise of Stalin
and uncritical reception of Stalinist policies which
characterise the Communist Party press the world over.
I had to refuse to take shelter in the cold and draughty
empty spaces which stretch behind the impressive facade
and early tradition of the Communist International. I
would like to go to the Soviet Union for a vist someday
but I had to refuse your offer on your terms. I had to
refuse, in short, to become a hack prostitute in the name
of the Revolution.
In the end, too, I had to refuse to turn over to you
the printing plant I had built up with so much pain and
struggle because I considered it not your property but
the property of the working class movement. Because I
could not carry on the Forum myself, for lack of finan-
cial resources and because of heavy debts contracted, I
- disposed of the plant and turned every farthing of the
proceeds over to where I now consider the true interests
of our movement lie. It was with a deep and abiding bit-
terness that I had considered comrades, when for two years
it had fought off all its many enemies on the outside.
Yet with it came the realization that we have to
build anew over the ruins you have wrought. The revolu
tion and the building of our future moves forward and
when we trample down the defenses of our enemies we shall
crush underfoot everything and everybody that stands in
our way. No sycophantic, blind, allegiance to a name, an
empty facade, a torn and shredded prestige can lead us
forward. Only unswerving fidelity to our goal and active
struggle towards this end with the weapons of a correct
and tested political line will lift us from defeat to ul-
timate victory. To this struggle I shall continue to
dedicate all my energies.

T
I have the honor to report that an American

Mr. Harold R. Isaacs called at this office in

months in Shanghai; at that time he exhibited pass-
port No. 177020, issued by the Department of state on
March 17, 1950. He stated that he expected to leave
Shanghai in June, 1931; that his home was in Now York
City and that hip local address wad in care of the
American Express Company.

contains a copy of a letter written by him to a kiss
Viola Robinson, cure of the Amorioan Consulate, Dresden,
Germany, dated July 24, 1931, at Chongtu, 3zoshuen.
This lotter, it is stated, was returned unopened to
Shanghai from Dresden, addressed to Harold R. Isaacs
in care of the Amorioan Express Company, Shanghai, and
was opened by the Post Office Consor at the request of
the Commissioner of Posts. The letter is very long and
shows that Icasos, although previously holding com-
munistio views, only decided dofinitely to turn "Red"
during July of this year. Ho stated that he was in-
fluenced in this decision by certain conversations with
0. Frank Glass, above referred to, during their trip to
320ohuen.
In connection therewith it may be of internet to
state that according to a police report dated October
17, 1931, information regarding this letter was given
by the Shanghai Municipal Police to an officer of the
local Britial Consulate Coneral, who apparently sabled
information regarding it to London. The police report
states that a reply was subsequently receive the glet

Imanes addressed an open letter to the verious newspapers
of Shanghai, under date of November 24, 1931, in which
he scored them for branding those alleged murders as
"horrible" and "dastardly," while at the same time they
did not raise their editorial voicos against the whole-

Commander of Shanghal and other Chinese militarists.

On any principles of abstract justice, is the mass murder
of thousands by the machine gun, the bomber, the rifle, the

This perpetual warfare has been waged on the pretext of

the government boasting the recognition of all foreign

from the mongre life earnings of peasants and workers.

against Imperialism of supporting-
the Chinese Revolution and ruthless-

The United States government has
warned Isaacs that it will, withdraw

treatles imposed upon China by the
imperialists, American and other citi

Isaacs has categorically refused to

Dr. Harold R. ISAACS, Professor of Political Science at M.I.T.
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES.
1. On 12 July 1967, WUSPARROW/1 renewed his old friendship with
Subject at the MIT Faculty Club. Subject is now a senior research associate
at MIT's Center for International Studies and has recently been named a
Professor.
2. For the past few years Subject has been working on an international
study series involving minority racial groups. His reports have been
published in the New Yorker magazine and as books, The New World of Negro
Americans and India's Untouchables. Subject plans to publish in August
1967 a book on the American Jews in Icrael and is working on another on
the Philippines.
3. WUSPARROW/1 first mot Subject in 1946 after he had just completed
a long and friendly interview with Ho Chi Minh as Far East correspondent
for Newsweek. At that time, Subject felt that the United States was making
a mistake in not accepting Ho as the leader of a united Vietnam, reeling
that Ho was independent enough of China to make him at worst a sort of
Tito.
4. Subject presently is despairing of United States foreign relations
in that our people from Washington, or elsewhere, seldom seem to establish
a deep rapport with Asian or African nationals, Subject feels that such.
relations as do exist never reach more than an ineffective superficial
level.
5. Subject first went to the Far East about 1930 when he was a crew
member of the Matson Line's Malolo and disembarked at Honolulu to work for
the Honolulu Advertiser. (WUSPARROW/1. went to work for the same paper two
years later.) Subject went next to the Philippines where he worked on a
Manila daily. While in Manila he was offered the editorship of the Bangkok
Royal Mail, to fill in for St. Clair MCELWAY, now of the New Yorker.

6. Subject's mind was set on China and in late 1931 he went to
Shanghai and joined The China Press, working alongside Tiliman DURD IN,
now of the New York Times. Subject lost his job with The China Press
after a flare-up with Hollington TONG, part-owner of the paper. Subject
then joined the Newsweek foreign staff. Subject was in and out of
Bangkok after World War II and WUSPARROW/1 became friendly with him.
According to WUSPARROW/1, many people regard Subject's Tragedy of the
Chinese Revolution as a significant work and a recent writer on Chima,
Dennis BLOODWORTH, holds a good view of Subject's Scratches on the Mind
7. Subject now-seems permanently settled with MIT, having bought
a home at 96 Farlow Road, Newton. Subject hosts there at pool-side
"seminars" on Saturday afternoons, with MTT faculty friends and journalist
friends such as Bob SHAPLEN coming by. Subject invited HUSPARROW/1 to
participate as well.
8.
.
However, as WUSPARROW/1 ascertained, Subject has little contact
with foreign students save for an occasional adult foreign graduate
student. We hope, considering Subject's background, that he will prove
with WUSPARROW/1's guidance to be a profitable unwitting spotter and
assessor of foreign graduate students.

EUROPE'S CRISIS; JAPAN PREPARAS
By Manau Chan
There are numerous American journaliste of
different political color and shades of opinion who are
"cooperating" in this way with Japanese imperialion, but
whoover has followed the writings of Harold Isaaca,
Alexander Buchman, Frank Class and Wilbur Burton in The
Chine Press, The China Weekly Review, Asia, Pacific Affairs,
New International, sto., realizes that these American
Trotskyist journalists are the most vicious and most dan-
gerous of the whole lot of reactionary journalists.
Hiding behind a barrage of Marxist phraseology (which
none of them has yet learned to manipulate with faoility),
these people are energetically conducting a compaign of
lies against the communist International, the Chinese
Communist Party, the Soviet Union, the Chinese Soviets
and the Chinese Red Army, a campaign which aims to under-
mine the confidence of the outside world in the Chinese
Soviet movement and the Red Army,

1. Reference is made to your request dated 14 September 1955.
The files of this office contain considerable information concerning
Subject., the salient elements of which are summarized below.
2. According to undated information from a reliable source,
Subject born 13 September 1910 in New York City, arrived in Shanghai,
China, from Manila, Philippine Islanda, in December 1930. First
employed in Shanghai by the English language daily, Evening Post and
Mercury, Subject became associated a few weeks later with the China
Press, with which he remained until May 1931. In June 1931 Subject
traveled up the Yangtze River with the British Communist, Cecil Frank
GLASS, a suspected agent for the Third International in China. Also
in 1931, Subject became the Shanghai secretary of the Comite Inter-
nationale Pour la Defense de Paul et Gertrude RUEGG (NOULENS), a
committee, with Headquarters in Berlin, formed to aid the defense of
the NOULENS against charges of espionage perferred by the Chinese
Government. Subject was in correspondence with Will MUENZENBERG,
President of the Committee and an active agent in Germany for the Third
International. Subject was also known to be in contact with Agnos
SMEDLEY in Shanghai during the same period. On 14 September 1932
in Shanghai, Subject married Viola ROBINSON, an American citizen
born 10 June 1910 in New York City. Miss ROBINSON was believed to
have been connected with Communist activities in the United States
and in China. Correspondence between her and Subject prior to their
marriage indicated that they were both sympathetic to activities
being conducted by the Communists in China.

c. In July 1933 the Nanking Government ordered
the Municipality of Greator Shanghai to take drastic
measures to stop the propaganda appearing in a
nusder of publications including the China Forum,
published by Subject. Subject's magazine allegedly
published Communist propaganda; in this connection a
protest was to be lodged against him with the American
Consulate.
d. Subject was described as a "self-confessed
Communist" in 1933. The following year he wrote an
article entitled "I Break With The Chinese Stalinists"
which appoared in the September-October 1934 edition
of The New International, a Communist propaganda
organ published in New York.

1930's). Friends of Subject stated that even during tho
height of his. Trotskyist career he never accepted money

Communism by "sheer idealism." Immediately after Pearl
Harbor, ISAACS broke with the Trotskyite group as he had
broken with the Communists and began writing propaganda
for the United States Government.

1.
Roference is made to the request received on
14 October 1963 from Lt. Whipple concerning Subject.
With respect to the specific questions posed in the
request, Subject is the author of a number of books,
including No Peace in Asia, Five Years of Kuomintang
Reaction, and The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution
The Piles contain no information concerning Subject's
teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
however they do contain the following summary of un-
evaluated information based on several predecessor
1. organisation reports. Additional information concern-
ing Subject is contained in our SODB 20588, dated 2
December 1949, subject: Harold Robert ISACCS, a copy
of which is attached for your retention.

•
a. Subject was employed as a staff writer for
the Havas Nows Agency in Shanghai from 1930-1935.
He was also editor and publisher of the China Forum,
a communist periodical, from January 1932 to an
unspecified dato. In July 1832 ISAACS wrote and
published the above-cited Five Years of Kuomintang
Reaction, a 136-page illustrated book of Communist
nature. While in Shanghai he was a member of The
Society of Friends of the USSR (Shanghai Branch)
and The China League for Civil Rights.
b. In 1933 Shanghai authorities listed Subject's
wife, Viola ROBINSON, as a suspect Soviet agent re-
siding in Shanghai. Prior to their marriage on 14
September 1932, ISAACS stated in a letter to Hisa
ROBINSON that he had definitely turned "Red."
the members of the ROBINSON family were described as
Communists.

arrived here. It indicatos that the association has already
taken decided steps towards its announced expansion into the
South Asian field. The station assumes that Headquarters

On the same day, a Pakistan Studies Organization

know who is interested in Pakistan studies (both
individuals and organizations) and what lines
they are thinking of working on.
On 5 April, all the items. of a "South Asian Mis-

Mr. P. A. Bisson
136 Claremont Avenue
Mount Vernon, N. Y.
Dear Mr. Bisson:
I have seen the correspondence exchanged between
Mr. Olass and yourself regarding the contributions you
collected for the China Forum. A draft for the sum in
full will be sent to you this week.
I do not know in the name of whom or what Miss Smedley
speaks of the China Forum. Since she was not in China at
the time the Forum Suspended, nor has she corresponded
with me on the subject, I consider it necessary to place
before you and the other contributors an account of the
circumstances in which the Forum ceased publication.
Since you apparently gathered the contributors together
in a meeting to hear what Miss Smedley had to say, I
would appreciate it deeply if you would gather them once
more to hear my account. The enclosed is a copy of a
letter sent by me last way to the Chinese Communist Party.
It has been published in China in a Chinese translation
and copies have been sent abroad but has not been pub-
lished in English as far as I know. I do not know the
names of the people who were good enough to contribute
to the Forum but their interest in the matter warrants
placing before them the story of what happened to the
magazine. I trust, out of simple fairness to me, you
will be good enough to give them this opportunity.
I greatly regret any inconvenience or embarrassment
to which you have been put in this matter. I do hope,
however, that my letter will enlighten you and your
friends and enable you to appreciate the difficulties
which have arisen. I know of no project to revive the
China Forum at the present time. Should such occur, the
resultant publication would be of a considerably different
character from the one I edited, as will be obvious from
'
..
the facts given in my letter to the C. P. I think people
who are interested in supporting the revolutionary move-
ment here should know these facts.
Once again, I appreciate all the trouble you have
gone to in this matter.
Did you ever, incidentally, receive the artiole
"Fascism in China" and the newsletter which I mailed to
July 13 last?
Yours sincerely,
(Harold R. Isaacs)

Letter of H. R. Lenace to the C.C.P, congern-
Ing the China Forum
To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:
The two-year period of my extra-organizational col-
laboration with the Chinese Communist Party has come to
an end and the China Forum which I founded and edited dur-
ing that time has been forced to suspend publication. In
the interest of our whole movement as well as in my per-
sonal interest, I consider it necessary to record here
and publish the history of the China Forum and the oir-
cumstances of its suspension. You refused me the oppor-
tunity to lay the matter before the membership of the
party even when I offered to do so in your own organs and
not through the columns of the forum. When, wrongly, I
permitted the Forum to go down in silence, you turned
around and in your organs and near organs in China and
abroad you proceeded with the usual slanders of "betrayer"
and "counter-revolutionary". In so doing you didn't have
the courage or the simple honesty to state that you pre-
sented the China Forum with an ultimatum and forced its
suspension because in reply its editor raised questions
which are being placed before the whole movement today
by the International Left Opposition. Nor did you state
that you deliterately smashed the Forum for this reason
despite my repeated and extended offers to continue publi-
cation as before on a straight anti-Kuomintang, anti-
imperialist basis, leaving these various problems to be
thrashed out first privately among ourselves. In other
words, you deliberately forced suspension of the China
Forum despite the fact, on your own admission, that its
loss was a serious plow to the revolutionary movement in
China, that it meant the disappearance of an organ which
for two years you had considered an extremely valuable
instrument in the hands of the movement. Here, as in the
broader issues which led to our differences, your blind
adherence to false policies was once more demonstrative
of your readiness to place your factional interests above
the interests of the Chinese Revolution.
E 1

-
In going back over the history of the Forum, I think
the vicious character of your action becomes even more
evident when I start with the fact that from beginning to
end I functioned not as a member of the party but as a
willing sympathizer who was prepared to throw all his
energies into a job he saw he could do edit and publish
an organ in China which could help mobilize the forces
of this country for struggle against the Kuomintang and
the imperialists by exposing the regime of terror and
privation which they have in common imposed upon the
masses of the Chinese people. Permit me to recall at
this point that I never accepted any personal remunera-
tion for timo or labor. You gave the Forum financial
aid but I never received a dollar from you that was not
put into the paper. I refused your offers of compensa-
tion and earned my living elsewhere. Your only claim on
me was my full-hearted loyalty to the Communist ideal and

1. A happy ending has been writion in the ease of ferris Appelman,
former Communist who is now secretary of the Conoral hose morial Hospital
of Denver. He has been praised in Moldington for "disclosing his Communist
past", and his board of directors has voted confluence in him and continued
him in his job.
2. No doubt all this is fitting and proper but it doesn't answer the
question of why nobody in Donyer goons to have known anything about
Appolman's Rod-tinged part, or why there was anything sensational about his
rovolation of it in Washington. hile the police state is rightly anathoma
to American citizens, it seems remarkable that official records should not.
be in existence and reasonably accessable to people with reason to check up
on such a point as past Communist service.
3. The point about Appelman is not that he did anything; particularly
reprehensible, but that what he did was quite in the open. According to the
Tashington tontimony he served the Communist party, apparently without
special concealment, in Runnia, Germany and other points in lurope, going.

5. About "The Voice of China" there could hardly be any illusion in
the mind of anyone who hiul carod to pay the alightest attention to it.

our common dedication to the struggle against a regime
of hate and misery and oppression. In the end you for-
folted this claim by ceasing any longer to be in my eyes
honest or.effective leaders of this struggle.
Although you helped the Forum financially, the part
you played in building it up from the day it started in
January, 1932, to the day of its last appearance in Janu-
ary 1934, was insignificant. My repeated requests for
cooperation in matters of circulation and material for
publication went largely unsatisfied throughout that time.
You never supplied me with the reports I so frequently
and urgently sought, particularly on trade unions, strike
struggles, the Red Armies, the Red districts, etc. Every
thing the Forum did and became was the fruit of the work
of a tiny group of devoted collaborators (the most in-
portant of whom had no connection with you whatever) and
myself who had to depend almost entirely on your own re-
sources for everything we did and published. At every
crisis in the Forum's existence, when it was banned by
the French authorities in Shanghai at the very outset;
when it was hounded and persecuted by the American and
Chinese authorities in the summer of 1933, when through
Brition police pressure it was thrown out of every avail-
able printing ship in the city; when the pseudo-Fascist
Blue Shirts again and again threatened the printing plant
which I built up partially through personally contracted
loans - it was invariably through my own initiative, with
the help of the little Forum staff, that we pulled our-
selves up by the bootstraps every time and carried on to
a point in January this year where the Forum was flourish-
ing and growing daily in circulation, prestige, and in-
fluence despite the many formidable obstacles in its way.
The formation of the China Forum Readers Association,
which in the brief space of three months spread to eleven
cities in five provinces, developing into a mighty poten-
tial weapon for the revolutionary movement, was the prod-
uct of spontaneous action on the part of the Forum'a
readers, later sponsored and led by the paper itself.
All these were the Forum's own achievements, not yours.
By your arbitrary and criminal action you shattered them
in the full stride of their growth. Because to my bitter
disappointment I had not nor could I secure the resources
to carry on myself - owing largely to the difficult condi-
tions of work and the impossibility of getting revenue

From almost the very beginning of my active work
which I date from the time I began reporting events in
China in a Communist way a number of questions presented
themselves to me in increasingly forcible form. These
arose originally from my discovery of the gross distor-
tions and exaggerations which I found to be characteristic
of Communist propaganda in China and abroad. I defino
propaganda as the skilful, clear, accurate and wholly
truthful reporting of the facts linked to an incisive,
purposive

telling them lies. I have never learned to the contrary
that it was my revolutionary duty to work in any other
way although I soon found that the present day Communist
Party press makes a practice of distinguishing between
propaganda and truth.
:
Examples of exaggeration and distortion most strik-
ing to me were naturally those which applied to China,
because here I could check allegations with known facts.
I first wrote these down to the ignorance or incapacity
of individuals. I felt that Communist editors abroad
would publish accurate facts about China if they could
get them.
Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up.
an independent mail news service and sent weekly bulletins
to papers all over the world giving brief, sharp, factual.
accounts of what was going on. This was in the fall of
1931 after my return from the area of the great Central
China floods of that summer. I scarcely understood then
why this service failed to secure any response from the
Communist press abroad. After about three months I had
to suspend it for lack of support. It simply didn't get
published except in a few organs which were not official
Communist Party papers, including the New York Militant.
-It wasn't long before I began to perceive, with a
deeper study of international events and the history of
the Chinese Revolution, that a consistent thread ran
through the distortions and exaggerations which I found
not only in brief casual reports of current events but
in the solemn pronunciamentoes made by delegates before
plenums of the E.0.0.1.f discovered that these departures
from the truth were made necessary by the official premise
that ever since the catastrophe of 1927 a mighty, upsurg-
ing revolutionary movement has been marching forward in
China to the very brink of seizure of power under the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I discovered
that these exaggerations were necessary because the prem-
ise was false and along with it all the basio tenats of
the policies being pursued by the Communist International
and the Communist Party in China. I cannot begin here to
=
give a summary of some of these distortions (which I
verbally cited to you by the dozen) ranging from particu-
lar incidents (the wilfully false picture given of the
cotton mill strike in Shanghai in January, 1933, even to
the point of transposing it to February to heighten the
impression given of the workers' role in the Shanghai war)
to high flown generalizations like the statement recently
made before the Plenum of the S.C.C.I. that the C.C.P. has
won over the majority of the Chinese working class and
the peasantry.
In denying the factual truth of this premise, whence
flows the whole policy of the Communist Party in China, I
deprecate not a whit the magnificent militancy and courage
of Chinese workers, striking again and again and fighting

Assistant Director for Policy Coordination
Attention: Security Officer
Chief, Special Security Division
Harold R. Isaacs
1. Reference is made to a memorandum from your office dated
3. July 1951 in which you requested that a Special Inquiry be con-
ducted to resolve information concerning an allegation that Sub-
ject is sympathetic to and/or connected with Communist activities.
.
2. On 31 August 1951, Mr. Kenneth Patrum of the Security
Office was advised that partial results have been received as
a result of inquiries at several national agencies. The partial
information reflected that Subject had been connected with at
least two factions of the Communist Party while living in the
Far East. It was suggested that extreme caution be used in con-
tacting or associating with the Subject.
3. This office has completed the investigation of the Sub-
ject, which includes a check of records of the appropriate Federal
agencies. As a result of this investigation, the files of this
office contain a great deal of information concerning Subject's
association with questionable organizations and individuals.
Although Subject has denied any current activities with the Commu-
nist Party, his associations and activities are highly questionable
and his political sympathy has not been unqualifiedly resolved at
the present time.
4. In view of the information as set forth above, it is
recommended that extreme caution be exercised in dealing with the
Subject. Under no
Under no circumstances should Subject be contacted with
regard to possible use by this agency prior to receiving a final
security determination by this office.
