In 1953 we created a separate control file
(62-99724) under the caption," CIA - James Angleton," for
the purpose of retaining copies of certain types of
memoranda disseminated to us by James Angleton, Chief,
Counterintelligence Staff, CIA. We believe that it is no
longer necessary to maintain this control file.

In the way of background, the control file was
created to give us the opportunity of closely monitoring
Your liaison with Angleton on a variety of matters which were
not reported through normal CIA channels. CIA Directors

permitted Angleton to run several intelligence projects,
Ymany of them with the Israeli Intelligence Service: KCCC He was
given authority by CIA to handle these projects and report
only to the Director, CIA. He was given authority to
disseminate to the FBI on all matters of interest to us.
In 1953 we worked out an agreement where Angleton disseminated
to us, and we attributed the information to Bureau Informant 100.
The field was given appropriate instructions regarding the
handling and reporting of the information. This procedure is
still in existence and is operating satisfactorily.
The information disseminated by Angleton is filed
in the case file of an individual or an organization. The
recorded in separate case files. There has been little or
no occasion to use the control file, and its usefullness at
this point can be characterized as being obsolete: 62-99724-78
