c.
Further inquiries in Mexico by our efficials there revealed
that Miestas DAMASCUS had been ordered to leave Mexice in October
1960 soloty because of the expiration of his tourist card, which had been
sace extended. baxican Records fail to show that be returned to Mexico,
ellowing his entry into the United States at Brownsville, Texas, from
Matamorse, Tamaulipas on 24 October 1960. Upon arrival in Mexico on
28 June 1960, he indicated that the purpose of his visit was to attend the
wedding of his sister, Anastasio, identified in preceding paragraph, -
however, as of 21 Jen 1961, there was no racore of Anastasie
DAMASCUS aka DAMASCOU is official Mexican Files, and there was
· as yet no identification of the individual she was alleged to have been
scheduled to marry. From the same source it was learned that for the
period 22 June through 6 September 1360, the only address listed in
official indices for Nicolas DAMASCUS to c/o Justo SIERRA, Reforma
95-407, Lemce City, which is the law office maintained by Justo SIERRA
Casasua, former Counselor of the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C..
and who to further identified is the documents cited in paragraph 1. c.
through b. above. DAMASCUS reportedly used SIE&RA to attempt to
obtain an extension of his tourist permit, although the details of his con-
taste with and knowledge of SIERRA bimself are not haown at this time.
Neither has it been possibio sú cí thần dats to verify the reported cen-
tact betwean Hicolas DAMASCUS and Subjects at the řistal New Yorker,
so repasted by Ms. Thomas DONLON. Investigatica efforts abroad by
thic Agency are cominuing, however, and any further information
developed will be forwarded as soon as available.

transitting kiexico and presumably Cube enroute to the USSA, your
particular attention is invited to the information concerning the contacts
and views of Jaste SAA Casasus furnished in the reports cited in
paragraph i. e., f., and g. above. It is noted Justo sikARA Caseses
