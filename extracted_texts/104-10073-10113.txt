According to information from an official Portuguese
service LING was contacted in late August 1900 in Santa Maria,
the Azores, by Eloy GUTIERREZ Manoyo, a Cuban National, and
Rafal probably Rafael 'HERNANDEZ, a Cuban diplomat. In 1988
and 1959, GUTIERREZ was reliably reported, brother sources,
to have been a military supporter of Fidel CASTRO's revolution
and to be employed by CASTRO possibly as a 0-2 agent. In
August 1959 he had infiltrated the ranks of certain anti-CASTR)
conspirators and delivered the leaders up to the Cuban Govern-
mant.

The Portuguese service (further reported in September 1960
that Lindsey LING, aka LING Lind Sey, was the manager of a Chinese
restaurant located at rua Valaverde 9, Madrid, Spain, and that the
restaurant was owned by a second (unidentified) Chinese, who was
also supplying clothing to the United States personnel at the
Lajos Base in the Azores. Theodor Heins/VIENER, who had represented
the clothing firm in the Asores, was reportedly arrested there in
December 1989 on a suspicion of espionage, and was, as of September
1960, reportedly in Bermuda, where LING was planning to go to
investigate setting up another restaurant.
The files contain no further information concerning Sub-
jects than that which is already believed to be contained in your
