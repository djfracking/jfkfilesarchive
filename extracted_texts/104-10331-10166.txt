ARRB Meeting 20 July - Results
REFERENCE:
The ARRB took the following actions on CIA document/issues:
1. Accepted CIA request to consider crypts/project names in Ford Presidential Library
Documents (Rockefeller Commission) NBR, not believed relevant, protect until 2017;
2. Accepted CIA request to "retype" the Australian document being released in sanitized form
(Board voted to protect the liaison relationship and to delete any identifying information at previous
meeting);
3. Accepted CIA approved language for description of 4 pages dealing with the assassination
from a sensitive foreign\document know as the "Mark Lane" document. [Board member with permission
of the foreign government had reviewed the full document on 7 July and agreed that the only the 4 pages
should be included in the JFK collection.];
4. Rejected CIA request for reconsideration of previous decision to protect only the digraph of
crypt, (IJDECANTER [asset, dead, identity and relationship with Agency exposed in Dec 1997 LA Times
article];
5. Rejected CIA request to deny in full JMWAVE org chart/Board voted 5-0 to "open in full".
The next Board meeting is 6 August. I need to as soon as possible if the Agency is going to
appeal or ask for reconsideration re items 4 and 5.
