June 1976. She reportedly made the statement that she was associated
with Frank STURGIS and that she had placed some poison pills in
her face cream for the purpose of assassinating Fidel. A 24 April
1961 FBI document states that on 8 January 1961 LORENZ STIRGIS, Alex
RORKE were to meet that evening and attempt a unity meeting of
ant 1-Castro Cubans. The unity meeting was sponsored by Luis CONTE
Aguero, one of the leading anti-Castro Qubuns. I have uncovered nothing
to date concerning an assassination attempt (in this connection;)
