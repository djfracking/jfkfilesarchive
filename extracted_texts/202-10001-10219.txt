Tack 23, Counterfeit Currency to increase Cuban economic
problems is convicered feasible within 30-60 days upon a
limited basis and in considerable scale within six months.
CIA asks the Group approval before proceecing with this
action.
Other Tasks.
I note here that CIA does not feel it has the operational means
to undertake Task No. 22, black-market activities, at this time. Fur-
ther that Task No. 11. Time magazine dissemination, would require
operational facilities not now available. I accept intéfinite deferral of
Task No. 22 and scrubbing of Task No. 11 on this basis.
The Department of State reaction, to my effort to get the U.S.
into priority actions towards our project's goals, has been cisappointing
to me thus far. Apparently, my conedule of targets for special efforts
is accepted only as it may fit into long-range, existing programs already
under way. If this is the theory of our project, I believe that the project
then becomes only a special reporting device and not a special U.S.
effort to win the goal of helping the Cubans recapture their country
from a gang of Communists.

SOAL
Intellisence build-up by CIA includes efforts to recruit a
Cuban diplomat in-place and an official in an airlines cifice in
Havana. The CIA team placed in Pinar del Rio Province lact
March was successfully re-supplied by maritime means on
24 May. The Navy and CIA have worked out a cooperative effort
to strengthen the U.S. security and intelligence program at
Cuantanano.
Holds
The CAC continues to provide word from inside Cuba cover-
ing local security moves and popular unrest (unrest reportedly
increasing). A substantial reduction in oil refining and manu-
facture of tires and tubes is reported from CAC sources.
+
Econimic pressure upon the Communist regime may be
increased by a Lepartment of Commerce move denying bunkering
facilitics at U.S. poris to vessela under Sino-Soviet bloc charter
carrying cargo to Cuba. State Department reports having solicited
views of our Arabassador to Japan regarding possible approaches
to the Japanese asking them to cease sugar purchases from Cuba,
Pronavanca efforts of USIA and CIA continue to apply pressure
upon the Cusan regime by focusing upon abuses of power and failure
of key programs such as reedical and iɔɔd. The VSA use of refugees
in interviews especially underlined this theme. I am looking into a
USIA proposal that we counter Communist Cuba moves to impress
Latin America by participation in the athletic North Central American
and Caribbean Cames set for August 11-23 in Kingston, Jamaica: a
"Irce Cuba" team might be effective, with good publicity support.

Task 7, "Voice of Free Cuba," is almost immediately

Navy for use of a submarine. CIA has firm plans for
worrying the Communist regime through broadcasts
which would appear to come from local dissident groups
actively planning to harass the regime.
2). Task 19, CIA is prepared to disseminate leaflets on Castro's
failure to the Cuban population via balloon with a view of
increasing instability of the Communist fischine. Inc
technique is tested and CIA has plans to operate from a
surface Ghip in international waters. The Group is
asked to approve the idea, including Navy support.
