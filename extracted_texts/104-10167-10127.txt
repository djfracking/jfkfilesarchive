In answer to his appeal assistance, I da I I would
ld try to help hi-
devise some means of establishing this casted that vel pass
word to his wife to contact Juin FRXIHIDEZ de stuce the leaves for the
purpose of putting him in contist with exymarw want to name and to instruct him
in CHAR's name to pass on any and all intimation he has at this time.
3.
This group still believes, in spite of what has been reported from Cute,
that, while they may have some little different view as to how much MORGAN can
be trusted, Eleoy GUTIERREZ Mazoyo and HORCAT and the zen of the Second Front
of the Escambray are and will remain anti-Castro and eventually will nove against
him.
:
C. It was learned that CHAR is presently living in Frank FICRIMI's house
at 2050 SW 60th Court, Miami, telephone 7-300. He also informed me that ODETY
had been talking with him about some local friends through when he produced the
names of some acquaintances of those whose names are Rissian. I have not yet
had an opportunity to discuss this with the ODEVY agent involved. ·
10. I will meet with the group again at the end of this week, at which tize
I expect they will have some modified position with regard to their activities
and will appeal again for assistance. Mantine, it is resumenied that (DCHAR's
recommendation with regard to having his wife get in touch with FELNDEZ de
Castro and to get him debriefed be passed to the Havana Station.

1. GOCHAR vas asked first to bring me up to date on what he and the others
in his group have been doing and he reported that they were not doing much c
anything except waiting. Waiting, first, for some funds which they are expecting
to come primarily from the sale of the ; and, sezona, waiting for the estab
lishment of some better comication with their contacts in Cuba.
2. With regard to the aimeraft, DAM told me on this date that he beligres
he does now have a sale for the aircraft and he thinks the sale price will be between
US$50 and US$55 thousand.

3. CHARse that has counicated with someone (he wasn't sure of
3
i
the name) in an attempt to
funds from people in Cuba. CEAR presented
this in the light that
was "authorizing" some people in Cuba to go ahead
and solicit funds. In this connection, DR mentioned that at one time in the
past Julio LOBO (note: this name has never been mentioned in any previous conversations
with this group) had considered donating US$100 thousand for the air force school
which CEAR was promoting at that time. but apparently became frightened of the
deal and nothing along this line materialized. CHAR said that he was hopeful that
sonetine he would be able to re-establish contact with 1020. All his reference is
entirely coincidental to my suggestions made to that I might try to bring
this group together with Juli 1030. Raving learned of this previous connection,
I want to revive this idea and proceed with the plan to bring these two together.

4. If and when they are able to accumulate sore funds, it is their intention
to go ahead with their plans for the establishment of a propaganda program which
would be initially voice radi. ODCHAR said that he had been trying to persuade
02 EDBIAS and Dove to a more narrow program within the limitations which I hai
for them in a previous meeting (See -11). He said he thinks now that this is
the more realistic approach, Dove holds to the original thinking that they 02
cannot commit themselves to such limitations. CDCHAR informed me that CV requests
another meeting with me. He told that I would be away for a fe: days but would
contact him as soon as I return.
(S-11).
5. I then questioned (DCEAR about his knowledge and QDBIAS' knowledge of the
presence of Soviet Russians in Cuba. DEAR stated that his only information had come
to him through [DRC] (this is the Canadian whom. DOTUR referred to frequently
in his carlier debriefing SELLY et al). [Root] plained to his to have seen the 05
by
Soviets in Santiago de Cuba en DCHAR said that furthermore he had obtained the names
which he passed to Colonel NIECES in the American Dibassy in Havana. When asked if
he thought these were the same Savid that I/S had referred to in his testirny
in Washington, OCEAR said he felt that they were, although he believed GDEIAS'
information was obtained independent of his, DCHAR's, Source.
