III. PROPOSAL
A.
Statement
It is proposed to undertake the development in Chils of a group
or committee composed of Chilean nationals which will engage
'overtly and actively in anti-Communist work and will function as
a WHD mechanism for the accomplishment of WHD missions (a) and (b)
in Chile, as set forth in Paragraph I above.
As the first step in implementing the development of that committee,
it is proposed to engage the services of a high-calibre American
national in Chile as a contract agent at an annual salary of
$6,000.00 to
1. Spot, recruit, and manage a qualified indigenous Chilean
who will act as organizer, of the aforementioned committee,
and
2.
Act as cut-out and principal agent for HD, in the
operations of the committee.
At such time as development of the committee warrants, the
necessary steps will be taken to place the committee in the
proper relationship with the DTHABEAS foundation for purposes
of cover and support.

Communications between FULMINATOR-1 and the Santiago
Field Station will at all times be carried on by means
of a secure cut-out.
'Since FULME:ATOR-1's cover is his overt business situation
in which he is already established, and since that situation
provides him with printing and publishing facilities, it is
believed that good operational security can be maintained
with a minimum of effort in this Project.

IV.
B. Background
The American national in question is a former WFD/050
agent (FULMINATOR-1) of proven ability, courage and
discretion.
FULMINATOR-1's present occupation in Santiago, Chile,
provides him with excellent contacts and cover for
carrying out the tasks proposed for him above.
He is part owner of, and holds the controlling interest
(51%) in a Santiago printing and publishing establishment
that publishes an English-language newspaper, The South
Pacific Mail, which FULMINATOR-1 edits. His establishment
is well equipped to handle a great variety of printing
jobs.
C. Current Status
On 23 January 1952, WHD Headquarters authorized its
Santiago Field Station to hire FULMINATOR-1 as a
contract agent for a period of at least two years
(See ANNEXES B and D). In his agent capacity, FULMINATOR-1
will undertake to develop the committee referred to above
in Paragraph A of this Outline.
At such time as that development warrants, an Amendment
to this Project containing a statement of all new require-
ments, will be submitted to competent authority for
approval.
RECOMMENDATION
That there be allotted to this Project funds in the amount of
$4,700.00 to provide salary for FULMINATOR-1 for the remainder of
Fiscal Year, to cover the cost of bringing him to Washington for
a period of covert training, provide his per diem allowance while
here, and transport him back to Santiago, Chile following that
training period.

MERCHANDUM FOR THE RECORD
1. May 1952
Meeting with Agent, Faul D. LANGEVIN on 20 April 1952
+1
}
1. The sense of the following text was obtained aring
an afternoon meeting with Agent LANGEVI!!. Participating in
the talk vere Messrs. Sparser and Tutton and Agent LANGEVIN.
Four rajor topics were discussed and will be presented here
in the order in which they were developed.
2. Printing Plant Problem: Mr. LANGEVIN indicated that
in two and a half to three months certain financial obliga-
tions would come due. These consisted entirely in making an
$8,000 payment arising from the purchase of equipment for his
printing establishment. This equipment, which cost about
$10,000 when purchased late in 1951, consists of an Italian-
made press, linotype machine, Speed Graphic cameras, tyre,
etc. The market value of this equipment (partly new and
partly used) is estimated to be at least $10,000. The sum of
*3,000 represents the total indebtedness of LANGEVIN's plant
and is owed to a Mr. MACHENZIE of Casa Mackonzic. Mr. LAIGEVIK
may meet this payment by either (J.) securing a loan from a Fort
Worth, Texas, bank using his share in family oil interests as
collateral, (2) taking on a Chilean partner, (3) getting the
money from a Chilean bank (which would involve an 18% interest
rate) or (4) getting the money elsewhere. Common agreement was
expressed on the undesirability of taking on a Chilean partner
since this would be a security hazard in any future PW work,
and would also eliminate the possibility of using the plant as
cover for another agent. 15. LANGEVIN, asked about his previous
statement about leaving Chile after two years, replied that now
there was no definite plan or desire in that direction. Ee
indicated he would have some idea about the possibility of
assistance from a Texas bank within a few weeks. Mr. LANGEVIN
also suggested that he would gladly use his earnings for the
next two years from the agency ($6,000 per year) if the Agency
could put up the $8,000 in a lump sum. The printing firm is
now making a profit above the salary which LANGEVIN takes out.
3. Briefing on the Comittee: Mr. SIYSER discussed the
overall tasks which LANGEVIN is expected to perform. Much
emphasis was placed on the need for security in explaining
this type of IW activity, particularly if and when DTHABELS is

brought in. Mr. LANGEVIN indicated that his cover for con-
tacting the Embassy vas good, and further indicated that no
unauthorized person in Chile knew of his U. S. Government
activities.
4. Information on FUMBLER: When questioned about the
discretion of FUMBLER, LANGEVIII indicated complete confidence,
stating that she was very efficient and would be useful in
assisting him in Pl work. LANGEVIN was thoroughly briefed on
the fact that FUMELER must never know of DTHAREAS or its con-
nection with the committee.
5. Words and Deeds: Mr. LANGEVIN stated that the format,
paper, type and photoengraving of this pamphlet was far above
Chilean standards. He said that Chile had only one printing
house capable of producing such work, and no artists of the
caliber exhibited in the pamphlet. He suggested a Spanish or
French attribution on poorer paper. The reproduction of posi-
tives is also not done in his plant, but must be contracted for
at a Santiago photoengraver's.
6. Bank Details: Mr. LANGEVIN has opened an account at
the Chemical Bank and Trust, 74th Street and Madison Avenue,
New York City. All future monthly payments will be made to
that bank, beginning with the payment for April.

Ageng loan (bee Amor A). After consultation with the Correr-
cial and Legal Divisions, 11D adviced LUGENII by cable, after
His return to Chile, not to complete any loan arrangements with-
cut notifying Headquarters (See Annex.3). It has decided that
a lean from the Agency, under the terms cutlined in the proposel,
resented the best solution for the agency from the standpoint
of security, and that such a loan would give the Agency even
greater control over the agent than now exists.
IV. RECOMMENDATION
It is recomended that the sun of $8,000 be made available as a loan,
at 4 interest, to contract agent, Paul D. INGEVIN, the loan tọ bo v
secured by a lien on machinery and equipment valued at approximately
$10,000; interest and principal to be amortized at the rate of $500
per month, the full amount of agent's salary.

contract with LANGEVIN would also be reviewed jointly by
representatives of these divisions with a view to incor-
porating any modification which might be necessary as a
result of the agent's entering into a loan agreement with
the agency.
6. As a prerequisite to the issuance of a loan, LANGEVIN
would be required to subrit a complete name-plate inven-
tory of all machinery and equipment involved in the loan
transaction and its physical existence in his custody,
his title to the property, and an approximate evaulation.
of its worth would be determined through WD station per-
sonnel.
B. Background
Contract agent, Paul D. LANGEVIN, is the sole owner and editor
of the English-language paper, South Pacific Mail, which is
published weekly in Santiago, Chile. The printing of this
publication was formerly done by an outside firm. Desiring to
handle both his own printing requirements and to engage in job
printing, LANGEVIN: obtained equipment from an individual who
expected to be compensated through a partnership in the busi-
ness. However, serious illness has prevented the prospective
partner from entering the business, and has forced LANGEVIN to
meet the financial obligation alone. The repayment of this
obligation will require LANGEVIN either (1) to accept a Chilean
partner in his business, or (2) to obtain a loan. The require-
ments of security and the need for flexibility of operation
militate against bringing in a partner. Moreover, a loan ob-
tained locally through ordinary commercial channels, i.e.
banks, would entail exorbitant interest rates. In addition,
since a bank loan would almost certainly: be of short-term
duration; there would exist the constant threat of loss of the
cover business through a possible refusal to renew the loan.
LANGEVIN has contacted a bank: in Texas in an attempt to secure
a loan, offering as security his share of a family interest in
• oil-producing lands. It appears doubtful that the Texas bank
will grant the loan.
C. Current Status
LANGEVIN was advised, while in the United States for training,
that Headquarters would investigate the possibilities of an

6. Since DTHAREAS has written to CORENIAS on the basis of a "previous
acquaintance", it now becomes imperative for CORIAS to be briefed or
DTHAFAS and certain of its personnel. : Headquarters would therefore
like to know the extent of COIAS' present knowledge of DTHA. EAS, in
order that we may supply him with whatever background information he may
need to be convincing in his role as an old friend of a DTHAFEAS director.
7. Headquarters will forward comments requested in paragraph 4 of HCSA-409

This is to confirm and amplify reference (d), that Headquarters has
prepared the initial letter from DTHREAS to Martin J. COKENIAS. This
letter, which requests COKEMIAS to act as the "honorary" DTHAEAS rep-
resentative in Chile, is being sent air-mail to the CONENIAS residence in
Santiago.
As an attachment to this dispatch ve are forwarding the draft of a
suggested reply to he sent by COKEMIAS to DTHA EAS, via air mail. COKENIAS
need not use our suggested letter verbatim, as long as he does incorporate
in his reply the ideas contained in our draft.
3. Upon receipt of the letter of acceptance from COKENIAS, DTHREEAS will
send COMENIAS a letter of introduction to FUNERRIAI. DIHABEAS will also,
at the same time, alert FUNEBRIAL to the anticipated contact, asking him
to put COPENIAS in touch with URIAI-1.

not disclose a greater knowledge of the DTHABEAS-FUNEBRIAL relationship to
date than would logically he available to him through his own correspondence
with ETAEEAS. In order to facilitate understanding between CONENIAS and
the FURIOSO-C group, however, the next letter from DTHAFFAS to COVAS
will include, in addition to the letter of introduction, copies of the
FULEERIAL_DTHABEAS correspondence to date. Headquarters realizes that this
correstondence is already available to COLENIAS, since copics were pouched
with HCSW-274, but it is believed that COMNIAS will be in a firmer position
vis-a-vis FUNDORIAL if he car. produce his own copies of such correspondence,

provisions. If this contract is satisfactory please return it for his signature
at such time as his clearance is obtained.

FULMINATER-1 has shown himself to be very enthusiastic regarding the proposed
employment with this Organisation and is anxious to start the tasks to‘be
assigned to hin as soon as his clearanco is obtained and the necessary instructions
are forwarded to this Station.

To carry out the acvert prepaganda wapoot of FULMINATIN-1's duties he has
highly recommended the use of Victor POBLATE Ctoga. The latior is a Chilean,
about 56 years of age, who is foreman of FULMINATER-l's printing shop. Be also
lives on the premises and would be the only person who would have to know if the
presses are used at ni¸ht. He is not a member of the printers' labor union and
his past actions have indicated to INATUL-1 that he is 100% anti-Communist.
He has been employed many years by Lucenzie and Co., a British firm which shared
the print shop facilities with F.MINATER-1'a presses. However, FULMINATER-1's
equipment is entirely separate from Mackenzie's and if the covert work is done
at night as is anticipated it is FULMINATER-l's opinion that POBLETE could run
off the work without any possible interference from other individuals. Another
of POBLETE's advantages is the fact that he is able to perform all the printing
oporations which will be necessary to put out normal propaganda and similar
material and this would eliminate the need to use other persons in the
preparation of the propaganda material.

Dear FUNEBRIAL:
It is my privilege, by means of this letter, to introduce to you
my good friend, Mr. COKENIAS, who has recently, and very graciously,
consented to act as the Foundation's personal representative in Chile.
I have taken the liberty of asking 17. COKENIAS to serve in this
capacity primarily because the statutes of our Foundation require that we
seek the services of a U.S. citizen to represent us in any foreign country
in which one or more Foundation grants may be operative. In addition, however,
I earnestly believe this arrangement will serve to strengthen the very promising
relationship already established between us and to stimulate those activities
which are of mutual interest to us. I had not mentioned this stipulation in
our previous correspondence, but I do so now in view of the possible imminence
of a formal agreement between Propaganda Por Chile and the Foundation. Our
receipt of your promised printing cost estimates would pave the way for approval
and detailed planning of an actual grant of assistance.
It is my hope and expectation that 15. COMENTAS will call upon you in
the near future to present his respects and ours. As our representative he is
authorized and prepared to discuss all natters of mutual concern. Mr. COKERIAS
has been instructed to extend to you, to Sr.
(to whom, I trust, you
will introduce Mr. COKENIAS), and to your group as a whole, every possible courtesy
and assistance. It is my sincere desire that this personal contact will prove
to be of cormon benefit.
Enclosed you will find a copy of letter of this date, to Mr. COKENTAS.
At the same time, I am sending Mr. COKENIAS a copy of this letter to you, as well
as copies of our previous correspondence, so that he may familiarize himself with
developments to date.
Trusting that you and Sr.
will receive Mr. COKENIAS as our
representative in the same spirit with which he has offered to serve, and hoping
that this arrangement will mark the beginning of a worthwhile and enduring
association, I remain,

PROJECT CUTLINE
Project: FURIOSO-C (PFGROVEL) Amendment No.2.
Type:
Operational
I. AUTHORIZATION
A. Basic Program Authorization
-
1. Basic project PEGROVEL was approved on 12 February
1952 for the establishment of a rechanism capable of conducting
KUGOWN activities aimed at the accomplishment of WHD missions
(a) and (b) in Chile; as set out in Section II (paragraph 2 b)
or Annex B to the WHD/KUGOWN Strategic Plan dated 1 November
1951. This task was assigned priority one in Phase I (1 Jan.
30 June 1952) in the aforementioned plan. Funds in the amount
of $4,700.00 were allotted to this Project, to provide salary
for contract agent Paul D. LANGSVIN (FULMINATOR-1) for the
remainder of FY 52, to cover the cost of bringing him to PHPRIME
for a period of covert training, provide his per diem allowance
while here, and to transport hin back to Santiago, Chile,
following completion of training.
2. Amendment No.1 to basic project PEGROVEL was approved
on 14 July 1952 for the amount of $8,000 (later reduced to $6,000)
to be made available as a loan, at 4% interest, to contract agent
Paul D. LANGEVIN%; the loan to be secured by a lien on machinery
and equipment valued at approximately $10,000; interest and
principal to be amortized at the rate of $500 per month, the full
amount of the agent's salary. Authorization for PBGROVEL Amend-
ment No.1 was the same as that for the basic project PEGROVEL
3. The 1954 WH Operational Program, approved by Chief,
KUBARK on 10 August 1953, authorized a maximum expenditure of
$10,000 for this project during FY 1954.

IV. THE RECOMMENDATION
That the funds currently approved for this project under
the WID Operational Plan for FY 1954 in the amount of $10,000
be authorized for the implementation of the proposal outlined in
this amendment. This support is not to exceed $5,000 during the
remainder of FY 1954. Funds used in furthering the revised plans
for this project will be provided periodically to the DTHABEAS
funding mechanism after receipt of statomonts from FUNEBRIAL as
to the proposed use of the monies.

III. THE PROPOSAL
i
2. Statement of the Proposel
1
41. In basic project PRGROVEL, it was proposed to
undertake the development in Gule of a group or committee
composed of Gillean nationals which would engage overtly and
actively in anti-BGGYPSY erforts and would function as a WAD
rechanism for the accomplishment of WHD missions (a) and (b)
aforementioned. As the first step in implementing the develop-
ment of the committee, it was proposed to engage the services
of a PEPRIME national in Chile as a contract agent whose task
was to select, and exercise subtle guidance over a qualified
Chilean, the latter to act as the organizer of the committee.
It was further stated that at such time as development of the
committee warrants, the necessary steps would be taken to
place the comittee in the proper relationship with the
DTHABEAS foundation for purposes of cover and support. The
provisions of the foregoing are now revised in accordance with
the proposal of this amendment as set out below. The overall
objective of the basic project remains unaltered.
2.
It is proposed, in this Amendment No.2 to Basic
Project PBGROVEL, that WHD furnish technical and financial
support, not to exceed $10,000 during Fiscal Year 1954, to an
indigenous group of Chileans for the purpose of aiding the
group in its overt anti-BGGYPSY and anti-BIGHT KUGOWN-type
activities. NED support will be specifically designed to assist
in the re-activation of the group along its original lines and
to foster by support periodically advanced, the revival of the
group's official organ, a weekly news magazine. It is antici-
pated that the indigenous group will eventually also serve as
a mechanism for the channeling of WHD support to other worthy
groups with similar aims. (See Annex C).
B. Background
L
1. In 1947, a group of influential Chilean business and
intellectual leaders formed a legally chartered organization
dedicated to an overt and active anti-BGGYPSY and anti-BICHT
program through use of all types of KUGOWN media.
The group
published an anti-EGGYPSY weekly news magazine designed for
the working class audience. The activities of this group,
including publication of its official organ, were later
suspended as a result of financial difficulties, public solici-
tation and subscriptions being, at the time, the only source of
funds.
2. Through the encouragement and subtle direction by
Security Informatian

Security Informatieg
Mission Santiago, working through contract agent Paul D.
LANGEVIN, FUNEBRIAL, an unwitting Chilean with excellent
contacts in business and intellectual circles, has succeeded
in ro-activating the former organization, and has recently
approached DTHAMMAS with a request for support for the group's
activitios.
C. Current Status
1. The provisions of basic project PBGROVEL, and of-
Amendment No.1 have been fulfilled. Contract agent Paul D.
LANGEVIN has accomplished his mission, that of selecting and
subtly guiding a Chilean citizen as the indigenous organizer
of the committee. The loan to LANGEVIN, provided under the
terms of Amendment Ho.l, has been paid in full, and the services
of the contract agent, for this project, were terminated as of
31 August 1953.
2. The present committee, composed of influential Chilean
citizens, has been in touch with the DTHAREAS foundation since
March, 1953. The initial contact and subsequent correspondence
with DTHABEAS have been handled by FUNERRIAL, who, while not
a member of the original (1947) group, is an outstanding
caricaturist and satirist with abundant experience in
journalism and publishing, and who has taken the initiative
in re-forming the once-active committee.
3. DTHABEAS is currently awaiting receipt, from FUNEERIAL,
of a detailed estimate of financial support needed, to include
printing costs of the group's woekly news magazine. The
publication itself will be published and edited by FUNEBRIAL-1,
a dynamic anti-BGGYPSY individual who also published the
official organ of the 1947 organization. Upon receipt of the
abovementioned estimates, and pending their review and approval
by WHD, DTHAREAS should be prepared to extend technical and
financial support up to the amount of $10,000 per annun.
It
is understood that such WHD support, channeled through DTHABEAS
will supplement at least an equal amount which is to be raised
locally by the FUNEBRIAL committee.
4. Contract agent Paul D. LANGEVIN has been replaced,
as the cut-out and principal agent for WHD, by Staff Agent
Martin J. COKENIAS. The latter is presently being introduced
into the operation as the Chilean representative of the
DTHABEAS foundation; this is being done by means of corres-
pondence between DIHABEAS, FUJNEERIAL, and Martin J. COKENIAS.
Once WHD support to the FUNEBRIAL group is actually extended
by DTHAREAS, COKENIAS, through the exercise of subtle guidance
made possible by his capacity as a DTHAREAS representative,

FULMINATER-1's weekly newspaper is 61% owned by him, and as indicated in
attached contract; he has agreed to keep the paper for at least two years.
The other owner, who has taken no activo interest whatsoever in the operation,
management or policies of the paper, apparently plans to sell his share.
The prospective buyer is not known but in any event PULMINATER-1 will retain
the controlling interest.
76. FULMINATER-1 is willing to spend the necessary time in Washington for
training and will be ready to depart immediately when so advised. However, his
wife is expecting a baby around 30 December 1951 according to her doctor's
oalculations, and FULMINATER-1 would prefer to remain in Santiago for at least
a few days after the child is born. He is certain that the birth will take
place within a week's time and it is hoped that his presence in Washington will
not be required prior to 15 January 1952. As a cover story for his trip,
FULMINATER-1 has advised that an option has been bought on one of his plays
and that a trip to New York to discuss the play with the prospective producer
is completely logical. Further, he has an estate in Texas which is in litigation
and which could logically require his presence there. PULMINAGER-1 asked that
ho bo allowed to spend a day or two in Texas either on his trip up or back to
settle this estate and it is recommended that he be allowed to do so in order to
provide his cover story with more basis in fact.
8%, FULMINATER-1 has been told that he mist pay United States income tax on his
salary received from this Organization. He is at a loss, however, to know how
this added income can be satisfactorily and securely explained to the Department
of Internal Revenue. In accordance with the conten:s of Field Regulations 50-13,
this matter is being brought to Headquarters attention with a request for
instructions as to how this matter is to be handled.

a) Business and intellectual circles
b) Working class reader audience
B. Operational Control
1. Control exercised by Headquarters
20
WHD/KUGCWN will exercise operational control through
DTHABEAS which will disburse funds to the FUNEBRIAL group
in accordance with specific WED instructions. Control
will be effected through the allotment of funds on the
bacis of budgeted need, through DTHABEAS, to the FUNEBRIAL
group upon evidence of satisfactory performance of the
missions assigned to this organization.
Control exercised by the Field
Chief of Mission, Santiago, will exercise indirect
control through Staff Agent Fartin J. COKENIAS. By means
of independent checking and reporting procedures, Mission
Santiago will keep headquarters informed of the FUNEBRIAL
group's activities. Should the group fail to provide
satisfactory performance, Mission Santiago will advise
headquarters to withdraw financial and technical assis-
tance.
C. Duration of the Project
It is anticipated that this project, if approved for
FY 1954, will be continued in the future by means of a
re-allotment of funds obtained through the yearly Operational
Programs.

D. Advantages to be derived by KUGOWN
1. By supporting the activities of the FUNSERIAL
organization, WHD will obtain the services of a secure
mechanism umiitting of CDYCKE interest, capable of conducting
extensive KUCONN activities on an overt and indigenous basis.
2. In addition to execution of its own KUGCWN type
program, the FUNEBRIAL group will serve as the focal point for
funding and direction of other KUGOWN activities carried on by
other indigenous groups having similar aims. By extension of
support to other such groups, the FUNEBRIAL organization could
thus become the nucleus of a secure KUGOWN network, requiring
no direct contact by WHD/KUGOWN personnel under CDACID cover.
3. Since this operation would be funded by WHD headp
quarters, through the WHD mechanism DTHABEAS, and since control
will be exercised by DTHAREAS through its Staff Agent represen-
tative in Quile, Mission Santiago will be relieved of all but, a
monitoring and reporting responsibility. This is in accordance.
with the WD plan of removing direct control of, and attribution
for, KUGOWN operations from the official station.
E. Risks Involved
Risks involved in establishing the KUGOWN channels
envisaged in this project should be minimal. The indigenous
individuals concerned have been recruited on an unwitting
basis and will be handled by Martin J. COKENIAS directly. The
"FUNEERIAL group, as an existing legal entity, has good natural
cover and can accept direct attribution for its KUGGIN acti-
vities. No Station personnel will be involved and the possibi-
lity of CDYCKE interest being disclosed will be further mini-
mized by securely funding the group and backstopping both
Martin J. COKEMAS and the group's activities by DTHAREAS.
FUNEBRIAL will be unwitting of the original source of his
funds and of CODYⱭKE interest.

Upon approval of this budget by Headquarters, the funde
will be placed to the account of Staff Mont Martin J.
COKSHIAS, who will be cercuntable for their diskursement in
accordance with Confidential Funds regulations. CONTINIAS
will disburse such funds in the soullest amounts possible,
consistent with raintaining the operating officiency of the
project. He shall not, moreover, make additional disburse-
nents until he has received tangible evidence of expenditure
(receipts) for previous disbursements. Ordinary disburse-
ments should not exceed $1,000.00 and should be covered by
receipts within thirty days. Where the Staff Agent is
certain that receipts cannot be obtained for large disburse-
ments and where the expenditures. cannot be authenticated with
cortainty by the Staff Agent, an amendment to the project
should be prepared and a proposed administrative plan should
be forwarded to Headquarters for approval. Staff Agent
Martin J. COKEMIAS shall take all reasonable precautions to
insure that he maintains complete control of the financial
phases of this operation at all times and that all disburse-
ments adhere to the Confidential Funds Regulations and the
objectives authorized in this project and its amendments.
H. Reports Procedures
In granting financial aid to FUNEBRIAL's group, DTHAREAS
will request periodic reports of activities and expenditures.
These reports will be covertly checked by Mission Santiago.
I. Coordination
J. Cover
No coordination will be required beyond WHD.
As a completely overt and legitimate local organization,
with an avowed anti-DGGYPSY program, the FUNEERIAL group has
natural cover. WHD support will be covered by channeling funds
through the secure DTHABEAS mechanism. Martin J. COKENIAS is a
Staff Agent under unofficial cover in addition to which his
relationship with the FUNEBRIAL group will be carried out in
his capacity as the local representative of DTHAFEAS.
K. Security
All indigenous personnel involved in this project are
unwitting of ODYOKE interest. Funding, control, and guidance
of the FUNEBRIAL group will be handled in such a way that (DIOKE
interest will not be disclosed to indigenous or unauthorized
noxsons. Attribution for the group's activities can and will
be accepted by the group. The original source of funds will not
be known by the group.
