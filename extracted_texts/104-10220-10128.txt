IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR STATION TO WORK WITH FERNANDEZ IF HE
APPOINTED CHIEF, DIGEPOL BUT FEEL THAT SENSITIVE OPS SHOULD CONTINUE BE
HANDLED WITH CIWOODS OR UNILATERALLY. IT IS TRUE THAT FERNANDEZ COOPERATED
WITH STATION DURING HIS PREVIOUS TOUR AND APPEARED NOT BE ANTI-WOFACT BUT
HIS GENERAL GREEDINESS AND LACK OF SCRUPLES MAKE HIM AN UNSAVORY PARTHER
TO DEAL WITH AT THAT LEVEL
4. IF STATION DOES NOT HAVE ABOVE DOCUMENTATION HOS WILL FORWARD.
WILL DISCUSS FERNANDEZ WITH COS ON HIS ARRIVAL HQS.
.
WH COMMENT:
END OF MESSAGE
*COS, Minit and Erasto Fernandez Betancourt, for DC/Digepol met
to discuss colaboration between Station and Digepol. Not
clear if Fernandez to be new Chief. While F has bad rep not
clear why. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous
time no clear indications he enriched himself by accepting
bribes from left. Station would work slowly until full
assessment acquired. Asked WAVE to work closely with
AMCLEVE-15 during Fernendez stay in Miami to collect info on
latter.

*REP gave AMCLEVE-15 PRQ data. Stated JMWAVE had no
further info indicating possible security problems
other than Havana broadcast during recent LASO
conference naming A-15 as CIA agent which WAVE
claims has no bearing on ops use as DIGEPOL ·
penetration.
**A-15 stated DIGEPOL job paid about 250 dollars per
month which he claims too little to live in Caracas.
Would be willing work for DIGEPOL or Station in
Caracas if had total income approx 600 dollars
per month.

1. A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
use as a penetration of Vonozuelan General Directorate of
Police. Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because
of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi-·
ties to CIA. Thereafter, Subject was treated as a "hostile".
In the ensuing months Subjoct was described as "an extremely
valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes.
Request for POA was again requested on 7 September 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being
an "agent of a foreign power."
2. Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a very pro-U.S. attitudo. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms
dealings, etc.

operations personnel. The remaining six trainees may be
ansumed to have moderate experience more in the field of law
enforcement and police investigations rather than intelligence
operations. 201 files are available at the desk on each indivi-
dual and we will make these files available to the instructors
to give them an idea of each individuals background,
6. Trainees will be available on a full time basis. A
secure building has been obtained by the liaison services for
exclusive use by instructors during the training cycle. Train-
ing will have to be conducted in Spanish..
7. Although evaluations on all trainees are desired, the
last six individuals listed will require more attention since
our relationship with these men is new and less is known about
them. Station Caracas will provide guidance in this area. An
additional point of interest would be any individual among this
group who might have potential as an instructor.
8. Follow-up training and/or technical training will be
based on instructor and Station recommendations. At this time
we have no information on what, if any, technical skills the
trainees have.

1. With regard to previous discussions between WH/3/
Venezuela and Chief, Covert Training Branch, it is hereby
requested that two instructors be assigned on TDY status to
Station Caracas for the purpose of conducting operational train-
ing for selected members of the Directorate General of Police
(DIGEPOL) and the Central Documentation Service (SDC). Names
of the training candidates are included on a separate sheet
attached to this memorandum.
2. This training program has been initiated at the direct
request of senior Venezuelan liaison officers associated with
Station Caracas. A general description of the situation, sub-
ject matter and identification of possible problem areas has
boon forwarded to you in the form of HVCA-16550, 9 May 1969.
3. Project CIFLUTE, under which this training will be
conducted, was approved on 8 March 1963 and covers all liaison
conducted by Station Caracas with the Venezuelan security
services.
4. In this training program, we hope to attain several
objectives. First, through training selected members of
DIGEPOL and SDC we wish to present sound operational methods
and techniques which will impress the trainees and serve as a
guide to them in improving their operations. Secondly, it is
desired to improve Station Caracas' liaison relationship with
these services by presenting a highly professional training
program. Third, we hope that through this good will, the Station
will be able to develop potential unilateral agent recruits
who will become penetrations of the Venezuelan services.
5.
All of the trainee candidates (see attached list) are
members of DIGEPOL and SDC. The first four individuals listed
have extensive intelligence backgrounds and are experienced

MEMORANDUM FOR:
CI/OA
SUBJECT
AMCLEVE-15
(201-300985)
5 September 1968
1. Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela,
is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuelan General
Directorate of Police and of the Special Group, a smaller,
somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested
on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above.
On 1 February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA
request because of indications that Subject was involved in
clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that
he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL.
Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile".
The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with
Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL
and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be
levied on him. The Station was advised that they could make
spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS
co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.
2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but
demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of ANCLEVE-15's
activities. The Station stated, in effect, that assets are
often unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con-
trol and who seldom disclose the complete range of their
activities to their supervisors. The Station added that they
were interested in Subject because of his position as a "trusted
confidant" of certain highly placed Venezuelan security officials.
3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the
intelligence information and operational reports he furnished.
For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba. And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme. He has reported such
operational information as a description of the capabilities,
layout and equipment of DICEPOL telephone tap operations.
Included in this information was his report that, at least on
paper, the U.S. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He
has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with which he is associated. At the same time
the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved.
in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty
hypodermic needles". To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-
ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this
involvement with him. .
4. In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of
engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing –
his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph exam-
ination for Subject.
-
5. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM and other questions
involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's
responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-
ing Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal,
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, ...In fairness
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un-
certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile
arms supplies,
6.
"
"
Station Caracas has requested that they be allowed to
cease treating AMCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that he be pro-
cessed for POA/OA to permit more effective utilization of this
well placed penetration agent. WH Division endorses the Station's
request.

SUBJECT
: Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles 201-300985
1. It is requested that a Provisional Operation
Approval be granted for the use of subject as a penetration
agent into DIGEPOL and the Remberto UZCATEGUI Bruzual
organization. The Caracas Station has requested that
processing be expedited.
2. The Caracas Station has reviewed Subject's file
and the documents sent by Headquarters and sees nothing
that would preclude the use of Subject as a penetration
of DIGEPOL. (copy attached)
3.
Significant information in Subject's file concerns
his two brothers who are currently in Cuba and his relations
with a well known Miami gangster. One brother, Roberto
POSADA Carriles, a suspect DSE official, is the Cuban
Telephone Company supervisor for Area Norte, including
Havana City. Subject has not seen either brother since
he left Cuba in 1961. Subject has also been in contact
with a well known gangster "Lefty" Rosenthal in the Miami
area. Both JMWAVE and the FBI were aware of this contact
which was maintained at the latter's request.
