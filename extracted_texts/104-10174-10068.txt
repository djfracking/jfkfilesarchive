1. Station Mexico regrets that, to date, it has been unable
L
to obtain the Reference report from Tichborn. As Headquarters is aware
Tichborn, while brilliant and articulate, is not always dependable,
especially when it comes to routine tasks. It is true, however, that
Tichborn has been extremely busy traveling for KUBARK, and is at the moment
on another of his frequent trips.
2. In any event, Tichborn has promised to provide the report as
soon as he returns from his present trip. It will be forwarded when received
from him.

ACTION REQUIRED › REFERENCES
ACT: Cable comments on Contract ranival and amendment
1. While TICHB was at Headquartere in April, he said he needed
$1,000 per year more than the $8,000 plus expenses he receives under his
present contract. He cited the high cost of life insurance he must take
out for all his air flights, since he does not receive EUBARK rights of
survivorship as a Contract Agent. He also mentioned the rising cost of
living in Maxico, and the increased amount of time he is spending on behalf
of KUBARK, at the expense of his cover. He said that his financial situation
will soon force him to spend more time on his law practice, limiting his
availability to KUBARK.
x
2. Headquarters thinks highly of TICHBORN, and we regard him as
an excellent long time asset who might possibly be converted to carver
agent in the future, then his legal practice is less lucrative, or_be__
chooses to work almost full time for KUBARK.
3. Meanwhile, Headquarters bolioves that the fairest arrangement
for KUBARK and for TICHSORN, would be to keep him in contract status,
raising his salary. This would ensure KUBARK's continued utilisation
of his valuable services, would assure the maintenance of a strong cover,
and at the same time would give TICPBORN the incentive to work hard at
his cover and would parmit him to realize the return from his cover
efforts. If TICHBORN were converted to Career Agent status now, there
would be almost, if not total offset of his cover income.

RE: “43-3″” – (CHE Y ONE
MARKED FOR INDEONG
NO INDEXING REQUIRED
INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED
BY QUAURED HO DESK ONLY
1. Referenced dispatch was discussed with the Ambassador cn. March.
He said that in talking with Oliver G. GALBOND and others in Headquarters
in early 1962 as well as with Chief, DYVOUR support, he had expressed
great appreciation for the assistence rendered by Edward G. TEHORS.
He said that he still felt that a similar survey, made a year or so after
the first one, would be most helpful in assessing significant changes in
he cutlook of the various segments of Salvadoran society. Also discussed
uns the possible utility of an early April 1962 survey on the issues and
personalities as they night develop during the forthcoming elections,
presently scheduled for 29 April 1962. However, the Ambassador concluded
that he was, of course, aware that there are other priority needs for
TICHORE's servicos.
2. While the Station would welcome another visit by subject, it does
not appear that the need for a general survey is so pressing as it was a
year ago. It is doubted that basic conditions have changed greatly, and
the changes which have taken place have been fairly well covered in CDACID
reporting. With regard to the pre-election estimate, mentioned above,
it should be noted that there are no other parties to date in the field
except the government party, the Partido Conciliacion Nacional (PCH), and.
only the FCN has thus far put forward candidates for Fresident and Vice
President. Unless postponed, the closing date for announcements is 12 March.
In other words, at the moment it appears that the not result of the
overwhelming victory of the FCM in the elections of last December has
made the forthcoming elections a more formality.
.
.3. The Station will appreciate early advice of a second visit by
TICHBORE, if his schedule permits.

The following information was derived from a transcrip-
tion of a tape made during a meeting with Edward TICHBORN
in early June 1962 in Washington, D.C. The purpose of the
meeting was to debrief TICHBORN concerning his opinions and
experiences gained from a recent trip to El Salvador. TICHBORN
spoke from notes for the first part of his report (pp. 1-6)
and answered specific questions for the remainder.

Speaking about the priest, it is interesting to note
that there has apparently been a considerable shift in the
attitude of the Catholic Church with respect to reforms in
San Salvador. It would not be surprising to note that this
is probably a Hemisphere-wide, if not a world-wide attitude
on the part of Popo John, the 23rd. You might even kind of
correlate this to what is happening in Spain and also in
Portugual. In El Salvador, itself, the Bishop issued a lotter

reforms and for immediate changes within the social structure.

by telephone on 26 October.

factories and the reason being given, that the government now
makes it impossible for us to keej a full staff, and therefore
we are reducing. This, of course, could have very serious
effects on any ability of the government to carry through its
reforms with respect to minimum wage. Interesting
Interesting enough,

there are even people in the lower classes, who having been
confused by what it means, are very definitely against the
whole idea of minimum wage. 1.think, here again, it is a
necessity for the government either to acquire a newspaper or
to buy a considerable interest in one of them and also to do
a job of publicizing and getting the message across with
respect to the general class of laborers. However, I anticipate.
that this difficulty--that the people, with the economic power,
are in a good position to at least partially sabotage this
particular reform by the simple expedient of just laying people
off and blaming it on the government. Let's face it, with
respect to political reform in Latin America, the thing that
is most meaningful to people is not political liberty, but
"bread in the belly." We have got to constantly bear in mind
that when we, with our own criteria of political liberties here
in the United States, go into Latin America we have got to
realize that sometimes the right to vote and the right to express
our views is a meaningless concept to a peasant who really is
worried about whether he gets one tortilla or two tortilias;
it's the bread that is the biggest political factor in any part
of Latin America. In this respect, it is interesting to note
that whereas the last time I was in El Salvador there was
lot of talk about Fidel Castro that was just kind of spontaneous
and extemporaneous on the part of some several hundred people
that I talked to. This time I also went through many of the
low-income barrios out in the countryside and talked to a great
number of people, and a great number of them kept mentioning.
Martinez who was the president for about 10 to 12 years back,
1934 to 45, Many of them, particularly, the older people
spoke rather nostalgically about the times of Martinez when
there wore jobs and when the prices were low and when even
though the wages were low, you could buy a full meal and could
get comparatively comfortable housing. Of course, it is
known that Martinez is one of the worst tyrants that they have
had there; and for a long time the thing they remember is not
the repressive measures that he took, not the number of people'
that were slaughtered under his orders. The thing that is
remembered now mostly is the fact that there were more jobs,
that the prices were low, etc. We've got to constantly bear

the less wealthy people in El Salvador have looked askanco
at the Alliance for Fropress. I think you will remember that.
in my last report I predicted that we would have problems
with respect to many reforms if they were to be the sine qua
con of aid from the United States.

With respect to the Church, I think it might be a good
idea to give some very detailed study as to how we can exploit
to the best possible extent, the apparent change within the
Church not only in EF Salvador but all over Latin America.
think that it might be a thing that wo should sit around or
someone sit around for a considerable time trying to analyze
all the ins and outs, and how we can fit this into the whole
program of action in Latin America.

the hierarchy. I think it's in the upper structure, Spaniards
and Italians; but in the lower structures most of the people
are from El Salvador and some from Guatemala and that their

natural inclination would be to go with the people.
I mentioned in my earlier report that very frequently the
priests in their early Massos (say at 5:00, 6:00 or 7:00 a.s.

would change the attitudes of their sermons because of the
different economic complex of the people attending church.
It's interesting to note that the Bishop's letter that was
issued with respect to reforms got a very angry reaction from
the 14.
Now one of the things that I note with respect to the
general political atmosphere in San Salvador is that there
seems to be a considerable confusion among the people with

the minimum salary. It is one of the cornerstones of reform
by the present ruling JUNTA, and it will be carried through by
President-elect RIVERA. As of right now, there seems to be a
very calculated campaign on the part of business and on the
part of financiers to confuse the people, and they have done
a good job of it. I reöember talking to many people asking
then candidly, "what is this minimum salary all about?" Many
of them told me the government has decided that they can be paid s
no more. In other words, they have really con-
verted it into an idea that this is maximum salary.

considerable snide criticism by the press; by a lot of the
population that this was a poor example of Alliance for
Progress spending. It was a small school; it was within the
desired $30,000 budget, but I am thinking that west of the
people in El Salvador having talked about 7,500,000 colones,
were expecting palaces to be built. Suddenly you have a very
small school, and it was being criticized by the press; by the
people at large. The next day, quite fortunately, the Minister
of Education very cbly took this issue and quieted it by
saying: “We
"We said we are going to build schools, not palaces."
But I think that even this criticism could have been avoided
had we announced rather that the expenditure of 3 million.
dollars or 7,500,000 colones, had we just announced that the
Alliance for Progress, in cooperation with the El Salvador
government, was going to build 100 small schools and say so
without any more dressing it up, not even mention the amount
of money that was going to be spent in total because then no
one could expect more than a small school. Also I think it
would have been better to have the first schools outside El
Salvador, possibly in a little town like Santa Techla or one
of the other neighboring towns; and then build the school
right next to the old school so that there would be a marked
contrast in every way. You could see it immediately. Certainly
there is always, land available near all the old schools, and
Just destroy the old school when you've built the new one; and
then really to do a public relations job, get statements from
the teachers, from the students, and, perhaps, have the oldest
school teacher in the neighborhood lay the cornerstone to the
school. Really do a public relations job of it on a very
personal basis rather than trying to stagger people with huge
sums of money. This is what I mean by talking in huge figures
when you can do a better job and arouse less expectation. When
you have few expectations, almost anything is better; so I
think if we talk little and act big, we're going to be much
better off in the long run.
I think also a very highly over-publicized group is the
Peace Corps. Here again, I think we're setting ourselves up
for some possible difficulty. All of this publicizing is
very good for consumption here in the United States; but in
the world we're living in now, the same kind of propaganda
gets outside the United States, Already there are all kinds
of jokes about the Peace Corps. Its done a terrific job of
publicizing here in this country. They get great coverage in

'
in mind that the things that are mostly meaningful to these
groups of people is whether they are working, the price
structure, and just the general bare economic needs that are
met by any government. I want to talk now for 3 moment about
the Alianza para Progresso and some of my impressions about
how it's doing, not only in El Salvador, but in Guatemala and
some of the other countries that i observed. One of the most
immediate impressions that I get is during the last few months
is that the Alianza para Progresse has been terribly over
publicized. I think we made a serious mistake in arousing
expectations in Latin America that may not be met. As a
matter of fact, I know from talking with many of the people
there that the expectations they have simply are not within
the reckoning of what the United States has planned. I even
think it's unfortunate if we have a slogan, that the Alianza
para Progresso as a slogan is open to serious attacks both
humorously and satirically. As a matter of fact, already
many people even our friends are beginning to use the slogan
by way of criticism. I have in mind recently, that the foreign
minister of Honduras was in Mexico and in a public statement
said, "we have a lot of alliance but no progress." And of.
course in the schools in El Salvador, there are all kinds of
turnings about twisting the words around by way of criticism.
-
'
.
'
'
What I mean by over publicizing and sloganizing is the
fact that almost all over Latin America, the newspapers are
reporting an outpouring of millions and millions of dollars,
and as you might expect they convert the figures into pesos,
or other local currency whatever you happen to be, so that
there is an announcement saying that the Alianza para Progresso
has allocated 10 million dollars and then they convert that
into 120 million pesos; it sounds like an awful lot of money.
Immediately people have grandioso ideas about what is going
to be done with all this money when in effect it is only a
request for that kind of money that has been done. We have.
basically speaking, still some problems among Congress as to
how much money is going to be allocated. Let me give you a
specific case about what I feel is an over publicizing of
the Alliance's program.
In El Salvador there was an announce-
ment in the papers that three million dollars had been silo-
cated by the United States Government for the building of
schools. Now, 3 million dollars converted into local currency
is something like seven and half million colones. That's a
big sum of money down there and, of course, it got tremendous
play in all the newspapers. Well it turned out, what the
Alliance had in mind, along with the Junta, was to build ore
hundred small schools. This would be 100 schools worth
around $30,000 a piece. Well, one of the model schools, right
now, is in the process of constructions in one of the neigh-
borhoods in El Salvador. While I was there, there was

all the big picture magazines. In time there's going to be
n musical comedy about the Peace Corps. All this is great
stuff as far as the United States is concerned, but I'm
afraid it is going to create serious problems abroad. Actually
the actual observable benefit of the Peace Corps in the
various areas will be very minimal when you consider, for
example, they have about 29 people that will be in the Peace
Corp in San Salvador. They're not going to be able to make
much of a dent in separate communities, because they are
separated. As I understand it, from talking to the manager
of the Peace Corps for the Contral Americon area; most of
these kids will be alone in the villages they are going to,
and whatever they do is not going to be very observable as
far as the general population is concerned. Unfortunately,
one of the things that we haven't yet learned in our thinking
about these under-developed countries is the fact that we do
such naive things as this: there is an elderly lady about 63
years of age that has been assigned to one of the small
villages in southern El Salvador and her expertise is home.

villages and if you have seen that they subsist,
and I say
subsist, merely on a
merely on 'a small supply of beans and maybe one or
two tortillas; and the difference between the supply of one
or two tortillas is a very meaningful one. When you start
talking about balancing the diet and varying the diet and
having a home economics expert to teach them this, this gets
pretty ironic. This is precisely the thing that could
easily be open to criticism and easily open to satire.
Imagine if I were someone in a position of Dr. Jose Rodriguez
RUIZ, who was a very left leaning Dean of the School of
Economics in El Salvador--if I really wanted to cede on one
issue and ridicule it, I would talk about this person who was
an expert on home economics; balanced dieting; and how many
vegetables you should have; what variety of vegetables, how
much cottage cheese you should have; and the whole thing in the
balanced diet. I could murder this whole thing in very short
time and make it very ridiculous.

I think these are things that, we've got to think about.
We've got to think about all the possible weaknesses, how this
thing can be turned around. I know that in the United States,
I know that in the hometown of this woman (she's from Nebraska)
it sounds absolutely marvelous and this home economics expert
is going down to a little Latin American country and tell them
all about home economics, but from the point of view of the
Latin American it's sheer irony and it's susceptible to attack.

with respect to your question about the influence
of the Church with the campesinos in other parts of the
community; I think that it's probably true all over
Latin America that the Church has great influence on the
thinking of the population. It's interesting to note
that in San Salvador and Mexico the real church goers
are the women and not the men, but the men are very certain
that their wives go to church so that they're their.
surrogates and that they take their children along with
ther. Although they are not great church goers, I think
they are Catholics and are greatly influenced by the priests.

interested in this when 1 talked to various people, including
cab drivers and boys that shine your shoes, people working:
in the markets, and some of the campesinos. There is an
awareness, certainly in the city, that Castro is having his
difficulties. One of the things that is interesting and,
of course, I think this may be referable to their Church
influence, is that the word Communism per se still has a
serious effect on people. I think it's one of the things
they talk about--social reform, etc., etc., but, the tag
Communism is still a very harsh tag in the Latin American-
mind. I think this is one of the serious errors Castro
made from his point of view was to declare himself a
Communist and a Marxist-Leninist because many people that
might have gone along with him at that moment got frightened
off. There is an awareness that he is having troubles and
that the Revolution hasn't gone along on the way it has.
Also there was a lot of talk among a certain group of
people tha: I talked with--these were some workers from a
textile mill, that there had been an awful lot of killing
that was done by Castro. Apparently, there had been
pictures of a lot of executions in some of the Latin American.
newspapers; and this has had an effect on them.
:
with respect to the government prosecuting anyone for
violation of the minimum wage law: As far as I understand,
it's still in its infancy. I think the belief of the
government is that if they start to impose any violations
this might have a serious effect in getting the program
across: But in this respect, I'd like to mention the
seventh day wage that was passed about a year ago when I

recall that this was accepting with the Bible that if
anyone worked for six days (this was referable to the
campesines) he was entitled to the seventh day pay. I was
worried at the time and mentioned my worries to Choretic
(Phonetic) and also the Minister of Economics who was at
breakfast with us at that time, that one of the possible
dangers of any reform is that it is not carried through
intelligently and forcibly.
forcibly. It is better not to have a
reform, not to announce a new idea, not to arouse expecta
tions, if there is going to be violation of those
expectations. At that time it was contemplated that the
army would administer the program of the seventh day pay.
Apparently they have changed their mind on that and have a
civilian group that is administering the program; there
has been no real scandal with respect to violations of
this. I was a little fearful that a local army guy would
get paid off by some of the big plantation owners and thus
be permitted to do all kinds of violations. Apparently
this has not happened, and they've been pretty effective
in the administration.
-
My big objection at that time was that again the
minimum salary thing was not properly publicized. They
could have had all kinds of radio and television programs,
intorviews with the campesinos, and asked them what they
felt about this and actually doing that kind of public
relations job which they did not do. I think this is true
with all these reforms. I think that they have got to be
brought to the people where you get reaction from the
people as to the extent of the change, any reform has on their
personal existence. This again is a matter of attitude;
a matter of technique in public relations.
Well, it is certainly true that there has been a
considerable amount of publicity about the Alianza para
Progresso. I was not aware that it was this specific group
that was pushing the program of publication. However,
harking back to a previous statement, I think that there is
a serious possibility that over publicizing of the Alianza
will cause more trouble than we can at present anticipate.
As a matter of fact some of the problems are already
beginning to arise. I had a long talk with Ambassador
Williams on this, and I think we both agreed that we ought
to soft pedal much of the talk about the Alianza; and
certainly to stay away from these enormous figures of
millions of dollars. As far as the people in Latin America

ordinary Madison Avenue flock. I think it ought to be a
person who has had some experience dealing with the Latin
American temperament because any program has to arise out
of the psyche of the people that are being dealt with.
Incidentally, I did see some of the pictures and some
of the coverage that was given Rivera during his election
campaign, and whoever handled that, I think, was very
effective; and I've suggested to the Ambassador that he
might suggest that the same people or person be retained
to accompany Rivera into his position as prosident.
.
I think one of the key persons with respect to the
left in B Galvador is the Dean of the School of Economics
whose name is Jose Rodriguez Ruiz. He is also the son of
the president of the University. Now first a word about
the young son--he gave a lecture on Marxism one of the nights
I was there, and I went to the lecture. The hall was i
filled to capacity; there were people standing in the
doorways, and I would estimate there were 400 or 500 people
there. It was a rather interesting experience because
from what I heard. I had been led to believe that it would
be kind of a rabble rouser and that he would try to instigate
the people into action. Actually what I saw was--
was--personally"
It was very moving, really: He has kind of the manner of
a priest. His voice tends to tremble at first; but as he
got more involved, he lost the tremor in his voice and
sounded more like a very intense profossor. The interesting
thing was when he spoke about the United States, it was
more in symbolic torms; there was nothing of real harsh
personal rancor either in his voico, his manner, or in what
he was actually saying; but it was almost as if he were
referring to an abstraction of the United States. 110

I didn't take off on the Ambassador personally. He just talked
about American ambassadors and he was bitter, less inclined
to be sarcastic than merely hitter. He is a very effective
human being. I note as I sat there, he moved the audience
that he had, emotionally. I could sec one of them kind
of swallowing and the tears running down eyes of the girl
to the left of me. There was really no attempt to rabble
rouse as such, there was no attempt to get the people out li
the streets as it were. Toward the end he made a very
interesting statement--he said: "We know that there are
changes necessary, we know that we have got to free ourselves
of the imperialist yoke of the United States, and we know
that these changes have got to come through us; no one is
going to help us but ourselves," but he says in making these

changes come about, let us be careful that we do not ruin
and that we do not set back our program by taking
precipitous action, without plan. Suddenly, it came almost
as a jarring note, he said--well perhaps we're not ready
to act yet, but whatever we do, we've got to do it
reasonably so that we don't lose the revolution as such.
I don't know whether he had eference to the fact that
maybe in Cuba the revolution did not work because certainly
he was very pro Castro. I think that there was a kind of
note of wariness in his talk, and it is interesting.
.
I suggested to the ambassador that it might be a good
idea for him to set up a meeting with Guillermo Moscoso
with the older Jose Napoleon Rodriguez Ruiz who was the
(rector) of the University, and possibly ask this younger
follow, the Dean of the School of Economics to come along
and try in effect to have Moscoso say, "Look, I know you
probably disagree with a lot that we're doing and you are
very skeptical about the Alianza para Progresso; you're
very skoptical about the United States per sc. Maybe in
many senses you're right, maybe in the past you had reason
to feel that there has been imperialism, but we want to
indicate to you that we have a change of attitude and just
give us a chance and I need your counsel and you're un
economist and I want to know. I realize that we may disagree,
but I wanted to meet you anyway." I think that there is
a possibility that a person in his frame of mind and I say
this is only a ressibility and it may be very minimal as
a possibility; but there is a chance that we may be able to
recreate some kind of the with him so that he is not as
"bitter and as antagonistic.. I do not think, at least from
hearing that lecture, that evening that he is entirely
beyond the pale; and bear in mind that there were no
Americans, there was no one in the audience (that I could
detect at least) who were not from El Salvador itself.
realize that there may be various opinions with respect to
this, but I did suggest it to the ambassador. He thought
it might be a good idea and he may very well do that.

Apparently the father, Jose Rodriguez Ruiz, Sr.
(Napoleon), is a person who is approachable. No is not as
far to the left as his son. He is a liberal, but he is
not considered a Communist. There is, I understand, some-
thing in the Embassy about him, but apparently it has been
checked out and it is felt that he is not a Communist. In
any event, there has been an invitation extended to him to
come to the United States. I think, as a matter of fact,
that with many of theso poople that if they were to come to

Japanese of Central America because they're the tough
workers. Also, there is a considerable amount of Salvador-
anian capital that is in various industries throughout
Central America which is an interesting thing to me. The
comparison to the Japanese seems to be very appropriate
in this situation.
"
I think that the real focus of trouble, if there is
going to be any, would be either the Labor unions or I
think more particularly in the University. My feelings
about Central America, generally, is that your revolutions
do not come from the campesinos or they do not even come
from the lower classes. They generally are the middle-
class groups or the low-middle-class groups. I think in-
Havana, for example, Batista was overthrown, not by the
campesinos but by the middle classes; and then the
campesinos came in afterwards because there was very little
doing outside of lavana even in the Sierra Madres, there
was only Castro with a small group of people. When Batista
really fell is when he had so damn much trouble inside of
Havana. He fled and left because he was having problems of
sabotage in lavana itself and not because Castro was
seriously threatening him from the Sierra Madres, for he
had actually withdrown about a month before, if you recall.
As a
I think with respect to the situation in Santo Domingo,
here again Union Civica Nacional was made up by the intel-
lectuals and by the middle classes and not by the campesinos.
As a matter of fact, Trujillo has tremendous support and,
adulation among many of the campesinos and his real basic
political strength was from the low economic groups.
matter of fact the Secret Police was recruited from the
lower barrios where he had the toughest little juvenile
delinquents you could imagine as a Secret Police, and this ·
was a real force. The interesting thing is that right
after Trujillo died, the first big mass meeting that his
son had was in the poorest barrio in Santo Domingo because
he knew that's where Trujillo still had basic strength..
I think the same thing is true in San Salvador. I
don't think it will be the campesinos, that will give you
the trouble; it will be the students. With respect to the
student situation, I think they might borrow leaf from PRI's
book in dealing with the students. I think the government
ought to make a very strong attempt to form a liaison
with the universitites and whenever they get some apt pupils
give them a job in the government, to bring them into
the various positions within the government and the same
thing with professors, to have them as economic advisors

I think one of the things that might be helpful with respect
to the situation in the universities is to try and catch
some of these students in the high school level.
to the ambassador, a plan that would be secething, comparable
I suggested
to the Rotary Club's scholarships that are given in
Colorado. 1 remember that when I was going through high
school, I was given $10 a month by the Rotary Club and I
was given a sponsor. I used to meet him once a month and
we'd have lunch. I remember this very strongly because it
was meaningful to me to have this kind of relationship.
I think that many of the businessmen in San Salvador could
get the bright young guys in the high schools who are
actually the guys who become the effective leaders in the
college. Get them on the high school level and become
friends with then. Once they have gotten to know some of
the people who are supposed to be the ogres that they later
talk about, and have had some actual financial help from
them; they are more apt to be approachable. At least the
person who has been their sponsor during the time in high
school can approach them. I think we have got to start
working on this at a stage before they get to the university.
Your lenders can be spotted, the people who are going to
be your most effective in colleges can be spotted in the
high schools. I think that is the time to start bringing
some of the people in close contact with the government, also
the business community. I talked to the ambassador about
this and he said he felt it was a good ides and was going to
talk to some of the people about it. I think, bearing

in mind, that the universities are really power seats in
many of the Latin American countries. We have got them
to accept this as a starting point and then work with this
and find out what are the elements that produce the
Teaders and when do the leaders first become observable
and try to catch them at the earliest possible time.
think it would ameliorate much of the situation with
respect to the students. The other thing (still on the
university thing) I've observed in places that I have
been is that the newspapers in these universities really
are not newspapers. I think the leftist newspapers are
really truly ineffective as far as appealing to the middle
span. The same thing with the rightist, you have either
the right or the left. The Catholics, generally speaking,
have newspapers that are more costly; and they are very
dogmatic to the right. Then you have the leftist students
who have poorly printed or poorly mimeographed newspapers
to the left. I suspect that the vast number of students
who are in the middle never have any newspapers and here,

the changes aren't forthcoming, they are going to be very a

going to mean to you?" He said, "I understand they are
going to give me a new house." Someone standing close to
him said, "what do you mean--they're going to give you a
house," and they actually had an argument about the thing.
The man selling the newspapers insisting that's what they
were going to do--build him a new house, etc. The other
man saying that's all propaganda, it's all demagogy; they
say this all the time and nothing is going to occur. The
chances are very strong that this man will not get into
a house. The chances are almost equally strong that he
won't even get an apartment because you cannot possibly
meet the housing shortage in such a place in San Salvador,
where I doubt more than 10% of the people have adequate
hygienic dwellings. So here again, well at least, this
newspaper vendor has gotten on enormously over bloated
notion about what we're going to do. It may be that in his
particular case, he is more aware of the Allanza and more
aware of the willfon dollars because he is selling news-
papers and magazines and he is reading about it all the
time. Here again I think is one of the dangers with
respect to the publicity about the Alianza.

I think I mentioned in my report about a year ago it
might be a good idea to get some experts in public relations,
and that they might be recruited from such places as Moxice
and Puerto Rico where you have people who have worked with
either government agencies, with some of our embassies, or
with some of the public relations firms such as General
Rubicam & Noble Advertising and other very widely-known
public relations groups in Latin America. I think it.
might be a good idea for the government to have someone
counseling him and particularly on any wide shifts of policy
on how to present it to the public. I think it would be
an enormously effective way in prosenting the programs of
the government, and it would be a good investment they could
make at this point. And I don't just sean getting the

the United States and given some kind of chance to
observe the United States first hand, they would be less
bitter about us. I think that they have adopted some very
dogmatic notions about us; they believe some of what they
see in the movies; kinds of snatches of newsreels about
the situation in the South. Actually, they have a very
distorted notion, and some of it is a very sincere
distorted notion. They really believe some of the things
they've heard. I think if they would see us first hand

about a thing, but it's another thing when you actually go
there and observe some of the tyrannical atmosphere. I think
the same thing is true on the reverse that you can disenchant
people by sending them to Pussia or to Cuba or behind the Iron
Curtain. Just as sometimes you can rub away some of the
malinpressions, erroneous impressions by sending people to
the United States and having them live on a campus for
example, such as Cambridge, Michigan, or any such place where
they can see first hand that we're not the oppressors that
they have been led to believe for a long time. Much of this
is really lack of exposure.
.
During the time that I was in El Salvador about 10 days
ago, there arose a serious problem of the departation of
Salvadoranians from Honduras; and it was all over the news-
papers, and very strong statements were issued both in the
editorials and by people over the radio about chasing out
some of the Salvadoranians that had been working in Honduras
for a long time. Apparently there has been a rapproachment;
there were meetings between the foreign ministers and I
think the problem may be resolved.
It's interesting to note that El Salvador is the most
heavily populated country of Central America.. I think they
have a population of about 120 per square mile, whereas
Honduras and Nicaragua have something like 15 or 17 per square
mile. Therefore, you have a very definite problem of

act. I saw a newspaper in 11 Salveder called the Daily
News; it's an American newspaper. I don't know who is
the editor of it, but it is really truly a newspaper and
it's a good job. It is well edited; it is a newsy
periodical and I think it could be used as 3 format for
many of the newspapers in some of these Central American
universitics. In Mexico I think you would have to have
a printed newspaper because there are more resources,
but a lot can be done with mimeographed newspapers if
they are made into newspapers. My suggestion would be
that you have actual news, gossip columns in these
newspapers about who is going with whom and all that sort
of stuff, have student programs, have actual news about
lectures that are given; and make it about two-thirds.
news and about only one-third editorial. Once you get
people in as readers then they will read some of your
editorial comment. Also It can become the organ to the
middle because none of the middle groups in any of the
universities I have ever seen have a newspaper that
speaks for them. I think, for example, and I mentioned.
this to Dave Phillips and Bill Carlson in Mexico, that
there isn't an effective student newspaper at the
University of Mexico. This is a place where you have
83,000 students and this is the growing middle class,
these are the spokesmen. They don't have a newspaper,
and I think it might be a good idea, for example, to
have some kind of symposium in El Salvador where you
invite prospective editors of student newspapers to
study the techniques of typography; to study the techniques
of what makes a newspaper readable. Actually La Quincena
that is published in Mexico, for example, is obviously
a political tract. There isn't one single article that
appears that doesn't have a political pitch, a very
strong anti-leftist pitch. Frankly, it is a boring
newspaper and typographically it looks very presentable;
it's an expensive project. Interesting enough in the
third issue of it they had a big editorial page saying
we are not supported by the American Embassy. We have.
gathered our own funds, etc. Well, "Ne thinkest thou
protesteth too loudly," is certainly true in that situation.
As I understand it we are not really sponsoring the
newspaper, but it has the look of it. None of these
newspapers have any ads or anything of this nature.
think that when you don't have any ads or you don't have

CONTACT REPORT
MEMORANDUM: of Contact and Conversation
Date 5 June 1962
SUBJECT
Henry Lopo8

}
1. Messor's Dick Ouderkirk and Forter Qoss contacted Subject at the
Shoreham Hotel in room 506. M on 5 June to debrief him on his current travel
in El Salvador. Subject will be in Washington until Thursday, 7 June. At
de-
the Subject's request a further briefing will take place Wednesday, 6 June
at 0930 hours with the benefit of a tape recorder. Subject believed that
there was sufficient material to warrant a detailed question and answer type
discussion and stated that he preferred this form reporting.
2. During the course of luncheon, at which the majority of the meeting.
was conducted, the following items of interest were brought out in conversath.
Most topics were discussed in generalities in view of the arranged formal
briefing scheduled for the following morning with a recorder.
.
a) Subject feels that there is a chance for real stability in the Rivera
government with the proper support from the US Government.
b) Subjoot stated that a slight disparity existed in the direction being
taken between the State Dept (Ambassador) on the one hand and the COS on
the other. Specifically, Subject believed that COS was supporting elements
too far to the right.
a) The military is apparently a true "third force" and not aligned with
the families, but broken up into conservative senior officers and an
emerging more liberal junior-officer corps. Subject believed that there may
be a possibility of getting to the campesinos through the liberal element
of the military, but not to the families.
d) 1 families are becoming isolated and have neither the full support
of the church, the military, or the government. The attitude toward the
minimum wage rate of the Rivera government seems to be "pay one half as many
twice as much. ". The cooperation of the 14 families is needed for the econost

development of the country, but as of now they are all
the way Right. As for
the minimum wage concept, the campesinoa apparently do not grasp it a
meaning.

6) The church is not so far Right that it supports the U. families and
it is tending more towards the relative left.
.f) The Alliance for Progress has been badly handled, as have some of
1
the activities of the Peace Corps. Subject believes that too much has been
promised through propaganda already without corresponding results. He believes
the danger of the program falling into ridicule is great if the US continue
to promise only, or continues its badly managab pubbuty by
program.
g) Discussion of the student University papers yielded Subject's opinion
that they are largely ineffective because they deal in polemics rather
than fact and news itemia, and DKK/R/XXXXXX because the ones
with too good format are obviously US puppets.
h) Less conversation about Fidel Castro is evident in public, although
the Fidel movement is still to be reckoned with. Recently there has been a
imulated by the Right
resurgence of the Martinez - dictator of the 10's - good old days when
^
everybody had a job this sentiment was ever expressed by some campesinos.
3. Subject mentioned that he had both high and low level contacts in
-
El Salvador and had managed to get a reading of public opinion and private
belief. Apparently it is a mistake for Rivera to delay the inauguration
so long after the election, at which time a favorable image of the Col
was successfully kept before the public, but which is now wearing off.
4. Subject proposed the following courses of action in certain fields
that were discussed in more depth.
c) (radio is the best means of communication with the campesinos. Subjed
was impressed with the results of the operation run by the Catholic priest
in Bolivia i using pre-beamed radios. He considers that a similar operation

Mr.
Edward C. Tichboro
Dear Mr.
Tichboro
Reference is made to your current contract with the United States
Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.
Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.
As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:
Effective December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly.
deducted by this organisation from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an
employee-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor.
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organisation and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organisation. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your
covert deductions returned.
All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force
and effect.

re
1. The Station, after reference incident, felt more strongly
than ever that it really did not have a complete assessment of
TICHBORN in the sense of what is his real ideological viewpoint.
This is not to say that the Station was overly concerned that
TICHBQRN was flirting with the opposition. As a result of the
events described below, the Station-feels it has a reasonably
clear idea on these points now.
2. On 15 May, being a Saturday and two days prior to
TICHBORN entering a Mexican hospital for a long-delayed and
somewhat apprehensive (on his part) hernia operation, TICHCORN
was in an unusually loquacious mood for a luncheon engagement
with the Station case officer. He showed little opposition to
three good Manhattans and, for the first time, the Station case
officer felt he was seeing clearly TICHBCRN "the person" and
not TICHBORN "the lawyer". In other words, there was no protective
veneer involved in the rather long luncheon discussion which
followed. The issue which brought forth the entire discussion
was reaction of the Mexican intellectual to the Dominican Republic
situation. In the process, TICHBORN brought out very sincerely,
passionately, and clearly the following points:
-
a. When he was a trial lawyer in California for five
years, his real Inclinations were what he termed "leftist". He
harbored a number of "reservations" about the way that things
were or were not happening in the U.S. under the U.S..system.
These were private thoughts and reservations and did not translate

themselves into action, but nonetheless points of real concern
to him.
Then, he came to Mexico for a period to get "that" novel
and writing off his chest: dering. that period, he saw the
Mexican system and some of the Latin American Systems.
juncture, he became very much aware of the fact that it was the
At that.
"system" that counted, in spite of whatever Imperfections existed,
and that there "was, and is, nothing that can anywhere nearly
approach the U.S. system". As he said, "Sure, there are a lot
of things wrong, because of decisions made by human beings who
are fallible and have their own interests to look after, but
there is so much good and so many compensations on the plus side
of the system and the way it works, you can afford to recognize
the wrongs and work them out within the system". He said that
this was so obvious from abroad that he just wondered why he
ever had worried about Incidents and didn't realize that it
was the "system" that mattered.
b. He told about some of the discussions he had had with
leftist Mexican intellectuals on these points such as, "Is the
Soviet system capable of producing and absorbing such pictures
as 'Dr. Strangelove! or having a John Steinbeck write a 'Grapes
of Wrath' and run off with all prizes in the writing and motion
picture field? Can you even approximate that in Mexico? Witness
the furore over 'The Children of Sanchez' here while the 'Grapes
of Wrath' was every bit as harsh with respect to similar
circumstances in the U.S. and won everything." On and on. in
so many words, our system thrives on "self-criticism", and
there are things to criticize, but what other system in this world
is not only permissive of that, but thrives on it. And so on.
He has no doubts about any governmental/social/political/economic
system in any combination being able to even approach it.
3. The foregoing is a very brief synopsis of a rambling and.
long philosophic discussion on these points in which TICHBORN
concluded his statement and, even, tirade (his Latin heritage
had gotten the better of him at that point) with the statement
that "My philosophy on this point, and my present sentiments,
have been forged in the fire of thinking as a leftist critic
and having come to see and understand a great deal; and they,
can't tell me a damn thing about what is the best system nor on
the basis of their present circumstances in their own countries
have they any right or basis for criticizing the U.S. and its
actions. Nothing is perfrect, and I can't defend it as being
perfect, but for every imperfection they try to show me in the
U.S. and what it has or has not done, I can show them hundreds
in their country and any other one they try to hold up as a model."
4. In so many words, at least the Station case officer at
the present time is satisfied in his own mind that TICHSORN was
speaking sincerely during this discussion and there is no question
in the Station's mind about where TICHBORN stands ideologically
even though he may be considered "left of center."
.
5. Since this issue seems to hover constantly in the back-
ground with TICHBORN insofar as KUBARK is concerned, the Station
felt it would be a good idea to register the foregoing incident
and appraisal with Headquarters.

1. The delay in answering reference should not be construed as lack.
of desire or intent, on the part of TIEKAN or the Chief of Station,
that the case be submitted to the Board of Review for Shortages and Losses.
for consideration, but rather as an administrative delay of getting the facts,
people, papers, etc., together and in one place for submission.
2. Attached is a statement prepared by TICHBORN regarding the loss
The
of funds and containing the pertinent circunstances of the case.
sub-narasaph mumberings are in accordance with, and relating to, the
requirements of paracraph 3, a of FR 34-250. The information requested
in sub-paragraphs numbered & through 12 is answered jointly by Stewart
R. FATAKER and Jerome H. BALSIS who were assigned to investigate the matter
by the reporting official.
3. PATAKER and BALSIS talked with TICHECK!, at different times,
regarding the shortage of funds and the impenings as related to them
were substantially the same as outlined in TICHORN's statement. Since
there is no other way to verify the facts and TICHISCRN has proven himself
to té truthful and forthright in his dealings with the Station his
staterent regarding the loss of fards is accepted as fact.
4. Since TICHEON is authorized travel expense "on actual,
reasonable, and necessary expense basis" it does not seen sensible for
him to have reported the loss of funds in other than the way he says
actually happened.

Forwarded herewith is the referenced amendment
Edward G. TICHBORN's contract which provides for a one year
extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation
increase from $9,000 to $12,000.
2.
During Subject's recent TDY in Washington it was
made clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension
of his contract was on the basis that TICHBORN continue to.
devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity. In view of
the fact that Subject is currently handling only one intellectual
project for the Station, please explain to him that in the event
that his work load reverts to the 50 to 65% level, he cannot
expect to continue to receive the present amount of compensation.
During Subject's talks at Headquarters, it appeared that
TICHBORN understands this most clearly. As a contract agent,
he is renumerated on the basis of services rendered, In return
for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incomo
he might receive from his private business activities. Obviously
it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time
assignments in other WH countries levied on TICHBORN, that the
Station will be able to continue to utilize Subject's services
at the high level of activity which will justify his current
compensation.

1.
_
Referenced dispatch has caused TICHBORN and the Station to become aware
of some new problems with the Maxican banking system. As Headquarters may
not be aware, TICHBORN has a dollar account with a Mexico City bank for his
personal affairs. Maxican banks do gol return cancelled checks to the
depositor, but only provide statements. TICHBORN requested his bank to
provide him with his cancelled check (on a loan basis) so that copies could
be made of it. It developed over a process of several weeks that the bank
could not locate this chock nor had it been run through TICHBORN's account.
Since ample time had expired (it was mailed in June 1964), the bank checked..
all accounts of persons with TICHBORN's last name on the theory that it
might have been run through someone else's account (not an unusual occurrence
here). It had not that the bank could discover.
2. As a result, TICHBORN is stopping payment on the check with the bank,
writing the office with which he filed his overt income tax, advising that
office of the circumstances, and requesting soma word back whether or not,
in fact, that office received and cashed the check. If the check van
received, TICHBORN will provide the Station with a copy of the letter 9Ô
stating and remove the "stop payment" order on the check. If the check was
not received (mail is another problem), then TICHBORN will send another chack
and a copy of the interchange of correspondence on the matter with the bank
and the income tax authorities will be provided Headquarters. It is hoped
this will be satisfactory.
3. The only reason the Station is providing all the gruesome details on the
foregoing is so that leadquarters will have some understanding of the Mexican
banking problems should questions of this nature arise again.

1. Please query Jerome H. BISTS in regard to the location of the
1964 overt and covert tax return and payment check in the amount of
$1774.00 of Reward G. TICHBORN and advise.
2. TICHPORN states that he passed the only two copies of each return ant
the check to FALSIS on 29 April 1965, Arther: stating that BAISIS told him he
would completely audit both returns to assure their accuracy in resand to
mathematical computations and application of tax liability. BALSIS was to
return a copy of the overt return for TICHEORN's retention.
3. A thorough search of Station files failed to uncover the subject
taz returns and check or any transmittal record of returns or payment.
4. Since TICHBOR: will be extremely hard pressed to duplicate the returns
without a copy of the overt return, the location of the returns is very important.

Dear Fr.. Thomes:
'
Due to increased demands upon my time from other clients,
I find it necessary to relinguish my duties as legal counsel
for the IILR here in Mexico, and I do so with great reluctance.
One of my heretofore-lesser clients has recently expanded his
activities in certain real estate developments in Guadalajara
and Fuerto Vallarta, thereby necessitating & frequent absence
from Mexico City. Then, too, I had underestimated the emount.
of time and effort required to satisfactorily attend the various
legal and administrative matters confronting CEDS.
Should you
th
so desire, I could recommend other legal counsel; but I em
inclined to feel that the Centro's principal problems would be
of an administrative nature rather than a legal one.
As for my legal fees to date, I am submitting a bill for
$650.00 U.S. Cr. This represents a total of 65 hours at the
rate of $10.00 per hour. My regular fees amount to $20.00 per
hour, but, in keeping with my own political affinity for labor
causes, I have reduced them to the lesser figure..
May I thank you again for your confidence and good will in
heving chosen me Es legal counsel for your organization's activities
ir. Mexico. I shall be happy to give you a personal report of my
observations on my next trip to New York.
Sincerely yours,
Henry P. Lopez

Edward G. TICHBORN Cover and Working Papers.
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES .
REFERENCE:
:
HMMA-24456 dated 8 Oct 64.
1. As Headquarters is aware, Edward G. TICHBORN is in Mexico on a tourist
visa and with a number of "associations" (i.e., law firm in PBPPIME, TV
and movie contacts in Mexico) which have sufficed to provide satisfactory
superficial cover for his presence and activities here up to this time.
However, he has been here long enough now and made enough trips to other
Latin American countries where a continuation of this tourist status and
present cover arrangements should be changed for something more substantial.
All of this became apparent when he began to try to obtain his working
papers. TICHBORN's profession, of course, is that of a lawyer, but he
_cannot practice this profession in Mexico, under Mexican law. Therefore,
to find a peg for working paper approval, something else had to be found.
None of his numerous present cover associations or stories had enough substance
to provide a sufficiently plausible basis for working papers. The corporation
being created for the QRMANTLE activity under the cover story being used
(e.g., fairly affluent PBPRIMER interested in culture and intellectuals
trying to get something of the QEMANTLE nature started and, then, interest
PBPRIME foundations in picking it up) will not support an application for
working papers. As a result, the Station and TICHBORN were casting about.
for something else with more depth and durability.

He said
3. Taking all the foregoing into consideration and to avoid complications with
his present projects or TICHBORN, the Station asked him what understanding he
had op
the proportion of his time to be devoted to KUBARK activities.
that his present contract was predicated on approximately 60 to 86-2/3% of
his time being utilized by KUBARK. His present estimate is that he is devoting
85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activities; and, if he is to do the kind of job
that is desired on the two intellectual projects recently acquired, he will.
sustain that percentage, Of course, he continues to be available for appropriate
election of political assignments (such as FUASPEN) in other countries from time
to time; but, it has to be recognized that when he is absent from Mexico,
this represents 100% of his time.
The Station agrees with his analysis on current commitments against his
time on behalf of KUBARK. Therefore, it was indicated to TICHBORN that he
should be prepared to take up this matter with Headquarters at the time ha
makes his late October trip to PBPRIME in connection with the new intellectual
magazine (see reference) and that the Station would request Headquarters to be
prepared to discuss the matter at that time. It is the Station's understanding
that his present contract extension expires 19 November 1964.
3
5. The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at its
initiative in order to try (n) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN
recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) to get a complete
understanding on all aspects of TICHBORN's contractual status (written and
unwritten) so that neither the Station nor TICHBORN get committed to these
continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contention about the
tline/salary involved. It should also be emphasized that TICHBORN has not
complained about recent requirements, but has devoted whatever time requirod
to handle them and do the job expected.

REFERENCE:HMMA-24352 dated 22 September 1964.
1. As probably can be discerned from previous communications on this subject,
the Station has never been too certain about the original understandings with
Subject on his relationship with KUBARK. At least some understandings have been
supplementary to the formal contract (such as, his availability for extended
trips to Latin American areas in election periods). This is no complaint on
the part of the Station, but merely a prelude to a matter which the Station
brought up with TICHBORN in connection with his intellectual magazine and
QRMINE activities.
2. It has been the Station's inference, from talking to TICHBORN as well as
comunications on other aspects of his relationship with KUBARK not covered
+
in his contract, that he is not to be considered a full-time contract agent.
In other words, he has outside activities in the legal and other fields here som
which it was understood would provide additional income to him at the time he
entered into his original relationship with KUBARK. As can be discerned from
his biographic data, he has operated at a level and enjoyed an income outlook
that would not be satisfied by the present contractual arrangements on salary.
It has become obvious to the Station, however, that if he is to handle, properly,
present requiremets being imposed on him by the Station a very high percentage
of his available time is going to be involved.

During the weck of 27 September, an old friend of TICHBORN's, Identity A,
came up with the following proposition:
8.
Identity A owns Identity B which operates out of Mexico City and distri-
butes PBPRIME shows dubbed into Spanish throughout the Caribbean and
South American aled. The business has been in existence for some time and,
according to TICHBORN, is thriving. Identity A said that his business had
reached a point where he needed legal assistance of various types, but was
not prepared to turn it over to just any local lawyer since it involved.
a wide range of problems.
..b..
Identity A, who knew from conversations with TICHBORN that the latter
was thinking about getting Mexican working papers, made an offer to TICHBORN:
He said that he would provide TICHBORN with office space and telephone in
his present office area in downtown Mexico City on Reforma if TICHBORN
would just advise him on what local lawyers, to see on these various legal
problems and act as a very general legal advisor to him on dealings with
these people. He and TICHBORN figured this would take, perhaps, 5% of the
latter's time. Further, and most important; Identity A said he would provide
the basis with Identity B for TICHBORN obtaining his working papers. For
various reasons, however, Identity A desired an answer right away (within
several days).
L
-
The Station checked out Identity A in Station files and found that there
had been some previous traffic on him in the period, 1957-61: HDC-W-334
dated 19 December 1957; HMM-A-9445 dated 12 February 1958; DIR-40866 dated
20 May 1961; DIR-41304 dated 22 May 1961; DIR-41303 dated 23 May 1951;
DIR- 41298 dated 23 May 1961; and MEXI-8085 dated 23 May 1961. As will be
_ noted, the May 1961 traffic concerned TICHBORN coming to Mexico and being
employed as legal counsel to Identity A. (This never really reached fruition
although TICHBORN used an association with Identity A, which was never more
than close social contact and an interest in show business, as one of his
various cover stories.) In all this traffic, there was not any derogatory
information developed on. Identity A. Therefore, the Station on strength
of the timing required and this previous traffic told TICHBORN to go ahead
with the arrangement since it is not only essential for his local activities,
but will provide him with stronger and readily available cover for any
further Latin American trips (i.e., FUASPEN) he might be required to make.
TICHBORN has been told, to transact an absolute minimum of his business for
KUBARK at this office on his regular projects. (e.g., QRMINE and QRMANTLE).
4. Hopefully, this will also straighten out the working papers problem on some
sort of rational basis in the near future.

(C'S COMMENT:
REQUESTED OPINION TICHBORN.).
1. FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OPINION OF TICHBORN, FROM OFFICERS WHO
HAVE DEALT WITH HIM: EXCELLENT CHARACTER AND COMPLETE LOYALTY TO
ODYOKE. ALTHOUGH AT STATION REQUEST TICHBORN HAS DEALT IN MEXI WITH
PERSONS OF FAR LEFT, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION THAT HIS
POLITICAL INCLINATIONS ARE. ANYTHING BUT COMPLETELY PRO-P9PRIME. THERE
IS NO QUESTION ABOUT HIS ABILITY AT ANY CHORE INTERESTING ENOUGH TO
STIMULATE HIM. NE IS EXTREMELY LUCID, AND HIS MIND CAN ONLY BE
DESCRIBED AS BRILLIANT. HE HAS AN EVEN, PLACID TEMPERAMENT. HIS
We are
JUDGEMENT APPEARS TO BE SOUND ( ALTHOUGH IN MEXI HIS ASSIGNMENTS HAVE
USUALLY BEEN OF THE TYPE IN WHICH HE FOLLOWED STATION GUIDANCE).
E
HI IS NOT GOOD AT DETAIL, SUCH AS REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING. IN ESSENCE:
HE IS A SHARP OPERATOR, WHO COULD PROBABLY DO WELL IN POSITION OF
IMPORTANCE.
30.2
2. STATION NOT IN POSITION TO COMMENT ON HIS LEGAL ABILITY. HIS
LOCAL ACTIVITY FALLS IN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS CATEGORY (AS A PBPRINE
CITIZEN HE NOT ALLOWED PRACTICE MEXI).
