1. Reference is made to the telephone conversation
of 26 July 1965 between yourself and Rogers C. Brooks of
thi's Office wherein background information relating to the
assignment of Terence S. Crabanac was discussed.
: 2. Subject will apparently develop a cover as a writer,
a field wherein he has an already demonstrated talent based
upon several publications. The objective of the cover is to pro-
vide a basis of attribution for some of his income. At the time
of the preparation of Mr. Crabanac's contract, the specific
detail of his cover was unknown.
3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of
possible royalties earned by Crabanac as a result of his
literary efforts or whether such income should be properly
offset.

REFERENCE
A.
OGC Opinion 65-2476a, dated 12 August 1965.
B.
Our Memo, dated 8 July 1965, Same Subject
1. This office herein recommends an ammendment to CRABANAC's
Supplement dated 4 July 1965, to delete paragraph 7. entitled "Offset."
2. This office acknowledges the OGC opinion, Reference A, which
determined CRABANAC may retain without Agency salary offset any future
royalties earned as a result of his literary efforts based on the fact
cover does not include role of a writer.
3. As Subject's cover "activities" have been officially clarified
as being only a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer for
which the Agency will be making all entitlement payments and actually
he will receive no funds from any cover, this paragraph, which is misleading,
has no meaning in Subject's contract and it is hereby recommended that
it be deleted from CPABANAC's Supplement.
4. Further, in future cases when a cover is so light that Subject
will not be receiving funds from cover it is reccomended that no "Offset"
paragraph be included in Supplements or Contracts.

Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
:
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such röyalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may.
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."

8 Cause of Illness
- E. Howard Hunt
1. Having been requested to give an opinion regarding the
origins of the duodenal ulcer for which I was hospitalized cctober
12-15, 1964, I believe it to have resulted from three years of work
frustration and professional dissatisfactions occasioned by (a) Agency.
failure to assign me to an appropriate post abroad following my parti-
cipation in Project MATE, and (b) the passive, non-challenging naturo
of the domestic work I was given.
2.
I should point out that before joining Project JAATS in May,
1960, I requested in writing, and was granted by responsible senior
officials, commitment to return me to an appropriate assignment abroad
upon the termination of NATE. Despite continuing verbal assurances

3. The T/O position I have been occupying
is the equivalent of sy 1953-54 assignment
as Chief of Covert Action for SE Division. Organisationally I am
where I was 11-12 years ago, but with a smaller staff and eary fever

This memorandum contains a recommendation in para-

2. Terence 8. CRABANAC (F) is a Contract Employee as-
signed to the Madrid area in Spain in a sensitive assignment
since his conversion from a Staff Employee on 4 July 1965.
CHABANAC was a CS-15, stop 7 ($19,880.00 per annum) and be

status. His contract provides that he will be entitled to
a living quarters allowance in conformance with regulations
of this organization applicable to its appointed personnel.
3. The basic living quarters allowance for Class II
officers in Madrid is $2,000 per annus. The house which
CHABANAC has located, with a one year lease from 15 November
1965 to 14 November 1966, has an annual rent of $6,600.00
oxcluding utilitios. Therefore, for rent alone, he will be
$1,969.00 per year over the 160 percent maximum allowed
under the provisions of FR 45-10b. On a 75/25 percent
sharing basis of the 60 percent over the quarters allowance,
he would be out of pocket $2,395.00.
4. Due to the operational sensitivity of CRABANAC's
assignment, his request formlief on his housing costs was
handled by Mr. Thomas Karenessines, ADOP. On ló September
1985, Mr. Xaramessines, ADDF, approved his being reimbursed
on a 76/23 percent basis for the excess allowable costs up
to, but not to exceed, 80 percent above his quarters allowance.
This authorization was included in a letter to CRABANAC from
Hr. Karamoasines. It is requested that the Deputy Director
