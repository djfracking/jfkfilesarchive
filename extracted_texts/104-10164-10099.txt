RYBAT KMSTONE VWNOCK NOC Byron W. GUTRADT's Past Contacts with _
Orlando Bosch and WKSCARLET−3
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS. INVOLVED
1. We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch,
WKSCARLET-3 and several other Cuban exiles were recently arrested
and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on
6. October. After having read these accounts NOC Byron W. GUTRADT
reported, for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3
in the early 1960's. GUTRADT met WKSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both
GUTRADT at that
were enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia.
time had already terminated his relationship with BKHERALD.
While at OCS GUTRADT was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3
but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledgeable of GUTRADT's back-
ground and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen
WKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and
doubts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would remember him.
.
2. GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was
training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored program. Bosch only knew
GUTRADT in ¨alias. GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since completion
of this training.
3. Given the length of time that has elapsed plus the lack
of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Bosch, GUTRADT and the
Station do not believe that their knowledge of his past BKHERALD
activities presents any security problems today. GUTRADT, of
course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and
was surprised to hear of the bombing of the Cubana airliner.

THE WASHINGTON POST
FBI Told of Chilean Plot to Use Cubans to Kill Allende K
By Jue Crankshaw
The Miami Hecold
MANI-- The Chilean secret police
last jpbruary attempted to recruit
two alerted Cuban exile terrorists to
a-sassinate the nephew of Chile's late
depnet Marxist President Salvador
Milende, a ranking South American
Intelligence official told U.S. authori
ties.
The Intelligence official, Ricardo
Morales of the Venezuelan secret po-
Hey,Auld FBI contacts that Chile's se-
crŕt'police (DINA) sought the assassi
nation of both Andres Pascal Allende
and his companion, Anne Marie Brus-
sier, according to documents made
available to The Miami Herald.
Morales, himself a Cuban exile, said
the DINA plot, which was never car.
ried out, was reported to him by Ro-
lando (Heru, who curicatly faces trial
in Miami on 39 felony charges related
to mme terroist bombings here.
Susparions of Chilean secret police
involvemera in plots against political
exiles have been widely expressed in
emnite circles. This was the first re.
pedited instance of an allegation to
the FBI by a high-ranking intelligence
official suggesting complicity of the
Chilean Intelligence service in polit
Ical assassination activities. Morales
had himself been associated with the
Central Intelligence Agency and FBI
as an operative and informant after
fleeing Cuba following Castro's ac
cession to power.]
At the time of Morales' report to
the FBI, Otero was a fugitive from a
Miami federal grand jury indictment
related to the bombings. He was sub-
sequently acquitted of that charge
earlier this year at a federal trial in
Jacksonville.
Morales quoted Otero as saying
DINA had attempted to recruit both
Otero and Orlando Bosch for the as-
sassination. Bosch was charged in
Venezuela last week with first-degree
murder in the sabotage of a Cuban
. airliner that claimed 73 lives.
Morales quoted Otero as saying
DINA offered arms and funds to Cu-
ban exile groups.
Otero refused to do the "favor," left
Chile and told the Latin American in-
telligence official on Feb. 15, then re-
turned to Santiago. He was arrested
two weeks later and held until he was
handed over to the United States in
May.
1
Bosch was arrested entering Costa
Rica with a false, passport on Feb. 19.
He was charged with plotting to kill
U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kis-
singer, Andres Pascal Allende and
Anne Marie Brussier.
No trial was held and Bosch was
later deported. He returned to Santi-
ago and apparently remained there
until going to the Caribbean area to
organize CORU, a militant anti-Castro
group which claimed credit for the
Cuban airliner bombing last month.
Morales made the reports to the FBI
in an exchange of intelligence with
U.S. officials about exiled terrorists'
plots.
An FSI spokesman in Washington
said Monday the bureau would have
no comment on the reported DINA
plot. (FBI officials in Caracas had no
comment on the case in response to
Independent inquiries by The Wash-
ington Post.]
Information on alleged DINA Cu-
ban exile conspiracy against the sur-
viving Allende family and government
members was suppressed during the
federal bombing trial of Otero in
¨. Jacksonville in September, 1976.
.
When Otero started to testify abom
his activities in Chile. government
prosecutors objected that the informa
tion was immaterial to the hombing
charges.
Otero was found innocent of federal
charges that be placed bombs at Mi-
ami International Airport in October,
and at the Miami FBI office. Social
Security Office, State Unemployment
Office. two post offices, a bank, the
Dade State Attorneys Office and the
Miami Police Department Headquar
ters on Dec. 3£
- His trial on related state charges was
to begin here Monday but was or-
dered postponed until after the begin-
ning of the year and transferred to
Pensacola.
Otero remained in Florida sutil late
December. 1975, when he was told by
an FBI informant that the FBI was
preparing to have him indicted on the
bombing charges.
Otero then went to the Dominican
Republic, where he was arrested, ther
paroled to the custody of Admiral Ce
sar de Windt, father-in-law of Frank
Castro, an Otero friend.
When a Miami federal grand jury
returned indictment; against Otero in
the bombings Otero flew to Caracas
Oters had $50 in his pocket when he

"I am going
to declare war"
It had been a long time since Dr.
Orlando Bosch had talked to a reporter.
He had been a fugitive for three years-
ever since he boasted he was going “un-
derground to direct the internationaliza-
tion of the war" against his one-time
comrade Fidel Castro. Sometimes, as he
flew from one Latin American capital to
another, he would forget what name he
had decided to use and would begin fum-
bling among his four phony passports.
He had once been a practicing pe-
diatrician, first in Cuba, then in Miami,
but for more than 20 years now the tools
of his real trade had been instruments of
death-plastic explosives, rifles and ba-
zookas. He led a group of Cuban exiles
implicated in some`150 bombings and
some 50 murders in the last two years
(New Times, October 29, 1976). His
group had been linked to the car-bomb
assassination of Chilean exile leader. Or--
lando Latelier in Washington, D.C., last
September, and now he was under arrest
In Caracas, Venezuela, charged with or-
dering the bombing of a Cuban commer.
cial airliner last October 6, which killed
73 people. He is one of the most famous
terrorists in the world.
A tall, heavy-set man with thick
glasses, he was sitting in the sun in the
Caracas prison when I walked up to him.
"Dr. Bouch?" I asked hesitantly.
"Yes?" he replied.
I introduced myself as a reporter
from New York. He squinted as he care
fully looked me over,
he
"How did you get in here?"
asked suspłulously.
I told him I had called his lawyer
two weeks before and been told to come
down to Veneruicin. Ily the time I are
vived, his lawyer had gone on vacation
and I couldn't reach him. I was in de-
spair. I'd flown 3,000 miles for nothing.
By Blake Fleetwood
nuing
Orlando Bosch is in a
Venezuelan jail, charged
with ordering the bombs
ing of a Cuban plane in
which 73 people died.
In an exclusive inter-
view, he talks about his
years as a terrorist, his
secret alliances with
Latin American govern-
ments and his plans to
get even with the
.66
traitors” who put
him in jail
It seemed that it would be impossible to
see Bosch. I knew that Joanne Omang of
the Washington Post had spent weeks in
Caracas trying to see Bosch and hadn't
been successful. In desperation I had
called another lawyer, who surprised me
with a simple suggestion. "Tomorrow is
visiting day," he said. "Be there at 8
a.m. and maybe you can get in.”
At eight the next morning, I
showed up at the prison gates and saw
two lines of visitors waiting to enter the
prison. On the left were about 300 wom-
en burdened down with baskets of fruit,
pies, cakes and fresh linen for their im-
prisoned menfolk. To the right stood the
four male visitors to the prison. In a tew
minutes the line started to move and I
followed along. I pessed a table where
someone asked me for my cédula. Al-
though I understand scae Spanish, this
was not a word I knew. Everyono elas Į
handed him what looked like an I.D.
card, so I took out my passport. He took
it and gave me a unail plastic stub. One
of the Beards, who spoke a rough, coun-
try Spanish that was dificult to under-
and ushered me into email bathroom
where I was frisked. Then my briefcase
was quickly searched and headed brak
to me. I followed the other four men;
through two barred gates. And suddenly
I realized I was in the prison--at liberty,
to find Busch among the longing prison
ers. I arxed one of the more respectṇhia-
looking prianners where I could finit Or

yard in a soution of the prison razorved:

of the assassination. But, he added, "I ·
went underground to direct the interna
tionalization of the war. I thought that
the action people [terrorists) should get
out of the U.S. and operate from differ-
ent bases throughout Central and South
.America." In the next 18 months, four
of the ten people on the FLNC· list were
killed, and a fifth had his legs blown off..
During that period, Bosch was
traveling widely in the Caribbean. (Did
be ever slip back into the U.S.? Bosch
laughed. "If I have to go to the United
States, 1 go.") His main goal was to
forge: alliances with friendly covern-
ments in Nicaragua, the Dominican Re-
public, Costa Rica and Venezżucia-all
countries with powerful Cuban exile
communities.
•
Bosch claims that he made his
first pact with the Venezuelan govern-
ment in 1974. He had entered Venezuela
from the Dominican Republic in June of
that year, using a false Dominican pass-
port in the name of Pedro Penya. "We
set off a bomb in front of the Panamani-
an embassy in Caracas. We chose the
10th of October because that is the date
the liberation of Cuba was announced
in 1898. We did it because the Torrijos
dictator [Panama's president] announced
that he was going to Havana, and he did,
and he kissed Castro. At the beginning
the authorities blamed some Panamanian
general who was in exile here. About
two weeks later a Communist Cuban of-
ficial was invited to speak at the Vene LYNCHBURG has some of the oldest homes
zuelan-Cuban friendship club. I infiltrat-
ed into the audience and before the guy
could speak the whole thing blew up. We
had to do it. We didn't want to hurt any-
one, but we just didn't want the guy to
talk..
“I continued conspiring all that
fall, raising money and planning bomb-
ings and other actions. But about the
middle of November I was arrested by
the DISIF (the Venezuelan secret politi-
cal police). They denied to the press that
rest. The U.S. knew of Bosch's daten-
tion, but passed up the opportunity to
I was in the country or even under ar-
extradite him.] Than I made my first fur-
mal agreement with the Venezuelan gov.
emment. I dealt with Rivas Vasquez and
Orlando Garcia (second and third in
command of the DISIP),
"I promised that no more action
In Caracus, and they promised me in the
against Cantro's friends would be inkon
name of President Carlos' Andren Porez
that no high official of the Cuban regime
would be allowed into Venezuela.”
Rusch was then released. He flow
to Curaunu, where he met with Ciuiliar-
mo Novo and other Cuban calle lenders
in Tennessee. And the oldest registered
distillery in America.
Its name, of course, is Jack Daniel's. Where
we still make whiskey the way Mr. Jack
made it in 1866. And then smooth it out
with his age-old charcoal mellowing process.

"Novo and I flew to Chile and madı
of effort there." Bosch lived in. Chile
from December 1974 to December 1975,
where he had another family with a Chi-
lean woman. According to press reports,
he lived as a guest of the government in a
government apartment. "I passed sever-
al times from Chile to Argentina. We
tried to shoot some Cuban diplomats in
the middle of 1975 and we set off a bomb
at the Mexican embassy in Buenos
Aires. We made good contacts there
with members of the triple-A party (a
right-wing extremist group). Because of
the contacts we made down there, we set
up the murder of two Cuban diplomats,
That was part of the agreement I had
with them. On August 9th last year, I had
a call from our pɛople down there. They
said, 'You read the papers today?""
'Bosch then made a slashing motion from
Carlos Rivero Collade, a former
Cuban exile leader who has returned to
Cuba, has written that Bosch received
special instruction in assassination and
personal attacks during his year in Chile
from the Chilean National Intelligence
Department. "The purpose behind the
training was to have Bosch assassinate
Andres Pascal Allende, nephew of the
slain Chilean president," he wrote.
According to former Costa Rican
Foreign Minister Gonzalo Facio, Bosch
arrived in his country with the Andres
Pascal assassination assignment given to
him by the Chilean junta. Using a Chi-
lean passport, a Chilean driver's license
and other Chilean documents in the
name of Hector D'Avanzo: Cintolessi,
Bosch entered the country from Nicara-
gua where, according to Facio, he had
met with "close aides of President Anas-
tasio Somoza." On the basis of intelli-
gence reports Bosch was detained in
5 Costa Rica and, while being held,
cording to Facio, "he told interrogators
he intended to kill Secretary of State
Kissinger, who was due to arrive here
soon thereafter." Bosch admitted to me
that he had been in Costa Rica, but
would not acknowledge any role in the
alleged assassination plots.

tablished while we were down there
which was the main purpose."
"After leaving Costa Rica I went
to live in Santa Domingo until August of
1976. I had a number of good friends.
there and we planned many actions.
"The Dominican government let.
me stay in the country and organize ac-
tions. I wasn't going to church every
day. We were conspiring there. Planning
bombings and killings... People were
coming in and going out. I was plotting
with them: Secretly, of course."
Bosch's plotting culminated in a
secret meeting of the top terrorist land-
ars of the hemisphere in the Dominican:
_ Republic. The story of CORU (Coordi
nation of the United Revolutionary Or-
ganizations) is true," he told me, "There
I was a meeting in the Bonao mountains of
20 men representing all different (Cuban
( exile) activist organizations. It was a
meeting of all the military and political
directors with revolutionary implica
tions. It was a great meeting. Everything
was planned there."
The top men from Alpha 66 (New
Jersey), Abdalah (a New York-based
youth group), the 2506 Brigade (veterans
of the Hay of Pigs Invasion), PLNC, F 14
(New York City) and Avalon Cubana (A

all of South America. "Over thermal
that table. That's him."
I told Bosch that not only hadn't
they asked me whom I was going to see,
but that they had somehow missed the
compact tape recorder in my briefcase.
Bosch, as it turned out, was anxious to
talk to a foreign reporter, saying that the
Venezuelan government had prevented
other interviews. For six hours, over the
din of homemade drums in a nearby
courtyard, he poured out his story.
"Fidel Castro and I were born in
Cuba the same month 50 years ago. We.
both came from fairly prosperous mid-
dle-class families. We both ended up at
the University of Havana in the late
1940s. I was in medical school and presi
dent of the student council, and Castro
was a delegate to the student council
from the law school. Although we had
our differences, we worked together of
ten and were both elected to our posi-
tions from the same political party,
which was very much in the center be-
tween the right and left. It's not like to-
day when all Latin American universities.
are dominated by Marxists. We were
both very anticommunist and anti-Batis-
ta and very nationalistic."
Bosch left Cuba in 1952 for two
years of internship in pediatrics at Tole-
do Hospital in Ohio. "When I finished in
1954, I returned to my hometown of San-
ta Clara and set up a practice as a pedia-
trician. But the tyranny of the Batists
dictatorship made me join up with Cas-
tro again.
"The Batista dictatorship was
choking us. I became the leader of the
July 26th Movement in my province and
we won the fight. I was appointed to the
government as a minister of communica-
tion. But even as the war was ending, we
were having problems with the Commu-
nists. They were taking over everything.
I complained, I fought against it, but
there was nothing I could do. At the time,
I still had faith in Castro and his revolu-
tion. But then it got too bad, and after a
month I resigned from the government.
That's when I started conspiring against
Castro."
Bosch told me about the group of
anti-Castro guerrillas he had led in the
Becambray mountains in Cuba in 1960.
Castro, Bosch says, sentenced him to
death. After running out of supplies, he
and his followers fed to Florida, where
they found a benefactor in the CIA. At
one point, the agency had up to 6.000
Cuban exes on its payroll.
Bosch interrupted himself and
took mɔ to his cell, a small six-by-eight-
foot room lined with Spanish tile w'silpa-
per. A small Sony television sat on a
shelf in the corner, and there were fresh
“designer” sheets on the bed. Bosch in-
troduced his cellmate, Luis Posada, wins
is also being held in connection with the
plane bombing. Posada pulled out a box
of Havana cigars and offered me one:
"America may have an embargo against.
Cuban cigars, but we deṣ't.”
Bosch and Posada had worked
together during the heyday of CIA-spon
sored anti-Castro activities in the early
sixties, including bombing missions
against Cuban sugar mills and gunboat
attacks against Castro's fishing boats.
But, in 1963, after the Cuban missile eri-
sis and the subsequent reduction of anti-
Castro activities by the Kennedy ad-
ministration, Bosch realized that the
CLA was no longer wholeheartedly com
mitted to his cause. "I felt hetrayed by

the Polish ship. Morales testified that
Bosch had said he was sorry that the
`bomb he planted in a ship called the Osa-
ka Maru went off in Tampa Bay, because
“the thing that he wanted was for that
ship to blow up outside in the middle of
the sea because he was anxious to see all
the Japs swimming and screaming Wee.
'wee, wee!' while the ship was sinking.
Bosch was sentenced to ten years
in federal prison, but was freed on parole
on November 1, 1972.
During his imprisonment, Bosch's
wife had left him. His voice broke as he
told me about it. “This fight cost me my
family and my five kids. They love me
and are very proud of their daddy, but 1

needed me. They were 13, 11, 10, 8 and

crime. I wasn't a very good husband.'
"
Bosch has always lived simply,
wearing a succession of old baggy suits,
often staying at the slum houses of his
supporters. “If I had stayed in Miami
and practiced medicine I would have
made many millions by now. But I could
not do that while my country was in ago-
ny. I have paid very much for the strug-
gle, very expensively, but that's the only
way I know. Sometimes .a'man has a
higher duty than to his children. Some-
times a man has a duty to his homeland.
That's the duty I feel."
Soon after his release from pris-
on, Bosch's sense of duty took an omi-
nous new turn. Detente between the
United States and Communist countries

action after that. We wanted to beat the

possible. I told them that we couldn't

taking more serious actions-hijack-
ing." (According to a Cuban exile news-
paper, one of the resolutions that came
out of that meeting was a vow “to begin
attacking Castro's planes in the air.")
"I accepted the leadership of
CORU because I wanted to set every-
thing up on an organized basis. We were
tired of being frustrated and not accom-
plishing everything that we wanted to
do."Bosch brought the other leaders up-
to-date on the kind of help they could ex-

public, Venezuela and Chile. Then the
group dispersed. In the 11 months since

to admit any personal involvement in
bombings within the United States; po
lice sources say the leaders had agreed
not to take credit for actions within the
U.S. because the FBI was putting too
much heat on them.)

Bosch claims that Orlando Garcia
has told him to "sit tight, everything will
be all right. We will let you go as soon as
the publicity blows over." But Bosch is
not sure he believes him, and is getting
very impatient. He spoke to me with ex-
treme bitterness about "the betrayal of
the Cuban people" by the Venezuelans
who had so recently befriended him. He
is even willing to entertain charges that

"The bus has left
with the dogs":
How they blew up
the Cuban plane
The following account of the
bombing of the Cubana Airline jet is
based on secret Venezuelan cuart
documents. Most of the information
comes from the confessions, since
repudiated, of the men charged with the
crime.
Herman Ricardo, 22, had been
working at the private detective office
of Luis Posada in Caracas för about a
year when, on September 10, 1976,
Posada introduced him to a "Mr.
Panyagua." Posada assigned Ricardo

he was a stranger in the country. After
a few days of helping "Mr. Panyagua,
Ricardo realized that he was really
Orlando Bosch, the maximuni lender
of the Cuban people.
On the night of October 5,
Ricardo, Bosch and Freddy Lugo, 25
met at a Cuban exile meeting. At
midnight that same day, Ricardo and
Lugo flew to Trinidad aboard a Pan
American flight. They stayed overnight
and the next morning inquired about:
Cubana Airline flight 455, stopping in
Barbados en route to Cuba. The clerk
told thein that the Cuban plane had
been delayed, but that there was
another flight to Barbados leaving:
Immediately, Ricardo protested, but
had trouble getting his message across
since his English was not very good.
Standing behind Ricardo in line
were a few members of Cuba's
championship fencing team, who were
returning home after an international.
tour. One of the fencers, also booked
on Cubana fight 435, translated for
Ricardo. He says that he doesn't want
to go on an earlier flight. He only wants
to travel on Cubana 455 and he's
willing to wait until it's ready to go."

Ricardo called Bosch, who told him, an

Washington grand jury. Bill Novo was
called before the Letelier grand jury
twice, and twice took the Fifth Amend-
ment. The government has now begun
offering limited immunity to some of the
other Cuban exiles, hoping to force them
to talk. Recently a friend of Bill Novo's
was jailed after refusing to testify before
the grand jury about Novo's travels to
Curacao.
As for Bosch, his future is un
clear. Venezuelan legal experts say the

Her's] campaign [to discredit the junta
abroad) was bothering some of our
friends in Chile. Chilean officials told me
many times when I lived there that they
wanted him dead." But Bosch denied
knowing anything about the Letelier as-
sassination. "Even if I did know," he
added, "I wouldn's tall anyone. I'm not a
stool pigeon or an informer.
According to a confidential intelli-
gence report obtained by New Times,
however, Bosch was not as talicent
about the Letelier case when quastioned.

arrest. The report states that Rosch
told Rivas Vasques, second in command
of DISIP, that, while he had nothing to:
do with the Letelier assassination, "the
Novo brothers are directly involved.”

do and Lugo, the chief potential wit-
nesses against him, have repudiated their
confessions after being deported to
Venezuela from Trinidad. In any case,
confessions made in Trinidad are not ad
missible in Venezuelan courtrooms: The
government has tapes of Ricardo's tele-
phone calls to Venezuela, but these, too,
are inadmissible, since they were not ob-

If that happens, he will surely slip
again into the violent, murky world
where desperate men are alternately
used and betrayed by the secret agencies
of governments. It is a far cry from the
life of a prosperous pediatrician, a fami

H/.. Attachment to
TM 180212, 16 Dec 76
Respecto a sus instrucciones de indogar sobre les actividades de
Orlando Boch durante sus visitas a Guatemala, paso a informarle lo si-
guiente.
El Embajador de Costa Rica en Honduras, Edwin Góngora, me dijo
(21 de noviembre) que a principios de este año recibió de su Gobierno
instrucciones de averiguar cuales eran sus contactos en Guatemala. Dijo
que el propio ministro de relaciones exteriores de Costa Rica, Gonzalo
Faccio, le había mostrado un documento procedente de. la CIA (estas fue-
ron sus palabras) en el cual se demostrabaja que Boch había tenido rela-
ciones en Guatemala con el hijo del ex-presidente Arena, Jorge Roberto
Arena España (Tito).
Agregó Góngora que era muy probable que al contacto entre Boch
y Tito Arana se hubiera hecho por medio de los cubanos Gerardo Sampedro
y Moreira, con quienes el segundo tiene negocios.
Recuerdo que, efectivamente, cuando Góngora me habló de esta asun-
to, a principios de este afio (más o menos en mayo? me mencionó la circuns-
tancia de que Faccio fué a Guatemala para comunicar al canciller guatemal-
teco, Adolfo Molina Orantes, los temores del Gobierno costarricense por
les actividades de Bach. Góngora recordó en nuestra Gitima conversación
que tal visita habia coincidido con el stantado do que fué victime Tito.
Arâna y quê; inclusive se mencionó que una qona y le otra podrían ester
selecionadas: sus contactos con Booh y el atentado.
Comento Góngora también que Tite Arona hecia frequentes viojes
Miami, donde es posible -dijo que ubiera hecho amistad con otros cubanos
anticastristas residentes allf.
Agregó: Góngora que quando sa la comunied de parte de su gobierno.
este asunto, requerda haber esqushado que al otro hijo del expresidents
Arana (Carlitos) tambiñan astaba relacionado con las natividades subversivas
contra Odubes. Comentó que Carlitos as aviador y pudo haber ofrecida nyuda.
mediente sus amigos que tiene en les FAQ
Dice Góngora que Facalo le mancionó también la posibilidad de que
Sooh hubiere tenido conacción con el viospresidente quatemalteco, Mario Ben-
doval Alarcón, pero que se carmala de prumban nobre #lla. Ma dijo ahora qué

EXILES vs.
CASTRO-
A Relentless
Pursuit
On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and
the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small
number of the 600,000 exiles who settled in the
U.S. have become extremists.
Highlights of events in those 18 years, some
involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the
extremists
1961: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and
trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala und Nica-
ragua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south
shore. The invasion was a failure.
1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released
by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ran-
som in drugs, food, medical equipment and other
supplies from "private contributions." President
John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban
exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a.

blockade to shake the island's economy. The attacks
generally failed.

Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do
they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about
what they may do in the future?
To answer such questions Orr Kelly and Carl J. Migdail of
the US News & World Report staff dug deeply into the
records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes
though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law-
enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.
BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM
After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became
apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state.
800,000 Cubans "voted with their feet" and fled their
homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United
States. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of
them live in the Miami area.
The majority of these immigrants are law abiding. But
Miami's "Little Havana" provides a culture in which the
virus of violence can grow.
"In Miami," explains one refugee leader, "the Cubans
keep their national identity, their heritage, traditions.
hatreds-and their hopes of going back to their homeland.
And they know they can't go back until Castro is gone. So
they dream of toppling Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in
other places in the United States seems very possible in the
atmosphere in Miami."
In the early 19tits, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the
Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitable.
It was U.S. policy to drive him from power. There was on
attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 with an
army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in secret by the
CIA. The linvaders were not given the air cover necessary for
a successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only
180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The
Cubans felt betrayed.
Then came other American moves against Castro. There
was a secret. "Operation Mongoose,” which inchided efforts
to assassinate the Cuban leader. The United States backed an
economie blockade of Cuba in an attempt to prevent Castro
from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipment from
abroad. Later, Cubaú refugees were ined to carry out secret
operations not only in ilio Caribbean but also in other parts.

CUBAN ANTI-CASTRO LEADER DENIES ACCUSATIONS

[Text] Carsons, 16 Nov--The anti-Castro leader Orlando Bosch categorically denied he
had planned the assassination of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, of Costa
Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Consalo Facio and of Pascal Allende and his girlfriend.
Bosch's denial was conveyed by his lawyer Francisco Leandro Mora, who said that his
defendant "never talked to Pacio and that when Pascal Allende arrived in Costa Rica,
Bosch had been in this country for 40 days.".
Bouch said:""Even if they try to make me look like a professional hoodlum, I

More also said: "As a politician, Bosch still does not understand what the plot is
against him, in which Fidel's intelligence services show an interest in Kissinger's
life and CIA agents are trying to destroy all those struggling against the Cuban regim
Leandro More added that Bosch claims that he personally does not know Rolando Otero,
a Cuban, also hired to kill Kissinger, according to reports from Miami, but that "he
knows who he is."
Bosch is being prosecuted by Venezuelan authorities, presumably as the brain behind the

lice, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bu-:
reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force.
its agents work closely with it.
With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of
the terrorist violence, law, officers have arrested a number of
suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-
pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence.
can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to
prosecute them.
A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might
have some knowledge of terror operations.
Efforts of law-enforce.nent officials to deal with the terror-
ist groups face formidable handicaps, however: The terrorists-
seem to know what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons.
relates that one suspect "identified one of my officers who
had never met him before, called him by name and told him
what section he worked in and what his duties were.".
Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties: Most of
them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Govern
ment. Many have had several roles: members of the U.S
Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee
leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found
the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to.'
A further complication is the heavy infiltration of the
terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence
corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as
agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to
discredit the refugees and influence American policy.
The Cuban Prime Minister has "surfaced" enough of such
agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Early this year,
for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was
named in Senate committee testimony as having been in-
volved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana.
In an April 22 broadcast by Radio Havana, De Armas said
that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a
man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had
provided him with the explosives.
In a speech on October 15, Castro bousted of a double
agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions
from the CIA. Said Castro: "From the very moment when he
was recruited by the CIA and over á period of 10
years, the
supposed agent has kept the Cuban Government fully in-
formed of all his contacts with [the CIA] and of the equip.
ment and instructions he has received.'
Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other
acts of violence. "Who else but the CIA. . . can carry out
these acts?" Castro asked.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.
involvement in the airliner bombing. He said: "I can state.
categorically that no official of the United States Govern-
ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in
contact with the American Government has had anything to
do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this
totally reprehensible.”
TERRORISTS' ARSENAL:
PLANES TO CANNONS
One measure of the military equipment
that is available to Cuban termorista in
provided by this partial inventory com•
piled by authoritien:
The CIA declines to discuss. Cuban refugee terrorism.
Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously
doubt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for
some of its earlier, activities, is still involved in operations
against the Castro regime. However, the agency is described
as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist -
groups. "We have absolutely no contact with the CIA," says
Lieutenant Lyons. "I'd like to, but they don't talk to us." One
reason for that attitude niay be that laws bar the CIA from
domestic law-enforcement activities.
Other laws, or the lack of them; also complicate the fight
against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved
in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless
the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it
illegal to conspire in this country to commit crimes abroad or
to export arms without a license.
Although shocked by the October 6 airliner hombing. U.S.
officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for
the FBI to enter that ease.
With such handicaps as these, law-enforcement officials say
they can look forward to only limited success against the
terrorists. Any real solution to the problem must come froin
within the Cuban refugee community--and investigators
state that the co-operation they get there does not extend to
cases of violence committed outside the U.S.

tistas, which means what it sounds like—pragmatists.”
A group calling itself Zero issued a "death list" of people
marked for killing and, according to officials, several persons
on the list soon died violent deaths.
Dade County's antiterrorist head, Lieutenant Lyons, says
he has stopped trying to keep track of the groups and instead
concentrates on trying to solve the crimes that they are
suspected of having committed. He has no shortage of
business. Here is a sample of the violence attributed to
terrorists in the last two years:
• Since February, 1975, there have been at least seven
assassination attempts directed against refugee leaders who
were viewed as opponents of the terrorists' tactics. Three
men were shot to death. One was killed by a boinb. Three.
other attempted killings failed, but a prominent radio broad-
caster lost both legs below the knees when a bomb ripped hist
car apart.
● On Dec. 3-4, 1975, bombs blasted the Miami office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Social Security office, a
State unemployment office, two post offices, a bank, a State
attorney's office and the Miami police-departinent headquar
ters. A man accused of those bombings, and also the bombing
of the Miami International Airport two months earlier, was
acquitted recently in a federal court. He is to be tried again
in a State court.
● A number of bombs have been exploded in New York.
One blow out the window of the Venezuelan consulate on
Fifth Avenue, across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral.
● On Feb. 12, 1976, a Soviet freighter, the Dzhordano
Bruna, was sitting motionless 35 miles off Cuba's north coust
while its tanks were being cleaned. Suddenly a small boat
raced close to the freighter and raked it with heavy machine-
gun fire. No one was injured.
● On April 6, 1976, two Cuban fishing boats were attacked
and a flaherman was killed.
On Sept. 21, 1976, in Washington, D.C., a bomb ex-
ploded in a car and killed Orlando Leteller, a former Chilean
Ambalador to the U.S. under the Marxist regime of the late
President Salvador Allende. Although the crime is officially
unsolved, there have been persistent reports that the bomb
was planted by Cuban terrorists us a "favor" to the secret
police of the present anti-Communist Government in Chile.
NEW TERRORIST STRATEGY
Lenders of the terrorist bunds are hurd to identify. But one
man has emerged as an apparent leader: Dr: Orlandó Dósch,
a podiatrician, Ilo was caught firing a bazooka at a Polish
ship in Miami harbor in 1968 and was sentenced to 10 years
In prison.
Dr. Bosch was released on parola uſter four yours, knit he
reportedly returned to the movement. He is now under
arrant in Venezuola, charged along with three other men in
connection with the Cuban airliner bombing. Dr. Bosch in
described as the louder of the group calling thelf Accion
Qubana.
In June of this year, Dr. Bosch called a small group of hi

Some wanted to avoid the risks of further attacki in the

American law-enforcement officials say that members of

On July 23, three men who had flown from Miami carrying

The most serious act of terrorism came on October 6,
when a Cubanu Airlines DC-8 exploded in flight shortly after
taking off from Barbados. The plane fell into the sea, killing
73 persons including members of the Cuban national fencing

PCC LEADER ACCUSES U.S. OF INTERVENTION IN L.A.
Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 0000 GMT 17 Nov 76 FL
(Text] PCC Central Committee member Raul Valdes Vivo, who is participating as a guest in
the opening conference of autumn courses of the School of Economy of the National Autono-
mous University of Mexico, said in a lecture he gave today that the United States has
intervened in Latin America with troops and capital.
This year's autum courses of the Mexican university deal with the topic "World economy
and social changes. In his speech, the chief of the PCC Central Committee Foreign Rela-
tions General Department pointed out that Mexico as a people and as a country has always
defended the right of the Cuban people to choose its own path.
Valdes Vivo said that Cuba is building true socialism since it began to follow a pro-
cess different from the one being followed to date by the other countries of the contin-
ent, a process which makes the right to self-determination a common cause for the rest of
Latin America. Internationalism and its practice, Valdes Vivo said in his speech, has
always been directed at--from the days of the Paris commune to the Spanish Civil War and.
to the Angulan conflict--giving support to peoples who struggle with their own strength
for the continuation of their own history and against forces that have come from abroad
sent by the enemies of those peoples.
Valdes Vivo affirmed that revolutions cannot be exported; nevertheless, the United States
has intervened in Latin America with its troops and its dollars and has taken part of
the territories of some countries, as in the case of Mexico.
