ABSTRACT
05
1. During your recent TDY to Headowanie: you requested all available
information regarding a young Cuban name
named (d) who talked to Identity 1.

2 October 1761. Identity I, apparently, and
Cuban official in witserland) to meet with
Cuba under a safe Conduct agreement.

squested by:ubject's uncle, a
Smo had recently departed from
05
3. During the conversation (LASA Jalked about his uncle, an old school friend
of Identity 1 and, also, Subject's father, a minor Cuban Government official also
stationed in Switzerland || Both the uncle are father were in disagreement with
the CASTRO Covernment and there was some leation that one or both were willin
to defect. Although this point was touched or obliquely, Identity 2 gathered
that Subject wanted to get his father into this country with mas assurance of
support. The question was not asked directly and no commitments were made or
implied.
4. After this relatively short talk in Identity 1's office, Subject and
Identity 2 went into a conference room where he rave Identity 2 papers dealing
with the organisation and purpose of the IEX (which were already available) and
said he would work with the students in the future? LASA) also expressed a wish
to go to Switserland for the purpose of informing the International Red Cross
group there of the inhumane treatment of Cubar political prisoners.
5. In parting, Identity 2 had a distinct impression that subject had not
really accomplished the primary objective of his visit, and as he was returning
to Miami, the foruroing was passed to Icantity 3.
6. For further information on Subject refer to NAVE-8368, 9 Oct 61;
DIR-17475, 12 Oct 61; and DIR-23974, 14 Nor cl. Also, bee copy of GATA-1631
