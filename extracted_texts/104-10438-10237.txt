1. Per our telephone conversation today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/0 for review in
this connection.
2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items
(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on
all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5 (B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.
3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to
the question in a manner which could have been construed as
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

(U) b. There is no comprehensive readily
available record of precisely what information
has been declassified and released in accordance
with the Freedom of Information Act and the
Privacy Act; there are separate collections
with a limited capability to retrieve some such
information;
(U) C. There is no available record of
the information that officials of the Executive
Branch of government, with authority to
declassify information, have said or written
in public either before Congressional
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows,
college symposiums, the general lecture
circuit, other public forums, etc.
In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee
that those items which are still classified by the
DDO components have not been deliberately or
inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as
"official public disclosure."
(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A
lists those items of the DDO deleted items which have
been declassified by "official public disclosure."
These thirteen complete and parts of four other items
can therefore be released from the court injunction.
(S) 4. Attachment B (seven parts) contains
eleven deleted items (seven subjects) which are still
classified but about which there may be some possible
question. These are highlighted here so that
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with
due regard for all legal and policy aspects.
(U) 5. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining
items which the DDO components advise are still
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amended and
cannot be released from the court injunction.

Mr. Ralph J. Katrosh
:
Special Assistant to the DDO
for External Oversight
Samuel Halpern
Review of 168 Deleted Items in
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks
(U) 1. This is the report of the review done by
the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items
which are the basic responsibility of the DDO.
The
remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi-
bility of the DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those
Directorates which are reporting directly to OGC.
Responsible components did the necessary inter- and
intraagency coordinations.
(U) 2. Several points need to be highlighted
concerning the completeness of the review, especially
as regards those items declassified by "official
public disclosure" as defined by the courts. While I
am sure that as diligent a search as possible was done
by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely
complete search is impossible for the following reasons:
(U) a.
.
There is no index of any kind,
let alone having the material in machine form
such as in the RSM, to the fifteen published
hearings and reports of the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (Church
Committee), the six published hearings and
proceedings of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume
Report to the President by the Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States
(Rockefeller Commission);

Item No. 49
.
MSS p. no. 7la
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily
American is still classified SECRET because it describes
intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper
publications. CCS files contain a newsclip from the
September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia
Journalism Review which states, "Landon K. Thorne, Jr.,
the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA, Benjamin Shute,
then a partner in the prestigious Wall Street law firm
of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore, now acknowledge that the
fourth partner [in the purchase of the Rome Daily American
in 1956] was the CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrange-
ment 'atypical' of what the Agency was doing, "a bad
example'." It is questionable whether the remarks made by
Mr. Bross, who retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute,
who left the Agency long before that, can be considered
as constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

(U) NE Division has highlighted these items.
(S) Item 22 states in part "A notable example of such
a 'special relationship' is Iran, where a CIA organized coup.
d'etat restored the Shah to power in 1953. The Shah was
understandably grateful..." Item 28 lists the Shah among
other "world leaders with whom CIA has developed special
relationships" as does Item 152 and a similar statement is
made in Item 179.
(U) Ray S. Cline in his book "Secrets, Spies and
Scholars," pp. 131-132, states:
"
a covert operation so successful that it
became widely known all over the world was carried
out in Iran. The Shah, then very young, had been
driven out of Iran by his left-leaning Premier,
Mohammed Mossadegh, whose support came from the
local Communist (Tudeh) Party and from the Soviet
Union. CIA mounted a modest effort under a skillful
clandestine services officer who flew to Iran,
hired enough street demonstrators to intimidate
those working for Mossadegh, instructed Iranian
military men loyal to the Shah how to take over
the local radio station, and paved the way for the
Shah's triumphal return."
(U) The Church Committee, Book I, p. 111, briefly
mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran"
as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert
operations.
"
(S) There is a vast difference between the classified
deleted items speaking about an active "special relationship"
with the Shah following the overthrow of Mossadegh and a
statement about CIA's role in overthrowing Mossadegh. The
former is still properly classifiable and classified.

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World
Features is still classified SECRET because both items
describe intelligence sources and methods and identifies
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to - but not by name in Book I of the Church
Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows: "Another
example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two
proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in
Europe... The larger of the two was subscribed to by
over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major U.S. dailies aware that the CIA controlled these
two press services." While Forum World Features was not
named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be
protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper
editors may be considered as "official public disclosure.

"
(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's Secret
Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean war was
winding down, the CIA began sending intelligence agents
into Tibet to assess the situation and see what could be.
done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the
offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched
by air and made contact with the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, giving
him a channel of communication with the West.
"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to
avoid capture by the Chinese forces in 1959, he was
accompanied on his flight by a CIA-trained radio operator
who was able to keep Washington posted on his often
hazardous progress.'
"
(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA
"close relationship" with the Dalai Lama and his being
"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different
from Rositzke's statement about CIA trained radio operators
being with the Dalai Lama. These are two different
comments with the first being properly classifiable

(S) Under injunction as classified information is
"For its Tibetan operation of the early sixties, the
Agency constructed extensive support facilities in
Northeast India and brought large numbers of guerrillas
to a deserted Army base in Colorado for special training."
Underlining (line 25, ninth thru twenty-third word)
indicates the questionable part of the item since MSS
page 97, lines 24-26 states "Some Tibetans were quietly
brought to the United States for special paramilitary
training at Camp Hale in the mountains of Colorado."
This sentence was originally deleted, then reinstated and
appears in boldface type on page 115 in the published book.

on the extent to which CIA sponsorship of Fairways may
have been placed in the public domain since the court

ATTACHMENT B (7)
Item No. 339
MSS p. no. 509
(S) CIA presence in Bolivia and Brazil has not been
officially acknowledged and is still classified because
it involves sources and methods.
:
David Phillips in his book The Night Watch,
chapter 8, pp. 212-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-
1972" describes his presence as Chief of Station of CIA
in Brazil and on page 209 he discusses CIA in Bolivia.
(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence
in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),
Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presence
in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.
It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. We
believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."
It is not a question of whether to agree or not
to declassification of reference to the Congo. The Church
Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made
"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the
subject moot. In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A
shows, four other countries of the Third World are also
mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone. What
adverse effect could be expected now by another public
reference to CIA presence in the Congo as of the original
1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is
difficult to comprehend. Since the government of Zaire has
not changed since the 1975 release of the information by
the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever adverse
effects there might be have already occurred.

Review of Deletions from The CIA and the
Cult of Intelligence by Marchetti and Marks
1. The responsible and knowledgeable components of this.
directorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from subject
book per your request. The review was made to determine whether
each deletion was still classified under EO 11652 or whether the
information in each deletion has been officially released by the
U.S. Government.
2.

'
Attached, Tab A, is a list of the deleted items reviewed
by this directorate. Tab B is a list of those items of primary
interest of this directorate. All of these items remain classi-
fied; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released. Tab C
is a list of those items which we determined are still classified
under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be
released, but we recommend that all of the items in Tab C be
coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab D is a list of
items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and
should be referred to other indicated elements. Tab E is a list
of the four items mentioned above which we believe portions can
now be released. The portions in red brackets remain classified
and should not be released.
.3. Since many of the deleted items involved the National
Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina-
tions through our contacts at NSA. We were told that any
coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General
Counsel. As a result, no further coordination with other ele-
ments was attempted.
4. This memorandum completes the DDS&T action on the
court ordered review of the deletions from subject book.

Hussein and the U.S. Government became increasingly concerned about the
strong and strident propaganda voice of Radio Cairo. Both parties shared a
desire to counter its anti-American, anti-Hussein line (which was not (new),
so the CIA funded the building of a Jordanian television station. A CIA
owned, New York based proprietary company, named RTV, provided the technical
expertise and management skills to put the station in operation.]
Still another example of a country where the CIA enjoys a special
relationship is Nationalist China. On Taiwan, however, the CIA's link is
not with President Chiang Kai-shek but with his son and heir apparent,
Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo. One former CIA chief of station, Ray Cline, now the
State Department's Director of Intelligence and Research, became something

the information straight forwardly, thereby, handicapping the analysts in making
*
a confident judgment of the accuracy of the report's content.
Some intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receive
large numbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from
actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance
(which is, by definition, an accurate account of what was said) with agent
reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services
confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose
function it is to analyze foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make
decisions based on that intelligence analysis.
[ In the mid-1960s, the Far East Division of the Clandestine Services and
159
the experts of the Scientific and Technical Directorate combineddfaces to
carry out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)
intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level
U.S. government officials were disturbed by reports that Communist China was on
the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.
They knew that the threat posed by Chinese ICBM's would play an important part
in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-
ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As a matter of the highest
priority, the CIA was told to find out what was happening at Shuangch'engtze, the
Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.
The Agency's technical specialists responded by designing a nuclear-
ppwered device which could monitor certain key electronic emissions coming from
the missile site, well over a thousand miles away, and then rely the information
to a CIA listening post. The plan was to emplace the device on a mountain
peak called the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the
Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to
the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA
laboratories. the Clandestine Services took on the responsibility for the most

would do. Progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base
camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by
a small party of climbers accompanied by a few porters. Soon after the
group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to
tell the CIA man, who had remained behind to handle communications with the
staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes.
The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in
an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now well off
schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition
161
because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency
operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its

target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures
well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into
operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news
of the successful installation was sadioed back to the staging. area.
But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been
sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to fly over
the mountain and photograph the monitoring site. It was learned that the
device had been knocked over by a snow slide. When the Indian government
was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi
that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headgaters of the sacred
Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about
religious pollution, not ecological.
The CIA reacted by planning another climbe of the mountain for the following
year, both to retrieve the damaged equipment and implace a new monitoring
system

this one powered by a non-nuclear generator. The climbing team,
led by Bishop, was gathered together again and this time it reached the
top of the mountain with comparatively little difficulty. The new device was
set up, but after an extensive search, the atomic generator from the year

difficult phase of the operation -- installing the machine on the mountain top. (160)
✓
The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the
Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the
CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not
only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project.
Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry
the device, complete with its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it
into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered
Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.
Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an experienced
CIA case officer.
That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian
climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret
CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn
how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top of Nanda Devi.
Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international
mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an
ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the
technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the
CIA chief of station in Delhi reported that all logistical and cover arrangements
with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was
clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport
plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were
brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from
where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda
Devi.
Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the
Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking
too much weight. The CIA case officer redistributed the load by convincing the

stopped working. This time the failure was attributed to a mechanical
malfunction.
At this point, the Agency gave up on mountain-top monitoring of the
Communist Chinese missile program, turning to other systems and new, improved
satellites for acquiring the information it was seeking. The Indians were

thanked and compensated for their cooperation. The American climbers were
presented with secret medals by a grateful, but disappointed, CIA.
[The fertile imaginations of the S&T experts during the following
i
years produced many more unique coblrction schemes aimed at solving the
mysteries of China's strategic missile program. Most eventually proved to be
unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.
The silliest of them all, however, called for the creation of a small one-man
airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In
concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into
the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would
assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.
Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with
this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.

A second system was a device, long and tubular like a rocket, that could 163
be dropped by a U-2 or another aircraft near the missile test site, its fall
slowed by a parachute so that the device would penetrate only two or three
feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the system, andaerial rising from
its top, would activate itself and perform its electronic sensing tasks. Still
later, the device would transmit its findings to a listening post, most
likely a circling aircraft. The need for secret air penetration deep into a
foreign and hostile power to deliver the monitoring device and additional
similar flights to retrieve the data collected and stored by the machine
raised serious questions as to the system's utility and worth. The S&T

restore the Shah to power. Over the years, the Shah had shown his gratitude by
allowing the Agency to use Iran as a base for electronic and radar surveillance
of the Soviet Union. The CIA station chief in Iran usually maintained much
closer contact with the Shah than the American ambassador. (With the 1973
appointment of former CIA Director Helms to the past of American ambassador in
Iran, any Agency-State conflicts then presumably disappeared.)

for surveillance of the Soviet Union
which it wished to install near the Soviet border in Iran As was normally
the case, CIA representatives carried out most of the negotiations with the
Iranis. However, when Ambassador Armin Meyer was informed of the details of
the proposed agreement, he raised some questions with the CIA station chief that
blossomed into an inter-agency dispute. At this point Meyer cabled the State
Department for instructions and advice.
ade
In the way of background, it should be understood that CIA communications
clerks handle nearly all classified cables between American embassies overseas
and Washington for both the CIA and the State Department. To have a separate
code room for each agency in every embassy would be a wasteful procedure, so a
senior CIA communications expert is regularly assigned to the administrative
part of the State Department in order to oversee CIA's communicators who work
under State cover. In theory, CIA code clerks are not supposed to read the
messages they send for State, but any code clerk who wants to have a successful
career quickly realized that his promotions depend on the CIA and that he is
well advised to show the CIA station chief copies of all important State
messages. The State Department long ago implicitly recognized that its most
secret cables are not secure from CIA inspection by setting up special
communications channels which sppposedly cannot be deciphered by the CIA.

Specialists, fascinated by the technical aspects of the project, seemed, however (164)
oblivious of the dangers involved in secretly flying near a Chinese missile
installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easily appear
to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear
attack. Development of the Costly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The
technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device
in the southwestern U.S. desert usually resulted in the system burying itself
several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation
that the device failed to self-activate and function properly. ]
A third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird,
such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which
could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well
over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble
on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once
over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras
would be turned on to record activities below and relay the information either
to its launch site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated
Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the
CIA in research on this "baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in

one step ahead of Ambassador Meyer. They had figured out a way to intercept
his cables and the replies he received from Washington. So shortly after each
State message was sent, Bob would appear in the CIA executive suite with a copy
of the message for the personal inspection of the Director. Written on top of
each mintercepted cable was a warning that the contents of the cable should be
kept especially confident because State was unaware that the CIA had a copy.
Despite Agency knowledge of all of Meyer's instructions and information,
Meyer and State's director of Iranian Affairs in Washington refused to yield
to Agency pressure for a quick settlement. Even after these two men met at
CIA headquarters with the Deputy Director of CIA, Vice Admiral Rufus Taylor,
they still insisted that the Agency's plans for the new installation were
unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so
aggravated by this continued resistance that he personally telephoned Secretary
of State Rusk to settle the matter. Rusk promptly ended the dispute by agreeing
completely to the CIA position.

Bob was also involved in another series of events which started when FI/D
worked out a liaison arrangement with the codebreaking service of a certain
South American government. This arrangement was ostensibly for the purpose of
allowing the CIA and the other country to cooperate in decoding messages sent
by third countries. However, FI/D tood advantage of the liaison to intercept
the secret communications of the host South American government. Such arrangements
were normal procedure to Bob. The intensely dedicated law and order advocate saw
nothing wrong in practicing this sort of duplicity on an allied government which
cooperated in good faith.
FI/D's liaison with the South American country continued for a long period
of time until relations between the United States and that nation soured over
unrelated issues, and as a result FI/D was forced to break off the relationship.
However, FI/D did not give up hope that the previous working arrangements could
be restored.7

were both quite disturbed by the indident. Negotiations then
ensued to secure the men's release. According to Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the US government offered $3.3 mil-
lion to get them out. Lee claimed that he wanted ten times as
much and consequently took nothing. In any case
In any case, the two CIA
officials were subsequently freed, the newly installed Secretary
of State, Dean Rusk, wrote a secret letter of apology to the
Singapore leader. In 1965, Lee mentioned the affair in a speech
as an example of the type of activities engaged in by the CIA.
The State Department then issued a routine denial furnished by
the CIA--State's press office not realizing the truth of Lee's
charges. Lee reacted by publicly producing Rusk's letter of å-
pology, and State was forced to retract its original statement,
although it still maintained that no ransom had ever been offered.
As well as embarrassing the US government and making headlines
around the world, the incident caused the State Department to
revamp its internal system for making announcements about in-
telligence matters.

Sometime later, Bbb suggested to an officer in the CIA's executive suite ②09
that the Agency should help the South American country obtain a channel in the
international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive
operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency should do this, and the other
CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, was not the American foreign aid program; and

be a matter concerning CIA. Only later did the executive suite officer learn
5

from other sources that FI/D had worked out a deal with the South American
country in which liaison would be restored in return for a Comsat channel (which 9
CIA would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme wen
with a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office.
Eventually, the South American country received the Comsat channel; the
country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that
country's secret messages. 7
Bob's job with FI/D is by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the
Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who
probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in
a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even lies
within the U.S. government not to mention the deceit he and his colleagues
perpetrate on friendly foreign governments which in good faith enter into
liaison agreements with FI/D.
Bob X is one of these bodinary looking people who mow their lawn, love
their wives, and do some very nasty things for the CIA.

Fow other devoted family men who lived in suburban Washington homes
similar to Bob X's are named James McCord and E. Howard Hunt. Both had long,
relatively successful careers with the CIA and rose to roughly the same upper-
middle level of the bureaucracy as Bob X has. McCord was a CIA security
officer, specializing in protecting the Agency's physical facilities. Hunt
was an onerator who plaved a leading role in the Bay of Pigs and who took part

Agency had become involved in a chain of events which forced
it to intervene militarily in a second country to protect its
operation against Cuba. The President may have set the original
policy, but there was no way he could have known that simply
by approving an attack on Cuba, he would set in train Agency
paramilitary activities against Guatamala.
CIA operations can have another unforseen effect on Amer-
ican foreign policy. They can subject the country to blackmail
if something goes wrong. For instance, after th CIA pilot was
shot down and captured by Indonesia in 1958, within five days
the US government approved the sale for local currency of 37,000
tons of American rice and lifted an embargo on $1 million in
small arms and other military equipment. Considering at that
moment, the CIA was actively backing an armed revolution against
the Sukarno regime these would have been strange actions indeed
for the US government to take if it were not extremely concerned
about saving the captured pilot.

A somewhat similar incident occurred in Singapore in 1960
after a CIA lie detector expert was flown specially into the city
to make sure that a locally recruited agent was trustworthy.

cerned about the possible loss of its large electronic surveil-
lance facilities. The view in the intelligence community was
that Makarios had to be mollified at practically all costs.
Finally, government negotiators reached a secret deal with the
wily old archbishop, and he received a special payment of about
$10 million in return for letting the bases remain. The CIA
put up half of the money, using the Director's Contingency Fund
for this unforseen expense.

In general, the presence of American intelligence facili-
ties in a foreign country can have an important effect on Amer-
ican policy toward that country, especially in the Tgird World.
Closely aligned countries, such as England, Jermany, Japan,
ind,
and Australia, have usually allowed the United States to set
up electronic spying bases as part of the general framework of
But to the less developed countries,
the presence of an American installation is both a threat and
an opportunity. The threat comes from domestic opposition for
ces who look on the base as an example of "neo-colonialism”
and use it as a weapon against those in power. The opportunity
arises out of the fact that the United States will pay dearly
for the right to install its eavesdropping equipment--and to
keep it in place, as Archbishop Makarios discovered.

Acting Executive Officer/DDA
Fairways Corporation
REFERENCE:
Attached memorandum from Central Cover Staff
1. With reference to paragraph 4 in the attached memorandum
from Mr. Latta, to the very best of our knowledge the CIA sponsorship
of the Fairways Corporation has not been officially placed in the
public domain. There has been at least one newspaper article relating
to Fairways and, in addition, at least one short television news
item on the same subject. However, official confirmation of the
allegations of a relationship which was made in these media presentations
has been carefully avoided.
2.
There has been official acknowledgement of the fact that
CIA's Office of Training runs a proprietary to provide executive
transportation. Such a statement appeared in the report of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. However, here
again there has been no acknowledgement that such an entity was
identical with or related to the Fairways Corporation.
3. The DDA concurs with the position of CCS as expressed in
paragraph 2 of Mr. Latta's memorandum.

In 1964, it was learned that the American embassy in Moscow had been thoroughly 2
bugged by the KGB. Scores of Soviet audio devices were found throughout the . 3
building. Counterespionage and security specialists determined that the
equipment had been installed in 1952 when the embassy had been renovated, and
that the bugs had been operational for roughly twelve years. The damage report
asserted that during this entire pariod at the height of the cold war

Soviet intelligence had probably intercepted every diplomatic cable between
Washington and the embassy. ☐ his assessment was based on the discovery of election
audio devices in the code room which would have allowed the Soviets to hear
distinctly the sounds being maded by the typewriters and cryptographic equipment.
=
It was a reasonably easy technological feat -- well within Soviet capabilities
to translate such sounds into their true alphabetical meaning ]
14
American suspicions about the Soviet eavesdropping were apparently aroused
early in 1964 when Soviet leader Khrushchev made a remark to Ambassador Fay-Foy
Kohler about Kähler's role in boocking the shipment to the Soviet Union of
steel for an important popeline. Taken in context, Khrushchev's remark indicated
to Kohler that there was a leak somewhere in American security. Kohler started
a massive investigation, and within a month or two, forty-odd bugs were found
embedded in walls throughout the embassy. Although Kohler would later claim
there was no connection between the discovery of the bugs and the investigation
he ordered after his conversation with Khrushchev, the timing would seem to
indicate otherwise.
191
☑In any case, the official damage report concluded that for those twelve
crucial years at the height of the Cold War, the Soviets almost certainly knew
every diplomatic secret which was communicated between the American embassy in
Moscow and Washington. The damage report noted, however, that this Soviet
knowledge may well have worked to the advantage of the United States at least
in one instance in 1953 when the Korean War armistice was being negotiated. At
the time, U.S. bargaining position with the North Koreans was that if a particular

1. Per our telephone conversation today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in
this connection.
2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items
(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on
all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.
3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to
the question in a manner which could have been construed as
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

Review of Deletions from The CIA and the

1.
The responsible and knowledgeable components of this
directorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from subject
book per your request. The review was made to determine whether
each deletion was still classified under EO 11652 or whether the
information in each deletion has been officially released by the
U.S. Government.

by this directorate. Tab B is a list of those items of primary
interest of this directorate. All of these items remain classi-
fied; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released. Tab C
is a list of those items which we determined are still classified
under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be
released, but we recommend that all of the items in Tab C be
coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab D is a list of
items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and
should be referred to other indicated elements. Tab E is a list
of the four items mentioned above which we believe portions can
now be released. The portions in red brackets remain classified
and should not be released.
3. Since many of the deleted items involved the National
Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina-
tions through our contacts at NSA. We were told that any
coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General
Counsel. As a result, no further coordination with other ele-
ments was attempted.

This memorandum completes the DDS&T action on the
court ordered review of the deletions from subject book.

Hussein and the U.S. Government became increasingly concerned about the
strong and strident propaganda voice of Radio Cairo. Both parties shared a
desire to counter its anti-American, anti-Hussein line (which was no
not (new),
so the CIA funded the building of a Jordanian television station. A CIA
owned, New York based proprietary company, named RTV, provided the technical
expertise and management skills to put the station in operation.]
Still another example of a country where the CIA enjoys a special
relationship is Nationalist China. On Taiwan, however, the CIA's link is
not with President Chiang Kai-shek but with his son and heir apparent,
Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo. One former CIA chief of station, Ray Cline, now the
State Department's Director of Intelligence and Research, became something
of a legend within the Clandestine Services because of his frequent all-
night drinking bouts with the younger Chiang.

Over the years, the CIA closely collaborated with the Nationalists first
to run guerrilla attacks against mainland China and then in more recent
years to use Taiwan as a base for U-2 flights (flown over China by Nationalist
pilots trained in the United States), electronic surveillance of the mainland
and such covert action programs as propaganda and disinformation aimed at
China during the Cultural Revolution. ]
In South Vietaam, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker insisted on personally
conducting all important meetings with President Thieu; sometimes Bunker was

accompanied by the CIA chief when there was Agency business to be discussed.
But there has been another CIA officer in Saigon who has known Thieu for
many years and who has retained access to the Vietnamese President.
According to a former assistant to Ambassador Bunker, this CIA officer has
served as conduit between Thieu and the American government when a formal
meeting is not desired or when Thieu wishes to float an idea.

Some intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receive
large numbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from
actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance
(which is, by definition, an accurate account of what was said) with agent
reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services
confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose
function it is to analyze foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make.
decisions based on that intelligence analysis.
☐ In the mid-1960s, the Far East Division of the Clandestine Services and
159
the experts of the Scientific and Technical Directorate combinedd forces to
carry out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)
intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level
U.S. government officials were disturbed by reports that Communist China was on
the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.
They knew that the threat posed by Chinese ICBM's would play an important part
in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-
ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As a matter of the highest
priority, the CIA was told to find out what was happening at Shuangch'engtze, the
Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.
The Agency's technical specialists responded by designing a nuclear-
ppwered device which could monitor certain key electronic emissions coming from
the missile site, well over a thousand miles away, and then rely the information
to a CIA listening post. The plan was to emplace the device on a mountain
peak called the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the
Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to
the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA
Laboratories, the Clandestine Services took on the responsibility for the mos☑SECRET

The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the
Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the
CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not
only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project.
Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry
the device, complete with its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it.
into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered
Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.
Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an experienced
CIA case officer.
S

That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian
climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret
CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn
how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top of Nanda Devi.
Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international
mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an
ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the
technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the
CIA chief of station in Delhi reported that all logistical and cover arrangements
with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was
clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport
plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were
brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from
where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda
Devi.
Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the
Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking
too much weight. The CIA case officer redistributed the load by convincing the

would do. Progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base
camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by
a small party of climbers accompanied by a few porters. Soon after the
group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to
tell the CIA man, who had remained behind to handle communications with the
staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes.
The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in
an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now well off
schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition
because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency
operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its
target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures
well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into
operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news
of the successful installation was sadioed back to the staging area.
But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been
sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to fly over
the mountain and photograph the monitoring site. It was learned that the
device had been knocked over by a snow slide. When the Indian government
was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi
that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headgaters of the sacred
Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about
religious pollution, not ecological.
The CIA reacted by planning another climbe of the mountain for the following
year, both to retrieve the damaged equipment and implace a new monitoring
system
--
this one powered by a non-nuclear generator. The climbing team,
led by Bishop, was gathered together again and this time it reached the
top of the mountain with comparatively little difficulty. The new device was
set up, but after an extensive search, the atomic generator from the year

stopped working. This time the failure was attributed to a mechanical

malfunction.
At this point, the Agency gave up on mountain-top monitoring of the
Communist Chinese missile program, turning to other systems and new, improved
satellites for acquiring the information it was seeking. The Indians were
thanked and compensated for their cooperation. The American climbers were
presented with secret medals by a grateful, but disappointed, CIA.

The fertile imaginations of the S&T experts during the following
years produced many more unique coblrction schemes aimed at solving the
mysteries of China's strategic missile program. Most eventually proved to be
unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.
The silliest of them all, however, called for the creation of a small one-man
airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In
concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into
the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would
assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.
Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with
this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.
A second system was a device, long and tubular like a rocket, that could 163
be dropped by a U-2 or another aircraft near the missile test site, its fall
slowed by a parachute so that the device would penetrate only two or three
feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the system, an aerial rising from
its top, would activate itself and perform its electronic sensing tasks. Still
later, the device would transmit its findings to a listening post, most
likely a circling aircraft. The need for secret air penetration deep into a
foreign and hostile power to deliver the monitoring device and additional
similar flights to retrieve the data collected and stored by the machine
raised serious questions as to the system's utility and worth. The S&T

Agency had become involved in a chain of events which forced
it to intervene militarily in a second country to protect its
operation against Cuba. The President may have set the original
policy, but there was no way he could have known that simply
by approving an attack on Cuba, he would set in train Agency
paramilitary activities against Guatamala.
CIA operations can have another unforseen effect on Amer-
ican foreign policy. They
can subject the country to blackmail
if something goes wrong. For instance, after th CIA pilot was
shot down and captured by Indonesia in 1958, within five days
the US government approved the sale for local currency of 37.000.
tons of American rice and lifted an embargo on $1 million in
small arms and other military equipment. Considering at that
moment, the CIA was actively backing an armed revolution against
the Sukarno regime these would have been strange actions indeed
for the US government to take if it were not extremely concerned
about saving the captured pilot.

A somewhat similar incident occurred in Singapore in 1960
after a CIA lie detector expert was flown specially into the city
to make sure that a locally recruited agent was trustworthy.

lations from his island. The CIA had a major interest in the
matter, sit operated a Foreign Broadcast Information Ser-
vice FBI3) listening post there, and the Pentagon was also con-
cerned about the possible loss of its large electronic surveil
lance facilities. The view in the intelligence community was
that Makarios had to be mollified at practically all costs.
Finally, government negotiators reached a secret deal with the
wily old archbishop, and he received a special payment of about
$10 million in return for letting the bases remain. The CIA
put up half of the money, using the Director's Contingency Fund
for this unforseen expense.

In general, the presence of American intelligence facili-
ties in a foreign country can have an important effect on Amer-
ican policy toward that country, especially in the Tgird World.
Closely aligned countries, such as England, Jermany, Japan,
and Australia, have usually allowed the United States to set
up electronic spying bases as part of the general framework of
cooperation between allies. But to the less developed countries,
the presence of an American installation is both a threat and
an opportunity. The threat comes from domestic opposition for-
ces who look on the base as an example of "neo-colonialism"
and use it as a weapon against those in power. The opportunity
arises out of the fact that the United States will pay dearly
for the right to install its eavesdropping equipment--and to
keep it in place, as Archbishop Makarios discovered.

specialists, fascinated by the technical aspects of the project, seemed, however (1641

oblivious of the dangers involved in secretly flying near a Chinese missile
installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easily appear
to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear
attack. Development of the Costly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The
technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device
in the southwestern U.S. desert usually resulted in the system burying itself
several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation
that the device failed to self-activate and function properly. 7

A third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird,
such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which
could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well
over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble
on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once
over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras
would be turned on to record activities below and relay the information either
to its launch site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated
Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the
CIA in research on this "baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in
to be,
the state of the technical arts. Its chief advantage was of course, that if
and when it was shot down there would be no pilot to confess it had been on an
Agency-sponsored spying mission. ]
The technical difficulties involved in the air-drop] system and the model
J airplane device were too great and time consuming for either to be fully
developed by their inventors before improvements in intelligence satellite
surveillance programs were achieved, thus negating the justifying requirement
for these questionable and potentially provocative collection systems before
they could be put into operation. Other clandestine collection devices
more sensibly contrived, most, however, of dubious value -- were also being

lie detector man, a CIA case officer, and the local agent were
soon all under arrest. The Singapore government and the British,
who were in the process of granting Singapore its independence,
were both quite disturbed by the indident. Negotiations then
ensued to secure the men's release. According to Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the US government offered $3.3 mil-
lion to get them out. Lee claimed that he wanted ten times as
much and consequently took nothing. In any case, the two CIA
officials were subsequently freed, the newly installed Secretary
of State, Dean Rusk, wrote a secret letter of apology to the
Singapore leader. In 1965, Lee mentioned the affair in a speech
as an example of the type of activities engaged in by the CIA.
The State Department then issued a routine denial furnished by
the CIA--State's press office not realizing the truth of Lee's
charges. Lee reacted by publicly producing Rusk's letter of d-
pology, and State was forced to retract its original statement,
although it still maintained that no ransom had ever been offered.
As well as embarrassing the US government and making headlines
around the world, the incident caused the State Department to
revamp its internal system for making announcements about in-
telligence matters.

that the Agency should help the South American country obtain a channel in the
international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive
operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency should do this, and the other
CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, was not the American foreign aid program; and
wether or not this particular country received a Comsat channel did not seem to
be a matter concerning CIA. Only later did the executive suite officer learn
from other sources that FI/D had worked out a deal with the South American
country in which liaison would be restored in return for a Comsat channel (which
CIA would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme wen
with a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office.
Eventually, the South American country received the Comsat channel; the
country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that
country's secret messages.]
:
Bob's job with FI/D is by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the
Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who
probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in
--
a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even lies
within the U.S. government not to mention the deceit he and his colleagues
perpetrate on friendly foreign governments which in good faith enter into
liaison agreements with FI/D.
Bob X is one of these bodinary looking people who mow their lawn, love
their wives, and do some very nasty things for the CIA.
Two
Tow other devoted family men who lived in suburban Washington homes
similar to Bob X's are named James McCord and E. Howard Hunt. Both had long,
relatively successful careers with the CIA and rose to roughly the same upper-
middle level of the bureaucracy as Bob X has. McCord was a CIA security
officer, specializing in protecting the Agency's physical facilities. Hunt
was an onerator who plaved a leading role in the Bay of Pigs and who took part

( situation. in private with his superiors. But Bob and his cohorts at FI/D were
one step ahead of Ambassador Meyer. They had figured out a way to intercept
his cables and the replies he received from Washington. So shortly after each
State message was sent, Bob would appear in the CIA executive suite with a copy
of the message for the personal inspection of the Director. Written on top of
each mntercepted cable was a warning that the contents of the cable should be
kept especially confident because State was unaware that the CIA had a copy.
Despite Agency knowledge of all of Meyer's instructions and information, ]
Meyer and State's director of Iranian Affairs in Washington refused to yield
to Agency pressure for a quick settlement. Even after these two men met at
CIA headquarters with the Deputy Director of CIA, Vice Admiral Rufus Taylor,
they still insisted that the Agency's plans for the new installation were
unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so
aggravated by this continued resistance that he personally telephoned Secretary
of State Rusk to settle the matter. Rusk promptly ended the dispute by agreeing
completely to the CIA position.
[ Bob was also involved in another series of events which started when FI/D

worked out a liaison arrangement with the codebreaking service of a certain
South American government. This arrangement was ostensibly for the purpose of
allowing the CIA and the other country to cooperate in decoding messages sent
by third countries. However, FI/D tood advantage of the liaison to intercept
the secret communications of the host South American government. Such arrangements
were normal procedure to Bob. The intensely dedicated law and order advocate saw
nothing wrong in practicing this sort of duplicity on an allied government which
cooperated in good faith.
FI/D's liaison with the South American country continued for a long period
of time until relations between the United States and that nation soured over
unrelated issues, and as a result FI/D was forced to break off the relationship.
However, FI/D did not give up hope that the previous working arrangements could
be restored. 7

A. There are three basic questions
hat come up. In the first place, I do
Ivor at least an automatic vote by
residential electors once the general
ection is completed. I think the Elec-
oral College, for instance, should be
iminated. Whether the ratio among
cates of votes ought to be changed

hancing of Congres-
onal elections by public funds-it has
roved to be successful, I believe, in
e Presidential election. I strongly
avor that, yes. And the other element
the overall package would be a sim-
le way for American people who are
tizens and 18 years old to register
> vote. And I am committed to that
roposition and the Vice President has
raciously consented to take on this
verall election process responsibility.
hose three will be basic elements of
e proposals.
10. Relations With Cuba
Q. Mr. President, are you prepared
lift the trade embargo against Cuba
; one step toward normalizing rela-
ons?
A, I think any substantial move in
ir relationship with Cuba would have
▸ await further discussions with them..
directly, and also some tangible evi-
ence on our part that they are willing
▸ restore basic human rights in Cuba,
volving the number of prisoners who
e being held, their attitude toward
verseas adventures such as the one
Angola, and other matters. So I can't
y what might come in the future.
I'm willing, though, to discuss these
atters with the Cuban leaders. At this
me we have no direct relationships
ith them, political. But through inter-
ediarics comments are being ex-
langed back and forth. Most of my
omments are in public statements like
is, but we do have messages coming
ick from people who visit Ouba.
11. Defense Savings Goal
Q. In answer to an earlier question,
r. President, you said that you could-
t say whether next year's defense
udget will be lower or higher than
is year's. But as I understood your
arlier postion, you did want to achieve
five to seven billion dollar savings
gardless of the overall level of spend-
g. Do you still hold with that figure?
that still your goal and a commit-
ent?
A. Yes. The analyses that I've made
the defense budget so far-which
; you know has been limited to about
month's study just part-time-indi-
ate that that's a goal that will be
ached.
12. Natural Gas Deregulation
Q. Mr. President, in letters to the
overnors of Oklahoma, Texas and
buisiana last October, you said uncon-
tionally that you would work with
ongress to deregulate new natural
as. And I wondered if you planned
▸ keep that promise, and if so how
ou will go about it?
A. I don't know how I'll go about
I do try to keep my promises. The
osition that I have taken, and the
osition that the governors of Oklaho-
a and Texas took at governors con-
rences to which I was referring, was
e deregulation of natural gas for a
mited period of time, four to five
ears, to see how it works out, leaving
xisting contracts in effect.
"
"
is not to cause sacrifice or hardship
among the American people.Unless I
can demonstrate that in balance the
temporary sacrifices in a certain area
are far overcome by immediate and ul-
timate benefits then nobody's going to
buy it.
And I believe that we've now got
such a horrible conglomeration of con-
fusion in the energy field that nobody
knows what's going to happen next.
So I think that the sacrifices will be
far overcome by the benefits that the
American people will be easily able to
discern for themselves.
-
15. U.S. Roon Canada
Q. You said that in spite of the fact
that the Canadian people would have
to determine their future for them-
selves, particularly in regard to the
separatism issue in Quebec that you
had confidence that the issue would
be straightened out relatively peaceful-
ly. Do you really think that there is
little concern in this country about the
future of a unified Canada and is there
anything really that we can do about
it?
A. There's a great deal of concern
in this country about the future of
Canada and I have complete confi-
dence, as I said in an interview with
the Canadian news media in the sound
judgment of the Canadian people.
I'm familiar-and even more familiar
I today than I was two days ago after
Prime Minister Trudeau's visit-with
the problems in Quebec and the inclina-
tion of some of the French Canadians
to have an independent status from the
rest of Canadian Provinces.
I don't know what's going to be the
ultimate outcome. But I believe that
we are so closely tied together with
Canada on a mutually beneficial basis,
sharing problems, sharing opportuni-
ties, sharing trade, sharing manufactur-
ing companies that have joint owner-
ship, our exchange of energy sources,
our sharing of the St. Lawrence Sea-
way, the Great Lakes as far as water
pollution is concerned, the bringing of
Alaskan oil and natural gas down to
us that we have got to have a continu-
ing relationship with Canada.
My own personal preference would
be that the commonwealth stay as it
is and that there not be a separate

in the Middle East, all of them, before
the end of May. The first visit of one
of those leaders will be Mr. Rabin: L
believe, March 12. And he will be fol:
lowed by the leaders from Egypt, from
Jordan and from Syria, from Saudia
Arabia and I look forward to meeting
with them.
At that point I hope I will have a
very clear picture of what rule the
American Government ought to play.
The same thing applies to the situa
tion that exists between ourselves and
Turkey, ourselves and Greece, our-
selves and Cyprus.
We can't impose our will an other
people. But if they honestly want to
seek a solution, we are perfectly will-
ing to offer our good offices as a coun-
try with influence and interest to help
them resolve their own differences. But
it's got to be done primarily by those
countries involved.
We have begun again, and within
the last week, our discussions on the
Panama Canal Treaty. We have two!
extremely good negotiators and I hope
that we will have success there. There's,
no way that I can say at this point i
what degree of progress we have made.
It's just beginning.
So throughout the areas of high dis-
pute, including South Africa and others
that I don't have time to mention we're
probing as best we can to discern some
possibility of resolution of those ten-
sion areas.
We are meeting today, in fact all
this week with the British, to try to
get a renewed proposal to make con-
cerning the question surrounding Rho-
desia. And then, of course, we'll still
have left Nambia and ultimately ma
jority rule question in South Africa.
But I've only been in office a month.
I don't claim to know all the easy an
swers. And these questions that have
are not going to be easy to solve. But
we're going to do the best we can open.

services, not trying to impose our will
on other people.

Quebec province. But that's a decision And U.S.-Uganda Ties
for the Canadians to make and I would
certainly make no private or public
move to try to determine the outcome
of that great debate.
16. Keeping Campaign Promises
Q. Mr. President, you've had a month
now to enjoy the view from the Oval
Office. Do you think you'll be able to
keep fully all the campaign promises
you made?
A. As you know, we have issued what
I believe is the complete book of my
campaign promises, which is, I pre-
sume, being made available to all of
you. My determination is to keep all
those promises.
Obviously if circumstances should
change I would have to reserve the
right to go back to the American people
and say "now that circumstances have
changed this a better approach to that
particular problem." But I will do my
utmost to keep all the campaign prom-
ises that I made to the American peo-
ple.
17. Production of B-1
Q. Mr. President, you said at various
times during the campaign that the B-1
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (AP)-Presi-
dent Carter made two errors in his
news conference today, which
which the
White House staff later corrected.
!
Mr. Carter used a wrong date for
the forthcoming visit to the United..
States of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
of Israel. The President said that he
thought the visit would take place
1
March 12.
The White House later corrected that
to say "the proposed visit is tentatively
planned for March 7 and 8.”
The White House also corrected the
President's statement that the United
States does not have diplomatic rela-
tions with Uganda.
"This is not strictly accurate," the
correction said, explaining:
"While the United States has with-
drawn its mission from Uganda and..
has no direct diplomatic representation
there, United States affairs in the
Republic of Uganda are carried out..
through the West German embassy and
the Republic of Uganda has an operat-
ing embassy and charge d'affaires in
Washington."

the impropriety or the illegality does
not exist on any ongoing C.I.A. opera-
tion.
8. Problems With Congress
Q. Mr. President, Charles Kirbo, your
friend Charles Kirbo seems to feel that
you're going to be having a continuing
problem with the Congress and that
you'll have to go over Congress's head
to the people in order to get results.
Is this true?
A. I think if you read the whole
statement that Mr. Kirbo made, which
is just a private citizen's opinion, he
would say that every President has had
arguments and debates and disagree-
ments with the Congress. And I think
that's inevitable in our system of Gov-
ernment. That's part of the checks and
balances that's very precious to us all.
I have found up to now a growing.
sense of cooperation with the Congress.
I think last week when I was asked
roughly the same question that the
troubles were perhaps underestimated
by the news media. I think now per-
haps the troubles with the Congress
are overestimated. I have frequent
meetings with the Congressional lead-
ers both Democratic. and Republican.
And I think that the progress of the
legislation that we consider to be cru-
cial which seemed to be moving very
slowly in the past is now speeding up.
So I don't believe that we'll have
nearly the problems with the Congress
that has been the case in recent years.
And I have to say in summary that
I am very pleased with my relationship
with the Congress now.
9. The Election Process
Q. Mr. President, in view of your
assignment to Vice President Mondale
regarding the election laws, could you
give us your view, sir, on the direct
1.-
But I will work with Congress on
the deregulation of natural gas as a
part of an overall energy policy. By
April 20 I think we'll be prepared to
present to you, the news media, and
the people and the Congress more
specific proposals involving direct
legislation proposals that will answer
your question more fully.
13. Energy Program Sacrifices.
Q. Mr. President, we've been told that
the central thrust of your new energy
program will involve sacrifice and
voluntary conservation, yet the public's.
always reading stories in the paper of
how the major oil companies are with-
holding natural gas. So I'd like to ask
how are you going to expect the public
to make sacrifices when there's such
widespread public suspicion about the
role of the oil companies in the energy
crisis.
K
A. I think the comprehensive nature
of the proposal that takes in all these
very disparate and sometimes conflict-
ing elements at one time and a long-
range projection of our needs and a
tangible demonstration to the Ameri
can people, to the extent that I'm able
to put it forward, that there will be
direct ultimate benefits to them will
be the elements that will cause them'
to make those sacrifices. At the same
time, I want to increase the surety that
we have that the reserve supply data
given to us by the oil companies and
others are accurate.
We are now conducting some admit-
tedly superficial studies by Secretacy
Cecil Andrus in Interior and also they'll
be followed up by more detailed studies
under Dr. Schlesinger, to see whether
or not the reserve supplies are ade-
quate and whether or not the oil com-
panies are giving us accurate data. I
think it's obvious to all of us that there
are some instances where natural gas
is withheld from the market. That's
understandable. If I was running an
oil company I would reserve the right
to release or to reserve some supplies
of natural gas.
With the emergency legislation that
the Congress did pass, I think in about
a week of assessment during the frigid
part of the winter-it's still very cold-
we were given some authority to buy.
extra gas at a very high price. This
is obviously a transcient circumstance.
But I believe the American people
will be willing to make the sacrifices
required, if they are convinced that fu-
ture reports will be accurate, that sup-
plies will not be withheld from the mar-
ket and if we can let the oil companies
know in a predictable way what our
policy will be two months or two years
or 20 years in the future-within the
bounds of human reason-then I think
they'll be much less likely to withhold
supplies of oil and natural. gas from
the market just hoping that they'll get
some bonanza increased price in the
future if the policies do change.
14. Rise in Gasoline Tax
Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri-
fices that you say your upcoming ener-
gy program is going to demand. Is it
likely that one of those sacrifices is
going to come in the form of a largely
increased Federal gasoline tax?
A. I don't know how to answer your
was a waste. You also promised to cut:
the waste out of the defense budget,
When would you expect to stop
production of the B-1 as opposed to
research and development on the B-1?
""
A. I think I cut out about more than
$200 million from the B-1 program in
the budget just submitted to the Con
gress. I have serious questions about
whether or not the B-1 ought to be
in the future the center of our airborne.
defense capability.
I have several more months before.
I have to make a decision on that mate:
ter and the National Security Council,
which combines, as you know, State,:"
Treasury, Defense and other elements
of the Government, working very close::
ly with me, is now making a complete
reassessment of the need for the B-L
bomber.
I don't know whether we will decide:
to go on with it or not. And I don't
know whether we'll expedite produce
tion of it or not, at this time.
Part of the factor to be assessed is.
the attitude of the Soviet Union. If we
can have a general lessening of tension,
a demonstrated commitment on their
part toward disarmament, it would cer
tainly make it less likely that we would
go ahead with the B-1.
But I can't answer that question unti
I complete my own study, and I think
that would have to be terminated by
the end of May.
. t
18. Campaign Financing Law..
Q. Mr. President, I was a little unclear
about what you're going to propose
in the campaign finance law. Are you
saying that you will propose to have
alf Congressional elections publicly fi-
nanced? A. That's my preference, yes.
Q. Is that what you will propose to
Congress? A. The Vice President is now
doing a study on a complete election
law package. And I'd like to reserve
my own judgment until I see what his
report is to me. But that's my own
inclination. It's a position that I took
during the campaign and so far. I have
no reason to change my mind.
19. Foreign Policy Turntable the
Q. You gave us a kind of a timetable
for your domestic program in your pre-
liminary statement. I wonder if you
have a similar timetable of what you
hope to achieve in foreign policy be-
tween now and the end of the year,
such as Middle East peace, Cyprus, the
treaty with Panama.
A. Of course I can't answer that
question specifically because I don't
know what cooperation we will get
from other nations and I don't know,
what the inclination of those nations
in disputed regions of the world want
to do toward one another.
Secretary Cyrus Vance has just re
turned from what I consider to be a
very successful trip to the Middle East.,

those Governments and their Cabinet.

lic and private on the controversial,

And I have to say in summary that
I am very pleased with my relationship
with the Congress now.
9. The Election Process
Q. Mr. President, in view of your
assignment to Vice President Mondale
regarding the election laws, could you
give us your view, sir, on the direct
election of a President versus the Elec-
toral College. And also do you think
that the public financing should be ex-
tended to Congress as well as the Presi-
dency?
A. There are three basic questions
that come up. In the first place, I do
favor at least an automatic vote by
Presidential electors once the general
election is completed. I think the Elec-
toral College, for instance, should be
eliminated. Whether the ratio among
states of votes ought to be changed
I'm not prepared to comment on now.
the anaticing of Congres-
sional elections by public funds-it has
proved to be successful, I believe, in
the Presidential election. I strongly
favor that, yes. And the other element
of the overall package would be a sim-
ple way for American people who are
citizens and 18 years old to register
to vote. And I am committed to that
proposition and the Vice President has
graciously consented to take on this
overall election process responsibility.
Those three will be basic elements of
the proposals.
10. Relations With Cuba
Q. Mr. President, are you prepared
to lift the tradé embargo 'against Cuba
as one step toward normalizing rela-
tions?
A. I think any substantial move in
our relationship with Cuba would have
to await further discussions with them
indirectly, and also some tangible evi-
dence on our part that they are willing.
to restore basic human rights in Cuba,
involving the number of prisoners who
are being held, their attitude toward
overseas adventures such as the one
In Angola, and other matters. So I can't
say what might come in the future.
I'm willing, though, to discuss these
matters with the Cuban leaders. At this
time we have no direct relationships
with them, political. But through inter-
mediaries comments are being ex-
changed back and forth. Most of my
comments are in public statements like
this, but we do have messages coming
back from people who visit Cuba.
11. Defense Savings Goal
Q. In answer to an earlier question,
Mr. President, you said that you could-
n't say whether next year's defense
budget will be lower or higher than
this year's. But as I understood your
earlier postion, you did want to achieve
a five to seven billion dollar savings
regardless of the overall level of spend-
ing. Do you still hold with that figure?
is that still your goal and a commit-
nent?
A. Yes. The analyses that I've made
of the defense budget so far-which
is you know has been limited to about
month's study just part-time-indi-
ate that that's a goal that will be
jeached.
12. Natural Gas Deregulation
Q. Mr. President, in letters to the
governors of Oklahoma, Texas and
Louisiana last October, you said uncon-
ditionally that you would work with
Congress to deregulate new natural
gas. And I wondered if you planned
to keep that promise, and if so how

Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri-
fices that you say your upcoming ener-
gy program is going to demand. Is it
likely that one of those sacrifices is
going to come in the form of a largely
increased Federal gasoline tax?
A. I don't know how to answer your
questions about specifics of the propos-
al. I want to make this clear. The pur-
pose of the energy policy evolution
is not to cause sacrifice or hardship
among the American people.Unless I
can demonstrate that in balance the
temporary sacrifices in a certain area
are far overcome by immediate and ul-

And I believe that we've now got

So I think that the sacrifices will be

American people will be easily able to

24 FEB 1977 THE ALW YORK TIMES
Transcript of the President's News Con
Following is a transcript of Presi-
dent Carter's news conference in
Washington yesterday afternoon, as
recorded by The New York Times
through the facilities of ABC News:
Opening Statement is
Good afternoon everybody. I'd like
to make a very brief statement as a
progress report to the American people
of some items that are important to
i us.
i
We have submitted and the Congress
is now considering legislation to give
me the authority to reorganize the
executive branch of Government. The
Senate Committee under Senator Ribic-
off has now completed their hearings
and they'll be marking up the bill
beginning tomorrow.
The House Committee on Govern-
ment Operations under Congressman
Jack Brooks has scheduled hearings to
begin on March 1.
So because of the interest of the
'American people and the Congress and
myself in completing this very crucial
project I think the Congress is moving
with great expedition to give me that
authority.
We've also initiated with directions.
to the members of the Cabinet and
other agency heads a new program to
cut down on the extremely great over-
load of paper work with a requirement
that those who prepare Government
regulations be responsible for the
preparation assigned them. I've asked
my Cabinet officers to read the regula-
tions that are forthcoming from their
departments each week until they see
the volume and the complexity of them,
and we hope to eliminate unnecessary
regulations, abbreviate those that are
necessary and express them in a lan-
guage so that we can all understand
them.
I've also asked major elements of
our own society, the university profes-
· sors and the state officials in this last
week to give me their suggestions on

President Carter walking past reporters after news conference at the E:
I'm not going to leave of not comment-
ing directly on any specific C.I.A. ac-
tivity. But I can tell you that I have
begun a complete analysis which will
be completed within the next week of
all activities by the C.I.A. I've received
substantial reports already.
I've reviewed the more controversial
revelations that have been publicized
in the last few days, some quite errone-
ous, some with some degree of accura-
cy. These same operations have been
reviewed by the Intelligence Oversight
Board, an independent board, and also
by my predecessory, President Ford.
I have not found anything illegal or
improper.
If in future assessments, which will.
come quite early, I discover such an
impropriety or an illegality I will not
only take immediate action to correct
it but also will let the American people
know about it.
.
I might say this. This is a very serious
problem of how in a democracy to have
adequate intelligence gathered, as-
sessed and used to guarantee the se-
curity of our country. It's not part of
the American nature to do things in
secret. Obviously, historically and still
at this modern time there is a necessity
to protect sources of information from
other nations. Sometimes other Gov-
ernments cooperate with us fully;
sometimes they don't.
But I'll try to be sure, and so will
Stan. Turner, who will be the next
director of the intelligence community.
He will try to be sure that every thing
we do is not only proper and legal,
but also compatible with the attitudes
of the American people.
One other point I'd like to make is
this. It can be extremely damaging to
our relationship with other nations, to

6. Human Rights Abroad
Q. In your letter to Mr. Sakharov
you said that the United States would
use its good offices to seek the release
of prisoners of conscience. And you
said that you wanted to continue to
shape a world responsible to human
aspirations. As you know there are
human rights problems in many other
countries. And some of them like Iran
or the Philippines we support with
arms, or we support with American aid.
These are countries where many people
believe we have more leverage than
we might have in the Soviet Union.
What if anything do you plan to try
to do to help victims of political repres.
sion in these countries?
A. I think without my trying to take
credit for it there has been a substan-
tial move toward concern about human
rights throughout the world. I think
this has taken place in probably ‘a
dozen or more different couries.
There's an arousing interest in the posi-
tion that our own Government here in
our free country does take. Obviously
there are deprivations of human rights
even more brutal than the ones on
which we've commented up to now.
In Uganda the actions there have dis-
gusted the entire civilized world and,
as you know, we have no diplomatic
relationships with Uganda. But he e is
an instance where both Ambassador
Andrew Young and I have expressed
great concern about what is there. The
British are now considering asking the
United Nations to go into Uganda to
assess the horrible murders that appar-
ently are taking place in that country-

on the American consciousness and our
society, and I hope it will be compre-
hensive enough so that it can be well-
balanced and fair to all.
We are quite concerned about the
pressures of nation. The advisers to
me on economics are trying to assess
all Government programs and private
actions that contribute to inflationary
pressures. When this analysis is done

cerns and possibly corrective actions
to the American people as well.

And the last point is that we will
have a complete: analysis underway
Now an deregulation. And the first
question is the deregulation of the air
lines. Legislation is in the Congress
now. We'll be submitting a message
to Congress very shortly on that sub-
ject. We will not submit administration
legislation because the Congress has
already moved substantially forward in
dealing with this important issue.
And now I'd like to answer questions.
Mr. Frank Cormier.
Questions and Answers
1. Defense Budget
Q. Mr. President, you told the Demo-
cratic Platform. Committee that you
thought present defense expenditures
could be reduced by five to seven bil-
dion dollars. Now I think you may have
modified your position somewhat since
then. Obviously in your short time in
office you didn't find the opportunity
to make cuts like that in your precedes-
sor's budget. But isn't it also likely
that next year's budget for the defense
will exceed this year's.
i
A. Well because of inflationary pres-
sures and because of an impossibility
of assessing the potential threat to our
country from other nations, it's hard
to predict exactly what the level of
defense spending will be. In the short
time that we had available to work
on the previous Administration's budg-
et-about three weeks of hard work-
we were able to reduce the suggested
expenditures by almost $3 billion. I
think about $2.75 billion.
-
This was done-and I think Senator
Stennis in his recent public statements
has confirmed that it has been done
without weakening our own defense
capability. And the substantial savings
in defense spending that will still leave
us muscle will be in such things as
the standardization of weapons, long-
range planning, a more businesslike al-
location of defense contracting, an as-
sessment of the defense contracts for
construction or
or repair already out-
standing.
· A reassessment of priorities of the
evolution of new weapons which in the
future can become enormously expen-
sive; a longer assignment of military
personnel to a base before they are
transferred; some emphasis on the cor-
rection of inequities and unfairnesses
in the retirement system.
These things obviously can't be done
in three weeks, but they will be an
ongoing effort on my part. And I think

ministration's first hudent

other nations. Sometimes other Göv

sometimes they don't.

Stan. Turner, who will be the next
director of the intelligence community.
He will try to be sure that every thing
we do is not only proper and legal,
but also compatible with the attitudes
of the American people.
One other point I'd like to make is
this. It can be extremely damaging to
our relationship with other nations, to
the potential security of our country
even in peacetime, for these kinds of
operations which are legitimate and
proper to be revealed. It makes it hard
for us to lay a ground work on which
we might predicate a successful meet-
ing of a threat to us in time of war
if we don't have some degree of secre. ·
cy.
'
I'm quite concerned about the num-.
ber of people now who have access
to this kind of information. And I've
been working very; closely with the
Congressional leaders, yesterday and
today, to try to reduce the overall num-
ber of people who have access to the
sources of information that within the
bounds that I've described propriety
and legality and American attitudes to-
ward secre-I'll do the best I can
not ever to make a mistake. And I'm
also assuming on a continuing basis
a direct personal reponsibility for the
operation of all the ingelligence agen-
cies in our Government to make sure
that they are meeting these standards.
3. Correcting Errors on C.I.A.
Q. If there has been erroneous infor-
mation, wouldn't it behoove you to cor-
rect the record?
A. In some ways we are correcting
n¨s
pute or confirm every individual story
the record, but if I began to either dis-
that's written whether correct or er-
roneous on every matter relating to
the C.I.A., then these matters which
are necessarily secret would no longer
be secret, so I'm not going to comment
on individual items that relate to intel-
ligence.
4. Difference With Meany
Q. Mr. President, George Meany says.
he won't go along with your idea for
pre-notification on wage and price in-
creases. And my question really is, how
hard, are you going to press Mr. Meany
to go along and do you have anything
else in mind that you could use in the
way of Government involving itself to
try to control inflation?
A. I announced earlier my firm com
mitment not to have mandatory wage
and price laws or authority, not to have
standby wage and price authority. I've
not made any proposal to Mr. Meany
or any other labor leader nor to any.
representative of industry or manufac-
turing. But I will retain the option in
the future of assessing what we need
to do to control inflation.
I've emphasized always the word
"voluntary." And to the extent that
I can arrive at a common understand-
ing with industry and labor leaders that
a certain amount of cooperation and
information can be exchanged before
a major proposal is made. I think that's
a legitimate pursuit of mine. I can't
force it. It's got to be voluntary. And
that's as far as I can go with my an-
swer.

aroused the ire of Mr. Amin.
1770
I've express my concern abo
prisoned path rers in chach
Korea, in Cuba, in many countris ---in
several countries, rather, in Suth
America and I'll continue to do so. I
have never had an inclination to single
out the Soviet Union as the only place
where human rights are being abridged.
We have, I think, a responsibility and
a legal right to express our disapproval
of violations of human rights. The Hel
sinki Agreement,
.
Rocket:
Three Provision, insures that some of
these human rights shall be preserved.
We are a signatory of the Helsinki
agreement. We are ourselves culpable
in some ways for not giving people
adequate rights to move around our
country or restricting unnecessarily, in
my opinion, visitation to this country
by those who disagree with us political-
ly.
So I think that we all ought to take
a position in our own country and
among our friends and allies, among
our potential adversaries, that human
rights is something on which we should
bear a major responsibility for leader-
ship. And I have made it clear to the
Soviet Union and to others in the East-
ern European community that I'm not
trying to launch a unilateral criticism
of them, that I'm trying to set a stand-
ard in our own country and make my
concerns expressed throughout the
world, not singled out against any par-
ticular country.
Q. Mr. President, the other day, get-
ting back to this C.I.A. thing, when
that story broke your Press Secretary,
when he issued what amounted to a
"no comment" by the White House.
someone asked him if this story had
broken back during the campaign when
you were running for Presiden, would
you have given a similar response? And
he said "well I don't know." So can
I ask you, what would have been your
response? Would it have been the
same? A. I don't know.
7. Review of C.I.A. Activities
Q. Mr. President, on that same sub-
ject, you said earlier that your review
of C.I.A. activities had found nothing
illegal or improper and you later said
that these activities are legitimate and
proper. Isn't that a value judgment that
the American public might like to
share? But how can they if you refuse
to' give them any idea of what you
have discovered during this review
about payments, including ones made
in secret?
A. That is a value judgment. It's made
by the independent Intelligence Over-
sight Board, which was established and
appointed by President Ford. This
board has made itself available to the
Inspector General and to any employee
within the C.I.A. or within the defense
intelligence agencies or any other to.
receive even rumors of impropriety.

WASHINGTON POST
CIA Admits
Working to
Raise Sub
By Timothy S. Robinson
Washington Post Staff Writer
The Central Intelligence Agency
has finally acknowledged publicly
that it was "involved” in the Glomar
Explorer's attempts to raise a sunken
Russian submarine from the Pacific
Ocean floor.
Board
There's the
Qullgame!
W
✓
File Marchett
For example, Gesell was forced to
issue a secret opinion in the case last
October that even the attorneys in-
volved still have not been able to
read. The opinion was issued in that
secret fashion upon direct orders of
the U.S. Court of Appeals, which in-
structed Gesell to accept secret affi-
☑davits from high-level government of-
ficials concerning the case.
The terse acknowledgement came in
a court document filed in the U.S.
Court of Appeals by the Justice De-
partment two weeks ago. The docu-
ment asked that a suit against the
CIA by a private group concerning
the Glomar's financing be sent back
to a lower court for further hearings.
The filing marks an abrupt change
from the previous position taken by
the Justice Department in the 18-
month-old case that the mere acknowl-
edgement of the CIA's involvement in
the project would be harmful to na-
tional security. Although the CIA'S
operation of the project has been re-
ported in numerous publications, the
agency has been adamant in its re-
fusal to say publicly whether those re-
ports were true.
The case brought by the nonprofit
Military Audit Project, which moni-
tors spending by the defense and in-
telligence establishments, has in-
volved an unprecedented amount of
secret court proceedings as the CIA
attempted to prove the need for sec-
recy to U.S. District Court Judge Ger-
hard A. Gesell. The suit seeks the fi-
nancial details of the Glomar project.
Public affidavits filed at the time by
former President Ford's top national
security adviser, Lt. Gen. Brent Scow-
croft, said disclosures of the CIA in-
volvement or other details about the
project might prompt other nations
offended by the project to retaliate
against the United States.
Scowcroft said that retaliation
might take the form of "strong meas-
ures" that might "endanger U.S mili--
tary and diplomatic personnel and
businessmen overseas."
The federal government had previ-
ously acknowledged only that the ship
was part of a 1969 classified U.S..gov.
ernment project “to accomplish cer-
tain secret tasks in furtherance of na-
tional security objectives."

3. The following items were heretofore classified SECRET
because they described sources and methods in identifying a
support base located in the United States, but are now con-
sidered to have been placed in the public domain.
Items 124, 126, and 127 on pages 129 and 130
INTERMOUNTAIN AVIATION, INC. Intermountain Aviation,
Inc. is named as an Agency proprietary in Book I of
the Senate Select Committee Final Report, pp. 208-9,
and in the Report of the Rockefeller Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States, pg. 218.
4. The following items fall into the questionable area
as to whether they have been placed in the public domain by
authorized Government officials:
-
a. Item 49, page 71a ROME DAILY AMERICAN.
Classified SECRET because it describes intelligence
sources and methods as related to several newspaper
publications. However, CCS files contain a newsclip
from the September and October 1974 edition of the
Columbia Journalism Review which states, "Landon K.
Thorne, Jr., the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA,
Benjamin Shute, then a partner in the prestigious
Wall Street law firm of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore,
now acknowledge that the fourth partner [in the
purchase of the Rome Daily American in 1956] was the
CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrangement 'atypical'
of what the Agency was doing, 'a bad example"." It is
questionable whether the remarks made by Mr. Bross, who
retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute, who
left the Agency long before that, can be considered
as constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

b. Item 54, page 80 and item 236, page 262
WORLD FEATURES. Classified SECRET because they describe
intelligence sources and methods and identification of
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to -- but not by name in Book I of the Senate
Select Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows:
"Another example of the damages of [propaganda] 'fallout':
involved two proprietary news services that the CIA main-
tained in Europe
the larger of the two was subscribed
to by over 30 U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major dailies aware that the CIA controlled these two

press services." It may be argued that although Forum
World Features continues to be protected to a degree
by deletion of its name in the Senate Report, CIA dis-
closure to newspaper editors, if it in fact took place
and depending on how it was handled, placed the subject
in the public domain. NOTE: EUR Division and CA Staff
confirm the need for continued classification and will
comment separately.

SUBJECT
Philip F. Fendig
SA/DO/O
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks
1. Subject book was published in 1974 with 168
deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court
trial and decision. The lawyer for the authors has,
in effect, requested that a review be made of the
168 deleted items to determine which can now be
declassified and removed from the court's injunction,
particularly in view of the official disclosures
since the publication of the book. The Department of
Justice has advised that such a review is in order.
2. Since the courts decided the 168 deleted
items were properly classifiable and classified in
accordance with the appropriate Executive Order in
effect at the time of the initial classification,
including Executive Order 11652, the review at this
time must include two points:
(a) Is the item still classified under
Executive Order 11652,
(b) Has the item been placed in the public
domain by official disclosure by the United
States, such as by an official in the Executive
Branch authorized to declassify the item, or by
a report of a Congressional committee, or by.
the courts.
3. Each addressee is requested to appoint a
focal point officer to review each component's
respective items which are held by this office.
This office also has the DDO documentation submitted
in support of deleting each item in 1973. These can
be reviewed by each focal point official as necessary.

The following items were heretofore classified SECRET
because they described sources and methods in identifying a
support base located in the United States, but are now con-
sidered to have beenpplaced in the public domain.

Inc. is named as an Agency proprietary in Book I of
the Senate Select Committee Final Report, pp. 208-9,
and in the Report of the Rockefeller Commission on

The following items fall into the questionable area
as to whether they have been placed in the public domain by
authorized Government officials:

a. Item 49, page 71a ROME DAILY AMERICAN.
Classified SECRET because it describes intelligence
sources and methods as related to several newspaper
publications. However, CCS files contain a newsclip
from the September and October 1974 edition of the
Columbia Journalism Review which states, "Landon K.
Thorne, Jr., the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA,
Benjamin Shute, then a partner in the prestigious
Wall Street law firm of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore,
now acknowledge that the fourth partner [in the
purchase of the Rome Daily American in 1956] was the
CIA. [Bross) recently called the arrangement 'atypical'
of what the Agency was doing, 'a bad example'." It is
questionable whether the remarks made by Mr. Bross, who
retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute, who
left the Agency long before that, can be considered as
as constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

A review will also be needed of those items which
may have been cleared or released by CIA when
reviewing manuscripts submitted by other authors
since the publication of the Marchetti book. A
few items will need to be referred by some of the

Classified SECRET; describe intelligence sources and
methods by identifying an operational support facility
located in the U.S. [Section 5 (B) (2)] According to
CCS files, in April 1975 the DCI was asked by an NBC
reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fairways Corporation
in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but
there are indications that the DCI may have responded
to the question in a manner which could have been con-
strued as admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways.
However, CCS files contain other evidence that CIA
sponsorship of Fairways was considered still classified
as recently as December 1976. NOTE: The DDA/Air

Donald J. Purcell
Chief, Covert Action Staff
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks
Memo for All Divisions and Certain Staffs,
from SA/DO/0, 8 April 1977, same subject
!
Following are Covert Action Staff comments on items
24, 48, 54, 55, 56, 236, and 280, which are among the
passages containing classified information that were de-
leted before publication of the Marchetti-Marks manuscript:
a) Items 24 (p. 47), 55 (p. 80), 56 (p. 81),
and 280 (p. 404) are classified secret, and are
exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2) of
EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and
methods of operation. Specifically, these items
name RTV, Inc. and describe it as a CIA proprietary
that was used for clandestine operations in a variety
of countries. In addition, items 55 and 56 are
especially sensitive because they describe an opera-
tion in Jordan, exposure of which could be harmful to
United States relations in the Middle East ( Section
5 b 3).
b)
Items 54 and 236 (on p. 80 and p. 262) are
classified secret, and are exempt from publication
under Section (5) (b) (2) of EO 11652, which protects
intelligence sources and methods of operation. These
items name Forum World Features, describe it as a CIA
proprietary that was used for clandestine propaganda
operations, specify that the clandestine operations
were directed especially at the Third World, and further
specify that the man who ran FWF was an experienced
CIA operator. It may be worth noting that the Senate
Select Committee declined to publish the name of this
clandestine proprietary when the Agency advised the
Committee that publication would damage the former
director of Forum World Features, who had entered into
a clandestine relationship with the U.S. Government in
good faith.

c) Item 48 (p. 71a) is classified secret, and
is exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2)
of EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and
methods of operation. This item names African Forum,
Africa Report, Preuves, Encounter, and Forum as
magazines that received CIA subsidies. In the case
of Preuves, Encounter, and Forum, these magazines were
published by the former Congress for Cultural Freedom.
The Government has not acknowledged covertly subsidizing
CCF or its magazines, although Encounter magazine's
ties to CIA have been the subject of press speculation.
Preuves magazine has been the subject of little or no
press speculation, as far as we know, and it is our
understanding that French laws prohibit covert foreign
subsidies to French publications, which makes it
especially important to protect the former CIA tie to
that magazine. Exposure of the two Africa magazines
would be damaging to a number of prominent people and
organizations in this country and in Africa that have
worked for improved social conditions in Africa and for
good relations between this country and Africa, which
would be harmful to this country's relations with Africa.

2. The one item excepted is Item No. 57. This item
relates to the Penkovskiy Papers. Marchetti and Marks wrote
in their manuscript: "One of the CIA's most famous venture
(sic) in book publishing was The Penkovsky Papers (sic).
This chronicle of spying for the West inside the Kremlin
appeared in 1965, and it was allegedly taken from the journal
of the actual spy, Colonel Oleg Penkovsky." The Penkovskiy
Papers are mentioned in the Final Report of the Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities, Book I, page 194, dated 26 April 1976, as follows:
"Another CIA book, the Penkovskiy Papers, was
published in the United States in 1965 'for
operational reasons', but actually became commer-
cially viable. The book was prepared and written
by witting Agency assets who drew on actual case
materials. Publication rights to the manuscript
were sold to a publisher through a trust fund
which was established for the purpose. The publisher
was unaware of any U.S. Government interest."
3. In view of this published statement by the Senate
Select Committee, Item No. 57 has been placed in the public
domain by official disclosure by the United States.
It can
no longer be considered classified under Executive Order 11652.

P. 552 is
a. Item 72, page 97: This item, which was placed in
Operations, on pages 173 and 174, is a problem area. The author
of this book is a former senior CIA officer who allowed the
N/Agency to review his manuscript prior to publication. However,
CIA did not approve the manuscript for publication and, there-
fore, in our view Item 72 remains classified under Executive
Order 11652 under Exemption 5B (2).
b. Item 152, page 165 and Item 28, page 48: These
two items also fall in a problem area. The following references
to CIA's special relationship with the Shah of Iran imply, but
do not specifically state, that such a relationship exists. See
Book 1 of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities, page 552, and Ray S.
Cline's book entitled, Secrets, Spies and Scholars; Blueprint
of the Essential CIA, pages 131 and 132. Additionally, though

SUBJECT: Review of Deletions from Marchetti Book for Declassification -
Request for Documents.
1. In order to review the deletions from the Marchetti book, The
Cult of Intelligence, Mr. Halpern must determine if any official of the
U.S. Government placed any of the classified material in the public
domain in open testimony before a Congressional Committee. The following
material or information is required:
a. Is there any index to public statements by senior government
officials on the subject of intelligence? Is there any index
to the Pike Committee or Church Committee testimony ?
b. Mr. Halpern would like to have copies of the open testimony
before a Congressional committee by senior officials of the
CIA,
NSA,
State Dept,
Dept of Defense,
FBI,
which deals with intelligence.
Any open testimony before Congressional committees by senior
U.S. officials dealing with the cutoff of AID during the
Cyprus disturbances.
d. Any testimony (open) concerning American POWS (MIA) in Vietnam
and CIA's method of communication with them.

is reported in an interim report of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975. It
may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire.
We believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5(b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo.

made on behalf of Cambodia. To insure that the program was tailored to real
requirements, to insure that equipment was received by personnel trained in
their use and to insure that material provided under MAP had reasonable
expectancy of maintenance support, items such as force structure, military orga-
nization, technical assistance and logistics became matters that came under tix.
purview of the MEDTC. To have closed our eyes to these aspects in my view.
would have ignored congressional concerns regarding efficient management. I
did not consider these functions a violation of the congressional intent in
banning advisors and these functions continued during my tenure. In my belief
the ban would have been violated had personnel been assigned to military units
or activities on an around-the-clock basis and involved themselves in most of the
matters affecting their units or activity. In prescribing the limits of our assist-
ance, the views of the GAO report were useful in guiding our judgment.
Question 10. During your tenure as Ambassador, did any U.S. Military Attachés
serve with Khmer military units in the field?
-What regulations did the U.S. Embassy have to govern the activities of
U.S. Military Attaches and the Military Equipment Delivery Team?
-Were any changes in the regulations made after the incident at Kampot
involving Major Lawrence Ondecker in March 1974?
Answer. No U.S. military served with Khmer military units in the field. U.S.
personnel from both the Defense Attache Office and the Office of the Chief
Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia routinely visited and reported
the military status of Cambodian military units as part of their duties; however.
U.S. personnel did not remain with units in the manner which U.S. advisors did
in South Vietnam. U.S. personnel were extensively briefed upon arrival regard.
Ing the Congressional restrictions against advisers to the Cambodian military.
The Kampot incident occurred prior to my arrival in Cambodia. Shortly after
my arrival in Phnom Penh. I received the instructions in effect and determined
that they were adequate. I did, however, personally impress upon my military
staff, on several occasions, the need to abide scrupulously by these instructions
and to avoid situations which might be interpreted as infringements of their
prescribed duties.
Question 11. In November 1974, the Washington Post reported and the De
fense Department acknowledged that data on potential hombing targets in
Cambodia was gathered by American reconnaissance fights from Thailand and
passed on to Cambodian military authorities.
_ When did this practice begin?
-Did you know about it, and did you have a role in it?
Do you consider it a violation of the Congressional ban on American
advisors with Khmer Republic forces?
Answer. It would be inconceivable to me that in a situation as existed in
Cambodia that military information which we had would be deliberately withheld
or denied to a country to which we were providing enormous military and
economic assistance. The information we had concerning enemy activities in
Cambodia was a by-product of our own intelligence collecting effort on com-
munist forces throughout Indochina. This information was provided to Cam-
bodian military authorities but the decision on what action, if any, would be
taken was one which the Cambodians made for themselves. The provisions of
information preceded my arrival and I am not aware exactly when the practice
may have begun. I was aware of the practice although I did not play a pivotal
part in the process and did not consider this procedure as violating congressional
restrictions on American advisors.
estion 12. Did CIA personnel in Cambodia ever act as advisers to Khmer
Republic forces in a fashion similar to their activities in Laos (even if on a
smaller scale)?
-Could you tell us what role China Airlines played in Cambodia and if it
was in any way associated with CIA activities?
- What was the U.S. role in organizing and applying the Khmer "Middle
Range Reconnaissance Patrols" (MERPS)?
Answer. Having served both in Laos and Cambodia, and knowing the CIA
operations in both countries, I can honestly say that the CIA did not act as
advisers to the Khmer Republic forces in a fashion similar to their activities
in Laos. China Airlines, under contract to Air America, transported supplies. not
including weapons and ammunition, for U.S. agencies in Cambodia. The Middle
Range Reconnaissance Patrols received U.S. Inilitary equipment as part of the
Khmer Armed Forces and also received some intelligence collection training..

Hussein on
Following the disclosure that Jordan's
King Hussein had for years taken secret
payments from the CIA. NEWSWEEK'S
Arnaud de Borchgrave flew to Amman
last week for an exclusive interview with
the King. The result was what Hussein
called "my first and very last words" on
The Washington Post's revelation of the
payments and their possible impact on
chances for peace in the Middle East.
Some excerpts:
DE BORCHGRAVE: How much truth is
there in the story that appeared in The Wash-
ington Post?
HUSSEIN: The whole thing is ridicu
lous and insulting. But I am prepared to
answer questions about it.
Q. Your government spokesman said the
story was a combination of "fabrication and
distortion." What has been fabricated and
what has been distorted?
A. What was fabricated in the story was
everything about funds handed over per-
sonally for private benefit. When friend-
ly Arab countries extend aid, it has been
traditional for the checks to be made out
to the Head of State, which then are
deposited in the state budget account.
This is not an uncommon practice. All
assistance received by us is handled in
the same way. What is true is that for a
number of years, we have been offered
security and intelligence assistance,
which the government of Jordan accept-
ed gratefully.
As for the story that the CIA paid for.
the protection of my children at school-
in America, my request was made to the
State Department which kindly agreed
to ensure their security. Remember that
there have been many extremist plots
against me and my family and this was a
perfectly normal request. If Amy Carter
decided to come to school in Jordan,
we would, needless to say, be responsi-
ble for her security and would not be.
sending a bill to the U.S. Government
for an elementary courtesy and security
measure.
Q. How do you feel about President Carter
ordering the arrangement-code-named "No
Beef" stopped?
A. We had, I promise you, never heard
anything about all this before. If the
reference is to the assistance we have
been receiving for security and intelli-
gence, then I have not been advised
about its suspension, either officially or
unofficially.
Q. The Intelligence Oversight Board set up
in February 1976 reported to President Ford a
few months later that they regarded the pay-
ments as improper and he did nothing about
it. What do you feel was improper about those
payments?
A. What is a proper way to support a
friend and ally is strictly your business,
Newsweek, March 7, 1977
7
His CIA Money
1
The subject never came up before and 1
was totally unaware that this assistance
to Jordan had come into question last
year. What is proper in some minds is
apparently improper in others. As far.
as I am concerned, anything I can get
for Jordan and my people is proper.
And five of your Presidents [Eisenhow-)
er, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford]:
thought so, too.
Q. Since you say the assistance was proper
and just another form of U.S. aid; why; then,
the secrecy and method of payment?
A. If you mean the report that pay-
ments were made directly to the King
and for his [personal] benefit and with
political conditions and obligations, this
eled against us. It was hardly coinciden-
tal that these attacks were made as the
peace offensive was picking up steam
and on the very day that Secretary
Vance arrived in Amman. It is obvious
to me that those who wish to sabotage
the peace process-and help Israel stay
put in the occupied territories-are
even willing to engage in character
assassination of persons whose dearest
wish is for a just and durable peace.
Q. Who benefits?
A. Two quarters: One, in your own
country, that has been trying to under-
mine one of your key institutions, en-
gaged in a worldwide, struggle to try to
neutralize the actions of the KGB in its
efforts to promote Communism. The oth-
er is a powerful group that is not interest-
ed in a settlement and which also feels it
has a score to settle with Jordan. Don't
Alexandra de Borchgrave-Gamma-Liaison
Choice of targets: Jordan's King Hussein taking aim on the shooting range
is à complete fabrication. The assistance
was designed, only to enhance our in-
telligence and security capabilities
period.
To us, the CIA is a part of the U.S.
Government. We have sought to acquire
know-how, equipment and new capabili-
ties to defend ourselves in the face of a
worldwide battle, be it hot or cold, which
is still with us. And wherever there is an
identity of interests between our two
countries, I will continue to advocate
fruitful and mutual cooperation.
Q. What do you feel was the principal
motivation of those [sources] who contribut-
ed to the Washington Post story?
A. To undermine the credibility au
integrity of those who are able and
willing to contribute to the forces of
peace: My people know me and I know
them and these attacks are futile in
terms of the Jordanian scene. We are.

launched the campaign to block the

failed.

efforts, but I plan to persevere regard-
less of attempts to sabotage a just and ple
durable peace.
Q. What, for example, do you feel the story
will do to your differences with the PLO and
attempts to form a joint delegation for the
Geneva talks? Is a joint delegation still a
realistic possibility?
A. A PLO delegation is in Amman this
week and the whole question of a joint
delegation is still very much in question.

Special Assistant to the DDO

Samuel Halpern
Review of 168 Deleted Items in
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks
(U) 1.
1. This is the report of the review done by
the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items
which are the basic responsibility of the DDO. The
remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi-
bility of the DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those
Directorates which are reporting directly to OGC.
Responsible components did the necessary inter- and
intraagency coordinations.
(U) 2. Several points need to be highlighted
concerning the completeness of the review, especially
as regards those items declassified by "official
public disclosure" as defined by the courts. While I
am sure that as diligent a search as possible was done
by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely
complete search is impossible for the following reasons:
(U) a. There is no index of any kind,
let alone having the material in machine form
such as in the RSM, to the fifteen published
hearings and reports of the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (Church
Committee), the six published hearings and
proceedings of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume
Report to the President by the Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States
(Rockefeller Commission)%;B

(U) b. There is no comprehensive readily
available record of precisely what information
has been declassified and released in accordance
with the Freedom of Information Act and the
Privacy Act; there are separate collections
with a limited capability to retrieve some such
information%3B
(U) c. There is no available record of
the information that officials of the Executive
Branch of government, with authority to
declassify information, have said or written
in public either before Congressional
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows,
college symposiums, the general lecture
circuit, other public forums, etc.
In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee
that those items which are still classified by the
DDO components have not been deliberately or
inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as
"official public disclosure."
(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A
lists those items of the DDO deleted items which have
been declassified by "official public disclosure."
These thirteen complete and parts of four other items
can therefore be released from the court injunction.
(S) 4. Attachment B (seven parts) contains
eleven deleted items (seven subjects) which are still
classified but about which there may be some possible
question. These are highlighted here so that
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with
due regard for all legal and policy aspects.
(U) 5. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining
items which the DDO components advise are still
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amended and
cannot be released from the court injunction.

ATTACHMENT B (1)
Item No. 22, 28, 152, 172
MSS pp. no. 46, 48, 165, 189
(U)
NE Division has highlighted these items.
(S) Item 22 states in part "A notable example of such
a 'special relationship' is Iran, where a CIA organized coup
d'etat restored the Shah to power in 1953. The Shah was
understandably grateful..." Item 28 lists the Shah among
other "world leaders with whom CIA has developed special
relationships" as does Item 152 and a similar statement is
made in Item 179.
(U) Ray S. Cline in his book "Secrets, Spies and
Scholars," pp. 131-132, states:
a covert operation so successful that it
became widely known all over the world was carried
out in Iran. The Shah, then very young, had been
driven out of Iran by his left-leaning Premier,
Mohammed Mossadegh, whose support came from the
local Communist (Tudeh) Party and from the Soviet
Union. CIA mounted a modest effort under a skillful
clandestine services officer who flew to Iran,
hired enough street demonstrators to intimidate
those working for Mossadegh, instructed Iranian
military men loyal to the Shah how to take over
the local radio station, and paved the way for the
Shah's triumphal return."
(U) The Church Committee, Book I, p. 111, briefly
mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran"
as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert
operations."
(S) There is a vast difference between the classified
deleted items speaking about an active "special relationship"
with the Shah following the overthrow of Mossadegh and a
statement about CIA's role in overthrowing Mossadegh. The
former is still properly classifiable and classified.

ATTACHMENT B (2).
Item No. 49
MSS p. no. 71a.
(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Daily
American is still classified SECRET because it describes
intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper
publications. CCS files contain a newsclip from the
September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia
Journalism Review which states; "Landon K. Thorne, Jr.
the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA, Benjamin Shute,
then a partner in the prestigious Wall Street law firm
of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore, now acknowledge that the
fourth partner [in the purchase of the Rome Daily American
in 1956] was the CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrange-
ment 'atypical' of what the Agency was doing, "a bad
example'.' It is questionable whether the remarks made by
Mr. Bross, who retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute,
who left the Agency long before that, can be considered
"
•
as constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

ATTACHMENT B (5).
Item No. 72
MSS p. 97
(U) NE Division has highlighted this item.
(S) The deleted item is "The CIA quickly made contact
with the Dalai Lama and a close relationship was established.
Financed and advised by Agency covert operators, he was..."
(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's Secret
Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean war was
winding down, the CIA began sending intelligence agents
into Tibet to assess the situation and see what could be
done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the
offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched
by air and made contact with the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, giving
him a channel of communication with the West.
"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to
avoid capture by the Chinese forces in 1959, he was
accompanied on his flight by a CIA-trained radio operator
who was able to keep Washington posted on his often
hazardous progress.
(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA
"close relationship" with the Dalai Lama and his being
"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different
from Rositzke's statement about CIA trained radio operators
being with the Dalai Lama. These are two different
comments with the first being properly classifiable and
classified.

Item No. 67 (lines 24, 25)

"
(S) Under injunction as classified information is
"For its Tibetan operation of the early sixties, the
Agency constructed extensive support facilities in
Northeast India and brought large numbers of guerrillas
to a deserted Army base in Colorado for special training.'
Underlining (line 25, ninth thru twenty-third word)
indicates the questionable part of the item since MSS
page 97, lines 24-26 states "Some Tibetans were quietly
brought to the United States for special paramilitary
training at Camp Hale in the mountains of Colorado."
This sentence was originally deleted, then reinstated and
appears in boldface type on page 115 in the published book.

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World
Features is still classified SECRET because both items
describe intelligence sources and methods and identifies
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to - but not by name in Book I of the Church
Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows: "Another
example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two
proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in
Europe... The larger of the two was subscribed to by
over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major U.S. dailies aware that the CIA controlled these
two press services." While Forum World Features was not
named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be
protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper
editors may be considered as "official public disclosure."

Item No. 107, 128, 129, 279
ATTACHMENT B (6)
MSS pp. 123, 132, 133, 403
(S) CCS states that all four items which refer to
Fairways Corporation as a CIA-owned proprietary company
are still classified since they describe intelligence
sources and methods by identifying an operational support
facility located in the U.S. and are therefore exempt from
declassification under Section 5 (B) (2) of the General
Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652.
(S) According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director
Colby was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship
of Fairways Corporation in connection with a planned TV
documentary on Agency proprietaries. CCS files are unclear
on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby
may have responded to the question in a manner which
could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of
Fairways.
In any case, CCS files contain other evidence
that the matter was considered to be still classified as
recently as December 1976, when Director Bush wrote to
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and asked that the
subject be withheld from public disclosure.

His CIA Money
The subject never came up before and I
was totally unaware that this assistance
to Jordan had come into question_last
year. What is proper in soine minds is
apparently improper in others. As far
as I am concerned, anything I can get
for Jordan and my people is proper.
And five of your Presidents [Eisenhow-
er, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford]
thought so, too.
Q. Since you say the assistance was proper
and just another form of U.S. aid; why, then,
the secrecy and method of payment?
A. If you mean the report that pay-
ments were made directly to the King
and for his [personal] benefit and with
political conditions and obligations, this
eled against us. It was hardly coinciden-
tal that these attacks were made as the
peace offensive was picking up steam
and on the very day that Secretary
Vance arrived in Amman. It is obvious
to me that those who wish to sabotage
the peace process-and help Israel stay
put in the occupied territories-are
even willing to engage in character
assassination of persons whose dearest
wish is for a just and durable peace.
Q. Who benefits?
A. Two quarters: One, in your own
country, that has been trying to under-
mine que of your key institutions, en-
gaged in a worldwide struggle to try to
neutralize the actions of the KGB in its
efforts to promote Communism. The oth-
er is a powerful group that is not interest-
ed in a settlement and which also feels it
has a score to settle with Jordan. Don't
Alexandra de Borchgrave-Gamma-Liaison
Choice of targets: Jordan's King Hussein taking aim on the shooting range
is à complete fabrication. The assistance
was designed, only to enhance our in-
telligence and security capabilities
period.
To us, the CIA is a part of the U.S.
Government. We have sought to acquire
know-how, equipment and new capabili-
ties to defend ourselves in the face of a
worldwide battle, be it hot or cold, which
is still with us. And wherever there is an
identity of interests between our two
countries, I will continue to advocate
fruitful and mutual cooperation.
Q. What do you feel was the principal
motivation of those [sources] who contribut-
ed to the Washington Post story?
if
forget it was the Israeli lobby that
launched the campaign to block the
Hawk anti-aircraft missile defense sys-
tem to Jordan. Fortunately, the lobby
failed.
Q. How much of a setback do you feel the
story has been to the peace-with-Israel
campaign?
A. I fervently hope, of course, that it
will not be a setback. Admittedly, it may
have a deleterious effect on our peace
efforts, but I plan to persevere regard-
less of attempts to sabotage a just and
durable peace.
:
Q. What, for example, do you feel the story
A. To undermine the credibility an! will do to your differences with the PLO and
integrity of those who are able and attempts to form a joint delegation for the
willing to contribute to the forces Geneva talks? Is a joint delegation still a
peace: My people know me and I knowe
them and these attacks are futile in
terms of the Jordanian scene. We are.
stronger than anything that can be lev-
Newsweek, March 7, 1977
realistic possibility?
A. A PLO delegation is in Amman this
week and the whole question of a joint
delegation is still very much in question.
FYORLD
The dialogue [inter/upted by the Jorda-
nian civil war'in 1970, when the PLO
was driven out of Amman] has barely
begun. To what degree political action
can be coordinated an ong us is some-
thing we will be expio,ing over the next
few months. And, the hole Arab posi-
tion on this problem • vet to crystallize.
Q. Is it your impression that the PLO is now
ready to amend its basic charter and agree to
coexist peacefully with Israel in a West Bank-
Gaza state?
A. This is the decision they must face.
But it is equally important to know what
the Israeli position will be. Why should
the PLO take such a step milaterally?
There must be a degree of simultane-
ity Israel recognizes a West Bank-Gaza
Palestinian state and the Palestinian's
recognize Israel.
-
Q. Is it your intention to negotiate with the
PLO prior to Geneva a new organic link be-
tween a possible Palestinian state on the West
Bank and Jordan proper?
A. This has been suggested by many
leaders in the area as a possible con-
structive development and we certain-
ly plan to explore the possibilities.
But I must caution you against overopti-
mism. The resumption of the Geneva
conference by itself means nothing and
if it doesn't produce quick results
then there will be the danger of a
letdown, of the pendulum swinging
back and the extremists coming to the
fore again.
•
Q. How do you think the latest CIA story will
affect relations between Jordan and the Unit-
ed States?
A. Throughout all these years I have
been very proud of the growing strength
of the relationship with our American
friends. We identified with principles
your forefathers held dear. We built
our relations on the basis of mutual
respect, confidence and faith, and be-
yond that anything I did to cement
relations with the U.S. was based on a
deep conviction about our common ob-
jectives-stability, peace and progress
in the Middle East..
My duty is to develop my country, its
human resources, armed forces and secu-
rity and intelligence services, to face the
tremendous threats that lie ahead. The
road is strewn with mines to sabotage the
peace process. One has just exploded in
Washington. There will be others. But
bear in mind that Jordan is not unique in
receiving such help. Israel falls into the
same category and is a far greater exam-
ple of all kinds of assistance. As far as I
am concerned, these will be my first and
very last words on that matter. My per-
sonal pride is a very touchy subject. And
my main concern is to preserve Jordan in
freedom.
Finally, regarding your media attacks
against a branch of your government, if i
you choose to denude a vital arm that is
there to protect you, that is your affair,
not Jordan's.

Item No. 339
MSS p. no. 509
(S) CIA presence in Bolivia and Brazil has not been
officially acknowledged and is still classified because
it involves sources and methods.
David Phillips in his book The Night Watch,
chapter 8, pp. 212-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-
1972" describes his presence as Chief of Station of CIA
in Brazil and on page 209 he discusses CIA in Bolivia.
(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence
in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),
Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presence
in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.
It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. We
believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."
It is not a question of whether to agree or not
to declassification of reference to the Congo. The Church
Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made
"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the
subject moot. In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A
shows, four other countries of the Third World are also
mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone.
adverse effect could be expected now by another public
reference to CIA presence in the Congo as of the original
1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is
difficult to comprehend. Since the government of Zaire has
not changed since the 1975 release of the information by
the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever adverse
effects there might be have already occurred.
