MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
DISBRIEFING OF TAVID M. WILSTS? (ps)
6 June 1960
;
1
1. On 1 June 1960 Mr. John G. Hayn and Mr. John Kennedy of WHR,
Mr. Robert Brown of CI/OPS, Mr. Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr. Charles
Bray of FI/D not with David N. WILSTED (ps).
2. WILSTED emphasised that the whole telephone system in Mexico
City is undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de exico, S.A.,
has sub-contracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
system to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off bo-
cause there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work hás
hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines
now are underground and we carmot get access to them before they enter
the central. This is particularly true with respect to the Ceech En-
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy.
3. WILSTED said that we try to keep track of the activities of
"Intel" but since they seen to attack "Colonias" at randon, we have no
prior warning of their presence in a certain area..
40 In the recent past, Mexico has been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. We have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. However, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must have, telephone lines in-
stalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber.
.
5. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These wo hilf
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.
6. WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a
regular telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
band, which later can be sold.

The take from each basehouse is collected early in the morning
before office hours by RAFANELLI. Ho only enters one basehouse which is
occupied by an elderly couple. All other contants are in automobiles
made at different spots each day of the week. RAFANELLI then takas the
material to a meeting between him, WILSTED and SECHSN where PAPANELLI
turns the material over to SECHEN and they all discuss the problems and
plans for the day.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-F
52-6-1, Section V, Paragraph 2 (u) (1).
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet In this reporting period LIFEAT provided vital
Information and live-monitoring support during the installation phase of a
successful Station technical operation targeted against Aleksandr G. SIDOROV,
Soviet Military Attache in Mexico.
(2) LIFEAT/Cuban This coverage provided valuable operational
support during the period leading up to the recruitment of AMSTRUT-2 giving
timely advance information of AMSTRUF-2's arrival in Mexico, as well as
his day to day activities and contacts. Following AMSTRUT-2's recruitment,
LIFEAT gave an excellent account of AMSTRUT-2's activities for those periods
he was not under the control of his case officers. This was invaluable proof
of his full cooperation with KUBARK and added a safety factor for the case
officers making the recruitment and initial handling which would not have been
otherwise available.
These coverages con-
(3) LIFEAT/Polish and LIFEAT Yugoslav
tinue to provide excellent information of the daily activities of the Satellite
officials assigned to Mexico. The LIFEAT support of the BEKNAVE/BECHICK
operation continues as noted in reference.
(4) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Ber-
mejo provides information and operational leads which, though valuable now,
would be invaluable if ODYOKE's policy toward AREVALO becomes sufficiently
defined to fully exploit all the information provided b; LIFEAT

(4) LIFEAT/EXILE
LIFEAT coverage in this area has been
most rewarding in providing leads to the contacts of Jua Jose Arevalo Bermejo,
"former Guatemalan President. 'Spanish Republican Exiles were covered for
approximately one-half month in August, at which time it was decided that the
coverage no longer provided sufficient leads and information to justify con-
tinued LIFEAT effort.
(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)
This coverage is at the request of the local office of ODENVY and the processing
of take in this area is done by that office. One of the most interesting items
provided from this coverage was the fact that the American Communists Albert
MALTZ and Margaret Larkin MALTZ had separated and that Albert MALTZ
would probably reside in the U.S. with Margaret remaining in Mexico. Con-
ceming the LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM, the local office of ODENVY wrote
on 23 August 1962: "This office feels that the coverage mentioned is quite
valuable and many useful leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly
with regard to travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are
in contact with individuals on whom coverage is ma inta ined",
B. Processing of Take
No change from that noted in reference A.
C. Liaison
No change from that noted in reference A.
D. Security
During the early part of August 1962 a group of "coyotes" was uncovered
In the telephone company in Mexico City and a number of arrests were made.
This group had organized a unit including linemen, centralmen, installation
crew, warehousemen, and workers in the office responsible for providing ser-
vice to new clients. It was the purpose of the "coyote" group to provide service,
for a price, to those individuals whose requests for installations had been turned
down by the telephone company due to limited availability of cables and contacts.
(Note: The company generally keeps a certain number of "spare pairs" in each
cable for its own use in providing special service, company phones, and for re-
routing during repairs to other cables. It was these spare pairs and contacts
which the "coyotes" used to provide illegal phone service.) This telephone com-
pany within the telephone company would also collect monthly fees from their
"subscribers". When the story came out, the telephone company had special
police stationed in each central and spot checks made of linemen and crews to
prevent recurrence. It was therefore necessary for the LIFEAT linemen to
refrain from any clandestine activity for a period of almost four weeks so as
not to be accidentally picked up as a member of the "coyote" group. LIFEUD-1
has reported that the situation is now back to normal with the special police
details and special checkups terminated. No compromise of the LIFEAT oper-
ation resulted from the above incident.
E. Technical
In addition to re-supplying LIFEAT with audio recorders (as reported in
reference A), the Station has ordered ten new dial tape recorders for the project.
Funds for this purpose were included in the latest Project Renewal Request
(forwarded by reference B).
F. Coverage
During the month of August 1962. LIFEAT covered a total of 15 target

The basehouse operators for LIFEAT Annex VI, LIFEUD-5 and LIFEUD-11,
after a long period of family disagreements, have mutually decided on a
divorce. Both are being terminated by KUBARK since their usefulness as
basehouse keepers for the project will end with their divorce. The agents have
agreed to the termination and it will be accomplished on a friendly basis.
(Agent Service Records will be forwarded). Therefore, it has been necessary
to close Annex VI and terminate coverage of the lines provided by that base-
house. LIFEUD-24 and LIFEUD-26 have been recruited to replace the ter-
minated couple and are presently looking for a suitable basehouse which could
fully replace the old Annex VI. (Note: POA was granted for LIFEUD-24 on 28
June 1962 and OA was requested. Also, OA was requested for LIFEUD-26
on 30 August 1962.)
During the absence of Woodrow B. GABBOT (ps), the processor of the
Polish language portions of the Polish Embassy take, a replacement in the person
of contact agent BETUMBLE was provided by Headquarters. He performed well
with no known security hazard to himself or LIFEAT. BETUMBLE departed
Mexico City on 17 September 1962. Until GABBOT's return Polish portions of
this take are being translated by the Station Satellite Case Officer.
2.A. During the month of August 1962, the LIFEAT operation provided
a total of 45 reels of raw take from the ACGM lines to the local ODENVY office
for their processing. In addition, a number of memos were prepared by the
Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on
LIFEAT provided material.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F 52-6-1,
Section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).
A. Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET
With the departure of Vladimir G.
NOVIKOV during the month of August 1962, it was decided that LIFEAT should
pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV. The contin-
ued coverage of aleksandr G. SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of
live-monitoring and special processing of the take, is considered essential to
those Station-assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillance
noted in last month's report (see reference A). Coverage of the Soviet Bulletin
Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials
assigned to Mexico.
(2) LIFEAT/POLISH
LIFEAT coverage in support of the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation. Addi-
tional coverage for this operation has been undertaken, leads from which will
probably determine future direction of the operation as well as aid KUBARK in
controlling the operation.
(3) LIFEAT/YUGOSLAV
In this area LIFEAT provided the infor-
mation that a cousin of a recently assigned KUBARK deep cover agent, Victor
W. OBOLD (ps) will be travelling to Mexico in the near future. This cousin is
a long-time Communist Party official and a chance meeting with him could
have destroyed OBOLD's carefully prepared cover. Due to LIFEAT advanced
warning, proper security safeguards have been arranged. LIFEAT has also
provided travel information on Yugoslav officials from the United States which
was of great interest to ODENVY.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F
52-6-1, Section V. paragraph 2 (d) (1): 1
A. Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET LIFEAT coverage in this area was concentrated
on known RIS officers: Vladimir G. NOVIKOV and Aleksandr G. SIDOROV.
The most rewarding lead from this coverage during July was that SIDOROV
would be absent with his entire family from his apartment for nearly two
months, and more importantly, that no one would be continuously watching
the apartment during that time... Based on this information, the Station has
been able to make the necessary preparations for establishing technical
surveillance of this apartment, LIFEAT coverage of the Soviet Bulletin
-Office, in addition to the above coverages, has provided information on the
daily activities of Individual Soviet officials assigned to Mexico, including
collection of travel and blographical data.
(2) LIFEAT/POLISH LIFEAT coverage has been vital to the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT has even provided live-monitoring
of an international call to BECHICK from a former admirer. Also in the
Polish area, LIFEAT provided names of Polish Embassy contacts who were
Invited to Polish national holiday celebrations at the Polish Embassy, as
well as information concerning the impending arrival of the new Polish Am-
bassador.
(3) LIFEAT/YUGOSLAV
In the Station's increased operations
against this target, basic biographical, personnel assignment, and personnel
daily activity information is essential. LIFEAT has been providing just
this type information since coverage commenced in May.

1(4) LIFEAT/EXILE LIFEAT coverage of exilé and revolutionary“
groups has been concentrated on coverage of Central American and,
Spanish Republican groups and individuals. Coverage of Juan Jose
AREVALO Bermejo, former President of Guatemala, has provided the
Station with valuable information concerning his contacts and future
plans. Further. LIFEAT covered LIGIRD-1's contact with AREVALO
and later revealed AREVALO's convierton that the Station asset, LIGIRD-1,
is involved in a plot to assassinate AREVALO. Coverage of Spanish
Republicans displayed the internal dissentions aroused by the plans
of a small group of the Mexico-based exiles to assassinate certain
prominent persons with plastic bombs, and ultimately told of the departure
from Mexico to Cuba of two individuals implicated in the plot.
(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)
Targets covered in this category are in answer to a long standing require-
ment laid on by ODENVY and approved by Headquarters. In the past
ODENVY has noted the coverage as valuable and worthwhile to them. As
in the past reliable information was provided on the activities, travel, and
contacts of the ACGM.
B. Processing of the Take
•
•
LIFEAT processors continue to process all take for the LIFEAT
operation except for the three ACGM lines which are processed by the
local ODENVY office.
˚C. Liaison
No change.
D. Security
No security Incidents directly affecting the operation or future of
LIFEAT were noted during July 1962. The assignment of special telephone
company crews to make a survey of spare telephone lines available for
use of new subscribers may cause problems when these crews uncover a
"spare" line used in a LIFEAT coverage. However, since these crews
have no authority (or desire) to trace down the lines to their ultimate
destination, normal LIFEAT security practices should negate this danger.
A second development which could cause future problems is the possible
assignment of a LIENVOY technician to check telephone centrals to see
exactly who else may be carrying on LIENVOY type work. As of this date
LIFEAT personnel, who have been provided with the true name of this
individual, have never heard of him working in any central in Mexico City.
As of this moment it appears this will not develop into a threat to
LIFEAT operations.
E. Technical
New recorders provided in May to LIFEAT are now in operation and
appear superior to previous models used. It is planned, with the approval
of Project LIFEAT for FY 1963, to completely re-equip LIFEAT with new
recorders and possibly dial tape recorders.
F. Coverage
During the month of July 1962. LIFEAT covered a total of 16 target
lines. Specifically, the coverage by target was as follows:

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with
CSHB-F 52-6-1, ceation V, paragraph 2 (a) (1):
Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFFAT/LIERODE with related lines continued to
provide valuable information for use in support of Station
operations. However, coverage of the LIERODE official
installation was out on 19 May for security reasons. The
following leads were provided: As a result of a LIFEAT
provided lead, the Station was able to develop an operation
in cooperation with the Mexican Government whereby Mario
CHAVEZ, Guatemalan who is representative of the Castroite
Bohemia, was placed under Mexican surveillance and ultimately
arrested. LIFEAT also provided a check on the activities of
LITANGO-1. Further, provision of travel information to and
from Cuba by Nicaraguan and Guatemalan exiles was of con-
tinuing importance.
-
(2) LIFEAT was employed as a check of the activities of
former KUBARK agents LIVESTOCK-2 and LIVESTOCK-3. This coverage
has contributed measurably to Station security.
(3) LIFEAT/LITMUS provided vital coverage of the LITMUS
official installation during the EECORN recruitment operation.
Also of value were the leads pointing to two suspected LITMIS
Intelligence Service agents. Other Station assets are now
investigating these leads.
(4) LIFEAT coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico City (ACGM) continues to provide excellent coverage of
the activities, travel, and contacts of the American Communists
living in Mexico. This information is of primary importance to
ODENVY.

section V. paragraph 2 (d) (1):
a. Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFEAT/LIERODE, with related lines, continued to
receive emphasis from the LIFEAT operation during the reporting period.
The appropriate Case Officer considers the check of penetration agents
LITAMIL-3, LITAINT-7, and LITALUS-3 through LIFEAT to be of
utmost value in controlling these agents and checking their activities.
In addition, LIFEAT provided extremely valuable information in the
defection of Jose PARDO Llada, giving leads for both FI and PP
exploitation. Ald was also given in providing a check of the AMIRON
AWOLS in Mexico. In a related occurance, LIFEAT provided informa-
tion that indicates the Cuban Embassy in Mexico is being used as a
Guatemalan Communist communication channel to exiles in Cuba.
LIFEAT also provided daily information on travellers to Cuba,
(2) LIFEAT/LITMUS provided information for use in
the BECORN operation. It is also of continuing importance as a daily
check on the activities of the LITMUS personnel in Mexico.
(3) During the recent Latin American "Peace Confer
ence", LIFEAT provided information on the delegates to the Conference,
especially the U.S. delegates, as well as the activities of the Confer-
ence.
(4) LIFEAT coverage of Noah SEBORER provided advance
information on the travel to the United States of Anna SEBORER and
Maria and Enos WICHER. The actual departure and return of these
American Communists was also confirmed through LIFEAT.
b. Processing of Material
There has been no change in the processing of the

Section V, paragraph 2 (d)(1):
Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFTAT/LISTODE continued to be an essential check on the
activities and veracity of the penetration agents LITALUS-3,
LITALUS-4, LITANT-?, and LITANI1-3. It also provided daily infor-
mation on the activities of the Cuban official installation as well
as coverage of long-distance calls received by that installation
from llavana, Cuba. In relation to the AVIRON AMOLS in Mexico, LIFEAT
was able to help confirm that none of the AWCLS contacted the Cuban
Fmbassy. LIFEAT also picked up the return from Cala of Oscar
ROIRIQUEZ Moruna (person who desired employment as a Cuban (-2 agent).
(2)
LIFFAT/LITYUS continued to provide the interested Case
of the officials
Officer with daily information on the activities
of the LITMUS installation in Mexico City.
(3)
LIFEAT, through coverage of Xavier GUERRERO Saucedo and
his wife, Clara Porcet de QUERO, was able to provide information
on preparation activities of the recent Latin American Peace
Conference held in Mexico City. This line also provided information
of GUERRERO's contacts with other Communists, particularly Francis W.
and Libby Campbell PARK, Canadian Communists now residing in Mexico.
(4) Coverage of Noah and Anna STORER revealed the plans of Anna
SPECKER to travel to the U.S., and gave precise itinerary and flight
LIFFAT was also able to provide the plans
schedule for this travel.
and travel schedule on Fnes and Maria WICHER's travel to California.
This information is of interest to O and was passed locally to

the Station is also considering a move of Annex I if a suitable new sitc

d. Security
Operations at banghouse Annex VIII had to be discontinued on
10 October 1960 when the telephone company's installation crews moved
into the area of that basehouse and actually approached the annex to
investigate the number of lines entering the house. The crew was put
off until the next day with the standard, and normal for Mexico City,
excuse that the "Senor" was not at home and they could not enter
without his permission. By the time the crew returned on the following
day, the basehouse had been completely desired of all equipment, the
lines cut back to the roof-line and their ende treated with acid to
give then an aged aspengan. The crew was allowed to enter the
barehouse to check (and ultimately remove) the extral lines, with the
admonition that it was about time they cleaned up that mess on the
"Senor's" rocf. Operations will be resumed when a suitable new
barehouse site has been located and equipment installed. There have
been no secarity repercussions since the removal of the extra lines
by the telephone company.
The only other security note was in relation to Annex IV
and was covered in LIAISON section above.
f. Coverage
The number of lines covered by LIFFAT during the reporting
period has ranged from 2 to 15, but has averaged 12. The normal
breakdown of the LIFEAT coverage is as follows:
LI FRODE and related liner.
LITMUS and related lines.
American Communists...
Local Communists..........
Targets of Opportunity

3
It is hoped that once the telephone company has completed its
present city-wide cable and installation work, at least in the areas
of the basehouses, LIFEAT will be able to increase its coverage to
15 or 18 lince. The targets for this 3 to 6 line increase are already
noted by the Station.
C. Personnel
No change since last report. Headquarters is reminded that
the second tour of Ralph B. MAFANELLI (ps) will end in June 1961.
It is requested that a qualified replacement te provided from Head-
quarters.
2. a. During the reporting period, information from one hundred
thirty LIFFAT reels on coverage of American Communists in Mexico
was passed to the local office of QUENVY for its information.

Exploitation of Leads
(1) LIFTAT/LIFRODE, with related lines, provided overall
coverage of the local Cuban and exile activities, and was consi-
dered extremely valuable in support of Station operations in the
Cuban area. LIFTAT coverage of the Cuban Embassy enabled the
appropriate Case Officer to check the veracity and activities
of the penetrations of that installation; particularly WTATI-3,
LITALUS-3, and LITAINT-5. It was also invaluable in the debriefing
of LICOZE-1. LIFTAT material was the basis of an effective KUPARK
inspired press release concernin, derogatory activities of Cuban
Enlassy personnel.
AN
IN
PS
LIFEAT loads were of special value in two "one-timo"
operations. The first of these was the ability of LIFFAT t.
provide advance information on a meeting arranged between Map ✗
ROJAS Villa (aka James Pradford STENART) and a Cuban Enbassy
official. As a result of the lead time given by LIFEAT, the
Station was able to provide surveillance of the meeting and
arrange for the detention of ROJAS. Ultimately, HOJAS (a fugi.
tive from ODEVY) was returned to CDYCKE jurisdiction through
Station action. In a second case LIFEAT provided follow-up
information which, when provided to ODGE, lead to the appre-
hension of Thomas Howard 10 (aka Carl. JOHNSON). He, too,
had attempted to arrange a meeting with Cuban officials in
Mexico,
and was under warrant, for abduction in Chicago, Illinois.
LIFFAT information was heavily drawn upon in the case
of Guillermo HERNANDEZ Vega, porsible Castre agent, who was
suspected of penetrating the AMIRON proram. Through LIFFAT the
Station was able to monitor HERNATEE's attempts to contact
various Mexican and Cuban officials and to arrange for his
return to MADD before any such contacts were made.
.

(2) LIFFAT/LITUS continued to provide daily information on
the official Folish installation in Mexico City which is described
by the interested Case Officer as "invaluable and unique."
During this reporting period, najor contribution has been in
providing the leads which determines that a local cafe is a
front for much Polish intelligence activity in the area. It
has been further indicated that this cafe is the Headquarters for
a suspected Polish operation directed against the ODACID install-
ation (previously fully reported to KB, KUHICT, and D
in GA-15914, RNA-15995, and DD/A-16222. The telephone of
this cafe has been added to the LIFFAT coverage with resulting
increase of Station knowledge of Polish Intelligence activity.
·· Also of major interest was the LIFIAT support of a
Statien audio operation against the Polish Fribassy in Mexico
City.
In this, LIFFAT provided the information on delivery
date of a KUDARK "bugged" picce of equipment ordered by the
Polish: Fribassy. As a result of the lead time provided, the
Station was able to promptly initiate base house procurezent
and other support for this operation.

As a continuing assot, LIFEAT provided daily notice of
the activities and movements of Polish officials. In one case
LIFFAT provided advance information concerning travel plans of
one Jan KRZYWICKI, a person on the Folish Watch list.
(3) During the reporting period LIFEAT added to the security
of the Station in checking on present and past agent assets. Of.
particular note was the coverage of the activities of LIFTRE,
LIVESTOCK-1, and LIVESTOCK-2.
(4) Until terminated for security reasons (see SECURITY,
below), LIFTAT neverage of the U.A.R. Embassy provided independent
check of the activities of the members of that installation. of
nots were the LIFEAT revealed meetings between Vicente LOMBARDO
Toledano, former Mexican President Lazaro CARDENAS and the previous
U.A.R. Ambassador Anouar HATE. This coverage also provided infor-
mation concerning the vieit of an Algerian rebel delegation to
Mexico.
(5) LIFEAT provided coverage of the local Communists, the
American Communist Group in Mexico (AQM), and lately on two
important Canadian Communists living in Mexico. In its coverage
of local Communists LIF÷AT provided coverage of Carmen FRUFAU
Civit (admitted former Soviet agent), Xavier GUERRERO Saucedo
and his wife, Clara Porcet de CUERPERO, and Juan Luis CAMPOS
Villalobos. LIHAT provided icais indicated the place of employ-
ment of BRUFAU, as well as much of her daily routine, thereby
allowing the Station to initiate physical surveillance of her.
LIFFAT coverage of CAMPOS, of interest to the Station's Communist
Party Penetration Program, revealed his insincerity in cooperating
with KUBARK, and as a result efforts toward his full recruitment
were terminated with minimum danger to Station assets. Recently,
at Headquarters request, LIFFAT reinitiated its coverage of the
GUERREROS. This coverage has already provided information of the
continuing contact between the GUERREROS and Frank and Libby
PARK, Canadian Communist "inmigrantes" to Mexico and members of
the Labor Progressive Party (Canadian CP). The Station hopes to
mount a more comprehensive coverage of the PARKS as a result of
the LIFFAT lead. In the LIFFAT coverage of the ACUM, of parti-
calar interest was the advance travel plans of Albert MALTZ, Noah
and Anna SEBORER (as well as the travels of their sons Carl and
Robert SFBORER), Maria and Enos WICHER, and Grace and Sam NOVICK.
Daily activities of the ACCM are provided through LIFEAT to the
local office of ODENVY.
(6) The LIFFAT complex provided the security check of the
private office telephones of the Chief of Station and Deputy
Chief of Station, as well as checks of the home telephones of
certain of the Station officers (as reported in 10A-16465).
Since this service is unique and of value to Station security,
it will be utilized periodically to guard against hostile audio
surveillance.
50
Processing of Material
There has been no change in the processing of the internally
produced LIFFAT take. LINEAT processors continue to process the take
from the LIENVOY/LIMERICK coverage.
C.
Liaison
In November 1960, the local office of ODENVY requested that
coverage of Albert MALTZ be re-initiated. This was done for a short
period. However, due to the start of telephone company cable work
in the area of baschous Annex IV, coverage had to be terminated.
Technical surveillance will be resumed when cable work has been
completed.

REF:
HAMA 20305, 3 December 1962
1.
Reference problem was discussed by KURIT with David N. WILSTED,
during the latter's TDY at Headquarters in early December 1962.
.
2. KURIOT recommends the following solution and has furnished the
attached material for delivery to WILSTED for his use:
The terminal identification system consists of two fluids.
Vial "A" is collodion in which is mixed a small amount of phenolphthalein
and is intended to be used by the person who originally connects the wires.
Generously daubed on the end of the screw, this solution dries almost
immediately in a water repellant, invisible coating.
b. The second vial "B" contains household ammonia. If the baubar
in this bottle is drawn down the row of terminals in the connection box,
the tip of any screw which was previously treated with the phenolphthalein
will immediately turn a dark red color and then will vanish after a minute.
The ammonia can be reapplied and this reaction will repeat itself a couple
of times before more phenolphthalein has to be reapplied.

which LIENVOY now provides. This is exactly the work previously done by
ZINSMEISTER and the only difference is that tapes are made at a different
location. However, this does require close coordination within the Station of
these twɔ operations.
A problem which has arisen with the withdrawal of the
Soviet coverage from LIFEAT responsibility (sec SECURITY below) and the
"outage" experienced earlier in June on two of the most productive Soviet
lines, is the extreme drop in the production of positive intelligence from
LIFEAT coverage. It is hoped that with more intensive exploitation of the
coverage still available, plus exploitation of new lines being installed by LIFEAT,
that the production of positive intelligence will again measure up to that previously
provided by LIFEAT.
c. Liaison
No change other than the closer inter-office liaison with
Project LIENVOY due to the above noted LIFEAT processing of LIENVOY take
and the increased reel and finished product exchange this entails.
d. Security
On 21 June 1960 LITENSOR suggested to ∞OS that LIENVOY
begin operations against the Soviet and Satellite targets in Mexico City. In
order not to indicate that the unilateral LIFEAT operation was providing this
coverage, it was necessary for COS to agree to this suggestion. So as not to
jeapordize LIFEAT operations and personnel, LIFEAT coverage was suspended
on the Soviet Embassy and Polish Legation, and the applicable "crosses" were
pulled and cleaned. This was accomplished by 1030 on 22 June 1960. Coverage
continued on the home of Aleksandr BEKIER, Polish Conselor of Legation, since
no security problem seemed to be raised by continued coverage of this line.
e. Technical
The arrival in early June of a portion of the replacement
parts requested for LIFEAT use has enabled LIFEAT personnel to perform much
needed repair and maintenance work on the aging LIFEAT equipment.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F
52-6-1, section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1):
a. Exploitation of Leads
1) LIFEAT/LIERODE provided information which assisted in
the press exploitation of the story of Gladys Izquierdo Martinez de DELGADO,
wife of the recently deported (with the help of LIFEAT provided material) Cuban
agent Francisco DELGADO Garcia. LIERODE coverage was also the origin of
the lead which gave access to Cuban agent Elpi CASANOVA.
2) LIFEAT coverage was reactivated 18 July on LIVESTOCK-2
as a Station security operation to check the activities of the potentially dangerous
former agent.
3) LIFEAT also continued to provide the only independent means
of checking the veracity of Jose Luis CAMPOS Villalobos who is of interest to
the Station's Communist Party Penetration Program.
4) LIFEAT coverage of the American Communist Noah
SEBORER provided the Itinerary of SEBORER's trip, which commenced 17 August,
to Havana, New York, Moscow, and Tel Aviv.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F

a. Exploitation of Leads
5%
DES
LIFEAT/LIMERICK continued to provide advance inform-
ation on arrivals, departures, work assignments, and contacts of the Soviet
officials in Mexico City. In this area LIFEAT provided the following: advance
travel information on the return of First Secretaries Yevgeniy BOCHKOV and
Yuriy ALEKSANDROV from consultations in the USSR, advance information
on the arrival in Mexico of the Georgian Ballet on June and its subsequent
departure for Cuba on 20 June accompanied by Assistant Cultural Officer
Aleksandr EROVKIN, and advance information on the assignment and arrival
of new Consular Officer Serafim V. DUNIN. LIFEAT leads provided on the
continuing attempts of the Soviets to rent apartments are being checked by
the Station surveillance team.
LIFEAT/LIERODE continued to provide excellent owerage
of the activities of the Cuban Embassy staff, particularly providing exploitable
coverage of Cuban intelligence activities. Of major importance during the
month of June was the acquisition of leads on the activities of Cuban "tourist"
Francisco DELGADO Garcia. As a result of these leads, passed to the
Mexican government in disguised form, DELGADO was arrested on the night
of 7 July and thereafter deported. LIFEAT information also enabled the
responsible Case Officer to alert agent LIMASK to threats made by DELGADO
to have LIMASK arrested, The LIERODE related owwerage of the telephone of
Santiago GARCES Arroyo has enabled the Station to maintain a check on the
activities of AMSHAD-1, including his possible role as middle-man in a "frozen
pegos for sugar" deal reported in MEXI-5794.
LIFEAT/LITMUS provided information on the activities of
the Polish Legation during June, particularly noting the travel plans of Pɔlish
Intelligence Officer Thadeusz ZIOLKOWSKI.
LIFEAT coverage of a member of the Mexican Communist
Party (PCM) is used in checking the veracity of Juan Luis CAMPOS Villalobos
who is of interest to the Station's Communist Party Penetration Program.
LIFEAT also agreed to suppor: Project LIENVOY in the
processing of the Soviet take when LIENVOY picked up coverage of the Soviet
lines LIFEAT was forced to relinquish on 22 June 1960 (See SECURITY beina).
LIFEAT, though short of processors, agreed to the processing when it was
learned that LIENVOY would be unable to process the added coverage it had
undertaken.

On the evening of 18 June COS met with LITENSOR at the home of LIELEGANT
(see MEXI-5761). Among other subjects discussed, LITENSOR urgently
suggested that OOS arrange coverage of the Soviet/Satellite installations.
Since this coverage is obviously one of great interest to KUBARK, COS was
left with no alternative but to enthusiastically accept LITENSOR's suggestion.
LIELEGANT was equally enthusiastic about the suggestion and requested COS
to furnish a list of target lines as coon as possible. On 21 June Malcolm Q.
EDELAND passed to LIENVOY/2 a list of 4 Soviet, 2 Pollai, 2 Czech and 2 Yugo-
slay lines. The Polish, the Czech, Yugoslav and 1 Soviet line were placed with in
two days. Meanwhile all LIFEAT Soviet/Satellite Ines were removed. After
due consideration it was decided to advise LIENVOY/2 that we would prefer to
drop the 2 Pollah lines and at least one Yugoslav line and use all remaining
available lines (LIENVOY can handle a maximum of 30 lines, always keeping
two spares) to cover a total of five Soviet lines and keeping the two Czech Unes
already in operation. This was agreed to but the four additional Sovter lines
could not be placed immediately due to the temporary absence from the city of
LIENVOY/3 whose aid was needed to fulfill this assignment,
The eventuality of a request from high Mexican officials for LIENVOY coverage
of Soviet/Satellite with its attendant affect upon LIFEAT had been foreseen by
the Station for sometime. On at least two previous occasions when a hint way
made to COS by lesser officials than LITENSOR, COS was able to dissuade
these officials on the basis of lack of qualified personnel for processing, trans-
cribing, and explotting the take that would come from taps against Søvlet/.
Satellite installations. However, on the above occasion when LITENSOR even
went so far as to suggest that the translations could be handled by language
experts at Headquarters COS was in no position to argue this point with.
LITENSOR. The actual Implementation of the change over of Soviet/Satellite
coverage from LIFEAT to LIENVOY (LIFEAT went back on Polish Legation in
late June) was accomplished smoothly, with no flaps and the Station does not en-
vision any problems, certainly, in the immediate future..
The processing and transcribing is being handled in exactly the same fashion as
before i. e., LIENVOY is doing the taps only, LIFEAT personnel are processing
the tapes from LIENVOY. As far as the Mexicans are concerned, the tapes are
being forwarded to Headquarters for processing with the transcriptions being
sent back to the Station for our information.. The Station has promised
LIENVCY/2 and LIELEGANT a monthly summary of any interesting highlighta
that appear in these transcriptions.

were transferred to the Intercept Center where they are now
responsible for doing the bill transcription of the tapes covering
lines of laterest to KUBARK.
C. LialeoU
During the month of June COS was in contact with
LIELEGANT on the average of four times, each week. As stated
En paragraph one above, COS met with LITENSOR on 18 June.
D. Security
It is belleved that the security of the project has been
Improved with the closing of Unit C and the elimination of all Unit
C personnel with the exception of LIENVOY/6 and 7 who were
transferred to the Intercept Ske. During the absence of Arnold
F. AREHART, Malcol:n Q. EDELAND was in direct contact with
LIENVOY/2 and took advantage of this contact to repeatedly
strees the necessity for tight security of this operation as
well as personal security of the various LIENVOYs. For
operational efficiency, contact once a week will be maintained
between LIENVOY/2 and EDELAND.
E. Technical
Early in June AREHART returned to Headquarters to
convert to Staff Agent and pick up his family to return Pcs Mexico
City. He and his family arrived 24 June. AREHART reported on
his return that some of the equipment was in need of attention but
that there were no technical problems during his absence.

With the elimination of Unit C the following personnel
were terminated during the month of June:

Between the dates 9 to 14 June during the viet of CORTICOS, LIENVCY covered
10 of the 20 Ithes of the Del Prado Hotel where the DORFICOS party was staying.
This coverage was for 24 hours cally and the LIENVOY personel monitored all
calls coming to and golig from the DORTICOS suite (see MEXI-5731). This
service was requested by the Station the day before TORTICOS &ival in Mexico
City and was readily agreed to and immediately put into affect thru the efforts of
LIENVOY/2. Considerable information of interest and value was obtained from
this operation as well as quantities of operational data,
Also, during the month of June LIENVOY/9 was dispatched to Cuba on a apocial
assigament per HMMW-8765. LIENVOY/9 successfully accomplished his
mission, returning on 6 July. The results from this mission will be forwarded
to Headquarters in a separate dispatch.

6. The Polish table of organiza ion had already been determined, with
the possible exception of Jue newcomer to the Polish Commercial Office who has
not yet been completely identified, and there were no changes during the month.
It is believed that most of the Yugoslavs have been identified,
7. The process of accumulating Information on Czech personnel has not
yet gous far enough for the Station to plek one or two likely targers for congeni

officer, arrived an 30 Jane and will naturally recelys all possible coverage. The
Starton received a proposal from Headquarters for special after fou to be paid to
Jaroslav VALENTA, the Commercial Attache; unfortunaraly, VALENTA had jus
departed on home leave, so action is being deferred unill his retura in August,
3. Among the Poles, coucantrated attention is belag paid to Aleksander
BKKIER and Stanislaw ADAMOWICZ by means of telephone taps. The uswly
arrived Polish intelligence officer will, If technically possible, receive the same
Coverage as soon as his permanent address is determined, although this will
probably mean dropping the BEKIER 16. Physical surveillance was ruu în
Tadeusz ZOLKOWSKI and Henryk POTASZ during the month, the former being

a number of possible IS compacts which are now being followed up. The
POTASZ surveillance was own practically immediately.

Forms executed call Poies except the custodial personnal, Henryk POTASZ
(whose form is in the process of completion), and the three newcomers about
whom linle is yet known. As a result of this activity, Roman CZYZYCKI
and Mieczyslaw WLODAREK have tentatively béau selected as worthy of closer
concentratica, the former on a long-term basis and the latter on a short-term
husls. CZYZYCKI is Ierest tag because he is ambitious and apparently not
intellectually committed to the regime, he is the close assistan; of Aleksander
BEKIER and heace has access to information of value, his entire family is
with him, and he is young enough to be able to make a new life for himself if
flight should become nagnssary. Attempts are now belag made to develop a
couract to him thrusigh one of his many acqualvances in the Mexican press.
10. WLODAREK is interesting mataly because he is Minister, and
because he seems to be dissatisfied with his prospects. HMMA-13177 of:
17 June transmitted information about a possible avenue of approach to him,
Information received more receurly disclosed that the doctor, who had been
rautatively spotted as a means of access to Mrs. WLODAREK, is indeed
anil-Communist but is also ou unfriendly terms with Mrs. WLODAREK,
ODACID persœurel, who had been asked to culitvate WLODAREK at diplomatic
functions, have reported that WLODAREK hàm àot attended my at which they
have beau presan. No Halſtood is now foreseen of any means of contact to
WLODAREK, and indicartons are that his recall may take place some time
this summer.
11. An attempt early in June to recruit a source close to Tadeus:
ZOLKOWSKI falled when it was discovered that the individual did not have
the access she had been balleved to have. Details were sent to Headquarters
in HMMA-15115 of 8 June.
12. Information on a possible source of operational intelligence un
Czech personnel was obtained from LIKAYAK/2 and forwarded to Headquarters
10 HMMA-15082 of 3 June and HMMA-15199 of 22 June. The mail tuercept on
the Czech accommodation address has began to function, but so far has
produced nothing of value.

ABSTRACT
MICROFIL
1. The purpose of this dispatch is to request Headquarters' assistance
in a problem involving clandestine markings for terminals in a telephone cable
cross box.
2. Specifically. It is desired to have the capability of recognizing which
cable terminals in a box are being used for telephone tapping without having any
markings apparent to unauthorized persons. This system is needed for use in
the event that taps must be disconnected quickly under the threat of a possible
security problem,
3. The tap connections are made by LIFEAT telephone company per-
sonnel and the terminals could be marked by them at the time the tap is made,
The connections sometimes have to be removed by another person who is not
familiar with the connections.
4. It is felt that a quick drying, transparent glue or lacquer that would
fluoresce brightly under UV illumination would be appropriate. A material that
could be removed later by wiping or chipping it away would be desirable but this
characteristic is not vital.
5. The system must be usable in open shade, although some additional
shade might be had by partially closing the doors of the box, and the light source
must be portable and if possible have the appearance of an ordinary flashlight.
The light source can be brought within two inches of the terminals,

David M. WILSTED (ps) departed Mexico City on 21 May 1960 for
home leave and Headquarters consultation of approximately two months duration,
His duties as outside Case Officer and principal technician have been undertaken
by Ralph B. RAFANELLI (ps) and LIFEUD-8.
-
1.2. a. During the month of May 1950, information from twenty-three
LIFEAT reels on coverage of American Communists in Mexico were passed to
the local ODENVY office for its information. During the period 10 May through
16 June LIFEAT processed this take as the ODENVY processor was on home
leave. Twenty-six reels of LIENVOY coverage of Sam Brooks were also passed
to the local ODENVY office under the guise of LIFEAT material.

e) Advance information was provided on the following
trável: Soviet Ambassador 3AZYKIN to leave 21 june 1960 for home leave in
the USSR; planned departure of Vladimir NOVIKOV, Cultural Officer, for home
leave in the USSR and return to Mexico; departure for home leave 31 May 1960
of known RIS officer Colone! Dmitriy KUZNETSOV; that thirteen Soviet officials
are returning to the USSR during the months of July and August 1960 with no
indication that these are to be replaced (Five of these are known RIS officers;
Yuriy CHELPANOV, Pavel KOVALEV, Yevgeniy LAPSHEV, Vladimir MAKOVKIN,
and Grigori YEFREMOV).
4). Due to advance information provided through LIFEAT/LITMUS,
the Station was able to cover a clandestine inecting of Alexandr BEKIER, Polish
Counselor of Legation in Mexico, and provide identification of BEKIER's contact.
Through coordination with MKCHARITY and the Station's KURIOT representative,
both audio and photo surveillance of the meeting were arranged,
5) LIFEAT/LIERODE significantly supported the Station's
efforts in the Cuban operations field by providing leads that lead to and assisted
in the recruitment of agent LITALUS-3, a penetration of the Cuban Embassy who
is to be handled by LITALUS-1. LIERODE is also utilized as a continuing check
on the activities of the newly recruited agent,
6) The Station's CE priority has been supported through coverage
of the phone used by PCM members juan Luis CAMPOS Villalobos and Marlo PEREZ
Marta. This coverage has provided information of value concerning addresses,
phone numbers, and contacts of other PCM members. It has also been employed
as a cross-check of statements made by CAMPOS to Howard O. MOSCHIANO.
7) LIFEAT provided information on travel planned and
accomplished by associates of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)
particularly that of Maria WICHER to Moscow, the return of Alber: MALTZ to
Mexico, and the planned travel of Noah SEBORER to Moscow In August,
b. Processing of Material
During the month of May 1960, the quantity of raw information
processed was noticeably reduced, and thus the amount of positive intelligence
derived was also reduced, due to the "outage" on certain of the most productive
LIFEAT lines. Principally involved were the Soviet lines, including one week
break on an Embassy line, three weeks on the Soviet Motion Picture Office line,
and one week on the Soviet Commercial Office line. These "outages" were
primarily due to the telephone company pulling the LIFEAT crosses, or the
target telephone being out of order.
c. Liaison
As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT is
in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists in Mexico to
ODENVY for their processing. No other Haison is considered necessary or
desireable.
d. Security
No security problems arose that were not readily solved by the
personnel concerned, nor did these jeopardize the operation.

a. Exploitation of Leads

AGR
During the month of May 1960, Project LIFEAT continued to provide
excellent coverage of the activities of the official Soviet and Cuban installations
in Mexico City, the Station's top priority targets. The following are specific,
though necessarily selective, contributions made by LIFEAT through provision of
exploitable leads and support to Mexico City Station,
1) The most outstanding single contribution of the LIMERICK
phase of Project LIFEAT during the period of this monthly review was the
providing of information to the responsible Case Officer which confirmed the
validity of agent LITARDY-1. This double agent turned himself into ODENVY,
and thus to KUBARK, during the latter part of the review period. LIFEAT/
LIMERICK provided data on the activities and Soviet contacts of LITARDY-1,
thus enabling the case officer to adequately plan productive use of this new asset.
2) LIMERICK continued to provide Project LIMESA with support
in the form of information on goods and services provided to the Soviets from
the local economy. Of special interest was information on specific apartments
which the Soviets were considering renting. LIMERICK also continued to provide
valuable information on Soviet commercial activities which has been reported
separately.
3) Also provided was information of a CE nature concerning
specific assignments of personnel within the Soviet Embassy, advance travel
plans of Soviet officials, and arrivals, departures, and addresses of Embassy
staff members. The following are examples of this category of information:
a) Vitaliy Borisovich SHUBIN arrived 11 May 1950 and
is probably the Intelligence Officer replacement for Yevgeniy LAPSHEV. The
address of SHUBIN was also provided by LIFEAT.
b) Aleksandr BROVKIN was assigned duties as Assistant
Cultural Officer to replace Vladimir NOVIKOV during the latter's home leave.
c) Valentin BAKULIN was appointed Soviet Film Officer
in charge of distribution of Soviet films, including propaganda films.
d) Advance notice was given of the 20 May arrival of the
Soviet delegation to the International Cotton Conference held in Mexico City,
and noted that the delegation would be composed of Dmitriy MAITOV, Boris
FIRSOV, Abdulla SULTANKHODZKAYEV, and Vladilyena TERESHCHINA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/WH/3/Mex.co
SUBJECT:
LIFEAT
8 June 1960
✓
1. During my recent visit to Mexico I had a good chance to go
over many of the ins-and-outs of this project with the Case Officer
and with other officers in the Station. At Station staff meeting I
stated that reporting on CI material derived from the project was
inadequate and COS appeared to go along with this view. The concengus
I got from the Case Officers was that the SP. Case Officer is not
sufficiently alert to the need for reporting on the CI aspects of
the matter and is limiting himself to strictly servicing SR. Division
mattors. Various Case Officers cited instances to me of conversations
pointing to new clandestine relationships or containing previously
known clandestine relationships in the Soviet field which have not
been reported. Owing to a lack of time, I was unable to examine the
records myself, but I am inclined to accept those statements as true,
2. The Case Officer gave me a general run-down of the situation
of the agents on this project and it appears that everything is running
very well. He told me that in Ms new project outline, which will
be up in a week or two, ho is including some raises to some of the
agents. He told me that on his last round of pay raises he had some
difficulty hero at headquarters. If any difficulty seems forthcoming
this time, I should like to have the matter brought to my attention
'because, as you know, I feel very strongly on this matter and fought
the same battles with headquarters for at least five years.
3. In speaking with the Case Officers or the Cuban side, as well
as on the CI, it was apparent that LIFEAT remains probably the biggest
single source of information available to the Kexico City Station
and that every effort should be made to continue its smooth functioning.
If this means a couple of hundred pesos increase to each agent semi-annually
or annually, it does not seem to be too much of a strain and I do not
see why we should have any trouble. When I compare the salaries of
the base operators and processors on this project, especially considering
the illegal position they are in, with those of relatively unproductive
agents elsewhere in Mexico and in many other Stations, I cannot help
but feel that we are buying a great deal for our money in this project.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
DEBRIEFING OF DAVID M. WILSTED (ps)
6 June 1960
1. On 1 June 1960 Mr. John G. Heyn and Mr. Jolin Kennedy of WHD,
Mr. Robert, Brown of CI/OPS, Mr. Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr. Charles
Bray of FI/D met with David M. WILSTED (ps).
'
2. WILSTED emphasized that the whole telephone system in Mexico
City is undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,
has sub-contracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
system to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off de-
cause there should be, more surplus lines. The renovation work has
hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines
now are underground and we cannot get access to them before they enter
the central. This is particularly true with respect to the Czech Em-
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy.
3. WILSTED said that we try to keep track of the activities of
"Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
prior warning of their presence in a certain area.
4. In the recent past, Mexico has been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. de have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. However, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must have telephone lines in-
stalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company carmot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber.:
5. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.
6. WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a
regular telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold.

contacts, Mony DESWAAN, over the latter's failure to pay the Soviets for two
shipments of Russian farm tractors for which DESWAAN has received payment
from the Mexican Government, the ultimate purchaser. LIFEAT indicates
DESWAAN has made himself unavailable to the Soviets since two of his checks
have "bounced" for lacks of funds. LIFEAT further noted that the Soviets are
concerned over reports that DESWAAN is planning an carly summer trip to
Europe with his entire family.
LIMERICK provided valuable support to the Station's AEIMPULSE
operation by furnishing detailed information on the DeSwaan and Esteve Brothers
commercial dealings with the Soviets. It was also employed as a security device
after the conclusion of the above operation.
Leads were provided on two properties of Interest to the Soviets,
Calle Mazatlan #208 and Calle Chilpancingo #13, which were a valuable contribution
to the LIMESA Project.
II)
LIFEAT/LITMUS was the source of information on the arrival in
and departure from Mexico City of Polish officials Jozef WINEWICZ, former
Polish Ambassador to Washington, and Bolesław JELEN.
LIFEAT/LIERODE continued to provide excellent operational
leads concerning Cuban and exile operations. Of particular note was the ability
of Station Mexico to warn an ODACID officer of a possible "walk-in" provocation
attempt by an agent of the Cuban Embassy. LIERODE also provided information
on four American citizens who entered Mexico on their way to Honduras to join
an anti-Somoza revolutionary attempt.
b. Processing of Material
Although the LIFEAT project must be considered primarily a
Station support project, an effort to further exploit LIFEAT for positive
intelligence has been made by assigning the assistant case officer the task of
coordinating the efforts of the appropriate area case officers and the Station
reports officer in matters concerning LIFEAT produced information. Although
this system has been tested only during the month of April, it is hoped that it
will prove of value in increasing the positive intelligence take from LIFEAT
provided material.
No change was made in the manner of processing the raw LIFEAT
reels during the month of April.
c.. Liaison
As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT
is in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists in Mexico to
ODENVY for their processing. No other liaison is considered necessary or
desireable.
d. Security
LIFEAT/LIVERY continued to remain out of operation due to the
extensive telephone company installation and renovation work being carried on
in the vicinity of the LIVERY basehouse. No definite date can be given for the
completion of the telephone company work.
e. Technical
No change.

a.
Exploitation of Leads
D The LIMERICK phase of the LIFEAT operation is able
continuously to provide the interested case officers with background personality
information on the members of the Soviet Embassy staff, as well as travel infor-
mation on Soviet officials and diplomatic couriers. During the month of April
1960, this type of information was exploited for the following: ·

a) Viktor Nikolayevich GLCTOV, First Secretary,
will be the replacement for Vladimir Georgiyevich NOVIKOV
as Cultural Officer when the latter leaves for the USSR on
29 May 1960. He will also act as the Soviet Ambassador's
executive secretary during the home leave of Vladimir Ivan-
ovich CHERNYSHEV. CHERNYSHEV departed for leave on
17 April.
H
b) Nikolai ZHOUGANOV was the replacement for
Anatolly Konstantinovich YEMELYANOV, Commercial
Office employee who works "upstairs" in the Chancellery.
rather than in the Commercial Office. This indicated
that ZHOUGANOV may be a code clerk.
c) Confirmation that four aliens are employed in the
Chancery as teachers, one of whom teaches English.
d) Indications of increased contact between the Soviet
and Cuban officials as noted in the travel of Soviet officers
to Havana and conversations between the Cuban Embassy
and the Soviet Ambassador indicating an announcement of
importance was to be made on 8 May, possibly concerning
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba
and the USSR.
e) Through the review of past LIFEAT traffic and
the direct statements of the Soviet Embassy personnel in
discussions of "duty rosters", it has been determined that
a reduction in the Embassy staff is in progress. Future
LIFEAT information should disclose whether this reduction
is of a permanent or temporary nature.

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-R
52-6-1, section V, paragraph 2 (₫) (1).
DESTAPO
FI
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet During the reporting period, LIFEAT coverage
of Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV provided an important and valuable check con-
firming the reporting of a number of KUBARK controlled double agents targeted
against this Soviet officer. Also, coverage of the Soviet Bulletin Office, al-
though not considered vital, does complete Station coverage of the Soviet
target and does provide daily information on the activities and contacts of the
Bulletin Office personnel.
(2) LIFEAT/Polish
LIFEAT continued to provide vital Information
concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both Individuals
and their daily activities.
(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usual coverage of day-to-day
activities of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have indicated the possi-
bility of a successful recruitment of a Mexican employee of that installation.
LIFEAT information will become even more valuable for continuing assess-
ment of the potential agent and forming of a plan for approach to the Mexican
In question.
(4) LIFEAT/Communist Party Coverage in this area gave Station
its first information concerning the second arrest of LINLUCK, as well as
providing sonie information on important persons in the Mexican Communist
movement.

(5) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT provides continuing coverage of the.
daily activities and contacts of juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo. Although most
of the leads gathered will depend on future exploitation, one contact with an
ODYOKE official was noted by LIFEAT (see reference b).
7.5
(6). LIFEAT/Cuban Of late, much of the emphasis of the LIFeat
operation has been directed toward support of Station operations in this area.
Coverage included monitoring of the activities of AMSTET-1 for the interested
Case Officer. This information provided daily leads for the Case Officer in
his contacts with AMSTET-1. LIFEAT also covered three lines in support
of the AMSTRUT operation. Of this support the interested Case Officer has
noted LIFEAT provided very valuable coverage of the important AMSTRUT.
operation during October. The coverage gave valuable operational leads
and resolved what would otherwise have been areas of uncertainty or
groundless suspicion. This allowed the case officers to move with more
certainty in developing the operation than would otherwise have been prudently
possible. It is noted that LIFEAT's continuing coverage is proving to be most
helpful.
(7) LIFEAT/American Communists LIFEAT continued to provide
information of interest to ODENVY. Travel and contacts of the ACGM are
particularly worthwhile.
"
(8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous LIFEAT continued its coverage of
former Station asset LIVESTOCK-2. This was in keeping with Station's
policy of making periodic checks of the activities of former, potentially
dangerous agents.
It should be noted that It is the Station's opinion that LIFEAT's
excellent overall service, plus its ability to provide unilateral coverage of
targets of opportunity on short notice (sometimes on as little as two hours
notice), make LIFEAT a dependable daily contributor to the fulfilling of the
Station's mission.
B. PROCESSING OF TAKE
No change from previous report.
C. LIAISON
c
During the month of October the two playback recorders used by
the ODENVY processor broke down. These were repaired by the LIFEAT
technician, David M. WILSTED. ODENVY continued to process take from
the LIFEAT/American Communists in Mexico lines.
D. SECURITY
There have been no known adverse security incidents effecting the
LIFEAT operation during the reporting period. LIFEAT meeting sites con-
tinue to be changed periodically. The fourteen regular and six alternate
sites used for daily contact between the Station Case Officer and WILSTED
and Wayne C. DRABAND are considered adequate. Numerous meeting sites
are used for contacts between WILSTED/DRABAND and the basehouse keepers.
E. TECHNICAL.
Audio and dial tape recorders ordered by the Station in support of the
LIFEAT operation began to arrive at the end of October. These were placed
in immediate service. It is noted that the automatic tape stop on the new
model Revere audio recorder has thus far proven to be of no use to the operation
