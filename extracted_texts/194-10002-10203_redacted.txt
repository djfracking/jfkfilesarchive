"RAMPARTS" MAGAZINE
"Pamparts" in a letter to subscribers dated
May 1, 1968, announced that beginning June 1,
1968, it would be published biweekly at a
yearly subscription price of $15. In this
letter "Ramparts" described itself as follows:
"... the first national publication to consis-
tently reveal the ribbon of lies supporting
America's involvement in Vietnam; we stripped
the curtain from America's 'invisible government'
by exposing CIA's unlicensed intrusion into our
domestic lives%;B we dared to write about the
applications of the Catholic Church's political
Dower; we warned, years before the Kerner
report, that white racism was the base of
America's racial problems; we blasted away at
the corroded institutions of Cold War liberalism.
Ramparts' is now the largest left-of-center
commercial magazine in the history of the United
States..."

Intruding Struggles
"Marines won't go to jail and the people
who sent them won't go to jail but we will.' Never-
theless, he said, 'We must engage in struggles that
intrude.'
"Most of us were not born to be revolu-
tionary. But one becomes a revolutionary not out
of choice but when the situation demands it,' he
stated. 'The time calls for it now and we must find
solidarity in a spirit of CHE GUEVARA,' he concluded"
A leaflet issued by "Campus Stop the Draft Week
Committee" advertised a noon rally to be held Friday, (January
26, 1968) at UCB with six speakers, including ROBERT SCHEER
and BETTINA APTHEKER.

Observation by SA of FBI
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette" newspaper, issue of
January 27, 1968, reported on the rally at UCB, which was
held January 26, 1968, attended by about 700 persons.
This article quoted ROBERT SCHEER as follows;
"We must switch to tactics which intrude
which are effective. We must act in the spirit of
a CHE GUEVARA because this is the time for the
spirit of a CHE GUEVARA,'
"We must start to plan now for the next
Stop the Draft Week,' the editor of Ramparts Maga-
zine urged. 'We must seriously think of filling
the jails because Stop the Draft Weeks must go on,
and if jail is the price to pay, we must pay it.
"Unless protest is effective, it is a
charade,' he said."

January 26, 1968
"The Daily Californian" newspaper, which is self-
identified as being published daily by the Associated Students
of UCB, on January 29, 1968, carried a news article
entitled "Radical Groups Emphasize Need for Mutual Self-
Protection'. This article described a rally sponsored by
MAPS held at noon on the UCB campus January 26, 1968, in
which "members of the PFP, "Ramparts", Black Panthers, the
mathematics faculty and political activists addressed the
crowd in drizzling rain. The article carries summaries of
the speeches of numerous pople, including BETTINA APTHEKER
KURZWEIL, a self-admitted Communist Party member, and ROBERT
SCHEER. The article contained the following regarding
SCHEER:
"BOB SCHEER, Managing Editor of Ramparts
magazine, also spoke. He began with a comment on
the carnival mood of the rally.
Roman Carnival
"There is something obscene or bizarre
about the Roman carnival attitude when seven people
are in jail,' he commented, referring to the fact
that Martha's Laundry was playing on the lower
"plaza and evangelists were singing and preaching
on the corner.
"'The United States is now fighting a war of
examples,' he said. 'They're saying "there are
certain things which we will not tolerate and we
will make examples of those who attempt them,"" he
continued.
And the war of examples in Vietnam
has been brought home, he added.
"He strongly emphasized the fact that the
government will permit a type of false liberty so
that one feels free--as long as it does not intrude
on government policies.

On February 4, 1968, ROBERT SCHEER appeared as a
guest on a nationally televised "Firing Line" television
show at 6:30 PM, Pacific Standard Time, where he was
involved in a type of debate with WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY,
Editor of "National Review". BUCKLEY stated ROBERT
SCHEER was invited to appear on this program to explain
the un-American attitude of SCHEER and also of "Ramparts"
Magazine, SCHEER said he was not previously apprised of
the exact topic but in any case could not speak for
"Ramparts" since he is only one member of the editorial
board. SCHEER then became evasive, claiming he wanted
a definition of "un-American" before he could answer
BUCKLEY. During this show, SCHEER stated that "National
Review" Magazine had maligned SCHEER when it stated he
traveled to Cuba in violation of State Department regu-
lations and SCHEEP requested a retraction be printed.
SCHEER did not state that he had traveled to CUBA illegally
in 1960 and legally in 1968, but such is the case. SCHEER
was very glib but was very evasive in answering BUCKLEY'S
questions and statements. SCHEER's statements showed him
stongly in opposition to the Vietnam war.
Television, February 7, 1968
ROBERT SCHEER appeared on the Pat Michaels'
television show at 10:30 p.m. on KTVU, Channel 2, Oakland
on February 7, 1968. During this appearance, SCHEER stated
he attended the Cultural Congress held in Havana, Cuba in
early January, 1968. He said he traveled in Cuba via Mexico
City as an accredited correspondent with the approval of the
State Department and that he traveled alone. The interview
related to SCHEER's work as managing editor of "Ramparts

"Ramparts" magazine is largely staff produced and has
nothing to offer but the guts and freedom of its reporters to
report facts as they see them. "Ramparts" does not edit the
reporters' articles for opinion or value of concept. These
articles are only edited for size and possible emphasis for a
particular issue so that there would not be four articles on
Vietnam in a single issue, for instance.
for instance. When "Ramparts" sends
a reporter to do a story it prints what the reporter writes
even though the Editor does not necessarily agree with that
reporter's viewpoint.
SCHEER feels that the United States is more
afflicted with an extremely biased press because in the United
States we have the illusion of freedom and Americans are raised
to believe that we have a free press while in fact the press is
controlled through "an interlocking directorate of big business,
big military and big government" that effectively manages the
news so that it is not troubling or upsetting to their interests.
SCHEER believes that the honest reporting of news by
"Ramparts" is doing "an awful lot of good" because a generation
is being raised in the United States that knows how to be free
for a change and "is not going to buy the nonsense that comes
out of Washington". The youths are asking some very searching
questions about American society and are not satisfied with the
usual glibness so they are willing to go on marches because
they do not buy these answers. This is a very large minority
of youths.
Most of the American soldiers in Vietnam have been
raised to believe that their country always does right and have
an implicit racism. They realize that the Vietnamese do not
really share United States objectives. For instance "There
is a 650,000 man Vietnamese army that never does any fighting"
"It is very clear that the Viet Cong has considerable support
from the countryside and has done some very fine things in the
countryside."
There are some cracks in the brainwashing and some
disillusionment with the war in Vietnam even among American troops.
More people have refused to fight and more people in the army

Television, February 23, 1968
ROBERT SCHEER was interviewed by BRANT FRAYNE
and PAUL SALTZMAN at the Expo '67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada,
in June, 1967, and the results of this interview were shown
on Canadian Broadcasting Company television network on February
23, 1968. Some of the points emphasized by SCHEER in this inter-
view are as follows:
"Ramparts" magazine, of which SCHEER is Editor, tries
to be exciting and to fill a void in American life. It tries
to handle the stories the other magazines do not have the guts
to handle and to give some diversity of opinion in the mass media
of America. It is an experiment in seeing whether American
freedom and democracy really works. Other magazines are locked
into the establishment because of the funding required to start a
magazine and the income received from advertisers, while "Ramparts"
is probably the only large circulation magazine in America that
does not depend on advertising.
:
"Ramparts" made a decision to challenge the big
magazines and to turn to a secular monthly magazine two and
half years ago (about January, 1965) and it no longer has any
connection with or particular interest in the Catholic Church.
It is aimed at challenging the establishment and its readers,
who are primarily in the 15 to 40 year age group.
and
Ramparts" has been called a muckraker
left-wing. It is on the left of the political spectrum since
it opposes the war in Vietnam and is interested in removing the
ghettos in American life. "Ramparts" is based as a left-wing
opposition to "Time" magazine but "Time" is biased toward the
establishment and toward maintaining the status quo. "Ramparts"
has never been sued for libel or had a serious challenge to its
factual accuracy. "Ramparts" has a small staff of only 30 and
has successfully challenged the other big magazines with exten-
sive advertising revenue and has done a more factual reporting
job on the Vietnam War, its casualties, civil rights stories
and stories on such topics as the children of suburbia rebelling
against suburban community and its values.

have taken those critical steps rather than go along with the
fighting. It is not a significant number yet, but SCHEER
believes it is growing. "We have to figure out whether the
United States is Rome on the rise or Rome in decay and hopefully
America's empire is on the verge of cracking up.
When asked if he could make a generalization about the
American housewife and American married life, SCHEER stated,
"The average American is drunk most of the time." SCHEER
explained that the average American has a couple of drinks before
starting home and several more when he arrives at home. The
cocktail hour is all about getting "yourself numb enough that
you can take your wife and kids and then you usually fall asleep
in front of the television."

The "Albion Pleiad," Albion College weekly newspaper,
Albion, Michigan, in its issue of March 1, 1968, carried an
article headlined, "SCHEER Rips NORRIS, College The article
stated SCHEER was scheduled to speak on the "relevance of
academe in response to cultural needs," but abandoned this
topic and instead dissected the speech given by Albion College
President LOUIS W. NORRIS to freshmen at this school in the fall
of 1967. SCHEER said Dr. NORRIS' speech stressed the importance
of vicarious learning and the central role of the "great
conversation." SCHEER said the "great conversation is a bore.
SCHEER stated that white middle class Americans want to make
revolution without doing anything revolutionary. SCHEER said
Dr. NORRIS stated in his speech "hippies" did not belong on
Albion's campus. SCHEER replied to this "with these ideas he
shouldn't be president of a university, and I wouldn't have to
make these statements if he hadn't given such a speech to the
freshmen. He said that America can no longer engage in foreign
aggression in the guise of extending freedom. SCHEER concluded
his speech by stating that to alleviate these crises America
should dismantle the defense apparatus, turn to a peace economy
and get out of Vietnam.
"
"
One of the critics of SCHEER's speech was quoted in
this article as saying, "Some of what he said was admirable, but
he was so irrational and so boorish and had excruciating bad
taste."

communism is the main reason that we are in that war. SCHEER
stated "that the Viet Minh forerunner to the Viet Cong was a
serious struggle for independence and fought the French who they
considered as foreign aggressors. Both Diem and Ky, South
Vietnamese leaders, worked for the French and thus the Viet Cong.
consider them traitors to their people. Since the U.S. supports
Ky and formerly supported Diem, it was natural for the Viet Cong
to fight against the U.S." SCHEER said "the U.S. should settle
for something along the line of the 1954 Geneva accords to get
out of Vietnam. SCHEER added that he thought it would be good for

ticket). SCHEER said this is a racist society in which we
live and the government's efforts to "control" the black man
is causing opposition to the government. He said we were

symposium was held at Dartmouth College on November 14, 1968
with five speakers participating. The article began by quoting
ROBERT SCHEER, Editor in Chief of "Ramparts" magazine, as
stating "you must use the means at hand, which might mean
buring your ROTC building to challenge the institution". The
article said "the program climaxed with Scheer's appeal for
the students of the college to assert themselves 'by
challenging the institution that is manipulating your life".
SCHEER reportedly added, "the spots closest at heart are where
you can best challenge the manipulators. I suggest you get
busy at task". He added, "even in the woods at Dartmouth,
where there aren't any girls, the elements for a confrontation
exist. I told a similar group at Columbia this, but they
wouldn't believe it. But look what happened" The article
stated that the audience applaused loudly at the conclusion
of SCHEER's plea.

VI. WRITINGS ABOUT SCHEER
Human Events publication, Washington, D.C., in its
issue of April 8, 1967, carried a story headlined, "The Inside
Story of 'Ramparts' Magazine". A portion of this story,
Scheer's Radicalism, reads as follows:
"Probably the best known nationally of Ramparts'
staffers is Managing Editor Robert Scheer, who, at
30, has made a career of New Leftism A former member
of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, he
is the most articulate of the Ramparts crew and con-
tends that he is an anti-Communist.
Last year Scheer ran for the Democratic nomi
nation for U. S. Congress in Berkeley, hinging his
entire campaign on getting out of the war in Viet
Nam and getting into the 'War on Poverty. Several
weeks ago, Scheer traveled to Prague, Czechoslovakia,
to meet with the Communist-controlled International
Union of Students and representatives of the National
Liberation Front, the political arm of the Communist
Viet Cong in South Viet Nam.
"Not publicized in his race for Congress but
revealed later was the fact that Scheer's campaign
coordinator was Carl Bloice, a 28-year-old Communist
party member. Bloice's CP membership was hardly a
secret, for several years he had been a by-lined staff
writer for People's World, the Communist weekly on
the West Coast, and then he was publications director
of the Communist-controlled W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

I. Burning of Draft Card
The cover of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
magazine contains a photograph of four right hands each
holding a burning Selective Service card. One of the cards
is a duplicate issued December 3, 1958 of the "Selective
Service Registration Certificate" for ROBERT SCHEER, 653
Britton Street, New York 67, Bronx.
The San Francisco "Examiner," daily newspaper
published in San Francisco, California, in its issue of
November 16, 1967, carried an article headlined "Ramparts
Editors Burn Draft Cards" which quoted "Publisher MARC
STONE" of "Ramparts" as saying the magazine cover is "a
very serious editorial statement," adding "there is a very
serious political crisis in this country and we want to
show that the bureaucracy of the Selective Service System
is unfair.
The San Francisco "Examiner" daily newspaper,
issue of June 13, 1968, carried a news article "3 Ramparts
Officers Before Jury in NY." This article stated that three
top officers of "Ramparts" magazine were called to appear
before a Federal Grand Jury in New York City, June 13, 1968
to testify at an inquiry described only as "having to do with
Selective Service." The article continued by stating that
there was speculation that the investigation dealt with the
cover photograph of the December 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
which pictured the flaming draft cards of 3 top officials.
(Should be four officials.)
The August 24, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" magazine
carried a column entitled, "Apologia," which carried a
reprint of a news article from the "New York Times" news
paper, issue of July 18, 1968. The article stated that
WARREN HINCKLE, III, ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD STERMER, and
SOL STEIN, all officials of "Ramparts" , appeared before a
Grand Jury in New York City on June 17, 1968, as a result
of the December 1967 cover of "Ramparts" containing a photo-
graph of four hands holding burning draft cards containing
the names of these four men.

"From Berkeley to D.C.
"At last summer's Communist party convention in
New York City, Bloice was elected to the CP's National
Committee and the requirements for serving on that
policy board make it clear Bloice has been a CP member
since at least January 1964, although intelligence
agencies place it many years earlier.
"Just two months ago the newsletter of the Robert
Scheer campaign - he is keeping his organization intact
under the name of Community for New Politics (CNP)
carried a social note: 'Carl Bloice, heretofore
coordinator for CNP, has left Berkeley for the larger
battlefield in Washington, D.C., where he will be a
correspondent for People's World -and The worker. At
a farewell party December 23 at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Scheer, Carl was presented with several
going-away gifts, including a larger than life poster
of Mao-Tse Tung....Carl has indicated he will be an
occasional correspondent [for the Scheer newsletter]
We all wish him the best of luck in Washington and
we feel fully comforted by the fact that we are not
losing a coordinator, but gaining a spy.'
"Tax Money Helped
"The portrait of Mao probably brought a gust
of laughter when it was unveiled and presented to the
Moscow-line Bloice, and the 'gaining a spy' phrase was
simply New Left humor. The story makes two important
points: 1) Scheer's campaign manager was a Communist,
and 2) The Capital correspondent for two Communist
newspapers will contribute occasional articles to
Scheer's campaign organization.
"Scheer has told Human Events that he hired Bloice
'for his technical competence'; that he likes him as
a person, but violently disagrees with his politics.

which channeled funds into Scheer's campaign. It
worked this way. During his campaign one of his
workers was Mrs. Phyllis Haberman O'Donnell, who has
been chairman of the East Bay DuBois Club. Mrs. O'Donnell
worked on a work-study program directed by the
University of California's Department of Criminology
(which is now practically another Sociology Department)
and was assigned to a leftist group called Welfare
Rights Organization as a case worker. In truth, she
worked for the Scheer campaign and reported on it
at WRO meetings.
"The work-study program was originally funded
through the Office of Economic Opportunity, receives
its funds through the National Defense Education Act
and is overseen by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare."
An article by IVAN SHARPE appeared in the San
Francisco Bay Guardian daily newspaper published at San Francisco,
California, in its issue of March 27, 1969, entitled "Ramparts
revolution with limousine service." This article reflects
numerous interviews with present and former officials of Ramparts
magazine and analyzes factors that led to this magazine's financial
difficulties. The article places primary blame for the bankruptcy
on WARREN HINCKLE and ROBERT SCHEER for their extragavant spending,
such as taking their wives on trips for Ramparts and spending huge
sums of money. Most of the blame was placed on WARREN HINCKLE
because frequently his expense account would be more than the
money he raised on promotional trips. The article gave most of
the credit for the sensational stories and exposes to ROBERT
SCHEER, who obtained them from his new left contacts. It reported
that HINCKLE had destroyed Ramparts and SCHEER was angry about
this. SCHEER decided to stay on as Editor-In-Chief of Ramparts
and his salary has been reduced from $15,000 to $10,000 per year
in an effort to help the magazine out of its financial problems

AD HOC COMMITTEE TO END DISCRIMINATION
11
morning
According to an article in the March 8, 1964, issue
of the "San Francisco Examiner, a San Francisco daily
newspaper, TRACY SIMS stated among other things that following
a sit-in demonstration in San Francisco during October 1963 by
various civil rights groups, the groups realized that a central,
coordinating committee was needed. The formation of AD HOC
COMMITTEE TO END DISCRIMINATION (AHCED) was the result and SIMS
became its chairman.
A source reported on December 9, 1963, that in
December 1963 TRACY SIMS attended a joint
meeting of the
San Francisco Communist Party
Youth Club and the Communist Party Berkeley
Off-Campus Youth Club.
A second source, on May 12, 1964, described AHCED as
a central body of representatives from militant youth organiza-
tions whose purpose was to work for equal civil rights and to
put pressure on establishments and employers to hire more people
from the minority races, especially Negroes.
A third source reported on March 13, 1964, that at
a meeting of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers
Party on March 11, 1964, KIPP DAWSON, a representative of
AHCED, related among other things that AHCED was directed and
controlled by the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area.
A fourth source reported on January 30, 1964, that
on January 29, 1964, KIPP DAWSON attended a San
Francisco Branch membership meeting of the
Socialist Workers Party.
Second source related on May 12, 1964, that the
W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of the Bay Area consisted
of the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of San Francisco,
Berkeley, and San Francisco State College. _ Accord-
ing to source, any member of the W. E.B. DuBois
Club of San Francisco who attends San Francisco
State College is automatically a member of the
club at San Francisco State College.
A fifth source reported on February 3, 1965, that on
February 3, 1965, a press conference was held at 1366 Turk
Street, San Francisco, California. At this press conference, an
official of AHCED announced and passed out press releases that

Black Panther Party for
Self Defense
A source advised that the Black Panther Party for
Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister
of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December, 1966,
as a militant black nationalist political organization to combat
police brutality, to unite militant black youth, and to
determine the destiny of black communities.

Communist China and black militant writers.
In March, 1968, the name of the organization was
changed to Black Panther Party (BFP).
The official BPP publication, The Black Panther
Party Black Community News Service," states that the BPP

Records of the Division of Corporations, California
State Department of Investments, Los Angeles, California,
indicate that Discussion Unlimited filed its Articles of
Incorporation as a nonprofit corporation, with the Secretary
of State, Sacramento, California, on or about June 4, 1963,
noting its principal site of office as Los Angeles County,
California. The aims and purposes of the organization, as
listed in the Articles of Incorporation, are H ...to promote

A source advised on May 8, 1963, that Discussion
Unlimited, Inc. actually was originated in Los Angeles,
California, in May, 1962, and was composed largely of a number
of present and former Communist Party members who assist in
staging panel forums and in promoting such events. Original
coordinator of the group was BERNARD LUSHER, who in 1961,
was educational director of the Southern California District
Communist Party.
This source was recontacted on April 9, 1965, and
indicated that the basic concept of Discussion Unlimited, Inc.
has not changed. It continues to present "left ideas" to at
least partially non-committed audiences. It proposes to
develop special activities around various issues on an irregular
basis. It is not a membership organization, and does not hold
regular meetings as such, but rather is strictly a forum-type
organization.
On May 10, 1966, another source reported that
Discussion Unlimited, Inc. continues to operate as a forum-
type organization.

J. Threat to Subject's Life
ROBERT SCHEER telephoned the San Francisco FBI
Office on July 8, 1968, to state the receptionist at
"Ramparts" magazine, San Francisco, received the following
telephone message from an anonymous male at 4:45 pm that
day:
"I just want to inform you that we
plan to destroy the Managing Editor,
BOB SCHEER, tomorrow night at 9:00.
11
SCHEER stated that the New York City Office of
"Ramparts" had received a threat about July 3, 1968 and
he felt that this call resulted from a recent article in
"Ramparts" regarding Cuban refugees. He said he had no
indication that the call was interstate.
"
:
The San Francisco "Examiner" newspaper, San
Francisco, California, in its issue of July 9, 1968,
carried a news article headlined, "Ramparts Threatened
By Bombs. The article stated that both the San Francisco:
and New York City offices of "Ramparts" had been threatened
by bombs and "Associate Editor ROBERT SCHEER had received
calls threatening his life."
SCHEER advised SA CHARLES E. GALVIN on July 10
1968, that no one had carried out the threat and that
he would immediately contact the FBI if any future threats
were made.
Records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation (CII), Sacramento, California, reveal
that a .25 calibre Beretta automatic pistol, serial number
415984, was sold to ROBERT SCHEER, 6468 Benvenue Avenue,
Oakland, California, on January 27, 1968, and that this gun
was purchased in Oakland.
Records of the Oakland Police Department were
searched October 17, 1968 by IC ROBERT L. GIBSON and it
was determined that ROBERT SCHEER did not possess a permit
to carry a gun.

This same source advised in October 1963,
that MATHEW HALLINAN was er 1963,

Representative of the Berkeley CP On-Campus
Youth Club during September 1963.

that organization to be the "W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America
Berkeley Branch.
"
This same leaflet, under the heading "The DuBois Clubs of
America" reads as follows: "The Berkeley DuBois Club is a part of
a nation-wide socialist youth organization founded in June of this
year. It attempts to bring together those action-oriented youth
who consider socialism to be a visible alternative to the ills of
this society."
As of April 23, 1965, the Berkeley W.E.B. DuBois Club

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)
A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the Dose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new
national Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt
for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates
to this meeting were cautioned against the germ of anti-Soviet
and anti-CP ideologies. These delegates were also told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the voung socialists
ettracted into this new organization would eventually pass into
the CP itself.
And
conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago
on December 28-29, 1963
1963, for the purpose of initiating a "call"
to the new youth organization and planning for a founding
convention to be held in June, 1964.
A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which
time the name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention. The aims of this organization, as set
forth in the preamble to the constitution, are, "It is our
belief that this nation can best solve its problems in an
atmosphere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament and true
freedom for all peoples of the world, and that these solutions
will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic
elements in our country, composed essentially of the working people
allied in the unity of Neorces and other minorities with whites.
We further fully recognize that the greatest threat to American
democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in
coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power
structure, using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy
the unified struggle of the working people. As young people in
the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to
defeat these reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve
complete freedom and democracy for all Americans, thus enabling
each individual to freely choose and build the society he would
wish to live in. Through these struggles we feel the American
people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative."

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)
The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
It is to be noted
the Castro network in the United States."
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.
The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD.
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that
the FPCC had been dissolved.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
- Fair Play.
The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.
"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,
Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

A source advised on April 20, 1965, that the PLP,
formerly known as the PLM, held its first national convention
April 15-18, 1965, at New York City, to organize the PLM into a

expelled from the Communist Party of the United States for
assertedly following the Chinese Communist line.'
The PLP publishes the "Marxist-Leninist Quarterly," a
theoretical magazine; "Progressive Labor," a monthly magazine;
"Challenge," a New York City newspaper; and "Spark," a west coast
newspaper.
The June 1, 1965, issue of "Challenge," page 6, states
that, "this paper is dedicated to fight for a new way of life
where the working men and women own and control their homes,
factories, the police, courts, and the entire government on every
level."
The source advised that the PLP utilizes the address of
General Post Office Box 808, Brooklyn 1, New York, but also
utilizes an office in Room 622, 132 Nassau Street, New York City,
where PLP publications are prepared.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
*
The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it
is known today, came into being at a founding convention held
at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. The SDS is an association
of young people on the left and has a current program of pro-
testing the draft, promoting a campaign for youth to develop
a conscientious objector status, denouncing United States in-
tervention in the war in Vietnam and to "radically transform'
the university community, and provide for its complete control
by students. GUS HALL, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,
when interviewed by a representative of United Press International
in San Francisco, California, on May 14, 1965, described the
SDS as a part of the "responsible left" which the Party has
"going for us." At the June, 1965 SDS National Convention, an
anti-communist proviso was removed from the SDS constitution.
In the October 7, 1966 issue of "New Left Notes," the official
publication of SDS, an SDS spokesman stated that there are some
communists in SDS and they are welcome. The National Head-
quarters of this organization as of April 18,1967, was located
in Room 206, 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)
A source advised in May, 1965, that the VDC was founded in
May, 1965, to organize the May 21-22, 1965, community "teach-in" on
the University of California, Berkeley, California (UCB) campus.
Public literature distributed by the VDC reveals that the
purpose of the VDC is to mold public opinion to force withdrawal of
the United States from Vietnam, and to utilize dramatic, large-scale
demonstrations in increasing public alarm about the Vietnam war.
A second source advised on June 24, 1966, that at a meeting
of the San Francisco Branch of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in
San Francisco, California, on June 22, 1966, KIPP DAWSON, whom source
identified as a member of the Branch, commented, among other things,
that with our help" the VDC was finally recognized as a political
power and was under "our control.".
The SWP has been designated by the
Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.
During the period from August 18, 1966 to October 7, 1966, the
VDC was publicly announced as having been expelled from the UCB as
a recognized on-campus organization.
A third source advised on September 29, 1966, that PETE CAMEJO
was the chief spokesman for the VDC in its attempts for reinstate-
ment as a recognized UCB on-campus organization. Following the re-
instatement of the VDC in October, 1966, CAMEJO decided to disband
the Campus Chapter of the United Committee Against
mar (UCAW), which
he had organized to replace the VDC on the UCB campus when it was
expelled. The UCAW Chapter was disbanded and the VDC subsequently
became an "affiliate" of UCAW.
The third source further advised that as of September 29, 1966,
the VDC was controlled and dominated by PETE CAMEJO. Source added
that the VDC is no longer under the control of the old stalwarts of
the original VDC and there is no continuity between the original and
current VDC.
A fourth source on October 27, 1966, identified
PETE CAMEJO as a current member of the SWP.
The fourth and a fifth source in September and
October, 1966, identified UCAW as an organization
in the San Francisco and East Bay areas whose
activities were directed toward protesting United
States foreign policy in Vietnam, and is controlled
and dominated by the SWP and the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA. 1373,.

Young Socialist Alliance (BAYSA) was formed in February 1958,
as the Bay Area Committee for the Young Socialist (BACYS). At
a later state in its development prior to adoption of the name

the Young Socialist Alliance (PACYSA).
The source advised that as a result of a national
convention held April 15-17, 1960, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
the BAYSA became a branch of the national organization to be
known as the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and will carry out
in the Northern California area the policies of the YSA.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE
The May, 1960 issue of the "Young Socialist (YS),
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance"
(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue
stated that this organization was formed by the nation-wide
supporter clubs of the publication YS.
The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declara-
tion of YSA. This declaration stated that the YSA recognizes the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political
leadership on class struggle principles, and that the supporters
of the YS have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP
on the principles of revolutionary socialism.
A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original YSA
was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York City
by youth of various left socialist tendencies, particularly members
and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were the
guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.
The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that the YSA
is dominated and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through
having SWP members comprise exclusively the National Executive
Committee (NEC). The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training
section of the SWP and the main source of new SWP members.
The headquarters of the YSA are located in Room 535,
41 Union Square West, New York City.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to

WOMEN FOR PEACE, aka
Women Strike for Peace
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,

evening edition reflecting that in November, 1961,
when concern mounted over radioactive fallout
from nuclear testing, a group of women in
Washington, D. C. started Women Strike for Peace.
The idea spread rapidly throughout the country
and now embraces 900 groups, including Women For
Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.
These groups support programs to achieve goals
such as:
(1)
(2)
(3)
Continued disarmament negotiations.
A strong and flexible United Nations.
Planning now at state and national levels
for conversion to peace-time economy and
positive efforts to ease world tensions
The women act as individuals and as
a group, with
specific actions suggested by individuals and
groups from all over the world. Decision to
participate jointly on any given suggestion is
democratly arrived at by members of the
Coordinating Committee. Effective cooperation
with other peace groups is encouraged. Monthly
Coordinating Committee meetings and general
meetings, as warranted, are open to all and
announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for
membership.
:
To stir an awareness of the need for peace,
Women For Peace encourage public education in
peace obiectives at local schools and sponsor
peace-oriented demonstrations and public meetings
newspaper ads, billboards, and candidates for
public office. On the national level the group
attempts to influence government officials by
letters and conferences.

L. Passport Information
Files of the Passport Office, US Department of
State, Washington, D. C., were reviewed by SA DOUGLAS M.
BROWN on January 26, 1968 and reflected the following.
On January 28, 1966, Passport number G 41559 was
issued at the San Francisco Passport Agency to ROBERT SCHEER,
based on his application, January 27, 1966. SCHEER stated
he was born April 4, 1936 at Bronx, New York, was a writer
by occupation, residing at 2828 Milvia Street, Berkeley,
California.
His last passport, number D 163804, was issued
February 5, 1963. It was cancelled and returned to SCHEER
when the above application was submitted. His parents
were identified as FRED SCHEER, born in Germany, May 5,
1898, and IDA KURAN, born in Russia, April 24, 1900. His
father was a United States citizen, but his mother was not
a citizen. He was last married in 1965 to ANNE BUTTERFIELD
WEILLS, born Eureka, California, March 14, 1942.
She was
designated as the person to be notified in an emergency at
the above address. SCHEER stated in the application that he
planned to depart San Francisco via Japan Airlines for a trip
of one month to Japan, Cambodia and Hong Kong for journalistic
purposes.
On November 29, 1967, SCHEER wrote a letter on
the letterhead of "Ramparts" magazine and signed the letter
as Managing Editor of that publication, which he sent to the
Visa Department, US Department of State, Washington, D. C.,
stating he had been invited to attend a cultural conference
in Havana, Cuba, in January 1968, by the Cuban Commission to

the United Nations.
He stated he found it necessary in his
position to accept this invitation and requested a visa for
this purpose.
The Department of State advised SCHEER by letter
dated December 18, 1967 that provided he would execute the
enclosed affidavit stating that he desired to attend the
conference as a professional reporter and would not par-
ticipate in the conference in any manner, his application
would appear to qualify under existing regulations.
On December 20, 1967, SCHEER returned the affidavit
which was executed on that date before a notary public in
San Francisco. On December 27, 1967, the San Francisco
Passport Office was authorized by the State Department to
validate SCHEER's passport for one round trip to Cuba.
The State Department files reflect that the passport was
so validated at San Francisco on December 29, 1967.
Miss MADELINE EBINGER, Clerk, Passport Office,
US Department of State, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco,
advised March 20, 1968 that her office received authoriza-
tion from the State Department, Washington, D. C. on March
19, 1968 to validate the passport of ROBERT SCHEER, DUGALD
STERMER and FREDERICK C. MITCHELL, all of "Ramparts" magazine
for one round trip to Cuba, each for journalistic purposes.
STERMER is art director of "Ramparts" magazine and MITCHELL
a senior editor of "Ramparts". Miss EBINGER expected SCHEER
to appear in the immediate future for this validation since
she stated he has been telephoning the passport office
daily for the past week to determine if the validation of his
passport had been authorized.
On April 16, 1968, ROBERT SCHEER was observed by
a Special Agent of the FBI to visit the Passport Office of
the State Department in San Francisco, where he had his
passport validated for one round trip to Cuba. This was
confirmed by MADELINE EBINGER the same day.

the San Francisco Passport Agency instructing, "You are
authorzied to validate passport G 041559, issued to ROBERT
SCHEER of 'Ramparts; valid for one round trip to Cuba.
Miss MADELINE EBINGER advised on September 18, 1968
that records of that office reflect that the passport of
ROBERT SCHEER was validated for one round trip to Cuba on
August 22, 1968. She said she recalled that an unknown man
appeared at the Passport Office a few minutes before
closing time on August 22, 1968 and insisted that the
passport be validated that evening since ROBERT SCHEER intended
to depart that evening.

cites how DANIEL SIMON, M. D. had sent hundreds of letters
to Berkeley, California during the wekk of June 22, 1965,
pointing out that Congressman JEFFREY COHELAN had failed
to take a stand in opposition to United States participation
in the war in Vietnam, and enclosed cards addressed to
Congressman COHELAN appealing to COHELAN to speak out
strongly in Congress for a cease fire and international
negotiations through the United Nations. The cards also:
stated that unless COHELAN took such action, he would be
opposed for re-election. By August 1965, there had been
750 cards processed and returned to Dr. SIMON. When
Congressman COHELAN failed to speak out in Congress opposing
US involvement in Vietnam, certain people began searching
for a candidate to oppose him. ROBERT SCHEER agreed to
oppose COHELAN. Some of his, supporters left the organization
because SCHEER refused to shave off his beard and others
left the organization because SCHEER refused to exclude Communists from
his campaign committee. The article stated ROBERT SCHEER
had the endorsement of the VDC as well as a sizeable portion
of the community, and was not centered among the college

Community for New Politics
also known as
Committee for New Politics
"Communique for New Politics, Left-Out News",
published bi-weekly by the Community for New Politics,
2214 Grove Street, Berkeley, California, 94703, in volume
number one, carried an ar icle captioned, "To All Who
Supported Scheer for Congress". This article stated:
Our campaign was founded on assump
tions which are at odds with mainstream:
American politics. We are concerned with
issues and not personalities.
"We were committed to development of
community dialogue and involvement and not
merely to electoral victory. The fact
that we obtained an unexpectedly large vote
does not change this commitment but rather
reinforces it. 'The Community for New
Politics' was formed to carry out this
commitment. We are, in fact, in a very
favorable position to implement a 'new
politics'. The campaign produced strong
community ties and the beginnings of a
serious program. If we succeed in new
politics it will serve as a much needed model
for American political life. If we fail
to seriously attempt it we betray not
only the larger community but our most
significant hopes as well.
"This will be a more difficult period
than that which preceded the election--it
requires all of our support.
"

F. Interviews of Subject
Another Government agency that conducts security

August 10, 1961 and August 16, 1961, the last interview
being under oath. During the interviews, SCHEER stated
that while in college he attended a few meetings which he
felt were run by someone who could have been in the Labor
Youth League (LYL) and had attended one social event
which he felt was definitely sponsored by LYL, but explained
that he had gone to this affair to meet a girl. He said he
never attended a political meetings of LYL and added that
he has never been a member of the CP or any organization
cited by the Attorney General. SCHEER admitted having
read the "Communist Manifesto" frequently and studied it

the CP, USA to be a threat to the United States and had no
reason to believe that a person who joins the CP swears.
allegiance to a foreign power or advocates the overthrow of
the United States Government. He said he believes that the
CP is not subversive because it claims to be interested in
bringing about its program through democratic process.
SCHEER refused to discuss his trip to Cuba in 1960 and
refused to discuss his membership, activities or associations
with the Student Fair Play for Cuba Committee (SFPCC) under
protection of the First and Fifth Amendments.

Ramparts magazine who last year ran a
strong, though losing, primary race in
California's Berkeley district as a peace

eloquently pleaded with the whites to

lined "Scheer supports Newton. This article stated "Bob
Schoef endorsed Huey Newton for Congress last week. It
quoted Scheer as saying, "I ran against Cohelan in 1966
because the assumptions that he shared with the democratic
establishment and the powerful interests behind it led him
to support the war in Vietnam and to ignore the increasingly
desperate crisis in our cities, including the miserable conditions
right here in Oakland."
The article pointed out that HUEY P. NEWTON was
running against JEFFREY COHELAN as the PFP candidate in the
California 7th Congressional District, COHELAN being the Democratic

The "San Francisco Examiner," a daily newspaper
published at San Francisco, California, in its issue of
October 3, 1967, carried a news article headlined "New
Peace Party's Aim - Beat LBJ. The article explained that
"the newly formed Peace and Freedom Party is out to beat
President Johnson in 1968 even at the expense of electing
his Republican opponent.

The article continued by saying that the new
Peace and Freedom Party was recently formed in an effort
to promote peace candidates and had initiated a drive for
the 67,000 signatures needed to put a Peace and Freedom
Party candidate on the ballot. ROBERT SCHEER was listed as
one of the founders of the Peace and Freedom Party.

The "Berkeley Barb," a weekly newspaper of the
left, published at Berkeley, California, in its issue of
March 15-21, 1968, carried an article headlined, "Differs
but Will Fight for Party. This article explained that
ROBERT SCHEER's decision to withdraw as a Peace and Freedom
Party (PFP) candidate for nomination as U.S. Senator, was
based primarily on differences with the PFP leadership
over how to conduct the campaign. SCHEER was quoted as
saying, "I think it is possible to conduct a radical campaign
and at the same time reach out to bring people in. I don't
agree that there is a conflict between educating people and
running a principled campaign. There are purists in PFP who
will be talking only to small meetings of convinced people.
Some of the purists seem to want a small, left wing,
vegetarian-type party. SCHEER also objected to being asked
for loyalty to the PFP program before it had been adopted.
SCHEER said he expects to campaign very actively for PFP, but
stated his position with "Ramparts" Magazine also creates demands
on his time.
The article added that SCHEER said he wanted to
work hard for PFP without being accused of doing it for
personal advantage. SCHEER also said he wanted to be free
of the petty in-fighting that goes on too much in the Berkeley PFP

America must pull out of Vietnam because it is
essentially wrong. The dominant political institutions are
responsible for the U. S. involvement in Vietnam. We must
reject the emotion of racial evil by studying the war in
Vietnam. America is fundamentally racist and must come to
grips with itself about racism. Relations are unwholesome between
white radicals and black panthers. The Panthers are becoming
better organized and can reach more people than white people
can reach. The Panthers wrote a book to obtain money with
which to purchase guns.
At the same meeting, GEORGE MURRAY, Minister of

FOREIGN TRAVEL
Trip to Indonesia, February, 1965
An American by the name of SHEA (phonetic),
who claims that he is an ex-professor of a California
University, visited Japan about February 11, 1965. He
went to visit the office of the National Harbor and Ports
Labor Union in Tokyo. The Japan labor union put up SHEA
in one of their dormitories and had him live there until
three days ago, when he left Japan and went to Indonesia
on a ten-day trip. Before he left Japan for Indonesia,
he claimed that he strongly desired to go to Communist
China. He was complaining to the Japanese labor union
officials about the discrimination problem in the U. S.
and made derogatory remarks about the U.S. The Japanese
labor union official, after listening to his desire to go
to Communist China, asked the Chinese Communists now staying
in Tokyo about the possibility of SHEA's trip to the Chinese
mainland. The Chinese did not give a decisive answer. Although
SHEA is expected to return to Japan after his trip from Indo-
nesia, he may go to China directly from Indonesia. It is
said that SHEA had to quit his university job due to an
article he wrote after he came back from a trip to Cuba.
The article contained some derogatory remarks about the
U.S. Government. ($)

magazine had visited Prague and held "a long, secret session"
with officers of the Communist controlled International Union

The article continued by stating that "Ramparts"
is the magazine that exposed the fact that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been financing the National
Student Association (NSA), which in turn had worked for
several years to prevent IUS from dominating the youth of the
world. The article questioned what relationship there was
between "Ramparts" and the IUS.
ROWAN telephoned ROBERT SCHEER, Managing Editor of
Ramparts" in San Francisco and SCHEER admitted that he had
met with representatives of the National Liberation Front,
political arm of the Communist Viet Cong, in South Vietnam
and also with IUS officers in Prague "several weeks ago"
for two days. In response to a question as to who controlled
IUS, SCHEER replied, "It is essentially an organ of the
foreign policy of the Soviet Union." SCHEER emphasized
that he had visited IUS headquarters strictly for journalistic
reasons and that he was in Europe writing a story for "Ramparts"
on Bertrand Russell, (94 year old British philosopher who
plans a Vietnam 'war crimes trial' of President Johnson) 80
he continued on to Prague to check the international implications
of the "Ramparts" article on the NSA. SCHEER volunteered, "We
don't truck with Communism in Ramparts. We compare the U.S.
position in Vietnam with the actions of the Soviet Union in
Hungary. Both are intolerable and we make no bones about it.
Any attempt to smear us at Ramparts is libelous and we'll sue.

This editorial described SCHEER as Managing Editor of

The editorial stated SCHEER had recently returned
from a trip to Cairo and Israel and then spoke at a meeting
in Berkeley, California, August 25, 1967, when he told his
audience about his trip. In his speech, SCHEER claimed he had
been accused of being an anti-Semite and an anti-Arab because
of what he said on the matter of Arab-Israel relations. The
editorial said that SCHEER referred constantly to the people
of Israel and the American Jews as the "Zionists" and uses
this term constantly when criticizing action of the Israelis.

The editorial continued by stating that SCHEER
accused the Zionists of being imperialistic, of being excess-
ively hard on the poor Arabs they defeated, of provoking the
war in short, of doing everything the Arabs and the Soviets
accused them of and SCHEER attributed these lies to Israel's
subservience to the United States.". In his speech, SCHEER
was further accused of using the term, "American Grand Concourse
Zionists," the "Anti-Semites favorite euphemism for Jew.

The November 1967 issue of "Ramparts" magazine
contains a 13-page article entitled, "A NASSER
Thesis" by ROBERT SCHEEP. In this article, SCHEER
analyzes the Middle East situation from 1952 to the
present, giving his recital of the relationship of the
various countries to each other, the rise to power by
GAMAL ABDUL NASSER, the Suez war in the middle 1950's,
and the six-day Arab-Israel war in June, 1967.
The article lays great stress on NASSER being
unsuccessful in some of his ventures because while he
nationalized many businesses and industries and distributed
the proceeds to the poor, he allowed the Army to remain
an elite, privileged class which was not loyal to either
NASSER or Egypt. SCHEER also blamed NASSER's failure
to develop a political party with its own aims set forth
for his lack of success in communicating with his people
and obtaining their full support.

IV. WRITINGS OF SUBJECT
ROBERT SCHEER is the author of a pamphlet written

about Vietnam. The persons whom SCHEER holds responsible
for misleading the American people are JOSEPH KENNEDY, Cardinal
SPELLMAN, ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, JR., NORMAN THOMAS, J. BRACKEN
LEE, General EDWARD LANSDALE, MARVIN LIEBMAN, and others.

A feature article datelined Cairo, July 31,
1967, entitled, "Egypt" which is described as "A Special
Report from Managing Editor ROBERT SCHEER in Cairo",
published in the September 1967 issue of "Ramparts"
magazine. In this article, SCHEER tried to explain the
current situation in Egypt. He laid the blame for the Arabs
losing the six-day war to the Israelis on "cowardly
or traitorous officers" in the Arab Army.
The article also stated that many in the NASSER
Goverment say that most of the blame for starting the
Arab-Israel war should be charged to the Syrians for
having provided the Israelis with a pretext for attack.
The article stated the Egyptian people were not at this
time in a warlike mood and NASSER was doing his best
to discourage his people from warlike aspirations and
to encourage continuance of the Social Revolution in
Egypt.
SCHEER concluded that NASSER must break with
the rightists in the Arab world and make his primary
commitment to the Arab social revolution in order to
survive. He concluded also that NASSER's most dangerous
enemy is the "Moslem Brotherhood" who could take control
of Egypt and become embroiled in another war in as little
as one year's time.

The January, 1968 issue of "Ramparts" Magazine contains
an article entitled Oil and the Arabs (The Nasser Thesis: Part 2)"
This article states "Researchers for this article and Part I
("Ramparts", November, 1967) include BOB AVAKIAN, JIM HAWLEY,
DAVID KOLODNEY and JOHN SPITZER.
The article states the thesis that the Middle East
is of paramount strategic importance to this Country" because

In addition the Mideast is the

trade crossroads between Asia and Europe and an important cultural
bridge between Africa and Asia and the center of the Islam world.
:
:
The article explains that 27% of the oil used through-
out the world comes from the Middle East and, since oil is in-
dispensable to industrial and military potential it is no wonder
that continued control of this resource is a major focus of the
Western powers.
It adds that if control of this oil is important
to the West it is absolutely critical to the Arabs, since it is
the only source of the cash needed to break out of the cycle of
underdevelopment and poverty in which their countries are trapped.
It pointed out that the profits from the oil go to the "wrong"
states, those with the least population (12% of the Arab population)
and therefore the least need. The article stated the Arabs could
repay the total investment of Western powers of $5 billion in
two years with the oil removed from Arab wells except for the
fact that Western Countries are in a position to force the Arabs
to deal with them or to have no market whatever for this off.
The article cited how Iranian Prime Minister MOSSADEGH nationaliz-
ed his country's oil production May 1, 1951 and the U. S. pro-
ceeded to crush him so totally that the example has served as
model for other would-be nationalists no major oil
chilling
producing country in the Mideast has dared to repeat MOSSADEGH's
attempt. The Western Powers were said to have accomplished
this by imposing a total boycott of Iranian oil.

The article explained that the Baghdad Pact was an in-
tegral part of a global containment policy which was put into
effect by the U.S. in the early 1950s but NASSER refused to a-
lign himself with it. NASSER was caid to be a threat to the
Western powers by being consciously and arrogantly expansionist,

The April - May, 1968, issue of "Ramparts Magazine,
lists ROBERT SCHEER as Editor in Chief and carried a two page
article entitled "The 'Peace' Candidates by ROBERT SCHEER.
In this article, SCHEER discussed the Vietnam War and Democratic
presidential candidates ROBERT F. KENNEDY (now deceased) and
EUGENE MCCARTHY. SCHEER was critical of each of these candidates
because they were not among the original protestors against
U.S. participation in the Vietnam War.
The June 15, 1968, issue of "Ramparts Magazine stated
that this issue marked the beginning of "Ramparts as a fortnightly
magazine which will appear in the same format as it has previously
appeared. It stated that features planned for the first few
editions include (in part) several articles on the problems of
today's Cuba including an interview with FIDEL CASTRO by ROBERT
SCHEER."
The August 10, 1968, issue of "Ramparts"
carried a two-page article entitled, "The Night BOBBY
Died," by ROBERT SCHEER. In this article, SCHEER stated
he was present at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles
California with ROBERT F. KENNEDY on the evening of
Primary Election Day, June 4, 1968, in the Royal
Suite, while the KENNEDY campaign workers were waiting
for the returns to come in. He wrote that he was also
in the Empire Ballroom while ROBERT KENNEDY was giving
his victory speech and while KENNEDY was shot about
12:29 A.M.
The September 28, 1968, issue of "Ramparts"
carried a feature-length article dealing with the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which was
described as "a Ramparts special report" by staff members
and it named 23 persons including ROBERT SCHEER as
responsible for this report.

and by holding the position that oil in the underpopulated oil
producing countries must be the basis of the development of the
entire region. It stated that the U.S. response to NASSER was
principally by propping up the economy and military machines of
the monarchies while alternately mollifying through grants or the
withholding of grants to the more leftist tendencies as they appear-
ed in Egypt and other Arab regimes. The article added Intensive
CIA operations even involved founding the American Friends of the
Middle East a pro-Arab Organization in the U.S. as well as
widespread meddling in internal Arab politics."

1
The article continued that Soviet support of the Arabs
began in 1955, which caused the U. S. to be more careful not to
cause an anti-Western Arab union to be formed that might topple
America's right-wing Arab allies. NASSER was said to have steered
clear of any major direct confrontation with the U.S. and "the U.S.
has never attempted to really clamp down on him. Thus the Arab
revolutionary impulse, fearful of challenging the West, turned to
"challenging Israel as a Western tool" and condemned Israeli im-
perialism." This hostility to Israel provided a kind of anti-
imperialism that was able to appeal to both progressive leftists
and traditional monarchies in the Arab world. In 1956 Israel
joined the British and French attempt to reestablish by force
Western control over the Suez Canal after NASSER nationalized it,
and Israel also supported the French in the Algerian war. To the
Arabs it seemed that Israel had aligned herself with the exploiters.
This signalled the Russians to begin helping the Arabs to get as
many friends as possible among the non-aligned countries even while
local communists in Egypt, Algeria and Syria were being jailed. Russia
felt that the Arabs were moving to the left to justify Russian
support.
The article said the social changesin Algeria and Egypt
were significant but also inadequate because "they destroyed the
power of the traditional upper class without in any significant sense
passing power on to that very broad base of the Arab pyramid. The
reforms in Syria and Egypt came about as a result of military coups
d'etat which placed men in power who were willing to introduce re-
forms.
The article continued by stating "The identification of
Israel-rather than the oil companies and their monarchies-as the
serious extension of imperialism has allowed Arab progressives to
play at revolution, through periodic anti-Israel tirades, without

taking essential revolutionary action." In reference to the
six day Arab-Israel war the article stated "the Soviets were clearly
unprepared to assess its implications," in reference to with-
drawal of UN troops from Gaza and Aqoba. It added "The Soviets
continuously underestimated the emotional depth and political
intensity of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It added that Russia
began immediately to rearm Eghpt and Syria after the defeat,
specifying only that their weapons be better used.
The article stated "The Central Thesis of this essay
is that the Great Powers cannot be expected to be concerned, on any
consistent basis, with the interests and needs of the Arabs and
Jews who live in the Mideast, but are preoccupied with their
own prestige and security needs. It added that both the Arabs and
the Jews identify their opposition with the nation of imperialism
supported by the American oil companies.
The article added that "The Arab denial of legitimate
Jewish nationhood as the basis of Israel is the subject of deserved
ridicule. But that the mainstream of Zionism has, in like fashion,
denied the existence of a legitimate Arab quest for nationhood is
not commonly admitted. This factor has been of great significance
in the formation and sustaining of Arab hostility towards Israel.
The Arabs will never be able to turn their energies from opposing
Israel to the development of an Arab nation so long as the Israelis
hold the existence of an Arab nation to be a threat. The Israelis
viewed the drive toward Arab unity and independence as a threat
to them. ABBA EBAN conferred upon Israel the very nationhood that
Israel denied to the Arabs. The Arabs find this position most
difficult to accept when the Jews deny them the same position.
The article stated that "Israelis must come to accept the fact that
nationhood is an aspiration which some Arabs hold without being.
conned into it by NASSER; and that an Arab State if it became a
reality (as a confederation or a nation) is not necessarily a
threat to Israel."
-
The article concluded that "The Arab Nation and the
Jewish Nation are both legitimate concepts which can survive to-
gether only if they exist as part of the same social revolution
to meet the needs of the people of the Mideast."

of an international communist conspiracy was false and the
U. S. is mistaken in considering it a unified, ever-growing

the communist conspiracy is a movement that does not hold
together because of nationalistic interests. He cited
the Sino-Soviet dispute and the international squabbling
between satellite countries and the major communist powers.

and if the U. S. withdrew from the conflict this withdrawal
would reaffirm the communists' confidence in the possibility

"'Anti-Communism is what holds the American people
together, not the Judaeo-Christian ethic, radical
author Robert Scheer told 500 people in the Social
Science building Thursday.
"He argued that the United States is attempting
to impose on the Southeast Asian crisis the 'myth'
of a monolithic Communism and the policy of 'contain-
ment' that developed out of the post-World War II
Eastern European situation 20 years ago.

"He said that America has become
has become 'so imbued
with the anti-Communist mythology that it has become
the over-riding criteria for all, and especially
foreign policy decision-making.
"He cited the investigations of philosopher
Bertrand Russell's Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal'
which purports to show American use of 'fragmentation
bombs that are not effective militarily, but which
demoralize the population. 'And these bombs are
designed not so much to kill as to torture.
"'What is frighteningly horrible about this whole
policy,' he said,
he said, 'is that it works. It succeeds
militarily even where it fails politically.
"He urged his listeners to 'support the Vietcong,
or National Liberation Front...given the fact that
they are the only ones standing up to the American
intrusion' over there.'
"He said that it is not the North Vietnamese
who have shown 'bad faith in efforts to negotiate,
'but us.' They have already offered concessions,
he said, even though it is we who are bombing them.
"Russian and Chinese foreign policies, before
and after the death of Stalin, he said, 'have been
essentially conservative, and not aggressive.'
He
cited as evidence the Trotsky-Stalin conflict and
Mao Tse-tung's early differences with the regular
Chinese Communist Party apparatus over this issue."

a meeting December 2, 1966, in the auditorium of Los Angeles
Trade College, 700 block, Washington Boulevard, Los Angeles,
with from 1,000 to 1,500 people in attendance. The topic of
the discussion was "What Will the New Development on the Left
Be?" ROBERT SCHEER from "Ramparts" magazine, EUGENE GENOVESE
from Rutgers College in New Jersey, and DOROTHY HEALEY from
Southern California District CP were the speakers. HEALEY
spoke first, stating that the most important things for the
groups on the left to do today were to unite on common grounds
and to be critical on grounds where they cannot agree, as well
as to give allegiance to the other 14 socialist countries in
the world. She described these countries as the hope of the
future. ROBERT SCHEER attacked her bitterly, his main contention
being that he felt he could not even say he was a socialist
because of all the crimes that are committed in the name of
socialism. He said he could not align himself with other
countries in the socialist world because of the barbaric
deeds committed by some of these countries.
-
He led a vicious attack against the Soviet Union,
against the STALIN era, against the crimes that were committed
in the Soviet Union against Jewish people and Jewish culture,
and against other religious people and intellectuals in the
Soviet Union. He made reference to the two writers who had
been recently jailed in Russia. In a rebuttal and question
and answer period the attack went back and forth, mainly
between GENOVESE and HEALEY against SCHEER for his anti-Soviet
Union position. SCHEER constantly brought up Hungary, stating
that the oppression that went on in Hungary is no different
than the oppression of the United States in Vietnam. He also
said the Soviet Union is a sick society just as the U. S. is
a sick society, and he is quite sure that the workers in each
society are not much aware of or care about the relative
difference of the sickness.

as follows:
"Scheer, who ran as a peace candidate in the
Democratic primary in the Seventh Congressional District,
winning nearly 45% of the vote, spoke of the kind of
revolution he would like to see. 'Revolution is better
than rebellion,' he said, 'but I am interested in
what a revolution will lead to....Soviet society is
vicious...I want a revolution that means the right
of a man to control his own life.
Referring to Marxism, Scheer said, 'The theories
don't work. The working class is not getting poorer
and poorer.
"It is true, he said, 'that the 'New Left
has no ideology, (but because of that) it does not
follow that it should accept the old ones...
there a New Left?
Why is

A meeting was held at Hospitality House, Balboa
Park, California, March 16, 1967, to hear ROBERT SCHEER talk
on the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). He was introduced
as editor of "Ramparts" magazine. His only comments concerning
the CIA were that the CIA was the
"whipping boy" for high
officials of the U. S. Government. He indicated that if anything
went wrong with the policy of the high government officials,
they could always blame CIA for their failures.
In discussing the Vietnam war, SCHEER stated the
President of the U. S., along with other government officials,
were guilty of murder of innocent women and children. SCHEER
then spoke of a trip he had taken to France and Belgium. He
said he had talked to important officials in these countries
and gained the impression that these officials were opposed to
the war policy of President JOHNSON, particularly the bombing
of North Vietnam. SCHEER alleged that there were more bombs
dropped in Vietnam than were dropped during World War II. He
claimed that the reason the U. S. was using anti-personnel bombs
against the people of North Vietnam was because they did not
agree with the U. S. and the use of anti-personnel bomb was of
a punitive nature.
SCHEER took the position of an independent criticizing
both the "Commie" and "Bircher" elements.

fighting on the side with angels with a monopoly on democracy,
peace and freedom.

is now nationalism, not world expansion and that the Communists
are now more concerned with internal problems than presenting
a united front to defeat democracy.' The article added "Mr.
Scheer and Mr. Oglesby charged that the U.S. is supporting the
wrong side in Vietnam because of its economic interest. The
real issue in Vietnam and other troubled areas of the world is
poverty, according to Scheer and Oglesby.

The "Seattle Post Intelligencer" newspaper, Seattle,
Washington, in its issue of November 22, 1967, reported that
ROBERT SCHEER spoke to an overflow audience at the University
of Washington, Hub Auditorium, November 21, 1967. The article
stated that SCHEER said it was arrogant for Americans to
decide what is best for the Vietnam people. SCHEER said
it was an "obscene argument that withdrawal of American
forces from Vietnam would result in a blood bath. He
claimed the United States was operating on a war economy
and suggested that our loss of pre-eminence in world
trade as well as in jobs which rely on military contracts
accounts for much of our reluctance to pull out of Asia.
SCHEER predicted that 1968 may be the "last democratic
election" for this nation. He predicted that the far
left and the far right would grow as Americans seek
alternatives. SCHEER advocated taking the billions spent
on the Vietnam war and applying them to domestic problems.
He alleged that unless this is done, there would be more
violence and more riots in American cities.

In speaking about the means of demonstration, SCHEER was
quoted as saying "Use your bodies imaginatively. Block
railway tracks and government buildings. Violence is the
only serious alternative. With regard to opposition to
the war, SCHEER blamed the rowdy character of recent
demonstrations which have been blocked by the economic
and political power structure. He said "I support these
tactics out of desperation, though I would like to see
the growth of a serious left to challenge the people in
power.

The article said SCHEER stated "We invoke the
devil theory of communism to explain the reality of
desperate social revolution." SCHEER concluded "Vietnam
is only the extension of this unhealthy American character-
istic, not an isolated example of mistaken policy. It is
an integral part of a policy of corrupt self-seeking
deception."
After explaining that ROBERT SCHEER visited
South Vietnam twice, the article quoted SCHEER as saying
"I think we have to realize that the Vietnamese are indeed
fighting for their freedom but their freedom from us.
They are nationalists trying to create a national revolution,
and they can't be explained away with a label."
SCHEER alleged that the United States was in
the Vietnam war to make a profit. He called for staged
withdrawal of U.S. troops over a period of years.
In reference to the domestic scene, SCHEEF warned
that sterner measures against dissent were coming and that
President JOHNSON's talk about peace was a "con job.
SCHEER said people were rioting in America because "they
have no legitimate avenue of dissent. In summary, SCHEER
urged concerned youth not to become complacent but to
remain aware of the problems and refuse to conspire with
liberal politicians who try to make dissent irrelevant
SCHEER told the group, "Block the halls and block the
airports. This may be one of the times when to behave
reasonably is to behave irresponsibly."
