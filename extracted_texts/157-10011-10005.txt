OCCURRENCE:
WAINWRIGHT met with TEPEDINO, who reported to him AMLASH's reaction to his meeting with
FITZGERALD. TEPEDINO said that AMLASH dwelt constantly on the fact that "he could not
understand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised a final
solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment
and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets.
According to TEPEDENO, (AMLASH) feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get
advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he will probably become_fed_up__
again, and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date! (91)
