official whose desire to defect was made known by MM 761-S
in June, 1962. Thereafter, CIA apparently made contact
with CUBELA in Europe through [CARLOS TEPEDINO, 9819 64th

effective action in Cuba. According to [TEPEDINO] CUBELA
desires some sort of compact equipment with which he can
possibly eliminate CASTRO%; however, CIA keeps offering
him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.
(
(u)
According to TEPEDINO,] there is now under discussion: CHECHECKCH)
some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure.
CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,
inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no
part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been
brought up again for consideration. President JOHNSON
allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.
If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime
before the elections in November.
TEPEDINO) told the informant he has not been able ✗
to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that
CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be
accomplished by men in Cuba, and possibly someone from
Europe.
1u)
The informant advised [TEPEDINO did not specificall (u).
indicate how he had acquired this information%; however, the
informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had
obtained it from CUBELA.
The above is for the information of the Bureau,
and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination
since both TEPEDINOKKK and CUBELA are apparently of operational
interest to CIA. Dissemination would also lead to the
disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely,
MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
