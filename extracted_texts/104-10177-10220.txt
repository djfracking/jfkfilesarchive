SUBJECT: John K. McLean
3 May 1972
1. On 28 April the undersigned was introduced to Mr. John

Europe where the money has been put into, Swiss and French francs,
plus German marks, Most of the money is apparently in savings

Mr. McLendon wondered if these foreign operations might not be
of interest to the Government (read CIA as Mr. McLendon was

employment with the Agency.) Mr. McLendon mentioned his night
club as a possibility, as it is frequented by persons of many.

via International Ventures, Inc. Mr. McLean is seeking
venture capital opportunities abroad. For example, he
and a Mr. Lincoln Epworth in. New York City are working
with a Japanese named Ikvò Kasai who is President of
