1. Forwarded under separate cover in true name pouch are
the WOACRE PBRUMEN passports for LIONION-1 and LIONION-2, issued
by Reference. These passports have expired, and the Station
understands that they can be renewed for another period. Due to
the sensitivity of the LIONION operation, Subjects cannot obtain
regular PBRUMEN documentation locally, and must have them in order
to leave México and return.
It is requested that WOACRE revalidate the passports
and return them to the Station for re-issuance to Subjects.

Technical Information
Reference:
IMMA 31767 dated 11 April 1967
1.
1. LIONION 1 photographic results continue to be satisfactory
for all concerned. It is therefore advisable that no changes in
proceduro be made at this time.
2. It is apparent that LIGNION 1 releyed the incorrect devel-
oping formula for the pulse camera film. Perhaps this error is due to
his inactivity in processing such film for over a year. Since the
conception of this operation all pulse camera film has been developed
in Microdol X. On the other hand, Tri X film used in the LIONION 2
operation (Pentax camera and, Balscope) has traditionally been devel-
oped in Acufine.
:
3. All pulse camera film is processed at Headquarters by an
automatic Muston system. Time and temperature information which the
lab uses would be of little value to your development procedure. The
results of your recent test indicate that it should be satisfactory
for an occasional check on the equipment.
4.
The difference between Plus X Negative and Plus X Fan film
is worth only one half "f" stop, which should cause no problem if you
decide to use the latter.

The LIONION Pulse Camera has been working for well over a
year with no major technical problem. A few months ago the 100 foot
film magazine had to be repaired because the supply spindles had
tightened and put an excessive strain on the motor.
2. More recently, the battery supply had dropped to about
22.5 volts or so causing erratic operation. The sensor relay between
the VLS-2 and the camera suffered the most because of chattering and
consequently arcing between the points..
3. To prevent failures of this type in the future, Raymond L.
BARCENAS is making a small battery charger at a nominal cost that
can be floated across the batteries keeping them fully charged.
We are doing it this way rather than ordering a DC power supply
because it is less expensive than a commercial model and will not

however, WOACRE/PB foresees any problems by doing it this way, please

Transmittal of 35cm Pulse Camera
Reference:
MEX 1-3960
1. The attachment contains the defective 35mm Pulse Camera
previously reported in referenced cable. Very little additional
Information can be supplied, concerning this mechanical failure,
other than that reported in the reference. This particular camera
was installed on 16 June 1965 and operated normally from that date
until the afternoon of 28 June, at which time It began to continually
blow fuses. Hugh T. FRANCOTTE entered the LIONION photographic
basehouse that night, and when it was found that the problem could
not be corrected on the scene, the camera was removed and taken to
MKCHARITY for further troubleshooting. It was finally discovered
that the shutter motor was malfunctioning and partially burned-out.
Joseph M. RESCIGNO stated that since there was a definite "short"
in the motor, this would cause the camera fuses to constantly blow.
2. Also included in the attachment are two (2), one hundred
foot capacity, film magailnes. Both of these magazines are faulty,
causing the film to jam. They were both in use with the previous
In
Pulse Camera which became inoperative during late May and was
forwarded to KURIOT Headquarters for repair. FRANCOTTE had two (2)
new magazines in stock, and they were issued to LIONION/1 for use
with the camera presently being returned for repair or replacement.

1. Attached (USC) are the expired genuine PBRUMEN
passports of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 together with two photo-
graphs and five signature specimens of each agent.
2. It is requested that new PBRUMEN passports be
prepared by KURIOT and pouched to the Station as soon as
possible,
3. The assumption of reference B that passports
obtained at the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City are actually
issued in the PBRUMEN Capitol City is correct.
4. The old passports should be returned to the Station
as the Mexican immigration visas appearing of pages 11 and 19 of
the LIONION and LIONION-2 passports, respectively, must be
in the possession of the Subjects until they are granted their final
immigration documents.

Availability of the Nikon Television System
.
1. At the time of Hugh T. FRANCOTTE's departure from Head-
quarters, KURIOT had recently begun an extensive evaluation of
the Nikon closed circuit television system. If this particular
system is now considered "operational", FRANCOTTE wishes to be
so advised, as there may be a possible application for it in
support of an operation at the Mexico City Station. Lawrence F.
BARKER was recently briefed by FRANCOTTE on the Nikon system,
and is now Interested in obtaining additional facts concerning it.
BARKER, who is responsible for the LIONION Project, foresees a
possibility for its use in the LIONION photographic basehouse..
2.
It was thought that perhaps the system could be further
"operationally tested" at this baschouse, and at the same time,
the Station could examine the possibility of a permanent Instal-
lation. Presently, LIONION/1 is utilizing a Balscope and Pentax
camera for obtaining photographic coverage of the entrance to the
PBRUMEN Embassy. Provided the television camera could be equipped
with a telephoto lens of about the same focal length as the
combination of the Balscope and 20X eyepiece, this system might
be a suitable substitute for the equipment now in service.
3.
It is requested that the Mexico City Station be advised
if the Nikon television system is available, and Headquarters
thoughts concerning the testing of It at the LIONION basehouse.
