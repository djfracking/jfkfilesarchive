Enrique "CEIJAS
had just approached him with the offer to sell him some weapons
allegedly belonging to KUBARK which were stored on an unidentified
key and valued at several thousand dollars. LOPEZ and CEIJAS told
DIAZ that an armed raid on the key would have to be simulated so that
-suspicion would not fall on them, and that the raid would have to be
pulled off on either the night of 25 December or 31 December when one
o the other of the men would be on guard duty at the key. [DIAZ had
turned down the offer. JMWAVE file checks showed that the two men
were indeed of interest to KUBARK, and that AMTABBY Underwater
Demolition Team was possibly involved. Appropriate defensive measures
ware immediately taken.
