Gentlemen:
We have received your check for $1,923.75 in payment
of Invoice #1352 covering a reduced billing for three
broade ists per week from November ló to November 30,
However, since we carried, at your request, 6 broad-
casts per week for this period we sent a supple-
mental Invoice #1389. for $607.50 to cover these ad-
ditional broadcasts.
Since we have also received payment for your Decem
ber Invoice #1399, we wonder if you have misplaced
Invoice #1389 covering the additional broadcasts for
November.
Enclosed is a copy of Invoice #1389 along with your
February Invoice.
Very truly yours,

Gentlemen:
We have received your check for $1,923.75 in payment
of Invoice #1382 covering a reduced billing for three
broadcasts per week from November 16 to November 30.
However, since we carried, at your request, 6 broad-
casts per week for this period, we sent a supple-
mental Invoice #1389 for $607.50 to cover these ad-
ditional broadcasts.
Since we have also received payment for your Decem-
ber Invoice #1399, we wonder if you have misplaced
Invoice #1389 covering the additional broadcasts for
November.
Enclosed is a copy of Invoice #1389 along with your
February Invoice.
Very truly yours,
Truly
Rishard
