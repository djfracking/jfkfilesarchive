Letter of Tax Instruction for FXINGLASS/CAZAZZUS
:
1.
Based on discussions held with tax representatives of the Organi-
zation, an assessment of your Organizational income has been approved to
satisfy your Federal tax obligation.
2. The assessment computation is based on an estimate of your taxable
compensation from the Organization and your estimate of other income from
outside sources. The assessment computation results in a percentage of
you salary being withheld each pay period to completely satisfy your tax
obligation. For tax year 1967 thirteen and nine-tenths (13.9) per cent
will be withheld, effective 28 August 1967. The computation is attached.
3. In computing your assessment rate, you have been granted a basic
tax credit of $250.00. This credit is not guaranteed, but is granted to
give reasonable assurance that you will not pay a higher tax than you
would under ordinary reporting procedures.
4. Future changes in your income or tax status may justify a revision
of the assessment rate. In this event this agreement would be amended
accordingly.
5. It is important that you file a tax return directly with Internal
Revenue that is consistent with your cover status. Care and accuracy in
preparing this return are necessary. Any tax liability resulting from
the tax computation on this return will be satisfied by your own funds.
A certified true copy of this tax return must be forwarded to us upon
your submission of the original to Internal Revenue. Provided below are.
specific criteria to assist you in the preparation of the tax return:
'
A. You will be provided with the name of a notional organiza-
tion to be used on your 1967 tax return. The only income you will
report will be income shown on your (FEINGLASS) earning statement.
You will not report your wife's income or tax withholding nor will
you report any withholding that was made from your salary.
B. The income that is shown (using the notional as a source)
will be reported on the Form 2555 (Statement to Support Exemption of
Income Earned Abroad) and will be exempted from tax, due to your
residence overseas. You will base your exemption on physical
presence abroad. For tax year 1967 you will report your income as
being earned prior to hom leave and therefore fully excludable
because the qualifying period, which ended on the date you left
Mexico for home leave, included an eighteen-month period abroad.
C. Other income must also be reported on this tax return,
including interest from the Credit Union, which will be indicated
without identifying the Credit Union by name.

SPECIAL NOTE
Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific outies may be reported in Section 8. However, the nature, source, purpose o dispo
sition of information of operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.
