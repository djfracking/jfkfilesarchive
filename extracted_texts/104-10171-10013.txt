over to his deputy. He then went to Rabans and informed the DRE leader-
ship that the second in command had taken over and he was told that
Habana would initiate contact with the new leader. (Note: Since close
relations are maintained by the JAVE Station and the DRE, no attempt
was made to press the source for nars and addresses, etc., as this in-
formation can be obtained in subsequent outside debriefings. The JMHAVE
Officer responsible for the DRE operational matters was informed of the
source's arrival and processing.)

a. He said that his father is in jail in Puerto Boniato,
and that in order to try and get him free, the source went to see hajor
Telarmino "Anibal" Castilla, the chief of training for the Palma Soriano
Military Encampment, whom he knew from their days in the Santiago High
School. Source made his plea and "Anibal" told him that before he could
act upon it, he would have to talk to the source for five hours in order
to determine his political orientation. The source replied that he did
not come to talk politics but to plead for his father. "Anibal"
answered that he would think about it and call the source one way or
another, but he never called. Source thought that this story adequate-
ly demonstrated the (Communist) political orientation of "Anibal.
8. The brother of "Anibal" (pera 6a above) is "Bertico"
Castilla, first name possibly Alberto. He resigned from the army and
is now living in Santiago, but the source is not clear on "Bertico's'
political orientation.
C. Electra Fernandez, the wife of Mender Cominche (the
Santiago G-2 chief), is no longer the civil head (comissionado) of
Santiago. She is now the president of the Federacion de Mujeres Cubanas.
A. The scurce has given a complete military map of Oriente
Province to the DRE member he left in charge of Santiago DIE (see para
7 above). Information is passed from Santiago to the DIE in Habana and
the latter, in turn, is to forward the information to the States.
Source said that his contacts who work in Micaro report
that the Nicaro-Mayari Arriba area is restricted and that unknown types
of military installations are being constructed.
