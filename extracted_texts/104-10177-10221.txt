in business and industry. This has been brought about partly by the nature
of his work in selling deluxe transportation on two continents and partly by
family background and early life in Europe.

and addresses.)
(Include type of work done, dates, exployers,
Business career began in Europe. Brought up in France and speaking French,
✓ was appointed, at the age of 18, General Sales Agent for mañerous
American products including Jantzen Bathing Suits, Three-In-One Oil, the
·Franklin Motor Car and the Le Baron Motor Car. Successful with these lines,
later became General Sales Agent in France for Dusenburg Motor Cars and the
Packard Motor Car Company. Almost immediately after taking on Packard sales
he accepted a proposition to work exclusively for the Packard Hotor Car. Co.
Remained with the company in Paris for two years, or until early in 1931.
Was then sent to the United States by the company to handle Packard sales in
Buffalo, New York where he remained until the autumn of 1932.
At that time he was approached by Raymond-Whitcomb Inc.; a leading American
travel company, specializing in deluxe tours and cruises, and asked to take
over sales in the New York Office due to his knowledge of Europe and his
contacts in Europe and the United States who were potential customers for
nigh priced travel offerings. He went to work in the company's principal
sales office at 670 Fifth Avenue and remained there until 1940. The travel
business became so severely restricted after the outbreak of war in Europe
that Raymond-Whitcomb Inc. was obliged to close most of its offices. Sales
were at a standstill and, as ne me working by his own choice on a comission
basis, it was necessary for him to leave. During his eight-year tenure with
Raymond Whitcomb Inc. he wrote on an average of $500,000 worth of business
yearly by himself.
+
After leaving Raymond-Whitcomb Inc., he took a position as Assistant General
Manager of the St. Regis Hotel in New York and subsequently transferred to
the Hotel Pierre in the same capacity. He remained at the Hotel Pierre until
1942.

30. EXPLOYMENT HISTORY. (Continued)
:
Attempting to volunteer for service in the U.S. Armed Forces he was turned
down as being overweight. He then approached the C. 5. Red Cross, was
accepted, and sent imediately to Sidney, Australia as manager of the U.S.
Officers' Club in that city. Subsequently, he served in New Guinea, and in
Legte and Manila in the Philippines.
After two and a half years overseas he became eligible for discharge and
rade application to return to the United States. He went directly to Wash-
ington D.C. upon his arrival to operate there the Tar Service Bureau of the
American Optical Company. The Bureau handled that company's business rula-
tions with foreign governments and aided implementation of U.S. Army, Navy
and Air Corps contracts.
.
With the war over and the War Service Bureau about to close, he refused a
position with the American Optical Company Sales Division, to re-enter the
Transportation field. He joined a newly-formed airline called Transair Inc.,
at that time one of the leading charter companies.
Due to the uncertain position of charter lines within the aviation industry
he decided to accept an offer made to him by American Airlines to go to 1
Europe as District Traffic Manager for Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg with
headquarters in Amsterdan. He remained with American Overseas Airlines until
he had ar opportunity to transfer to Trans World Airline which made it possible
for hin to return to Paris as Special Sales Representative, covering large
corporation, goverment accounts and the notion picture industry. He has now
been with Trans World Airline in Paris for fifteen months.
For verification of his employment history the following persons are offered
as references. Both are familiar with his business career and have known
him personally for years. As is indicated by the above he has been employed
by both.

SPECIFIC PARI-4214
NAPOK
18:47
1. We regret that circumstances beyond our control prompted us to
dispatch PARI-421), on the off chance that Subject might be of sufficient
Interest to you as a potential candidate for recruitment, thus bringing to
a head a question which normally would have followed its course through the
mill. In this case, however, due to Subject's alleged resignation from TWA,
we felt that a cable such as the one we dispatched was justified, die to the
fact that unless some quick action is taken, Subject will definitely leave his
present, job with and seek employment elsewhere.
2.
On 10 December, Subject had luncheon with HARF and unloaded all his
financial troubles. In a casual way HARE asked him if by any chance he would
be willing to stay on at TVA if his salary were supplemented. Subject took
esgerly to this possibility, since it is well-known that Subject likes his
job and desires very much to remain, but is resigning merely for financial
reasons. In consultation with UNPOVED and HARE, both of whom know Subject
well, it is apparent that probably $300 monthly would allow Subject to decide
to stay with THA, provided we are sufficiently interested in recruiting him
for intelligence activities.
3. Attached hereto is UTVED's latest report on Subject, dated 8 Decem-
ter, and prepared prior to HARE's luncheon with Subject. There seems to be
sone question as to whether Subject has actually submitted his resignation to
THA in writing. According to UWOVED, he has, whereas Subject denied this to
HARE..
In any event, it is well known in Paris that Subject is taking terdinal
leave at present, prior to leaving TWA.
m
h. We now await your reaction as to whether you feel that in principle
NOVICKAR- is worth recruiting. it is too early, not having had specific and
detailed talks, with NeVICKAR, to submit a project outline, but all here are
agreed that the organization could benefit considerably by Subject's extensive
contacts in all countries of Western Europe.

Subject is quitting his position as traffic representative with Trans World Airline
as of 31 December, 1949. In August, 1949, subject advised his superiors, including
WARREN LEE PIERSON, Chairman of the Board of TWA and a personal friend, that he could
not' continue unless a larger salary and a more liberal expense account were forth-
coming. He was informed in due course by Vice President COCKS that it was impossible
for the company to give him more money within the present wage structure. Subject
therefor decided to seek other employment. On or about 15 November subject was
advised by Overseas Manager THORTON that "he could proceed to make new arrangements
as of the end of the year. Whether subject actually resigned or was asked to
terminate his connection due to his repeated demands for more money is not completely
clear to the writer.
Oversoas Karager THORNTON was never sympathetic with the subject. According to
STANLEY MARĶUSEN, THA Overseas Public Relations Director, THORNTON was jealous of
subject's popularity. On the other hand, JOHN WINCHELL, Traffic Manager for Paris,
and subject's immediate superior, was,, and continues to be, his strong supporter.
On the basis of business produced WINGHELL has told the writer that subject is the
company's most valuable employe overseas. MARKUSEN concurs in that belief.
Subject is highly regarded by OSCAR HOLCONS and PALMIR BRADLEY, directors of TWA.
In addition he is a close friend of PIERSON, Chairman of the Board, who engaged him
directly in the first place. None of these, however, seem willing to run counter to
the economy drive now in progress within TWA sponsored by new President RALPH
DAMON. Unless there is a last minute change in policy subject's termination will stand.
Subject's future is uncertain. He has boon in touch with a friend of his in New York
· named HARVEY DWIGHT. DWIGHT makes frequent business trips to Europe on behalf of his
own company which deais in spare parts for airplanes. He has intimated that he
might use subject in Europe for six to eight months and then bring him back to the
U.S. for employment, in Washington. As ofthe above date DiIGHT has made subject no
definite offer but has advised him in a letter seen by the writer not to worry about
his future.
Ex-Postmaster General JANES PARLEY, now with the CocaCola Company, was interested
recently in hiring subject for work in France but that idea seems now to have been
dropped.
CHAPLES ROJERS, Paris automobile-dealer, has asked subject to work for him but subject
has refused.
Farmer
Subject in hard pressed for money. Ho has outstanding debts and link salary from
TWA, in the vicinity of $550 monthly, had never been sufficient for his needs. In
October, 1949, THA out the living allowance paid to employes oversees.
to subject, that cost him about $150. monthly and forced him into debt.

1. UNKOVED has just informed me that subject has definitely decided
not to return to Paris and is now staying at the Hotel Stanhope on 5th Ave.,
New York. UNLOVED further assures me that subject is definitely un_employed
for the moment and is desperately looking for suitable employment.
-
2. Apparently Subject has been able to borrow a considerable amount
of money, he having sent to his wife who remained behind in Paris a suffi-
cient amount of dollars to cover local debts in French Francs which Subject
had accrued at the various Faris hotels, bars, nightclubs, etc. Subject's
wife is at present liquidating all these debts, closing up and returning to
the owner the apartment in which they lived and plans to depart for New York
to rejoin her husband within a few days,
3.
UNMOVED) ht; also assured me that subject is very anxious to return
to Europe and, if possible, Faris. UNMOVED has maintained his contacts with
other high TWA officials in Faris, who have told him that they are "lost with-
cut Subject and would be very glad to see him back in Faris. It also seems
apparent that Subject left WA under favorable circumstances and would be
willing to return (and they would accept him) provided his financial situation
were satisfactorily settled.
4. If Subject still interests you, I suggest you endeavor to contact
him at his hotel in New York.

1. Subject is presently employed in Paris by Trans World Airline
in the capacity of Special Sales Representative. He is well known to
Douglas C. HAPE and Eleanor T. HARTWELL, the former having known him
socially for a number of years and the latter having dealt with him on
transportation problems since his appointment, fifteen months ago, to the
position he now occupies with TWA..
✔
2. Subject is also a long-time friend of UNMOVED, who brought him
to our attention as a potential recruit and who has provided us with the
biographical information contained in the attached personal record form
No. 51-67.
7
3. From what I have been able to gather from UNLOVED, as well as
from HARE and HARTHELL, subject appears to be the type of individual which
might be ideally suited to fulfill certain valuable operational assignments
in France, such as "spotter" for other high-level potential agents, high-
level contacts, cut-out, etc. All who know him agree that subject is capable
of "doing anything and getting to know anyone if he so chooses. Apparently
subject, despite the "trass" which surrounds his perceptible personality, is
a serious-minded, intelligent and patriotic individual who has had much ex-
perience along lines which could be of use to this organization, as well as
an uncanny knack of being able to introduce and ingratiate himself into prac-
tically any milieu of interest to his work or wishes. A partial list of
subject's fairly close friends, as reported by UNOVED on Page 8-a of attach-
ment, shows the variety of people subject knows and sees whenever they are
in this area. Undoubtedly, subject himself could add a much longer list of
names to those reported herein, particularly with respect to contacts in
Europe.

4. I am assured by UNOVED that subject, despite his ability to
aake and keep murerous and varied friendships, is far from being a "good
tine Charlie". He is, on the other hand, one of those characters whom every-
one likes and trunts and who goes out of their way to see as often as occa-
eion permits. UNDEVED assures me that subject

not been possible and subject is at present seeking another more remuner-
ative position, since he claims that his present income of approximately
$666.00 monthly (including expense account) is insufficient to permit him
to live in Paris and maintain the contacts and activity required by his
job. According to UNLOVED, subject is at present endeavoring to secure
from his good friend Benjamin KATZ(President of the Gruen Watch Co.) the
sales agency for Gruen watches in Europe. Meanwhile, however, subject is
not contemplating resigning his position with TWA until he has a firm and
more remunerative position. UMMCVED states that subject plans to remain
with TWA at least until the end of the year, by which time he may have
secured something better. Subject has also had talks with James A. FARLEY
(on his recent trip to France) concerning the possibility of handling the
Coca-Cola agency here. Nothing has come of this possibility to date, but
subject appears to be hopeful.
7. UNYOVED is of the opinion that subject would be most receptive
to a proposition of doing intelligence work and furthermore believes that
if subject could supplement his present income by an additional $200 or
$300 per month, he would be willing to remain with TWA, which he likes
and is only considering leaving due to his present low total income, much
of which is spent in connection with activities required by his position.
8. UNLOVED has, of course, never even hinted to subject anything
about his own undercover activities and is sure subject does not suspect
that the former is doing anything but his cover work in France. UNLOVED,
when questioned as to his opinion concerning subject's potential value
as a covert agent, as well as his recuitability, has pointed out very
strongly that subject, due to the very nature of his personality, must
be given a good deal of operational guidance and be closely controlled.
Questioned as to whether some other individual should endeavor to recruit
subject, UNZOVED was of the opinion that, should the organization desire
to do so, he would be best fitted to exploit subject's potential, since

he has known hin for a good many years and as a close friend, knows his
strong and weak points and could, in general, immalle subject to better
advantage than another individual who might have only occasional contact
with him.
9. He request that consideration be given to the advisability of
endeavoring to recruit subject and, in the event of a favorable decision,
that provisional operational clearance be given in order that subject may
be approached on the subject of engaging in intelligence work. With
regard to whom should actually recruit subject, we suggest that HASE might
safely make the first approach and, if subject accepts and final security
is obtained, he might eventually be turned over to UMICVED for exploita-
tion.
10. We would appreciate your reactions to the desirability of
recruiting subject, as well as your thoughts as to how best exploit his
obvious potential.
.
11. If subject's recruitability is approved in principle and he
is given provisional security clearance, this Station would then prepare
a field project outline, to be submitted to you for approval,
