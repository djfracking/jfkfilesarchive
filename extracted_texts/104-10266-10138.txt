SUBJECT

: Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent
In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph
6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from
LIRING-3's handler Wallace B. BOWTON, to the effect that
probably
LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S. feelings". the time has
dorty,
▲
come to review the LIRING-3/Ops In the same cable. the Station
sett forth several control elements including true name receipts
and taps made in ROWTAN's safehouse of LIRING-3's amourous
sessions with a young art student
What appears to be lacking i
not considering the case as the handling of a double agent,
possibly
"t
probably hostile, his homework--that is to say, that there are
A
certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:
a.
Placing of a phone tap on L-3's telephone, if
I
it can be determined that he has a telephone.
b.
address.
Intercept of all mail going to LIRING-3's home
i
c.
to res
Physical and photo surveillance of L-3 to determine
any patterns of actions or contacts with suspicious persons. if
L-3's contacts and actions agree with what L-3 tells ROWTON and
to allow ROWTON to be prepared to cover himself in his relations
with L-3.
d. To discretely investigate I-3's sources of income,
i.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more
Cuban
recently from his wife's salary from ENG) are sufficient to
account for his scale of living, whatever it is.

PROMISED PROVIDE MAXIMUM SUPPORT. L-3 STATED WOULD NOT MENTION ROWTON
(AS GREEK FRIEND) TO CUBANS BUT WOULD COUNT COMPLETELY ON LATTER'S
ADVICE AND GUIDANCE IN ALL ACTIONS. AGREED WITH ROWTON HE SHOULD NOT AN

5. L-3 FEELS CUBA NEEDS COMMERCIAL CONTACTS WITH WEST. SINCE
ROWTON DOES NOT APPEAR AGAINST REVOLUTION AND WANTS DEVELOP TRADE
WITH CUBA, L-3 WILLING WORK FOR HIM. AGREES WITH ROWTON THAT TO
ON THERE,
TRADE WITH CUBA, MUST HAVE GOOD INSIGHT IN WHAT IS GOIN
POLITICALLY AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY. AT SAME TIME L-3 BELIEVE. CUBANS
OPERATING IN MEXICO WITH POOR SECURITY AND FEELS THAT WITH ROWTON'S
ASSISTANCE COULD DO BETTER JOB AND SERVE BOTH ROWTON AND REVOLUTION.
HIS CONDUCT WITH CUBANS THEREFORE IS NATURAL AND HIS CLANDESTINITY
WITH ROWTON JUSTIFIED IN HIS EYES ON GROUNDS IT NECESSARY FOR OWN
WELFARE.

ROWTON DOES NOT APPEAR AGAINST REVOLUTION AND WANTS DEVELOP TRADE
WITH CUBA, L-3 WILLING WORK FOR HIM. AGREES WITH ROWTON THAT TO
GOING ON THERE.
TRADE WITH CUBA, MUST HAVE GOOD INSIGHT IN WHAT IS GOINGON THERE,
POLITICALLY AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY. AT SAME TIME L-3 BELIEVES CUBANS
OPERATING IN MEXICO WITH POOR SECURITY AND FEELS THAT WITH ROWTOR'S
ASSISTANCE COULD DO BETTER JOB AND SERVE BOTH ROWTON AND REVOLUTION.
HIS CONDUCT WITH CUBANS THEREFORE IS NATURAL AND HIS CLANDESTINITY
WITH ROWTON JUSTIFIED IN HIS EYES ON GROUNDS. IT NECESSARY FOR OWN
WELFARE.

1. At about 1830 on 2 May, 1966, Nonton dropped into the Salon de
La Plastica Mexicana in the hope of running into Subject so that he
could renew contact more or less casually.
2. Fortunately as soon as he stepped into the door he found Subject
engaged in conversation with the receptionist and another person (pro-
bably a Mexican employe of the Salon). When Subject spotted howton he
broke off his conversation and moved away to greet Rowton cordially. He
said that he had himself just arrived at the Salon and was very ha. py
to run into Howton again. After a few griff remarks, he invited Horton
to coffee in a nearby cafe. howton accepted and they both left the Sa-
Ion althout further delay.

3. Reston remained with subject in conversation over coffee for about
45 minutes. Subject expressed gratification in having zet Rowton and
several times reassured hoston that he enjoyed conversing with him re-
gardless of whether he made an sale of his painting or not. Howton re-
verted to the theme that he had a genuine interest in subject's future
and hoped in some way to provide Subject with the means of becoming re-
latively independent so that he could travel and carry on his art work
freely. Howton added that he had given much thought to the idea of using
Subject to help him in his economic research, since this would justify
Rowton's putting Subj ct on his expense account. He then questioned Sub-
ject on his possible connections in Mexico, but Subject confessed that
he had only limited contacts that probably wo ld not be useful to Rowton.
Rowton then moved into the target question. He stated that most of his
clients in England, France and Greece were interested in Cuban require-
ments and perhaps Subject was in a unique position to prepare a report
on what the Cuban econes required at the moment. Subject responded with-
out bestitation that he could do something on Cuba without too much if-
ficulty. He explained that he knew official Cubars in Mexico City, in-
cluding those in the Commercial Lission, and could travel into Cuba if
necessary.
4. Rowton then stressed that he really did not need too many statistica
on the Cuban economy nor contact with the Cubans but wanted somehow to
justify helping Subject financially. He explained that he could easily
assemble some data himself, but wanted subject to do something concrete

Wallace B. Hoton Contact with Carlos Jurado.
1. When Howton arrived at the entrance to the Bellas Artes
Building at 1100 on 30 April,as planned, he found Subject waiting
on the steps. Subject greeted Rowton cordially and sugested
that they take a taxi since the Ministry of Education building was
a little too far to walk to. He then hailed a taxi and instructed the
driver to take them to the Secretaria de Education Publica on Calle
Argentina. :

On arrival he escorted Rowton through the court-yand of the
lding and explained the murals of Diego Rivera. He commented
that he felt the murals were superior to those at the Irado Hotel
2 Quernavaca since they had more "social meaning”.
the hardship under which Rivera had worked, which included some
physical danger from certain elements opposed to his socialist ideas.
Rowton picked up this theme in relationship to Dubject's own situation
in an attempt to elicit as much information as possible concerning
Subject's financialstatus and position vis-a-vis the Mexican govern-
ment.
3. In the course of conversation Subject stated that he had received
relatively little understanding and sympathy from the covernment of-
ficials as a whole but did receive some sup ort from the Instituto
Nacional de Bellas Artes. He explained that he was able to earn e-
nough money from teaching assignments to be relatively independent,
and not depend on sales of his picutres to make a living.
In reply
to hoston's comment to the effect that perhaps his wife could find
some employment to help Subject, the latter replied that his wife
could not work because of her status. He quickly added that he pro-
bably would not find it difficus to procure working papers for her,
but he preferred not to do so at least at the present time.
4. After completing his tour of the Secretariat of Education Building,
Subject invited Kowton to view the murals of the Supreme Court Buil-
ding on fiño Suarez, which He described as superior even to those of
Diego Rivera, especially because of their open defiance of official
opinion. On the way Howton continued to put discreet questions con-
cerning subject's personal life. Subject replied by revealing that

he lived with his wife and three-year-ol child in a very small
apartment near Jan Angel and shared a studio with another arist.1
He added that he was paying 650 pesos monthly rent which he cop-
sidered very high for what he was getting, to also compla
that
the artist with whom he was sharing the studio was a dil ettante who
was more interested in the atmosphere of the Latin Quarter than in
art for its own sake. He said he found it difficult to paint with
guitars playing and cocktail glasses clinking in the ackground. Sub-
ject then stated that he was looking for a more suitable arrangement,
perhaps in a condominio and preferably in the Tacubaya area.
5. In connection with his own future hopes, Subject stated that he
wanted very Euch to travel to gain as much experience as possible
I
so that his style could be crystalized. He commented that he could
move easily to Cuba since his wife's family lived there and he could
get along with the Cuban authorities, but he felt Nexico was better
for him at the moment. He expressed preference for Sweden, North Af-
rica and Greece. In reply to howton's queries, he stated that he
did not feel that his daughter would present a problem, since he could
leave her in the care of his or his wife's relatives. He added that she
was currently attending a Jardin de Niños in the mornings and doing
very well despite her tender age.
C. Subject commented also that he likedtravel so much that he had joined
the Mexican Navy to see the world. He added that he had been able to
visit almost all the potts of the east and west coasts of North and
Central America but had not succeeded in seeing Europe as he had hoped.
Since Rowton was posing as a Greek, Subject expressed great interest
in visiting Athens and the Middle East, and at one point asked Howton
how much money he would need to live in Athens for a month as a tourist..
Subject also stated that both he and his wife were anxious to learn
English and French so that they could absorb as much local culture as
possible in their travels.
7. After inviting Rowton to coffee at a nearby restaurant, subject stated
that he had to meet his wife and some friend's for lunch and left Row-
ton at about 1335 in front of the Cathedral. He promised to telephone
Rowton again so that they could get together before nowt n left the
country.

place of the meeting. He informed Rowton that he himself
could be contacted on 48 22 66, a telephone that was located
near his studio in the Colonia Florida. He asked Royton to
obtain as soon as possible the measurements of the proposed
mural and a photographs of of the owner so that he could make
a sample painting.

And
from L'TA INT=2)]
1. Following a Station lead to the effect that Mrs. Chichay
Jurado, who is employed by the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City,
is the daughter of a Cuban residing in New York City, Howton
visited the Salon de la Plastica Mexicana, Calle Havre 7, where
Carlos Jurado's paintings were on exhibit. After several un-
successful attempts to meet Jurado by chance at the salon, Rowton
left his alias and telephone answering service number with the
receptionist on 14 Apil1, 1966, and asked that jurado contact him
for a meeting. On 16 April Rowton again visited the salon ( having
received no message through the answering service) and fortulately
met Jurado who had dropped int to pick up messages from the re-
ceptionist.

2. Rowton explained that he was interested in Jurado's style,
particularly for a mural that might go well in a New York night
club owned by a friend of his. Jurado was, of course, immediately
interested and commented that he was most anxious to visit New
York to see the Museums. In answer to howton's query, he stated
that he did not have any relatives in New York and had never been
outside Mexico. Rowton invited Jurado and his wife to dinner the
following evening so that they could discuss the proposed mural.
(Rowton planned, if pressed, to use the "La Chansonette" night-
club restaurant owned by his frien Greek friend Rita Dimitri as
the prospective client).
3. On 19 April at 1930 Rowton met Jurado at the Salon as planned.
Fortunately Jurado had brought his wife Chichay along as Rowton
had suggested. Rowton invited them to dinner at the Restaurante &

a sort of stringer in reporting on economic developments.. Julfect
replied that he understood and did not see that such a task would be
too difficult.
5. Howton then asked Subject how he was coming in locating a new aprt-
ment/studio. Subject replied that he had found a desirs le place near
Chapultepec, and hoped to be able to nove soon. Howton then commented
that he might have to leave for Paris in the next few days and would be
away for about two weeks on business. He stated that he might be able
to help Subject with the rent on his studio provided it had a phone.
Rowton explained that he was at present paying 350 pesos monthly for
secretarial service and could just as well pay Subject something for
taking telephone messages. Jubject replied that he would be glad to
be of service to howton without compensation ( "mi casa es suya") on
such a matter.
6. Rowton then turned the conversation to Subinetle wife and family.
Subject revealed that his wife's maiden name ( apellido) was the
Chinese translation of "Flor de Durazno". He pronounced it in Chinese
for Rowton but Rowton made no attempt to transfliterate it and at this
point cannot recall the phonetic pronunciation. Subject added that Chi-
chay is a Cuban corruption of the Cinese given came. In reply to How-
ton's direct query, Subject stated that his wife's father mother is in
Cuba but her father is in New York. He added that her father did not
agree with the revolution and left but the rest of the fabily remained.
He also stated that her mother has not remarried and lives with her
brothers and sisters. Subject added that his wife felt no bitterness
toward her father and in fact the father whites regularly once a week
from New York. Nowton did not press for an address at the time, feeling
that it would be more discreet to wait for an opening at a subsequent
meeting( when he could allege that he was planning to stop over in New
York).
7. Hoxton took the occasion of his alleged impending departure to ask
for Subject's home address so that he could write from Europe. Subject
stated that since he might move it would be better for Hoston to write
to him care of the Salon rather than to his present address.
8. On leaving Subject Ro ton promised to pass by the Salon again before
he left so that he could say goodbye to Subject.

"El 77" at Calle Condres 77. Neither had eaten there previously
and appeared delighted at the opportunity to enjoy a good dinner.
4. In the course of conversation, Jurado stated that his wife
Chichay was born in Cuba and that they had a three-year old
daughter. Niether he nor Chichay made any referance to her em-
ployment at the Consulate and "owton did not feel it wise to
press tɔo bard on that subject. Rowton again asked whether Ju-
rado had any relatives in New York in the event it might be ad-,
visable for him to travel there in connection with the mural, but
meither he nor his wife responded in the affirmative.
5. Later in the evening, Jurado and his wife strolled along Khuz
Calle Niza and Reforma to the Hotel Hilton with Rowton. This
gave Rowten an opportunity to sound them out on politics with
specific reference to Cuba. Howton pretended to be of Greek-
Irish parentage and more or less neutral in his own political
views with respect to Cuba. Chichay Jurado stated that she felt
Cuba was doing well and that the relovation was the only answer
to the corruption that had existed previously. Carlos Jurado
agreed, consenting that the "Northamerican" position with regard
to Cuba was unfortunately erroneous and short-sighted. hot
placed much of the blame on the former Eatista regime but lamented

1. A PEQ Part II for LIRING-3 is being forwarded under separate
cover. It is to be noted that LIRING-3 has not been recruited in the
name of WOFACT, but instead is engaged in clandestine activities for
Wallace B. ROWTON, who LIRING-3 believes is a Greek businessman with
international connections who requires economic, political and personality
Information in order to conduct his business.
2. The fact that LIRING-3 is not aware of his WOFACT connection, at
the present time, outveights the value which would accrue were an attempt
made to make him knowledgeable. He performs clandestinely for ROWTON
and he is actually attacking priority targets.
priority targets. In this way he works
against the target with a clear conscience and his left-wing sentiments
are not threatened.
3. The operation is moving, however, toward the eventual full re-
cruitment of LIRING-3, but it is moving slowly in that direction because
of the political and social beliefs of Subject. One advantage of this
false flag recruitment of this individual, at the present time, is the
fact that he is able to enter the target area without fear of capture and
exposure as an enemy agent. Under the present plan of operation he believes
his work actually is aiding the revolution which he believes in from an
idealistic standpoint,

3. Subject, in his political outlook, is left of center, with
•
a history of revolutionary activity in Cuba from 1961 until his return
to Mexico in 1964. Subject has insisted to Rowson that, because of his
(existentialist) philosophy, ho han never permitted himself to join any
organization, including the communist party, although he has given moral
and material suport to unloutionary movemonth bath in Qubo and they Moxioo.
Subject has confessed his disillusionment with any of the revolutionary
leaders in Cuba and with all of the Mexican leaders, remarking that sooner
or later "the real" revolution will come to Mexico to eliminate the cor--
ruption and injustice that prevails throu, hout the country. Subject, howeve
feels that in the neantime he must live under a more practical philosophy
of daily life and is willing is make the necessary compromises to assist
Howton in his busines affairs. Subject has shown no reluctance to exploit
his friends, and even his wife, to be of specific service to Rowtch, and
han, on numerous occasions, volunteered to do so with Rowton's approval.
This appears to Rowton to be a reflection of the existentialist Conviction
that his philosophy gives him freedom to choose without dependency, obli-
gation or justification.
*
4. Rowton is aware that Subject is currently undergoing a decisive.
climacteric, the future direction of which is not as yet certain. Howton!
mas succesied in making Subject compromise a great deal with his past idcals
particularly concerning deep involvement with other people and acceptance'
of financial support for purely business transactions, and for this reason
has hesitated to uncover for Subject any of the mystery surrounding his
own life and activites. Subject disilkes "northamericans" and considers
life in the U.S., with which he is not familiar from experience, as corrupt.
and decadent. Rowton feels that he can eventually break down Subject's
prejudice, if this proves to be necesso worthwhile, but it would be
fatal at this time for Rowton to reveal hid
sections..
Subject is, in his in words, completely confident of Rowton's good will
and
WoFACToward him and is, at least for the moment, totally dependent upon him for
Fuidance as well as financial support. Any attempt at direct recruitment
at this point would, in Rowton's opinion be counterproductive.
In his various contacts with the Cubans thus far, particularly his current
visit to Havana on what appears to be an IS briefing, Subject can in all
respects act naturally, without the feeling that he is concealing anything.
from his Cuban friends, simply because he is unwitting of Rowton's true
offiliations and intentions. If he were witting, he would appear to all
concerned to be suffering from a severe psychological crisis, and ceruainly
would not be in a good position to produce useful information or inspire
confidence. Subject is under some strain as a result of his current rela-
tionship with Rowton in his capacity as an international bourgeois busi-
messman, a fact attested to by his wife to Rewton on 7 November when she
expressed concern over Subject's recent mocdiness and lack of interest
in painting. Subject has also become involved in a love affair with one
of his rich art students, a Mexican woman who is known to visit Subject at
the safehouse.
5. In summation Rowton feels that Subject is excellent potential agent
material, both because of his background and experience as well as his
direct access to targets of interest. The problems inherent in his philo-
sophical and psycholonical make-up will continue to be taken into conside-
ration in developing Subject's full potential. The obvious disadvantages
of Subject's unwitting status vis-a-vis ☐ can be overcome by careful
handling of Subject and increased controllover him in the future.

Development of LINING/3 by Rowton:
6. Rowton met Subject in April, 1966, by cold approach in the
Row-:
art studio where Subject at the time was presenting his latest
works under sponsorship of Bellas Arses. Rowton posed as a Greek busi-
nessman interested in Subject's style and his immediate objective at the
time was to ascertain the address in new York City of Subject's wife's
father (a Cuban of Chinese origin who had left Cuba as a refugee).
ton, feeling that he had to present an above-average prospect to Subject
to permit future meetings, alleged that he was anxious to arrange for the
painting of a mural to be installed in a New York nightclub owned by a
Greek friend of his ( Rita Dimitri, owner and performer at the "La Chan-
sonette"). Rowton felt that pin-pointing a "New York nightclub" would
have the double advantage of determining; Subject's sentiments toward working
in New York City and in a bourgeois environitent.
.
7. Subject reacted very favorably to the initial approach and accepted
Rowton's invitation to dinner in the company of Subject's wife the next
evening. Both Subject and his wife were cautions in revealing any specific
data concerning their background and personal history, but neither con-
cealed their mutual approval of Castro's regime and dislike for the corrup-
tion in Mexico. As a result of this mecting Reston realized that any at-
tment at a direct approach to either Subject on his wife, who was then em-
ployed part-time at the Cuban Consulate, would be conterproductive and that
a more subtle approach would have to be develoned. Rowton decided that a
strong personal relationship developed bwith Subject would be productive
and could eventually lead st useful production on Subject's part.
'
8. When, therefore, on 2 May, 1966, Subject expressed gratification
at having mot Rowton and indicated that he wished to continue his friendly
contacts, regardless of whether Rowter purchased his painting or arranged
for the mural, Rowton DY moved in with an offer to "hire" Subject as his
·business associate on an unofficial basis, so that Subject could acquire
a degree of indepence financially and perhaps do some traveling for Rowton.
"In order to develop as much clandestinity as possible in his future con-
tacts with Subjec, Rowton explained that he is simply a tourist in Mexico
and as such not permitted to engage in lucrative business activities. He
would therefore have to depend on Subject's discretion in any dealings he
might have with him. Subject accepted this as quite normal but pointed
out to Raton his limitations xas far as business training and experience
went. In reply to Rowton's cuery, he did confess, however, that he had excel-
lent contacts in Havana that could be exploited for business dealings with
Cuba. He volunteered to make an exploratory trip to Havana to renew his
friendship with the perons concerned. Rowton accepted this offer, not only
to test Subject's story but also to seize the occasion to be in a position
to provide Subject with money to make the trip and thus compromise him some-
what at the outset.
9. Rowton's next move was to explain to Subject that he had a long-
term interest in Cuba and hoped to do a great deal of business in the fu-
utre but first felt it was essential that both he and Subject develop the
proper contacts inside to ensure success. Subject readily agreed to this
and felt relieved that, Roston did not expect him to produce concrete results.

10. Inasmuch as Subject and his wife had long lived an almost
ascetic life in a small sparcely furnished apartment with no apparent
luxuries and dressed in the simples and apparently most inexpensive
clothing available, and furthermore apparently did not have any conscioua
desire to improve their living conditions, Roston realized that financial
control over Subject would be difficult to establish unless Subject and
his wife could me made to lift their eyes to soe a more comfortable and
promising life within their reach. He therefore chose some of the best
restaurants for lunch dates with Subject (prior to the renting of the
Gafehouse), brought several relatively expensive dolls and toys for their
child, arranged through the COS to have a credit account opened for Sub-
ject and his wife at Sears Roebuck Stores and was able to present Subject
with a credit card that would enable Subject and his wife to make. effort-
less purchases on credit. Rowton. aiso persuaded Subject to open a checking
account at the Banco de Londres y Mexico, ostensibly so that he could keep_.
better track of the ront paymonts or the safehouse. All these bourgeois
trappings were calculated to raise Subject and his family fromthe com-
1 placent proletariat standard of living into which they had sunk. Subject
oxpressed to Rowson his appreciation for such restures and confessed tha
he now realized. the importance of these outward signs of respectability
and as a result felt more able to sten into the world of higher society.
His wife also revealed in her comments of appreciation to Howton that she
walcomed the prospect of a better life for herself and her child and honed
to be able to purchase enough furniture to make her home respectable and
permit her to invite guests occasionally.
e_and"
11. The one adverse effect of this effort on Rowton's part has been
that hubject bean to me the Safeent for amorous tryst with
one of his art students, an apparently wealthy Mexican woman, who has now
in effect become his mistress ( as revealed by technical surveillance from
an IP in the same building set up and run very effectively by Medbury).
Subject has revealed the name and address of this woman to Howton in con-
nection with the establishment of a 2.0. Box which could be used as a drog
for communication between Subject and Rowton while the former was in Cuba;
but he has not to date told Rowton of his illicit relationship with the
- woman. This development can, of course, serve as a potential control over
Subject and can be used in any future
examination, but, on the
other hand may lead to complications in subject's personal life and create
hostility on the part of his wife, should she discover the philandering of
Subject. She might likewise tend to blame Rowton for Subject's conduct. For
this reason Rowton has made every effort to maintain good relations with
Subject's wife ( she has already confided to kowton her concern over Sub-
ject's recent Loodiness, as stated above) in the hope that she will turn to.
Rowton for help in the event she feels her marraige in jeopardy. Considera-
tion is also being given to the possibility of breaking up as discreetly
as possible Subject's affair with the Mexican woman in the event that it
becomes more serious. Technical surveillance of the trysts will continue
to provide useful information in this direction.

12. With regard to the use of Subject unwittingly to elicit operationali
information from his Cuban friends in Mexico City as well as Havana, Rowton
gradually impressed on Subject the need to acquire all possible information.
both political and economic on Cuban develoements as a prelude to enreging
in serious and lucrative business with the Castro regime. Subject accepted
this line without question and did produce some useful inside information
of value. The turning point, however, came in connection with the disappear-
ance of Julian Iinez, the Press Attaché of the Embassy in Mexico City in
late September, 1966. Subject reported the disappearance to Rowton with some
Clee, commenting that he and his wife were convinced that López had gone

Review and Assessment of LIRING Operation.
Búćkground Character and Assessment of DIRING/3:
1. Ziring/3 (Subject) is a 36-pear-old Mexican artist of the
Diego Rivera School and an ascitic existentialist oriented
toward the philosophy of Jean Paul Mure, with relatively strong
leftist political convictions. He has produced a fair amount of
painting and had relatively good success in murals both in Cuba and
Nexico, but has not succeeded in selling many of his works, despite
numerous expositions, sponsored by the Mexican Government plastic arts
organization (Bellas Artes). Because of his family, educational and
environmental background, Subject Feels that his work has not been
appreciated for its intrinsic word by the Mexican Government and tendo
to blame his politicial convictions for this lack of acceptance. Subject,
Phowever, has, as he himself asserts, no feelings of bitterness or re-
*sentment, although he frequently experiences the "anguish, forelomness
. and lonliness" of the existentialist, but he has not permitted himself
to degenerate into a beatnik either in his personal or artistic life.
Subject has confided to kowton that he has no real friends and that he
has withdrawn from society, the dictates of which he cannot accept. He
enjoys the prospect of travel, especially abroad, "to develop his art"
But also an esc.pe from the pures and obligations of the boolal
life he has been forced to lead in hexico.
2. Shortly after he met Rowtor, in April, 1966, Subject confessed
that he felt himself at a crition in in his personal and artistic
life. He indicated that he felt radoxes inherer in his philoso-
phy were overwhelming and depressie him and that he welcomed friendship
with Rowton, an experienced foreigner whom he felt he could trust in-
plicitly. At one critical point, Subject quis his rather te ious job
with the Ministry of Education (teaching art in a public school) with the
comment that "everyone must make personal decisions and take risks, and
(I have decided to throw my lot in with you (Rowton) for better or worse
and so have quit the job since it was interfering with my availability",
This he did without knowing any more about Rowson than his name, which,
technical surveillance revealed he did not accept as a true name, and
with no guarantees of future financial support from Rowton. Rowton, in
his conversations with Subject, has been careful not to reveal any data
concerning his personal life and background, including his permanent or
local address, providing Subject only with the number of a telephone ans-
wering service, and using the safehouse rented by Subject as a principal
point of contact. Subject has accepted money from Rowton, at first only
for previously approved expenses, and subsequently for his peroonal use,
but has accepted Rowton's initiative in this matter, and made no demands
.on.Rowton for remuneration for services rendered. He has been meticulous
in accounting for funds and shown no reluctance to sign receipts presented.
to him by Rowton ( with his true-nome signature). Subject has confessed
(and shown) an almost complete lack of experience in business and intelli-
gence work, but has accopted Rowton's guidance, where required, without.
hesitation,

th
off or a bingo with some friends. Subject then repeated to Rowter his
criticism of López' childishnoss and inexperience and recalled that when
he himself had pointed out to 16 his nece in handling his Embassy
16ne no-
functions(in the Press and Cultural field) tez had shrugged off his ad-
monitions with the comment that were more important things to do
for the revolution. The disregard, bordering on dictain, with which López
ins well as apparently other Cuban officials, had greeted Subject's friendly
advice in the past, obviously cut Subject the quick and fostered in hia
to
the resentment of a peasant toward his master. Taking this into considers-
tion and in the hope of stirring up as much trouble for López and the Em-
bassy as possible, the Station permitted Royton to pass to Subject the
highly restricted information that López hoi actually been arrested by the .
Mexican police for complicity in the arms gling ring that has recently
Rowton Cave.
been uncovered in their operations from Mexico into Gatemala.
Subject enough details to make the story convincing and asked Subiect to
attribute the information to "Central American friends" and to stress that
it was already inthe hands of the press. In addition Rowton suggested that
Subject pass this information personally to López as a hot tip so that L6-
poz-could discreetly disappear before the reporters managed to question him.
When Subject did as requested by Rowson, López was apparently so overwhelmed
with gratitude for Subject's good intentions that he informed the Ambass r
the following morning (just before his suddent departure for Havana). Events
then moved swiftly. The Ambassador called in Subject and expressed his per-
sonal appreciation for Subject's interest and help in this delicate matter
and armed with Subiect that the involvement of Embassy personnel in arms
smuggling was placing Cuban-Mexican relations in jeopardy. overni mt this
raised Subject's status in the eyes of the bassador and his closest ad-
visors ( Curbelo and Ceneda) to that of a valued confident rather than simpl;
a friend of the revolution. This obviously pleased Subject and zaie him all
the more anxious to conceal the role of Royton in the affair so that all the
. credit would continue to fall to him.
•
13. As a result Subject was subsequently called in by Curbelo and.
in
Cepeda and asked to offer his services to help the Tricontinental its
work in Central America. On Rowton's advice which Subject sollicited) the
offer was accepted on condition that the work to be done would be serious.
(i.e. worth the personal risks Subject would have to run) and the Subject
would be permitted to work without the overt involvement of the local Bm--
bassy, These conditions were prombly accepted and Subject was invived to
Visit Havana again so that he could be briefed on the spot by Camani Cien-
fuego and his staff.
14. Subject was thus catapulted into the level of IS activites, with

15. Subject was born in Nexico City in 1930 of a middle class family.
Subject's grandfather was a woll-known textile 'morchantnwho served some 12.
years as president of the Chamber of Commerce. At least one of Subject's
aunts is currently well-to-do and the owner of several apartment houses in
Mexico City. Subject has at present little or no contact with his family.

16. At the age of 15 Subject left home to join the Mexican Navy,
Subject has commented to Rowton that his childhood was not particularly
happy and that his mother and father separated, apparently when he was
in his teens. It appears likely that Subject left home as a result of
family dissension. Subject states that his esire to travel and see the
world wasvery strong; at the time he joined the navy.
17. Inasmuch as the legal for enlistment was 18, Subject had
to have his birth certificate altered to show that he had been born in
1927 rather than 1930. is a consecuence all of Subject's official docu-
ments now show his birth-date as 1227, including his passport.
18. Subject served a three-year hitch in the navy and visited nearly
all the ports of Mexico and many of Central America. Subject's speciality
appears to have been in the quartermaster branch, since he learned the
rudiments of navigation and ship-handling. When he left the nval service,
Subject enterei the University of Mexico and took courses in Archaeology
and Anthropology for the next two years. Subject simultaneously developed
a strong interest in painting and sculpture and over the next five or so xx
years, studied under such masters as Rivera and Siquieros.
19. Subject was married in 1950 at the age of twenty years to a
young Mexican woman from Leon, GTC.. and during the next ten years had 27
at least four children by her. He divorced his wife in about 1960, just
prior to his departure for Cuba, but he had not been on good terms with
her for several to the ditto about in5"
05" 5: 1060, Sub-
ject worked in the Mexican Government Social Service among the Indians in
the southern states of Mexico. Subject attributes some of the tension that
arose between him and his wife to this employment venture. He commented to
Rowton that his first wife wanted to live a quiet normal life in Mexico
City and was unwilling to share with him the hardships of social work in
• remote areas of tropical Mexico. During this period Subject gradually de-
veloped his own style in painting and began to establish close contacts
with Mexican art circles.
20. Subject went to Cuba in about 1900 "to join the revolution",ap-
parently as a result of his increasingly leftist nolitical sympathies. He
did a relatively large amount of painting and mural work during his four-
year residence in Cuba, while at the same time working in the Ministry
Labor and Education. In about 1961 he married a Cuban woman of Chinese
orimin from Santiago de Cuba and the following year a (girl) child was born
to them in Havana. Subject has told Rowton that he has had very little
contact with his first wife since his divorce and pays no alimony. He added
that his family, however, has continued to take an interest in his first
wife and the children of his first marriage and has helped to support them
financially. During his stay in Cube, Subject developed close friendship
with many Cuban revolutionaries, particularly Arnol Rodriques, whose wife
worked with Subject in the Ministry of Education at the time when Arnol
Rodriquez was serving as Minister of labor.
21. Subject returned to Mexico City in 1964 with his new wife and
child (whom he had naturalized as a Mexican citizen). By this time Subject
es
had become a professional artist but supplemented the rather modest income
ho acquired from the dale of his painting by teaching art privately and
in Mexican public schoois. His monthly income during 1965 and early 1966
did not exceed. 3,000 pesos.
