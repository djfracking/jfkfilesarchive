REMARKS
APPROVEO
Mr. David E. Murphy is hereby awarded the Distinguished
Intelligence Medal in recognition of his outstanding service
to the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 27 years.
During this period Mr. Murphy held a series of senior positions
in Headquarters and overseas. Long an acknowledged expert, both
operationally and substantively, in the Soviet field, he led
the components having prime responsibility for that area to
major gains in the fulfillment of Agency missions vis-a-vie
the Soviet Union. Throughout his career Mr. Murphy displayed
his intellectual and leadership abilities, professionalism
and dedication to duty. His many accomplishments reflect
great credit on him, the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Federal service.

OVERALL RATING:
OUTSTANDING
:
1. At the end of May 1974, Mr. Murphy will leave
Paris after a most successful six-year assignment as
Chief of Station. He distinguished himself by having
molded this Station into a cohesive, well-disciplined,
and highly productive unit. I reiterate my evaluation
of Mr. Murphy as, overall, the most effective chief of
a major station in the European Division. His earlier
fitness reports and his excellent record in Paris
attest to this.
2. In the past year under Mr. Murphy's direction,
the Paris Station has continued to make significant
progress on all major fronts. As examples, I can cite
two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an imaginative
effort to get closer to several other primary Sovict
targets, a perceptible improvement in our French liaison
relationships, a marked increase in both quality and
quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting,
the acquisition of new sources to cover the French
internal scene, and a revitalization of several existing
assets into producers of valuable intelligence. Although
normally most of the credit for such achievements rests
with the individual operations officers concerned, in
Mr. Murphy's case he personally becomes involved in each

2. Mr. Murphy brought to the Agency from his
previous military and civilian experience and study,
a knowledge of the Russian language and of the Soviet
system. It was in the field of Soviet operations that
he rapidly made his mark, first in Japan, and then in
Germany. His incisive mind, vitality, enthusiasm,

After revitalizing and redirecting our Soviet
program as C/SR and of the enlarged SB Division, Mr. Murphy
was appointed COS, Paris in 1968 and served in that position
until 1974. His alx years in Paris were marked by steady
progress in all areas of the missions and objectives
assigned to that large and complex station and by the
handling of delicate political and internal crisis situa-
tions in France effectively and to the benefit of the Agency
in
and the United States. His analyses of the situation
France at times of tension and crisis were particularly
remarked upon for their clarity, incisiveness and value to
U.S. policy makers. For his leadership of the Paris
Station, Mr. Murphy's performance was characterized as
"Outstanding" in each of the years of his service there.

operation and therefore the cited progress is a direct
reflection of Mr. Murphy's talent and skill as a dynamic
operational manager. Paris is a sprawling metropolitan.
area where operating obstacles, particularly these
relating to access to major targets, are further exacerbated
by sporadic French scrutiny of our activities. It is
therefore all the more noteworthy that the progress made
by the Station has been accomplished without any embar-
rassing flaps through Mr. Murphy's insistence that the
highest standards of tradecraft be practiced by Station
personnel and by visiting case officers.
3. Mr. Murphy can take considerable personal pride
in his record in Paris. His personal concern with all
areas of Station activity and his common-sense approach
to both operational and administrative matters are indicative
of this officer's competence as one of this Agency's most
gifted and thoroughly professional senior officers. His
wide range of interests, his wealth of operational
engagement, his ability to make well-reasoned and prompt
decisions, his aggressiveness, and his persuasiveness are
all hallmarks of Mr. Murphy's superb performance. Although
Mr. Murphy shows a lively impatience with bureaucratic
roadblocks and cogently articulates his views on all issues,
his correspondence with Headquarters is invariably presented
factually and in a dignified and unemotional tone; this I
have appreciated and would like to add that Mr. Murphy
promptly implements Headquarters guidelines and decisions.
4. Mr. Murphy's performance clearly merits the
rating of OUSTANDING.

Given the size of the Paris Station and the complexity
of its diverse activities, on loverall performance Mr. Murphy
is rated as the most effective Station Chief in the European
Division area. In the period under review, substantial
progress has been made against all operational targets.
Under Mr. Murphy's tutelage particularly noteworthy accom-
p lishments are noted in the Soviet field against human
targets and on a superbly executed technical penetration;
in the area of liaison where Mr. Murphy has almost single-
handedly developed productive relationships at senior levels
and as
testament to his efforts, successfully enlisted
outstanding liaison support to a delicate CI investigation
of primary interest to this Organization; and more recently,
Mr. Murphy has effectively harnessed Station resources and
assets to collect timely intelligence on economic topics,
to move forward in the effort to thwart terrorism, and to
furnish valuable reporting on the critical French elections
of March 1973. Under his direction, the Station has acquired
a number of productive and responsive assets in the past year,
while other operational programs have improved upon their
high quality/intelligence production record.
2. Mr. Murphy is a thoroughly professional senior
intelligence officer who plays a very active role in
practically all of the Station's operational activities.
His incisiveness and keen analytical talent enable him to

credit that all Paris-based operations are run with the
highest degree of professionalism and adherence to strict

My feeling that Dave Murphy has done an outstanding
job as Chief of Station, Paris is so amply documented in the
preceding Fitness Reports that this final report before I
leave the Division need not be lengthily repetitive. It is
useful to record, however, that during the last half of this
year his Station has been deeply involved in the reporting
and analysis of some highly sensitive developments on the
French political scene. Much of the analysis of this situn-
tion has been handled by Dave himself, and has proven of real
significance to our highest level customers. We have briefed
a number of ranking officials in Washington on Dave's
findings and they have been uniformly appreciatives
therefore deserves credit for alerting Washington to a difficult
situation concerning which the U.S. Government has had little
or no information except from this Agency's sources.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attack, adibinasaid sheets, if pecensary for this section or fut reviewing officer's comments,)
I first met Mr. Murphy following the assumption of my present
duties at the end of March 1973. Therefore, I am in a position to
comment on his performance only during the last seven months covered
by this report. During that time, Mr. Murphy's performance has been
thoroughly outstanding in every respect. During his years in France,
ho has developed a real expertise on this country, both in terms of
how it functions and with regard to the manner in which Franco looks
at the world.
Mr. Murphy has effectively directed and coordinated a large
staff, and I have been particularly gratified at the extent to which
his staff coordinates its reporting with other interested elements of
the Hission. I am told by my DCM that, based on his experience, the
coordination between Mr. Murphy's offico and the substantive sections
of the Babssey is botter at this post than at any post ho has known
or heard of. This is in large part a direct tribute to Mr. Murphy'a
loadership.
I find i am calling increasingly on Ar. Murphy's advice in the
proparation of Esbaney Saddaments on a broad range of policy issues.
Illa costriations have been perceptive and, by and large, accurate.

1.
During the reporting period. Mr. Murphy has continued
his usual virtuoso performance. The Station has been very
heavily occupied in one degree or another against most of the
hardest targets, and Mr. Murphy has been fully on top of
everything that has gone on.
2. Particularly worthy of note is the manner in which
Mr. Murphy has raised the level of our liaison in France, taking
advantage among other factors of a change for the better in the
leadership of the external service. Although this situation
has certainly been favorable. it could not have been exploited
so fully had it not been for Mr. Murphy's rare combination of
charm, persuasiveness, and a superb professional background.

period. He has excellent judgement, a quick mind and a thorough knowledge of
France and French politics. And he has common sense, as well as a good sense
of humor. His personal conduct is impeccable; his behavior, gentlemanly.
Mr. Murphy is widely known and respected in the French official and diplo-
matic community. His contacts are numerous and useful. He and his wife make an
excellent representational team. He speaks excellent French.
Mr. Murphy's relations with other senior officers at the Embassy are cordial
and harmonious. He is a good administrator and is well-liked by his subordinates,
as well as his collegues.
In sum, I am delighted to have Mr. Murphy on my staff and consider him an
officer of the highest calibre.

(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
In my opinion, David Murphy has done an outstanding job
during the period covered by this report.
I arrived to take up my duties as DCM in this Embassy
in December 1971. However, since that time I have served
as Chargé on a number of occasions and while, when the
Ambassador was present, the Ambassador preferred to deal directly
with Mr. Murphy and, as a result I had only collateral dealings
with him, I feel I had more than ample opportunity to observe
his performance and evaluate it. I can say without hesitation
whatsoever that he performed in a superb manner during a
particularly difficult period. He deserves top marks not only
for his own performance but for the manner in which he directed
those operations here in France for which he has had the
responsibility.

1.
Long before Mr. Murphy departed for Paris in June
1968, he began preparing himself for this assignment as Chief
of Station by reading files, interviewing personnel, and
discussing cases. As a result, on arrival in Paris he was
already well oriented concerning the Station's problems and
had formulated plans for revitalizing it.
2. The entire year in Paris has of course been over-
shadowed by the Vietnam Peace Conference and a large proportion
of the Station's effort has perforce been devoted to supporting
the U.S. delegation. The Station has responded exceptionally
well to this demand though it has forced a slow-down in normal
Station activities.

3. A number of other events have also taken place in
France or concerning France which have forced the Station
during the past nine months to perform firemen's duty
May-June riots which extended into August, the dissolution
of the Assembly and re-election of deputies, the Czech crisis
beginning 21 August, the December monetary crisis, the Near
East crisis, continued student unrest, the President's trip
and currently the problems precipitated by DeGaulle's resig-
nation. All of these developments have been covered
amazingly well.
1. While the exceptional events enumerated above have
forced the Station to concentrate its efforts on the immediate
issues, Mr. Murphy nonetheless proceeded with the longer
range goals of the Station. He has worked at improving re-
lations with the French Services, personally becoming deeply

involved even in routine liaison activity. Consequently,
our relations during the past nine months with the French
have improved considerably. This improvement can partially
be attributed to a reawakening on the part of the French
Government to the Communist and New Left threat (which was
brought into focus by the May-June riots) but it was also
in large measure due to Mr. Murphy's concerted efforts to
cultivate selected officials, initiate substantive dis-
cussions and increase our own level of exchange with the
Services.
5. Operations against the Communist Party have been re-
activated with emphasis on the international aspects of the
Party, particularly support of subversion abroad. Operations
against the large Soviet and Chinese targets are beginning
to move ahead. Production-wise, the take from both unilateral
sources and liaison increased significantly during 1968. We
expect further increase in 1969.
6. There are still many weak spots in the Paris Station
and many refinements and adjustments to be made. But Mr.
Murphy has made an exceptional beginning; the Station is
moving in the right direction and during this coming fiscal
year we should begin to see the worth of the programs which
are being so energetically pursued by him. Without question,
his performance has been Outstanding.

COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METHODS
The COS Seminar is aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and
Deputy Chiefs Station and Chiefs of Base for field assignments.
Emphasis was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or
medium-sized installations, since they must handle a peculiarly
wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to
remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and
techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination,
management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of
the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large,
at home and abroad. .
The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods
conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, pro-
grams, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested read-
ing are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to
the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them,

(For the period ending 31 March 1965)
SUBJECT:
Mr. David E. Murphy
1. This report is the first full year report of Mr. Murphy's
performance as Chief of the SR Division.
2. Perhaps his greatest contribution during this past year has
been the energizing of the Division's several components with a
consequent very noticeable increase in the efforts of the Clandestine
Services as a whole against our Soviet targets. Mr. Murphy's
enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are as
a result profiting from his sound approach to the role and mission
of his Division. He has fully understood the fact that the SR Division
cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services
for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet
requirements, but must harness the interest and the energies of all
the area divisions. In this respect, Mr. Murphy is achieving nothing
short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also
improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field, while
his general administration of his Division from a managerial point of
view has continued to be excellent.
3. The overall evaluation of Mr. Murphy's performance during
this past year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors,
is outstanding. It is because of the quality of this performance that
favorable consideration has been given in principle to the gradual
investment of an increasing portion of the manpower assets of the
Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish-
ments to date justify confidence that these increases are being well
invested and will provide a maximum return,

1. This report covers the performance of Mr. Murphy
as Chief of the SR Division for the past year.
2. The past year has seen à measurable increase in the
work load of the SR Division, with no let up in the energetic efforts
of the Division to accomplish its mission. A sumber of new audio
operations have come into being and the support rendered the
Division by the other area divisions has been a reflection of the
success of Mr. Murphy's program to enlist the interest and the
energies of the other area divisions in attacking one of our principal
targets.
3.
Mr. Murphy has now assumed new responsibilities as
chief of a substantially enlarged division including the satellites
as well as the Soviet Union. This is a tribute to his own outstanding
management of his division as well as a recognition of the close
operational interrelationship between Soviet and satellite activities.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 31 March 1964)
SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy
1. Mr. Murphy relinquished his duties as Chief, Eastern
Europe Division in September 1963 and took over his present respon-
sibilities as Chief of the SR Division at that time. This report coverg
the period from 1 April 1963 to the present and thus includes comments
on his performance as Chief, EE Division and Chief, SR Division.
'
2. Mr. Murphy combines an extraordinary talent for this work
with a considerable and varied experience in it. His previous report
indicated that he was turning in an outstanding performance in dealing
with the affairs of the EE Division, and he continued this level of his
performance in the first six months covered by this report. A general
reorganization of senior officers in the Clandestine Services offered
the opportunity to put Mr. Murphy in charge of the division which he
had long aspired to direct and for which position he was eminently'
qualified, both linguistically and by field experience. He is showing
excellent results in refurbishing the Division and giving it new life
and impetus. His considerable energies enable him to give an out-
standing performance in managing and directing his Division's affairs
while at the same time engaging personally and most actively in a
number of very important Divisional cases. His competence includes
awareness of the need for keeping his costs down and getting the
maximum from his manpower. He is showing imagination and
initiative and is probably the best qualified and best prepared officer
ever to head the Division.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT:
i
David E. Murphy
27 May 1960
1. Murphy's performance since he became COB Berlin last sumer
must be almost a well known to Headquarters as it is to me. His projected
assignment as Deputy Chief EE, then the realliation that his continuation
in Berlin is essential, and later still his detail to the Paris conference
as the KUBARK referent on Berlin all recognize different aspects of his
remarkably high qualifications.
2.
•
As COB Berlin he is a worthy successor to William K. Harvey; he
is fully on top of the job. This was expected, but in addition he has
shown an astonishing virtuosity in the field of coordination, in which
his pioneering work has set a fine example for the rest of KUPARK overseas.
In a few months he learned more about the totality of American Intelligence
in Berlin than anyone would have supposed possible; then he used his knowl-
edge with great diplomatic skill to bring about one improvement after
another. The successful reform of the Marienfelde situation followed his
suggestions, with the whole community willingly cooperating once he had
demonstrated the advantages to be gained. He knows more of both the big
picture and the small details of Army operations than the Army's own local
commander (to say nothing of all higher ecnelons) and with this knowledge
has already Improved the Army's product, for example in providing detailed
briefs which the Army system is not geared to supply. His grasp of the
whole subject, his ability either to generalize usefully or to go into deep
ge
detail as appropriate, his speed and thoroughness in attacking the many
problems are all demonstrated in the series of brilliant memorania anten
have come from him for many months. In addition I have several tizes
witnessed his tapressive skill in negotiation, in bilateral alscussion with
one or other geliengue In Barlin, in meetings of the ICCH, in presentations
before the RX, and in particularly delicate dealings with Maj, General
Van Natta. It is quite clear that he has son the ungrudging respect of the
whole community as the lealer of American Intelligence in Berlin.

Fitness Report - Mr. David E. Murphy

1. This memorandum is in lieu of the Fitness Report Form
on Mr. Murphy and covers the period from 1 April 1962 through
31 March 1963, during which Mr. Murphy has served as Chief
of the Eastern Europe Division.
2. After a long series of assignments dating from April 1948
and involving duty at Tokyo, Yokosuka, Karlsruhe and Berlin where
he served as Chief of Base of that important installation, Mr.
Murphy returned to Headquarters in August 1961 as Deputy Chief
of the EE Division and became Chief of that Division in June 1962.
I should like to quote from the fitness report on Mr. Murphy written
at the time he was assuming his new responsibilities as Chief of
EE Division: "There is every reason to believe that Mr. Murphy
will manage the EE Division in the same outstanding manner with
which he won the ungrudging respect of the Berlin community as
the leader of American intelligence in that area." A previous
fitness report covering his first year as Chief of Base, Berlin
is equally laudatory.
3. In his responsibility for streamlining and improving the
effectiveness of his Division in both its headquarters and overseas.
postures, Mr. Murphy has been energetic and imaginative. He is
an authority on the situation in West Germany but particularly in
Berlin and has played a highly useful role in government councils
on these problems. He has excellent working knowledge of Russian,
French and German, and his operational experience as a result

Since the submission of the last Fitness Report, concerning
; his performance has consistently continued at the
same outstanding level of competence and effectiveness. During this
period, in anticipation of um assuming duties as Chief of Base
at the end of August 1959, I have in increasing measure delegated
responsibility to him and he has been fully involved in all major
phases of the operational direction of the Base. During the entire
month of July he was Acting Chief of Base. During this period his
performance was outstanding and he directed the operations of BOB
in a fully effective, well organized and thoroughly competent manner.
I have nothing further to add concerning great abilities
and fine performance which are fully covered by the detailed comments
in his last two Fitness Reports and in the promotion recommendation
dated 28 September 1956 on the basis of which he was promoted from
grade GS-15 to grade 03-16.

period, in anticipation of assuming dution as Chief of Ease
at the end of August 1959, I have in increasing measure delegated
responsibility to him and he has been fully involved in ali major
phases of the operational direction of the Hane. During the entire
month of July he was Acting Chief of Base. During thin period hia
performance was outstanding and ha directed the operations of DQD

years he has been assigned to BOB. These abilities, plus his unusual
language capabilities and his broad and detailed area knowledge, make
Subject, in my opinion, one of the most valuable, versatile and
effective officers in
The only weaknesses I have noted in
Subject during the almost four years that I have been completely and
Intimately familiar with his work on a daily basis, are a tendency at
times to be too impatient with other officers particularly those who
do not begin to measure up to his very high standards of performance,
and an occasional tendency to be somewhat undiplomatic in his handling
of personnel. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that neither
of these factors are of sufficient importance or weight to, in any
material way, decrease the effectiveness of Subject's consistently fine
performance and are, in my opinion, merely the inevitable corollary of
Subject's great drive and intense dedication to his profession. It
also should be pointed out that while Subject is an exacting supervisor,
he is never unreasonable nor in any sense dictatorial, and he has demon-
strated the capacity of quickly developing and retaining the full
loyalty, cooperation and respect of the officers with whom he works.
It is, I think, significant also that the respect which other officers
hold for Subject increases in direct proportion to the level of pro-
fessional competence and experience which these officers attain.
In assessing Subject's performance and capabilities, it should be
pointed out that he has been officially recommended for promotion
from grade GS-15 to grade G3-16 and that he has been officially recom-
mended to succeed the present incumbent as Chief of Base, BOB. Further
comments concerning Subject in this connection are contained in
EGBT-1003 dated 28 September 1958, the covering dispatch to this
Pitness Report which should be read in conjunction therewith.

Mr. David E. Murphy
Service in the Clandestine Services
Records Committee
1. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you
for your service as a member of the CS Records Committee.
The contributions which you have made to our deliberations
have been of considerable assistance to me and to the CS
records program..
2. I believe that effective records and information
systems are vital to the success of an intelligence organi-
zation and that the Records Committee plays an extremely
important role in ensuring that these systems are consonant
with more pressing and dramatic operational and policy
requirements. The advice, assistance and participation
of yourself and other senior officials have enabled us
to meet our obligations and make steady improvement in
this area. I hope I may continue to count on your sugges-
tions, initiative and advice in this area in the future.

erational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations
of this organization.
4. Salary and allowances paid by your cover fatty shall be re-
tained by you to the extent that they do not exceed the salary and allow-
ance payment due you on the basis of your grade level with this organiza-
tion. If such cover payments are less than the amount the you, the dif-

problem, any grade promotion received from a cover facility will be re-
ported immediately by you to this organization's payroll office through

ings statements.

ticipant as an employee of this organisation. Salary

1. I would like to take this opportunity, upon the eve of my departure
from Berlin, to thank you for the asbistance you have given to me.
2. Your constant cooperation with reembers of my staff and with the
other units in this Command has been particularly appreciated. Your
advice, which I know was based on intimate knowledge of the intricate
problems pecuifer to Berlin as well as on your thorough professional
competents, was most valuable in developing plans and polities for this
headquarters. In addition, the valuable and timely information provided
by you has contributed to an important degree to the security of this city.
I am certain that my successor will continue to benefit greatly from your
assistance,
3. I wish you continued success in your assignment and sincerely hope
that someday we will once again have the pleasure of working together.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation
TO:
Mr. William Harvey
4 June 1959
7971 USARSG
APO 742, US Forces
1. As the Commanding Officer of this unit, it gives me particular
pleasure to extend my appreciation to Mr. David Murphy and Mr.
Liebenau for the able and extremely valuable assistance which they
rendered to an operation of this unit on 24 May 1959.
2. Mr. Murphy, when informed on Sunday 24 May that some
assistance was needed by this unit, despite the short notice, whole-
heartedly and unstintingly rendered advice and logistical support.
Because of unforeseen circumstances, certain support was lacking
for a particular operation, and Mr. Murphy immediately proferred
the necessary aid. In discussing the various phases of the operation,
Mr. Murphy was good enough to share his rich experience with repre-
sentatives of this unit and thus facilitate implementation of the project,
3. Mr. Liebenau's consideration, tact and concern over the
security and success of the operation merit praise. Despite the short
time allocated to Mr. Liebenau's phase in the operation, he consistently
deferred to the wishes of the members of this unit, recognizing that
security of the operation was paramount.
4. Such cooperation and spirit of friendliness as exhibited both
by Mr. Murphy and Mr. Liebenau are a very welcome new page in the
relationship between this unit and your organization. It is a significant
step toward the type of coordination and cooperation which will in the
last analysis benefit the intelligence community to the detriment of the
opposition.

November 15, 1974
The Honorable Henry A. Kissinger
The Secretary of State
Department of State
Washington, D.C. 20520
Dear Mr. Secretary:
-
It is with regret that I find it necessary to
submit my resignation from the Foreign Service Reserve
to be effective November 23, 1974.
My duties with the Department of State have been
a source of great interest and pleasure to me, and
I look forward to the possibility of further service
with the Department should circumstances permit my
consideration for employment in the future.
