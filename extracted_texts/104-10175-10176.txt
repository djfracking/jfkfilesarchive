Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. 8. J. Papich
Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECTS Lyle STUART
Reference is made to your memorandum dated 1 June 1904,
in which you provided this office with several questions you
wished to have passed to Hiss Viola June COBB regarding
Lyle STUART. There follows the information provided by
ancour to your inquiry:
1.
& an
Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose AREVALO, and
Antikomunismo eu America Latina:
Early in the spring of 1962, in Mexico, AREVALO told
me that STUART was prodding him about getting another of his
books translated, to take advantage of the publicity around
I was already far beyond
The Shark and the Sardines
speaking terms with SI AT and therefore declined to have
About three months later,
anything further to do with him.
AREVALO told me that STUART was going to publish
Antikomunismo en America Latios. and that a young American
student, married to a Bexican, Angela delli SANTE ARROCHA
(who had written Arevalo, pensador contemporaneo, published
by Costs Amic, 1982, financed by Als Radical Revolucionario
de El Salvador) was doing the translation into English.
Early in 1963, ARIVALO told me that the translation hadn't
been satisfactory and therefore STUAKT had obtained a re-
translation, by Charleton DEALS.
When STUART was here in Mexico in June, he told
Dr. OSTGUEDA that he was very happy about the way the book
was selling.
Inasmuch as STUART has paid AREVALO only 10 per cent
of moneya received by STUART on the Shark and the Sardines
gales (in contract with some book contracts in which the author
receives 10 per cent of the money represented by number of
copies sold multiplied by the retail sales price) I would
assume he is no more generous with Antikomunismo

AND
I have discussed with Paul Burke, DC/CI/ICG, Mexico's request for
amendment of OA to use LICOCKY-1 against the Soviet official. We both
are of the opinion that she can be used for development of the target to.
determine his susceptibility to recruitment, but that she should not be
‘used to make the actual recluitment should the matter develop to that
point, due to these considerations: (1) She is not a recruiter, never
has made a recruitment. (2) Odds are she would be blown to the Soviets,
since we must consider that the odds for successful recruitment of a
Soviet official are not favorable. (3) Her relationship with LILUCK
in Mexico is fairly well known, so that there could be an unfavorable
blow back on LINLUCK.
In authorizing her use in the developmental role, Burke would
like for Station to be informed that it should tell LINLUCK that Sta-
tion's continuing investigation of LICCO-1 discloses her association
with Soviets; therefore, he should be very careful in his relationship
with her.

:
1. Forvarded herewith in' a progress report for Project LIHUCK for
the period spesified. This report was prepared by Leo C. HEDLICH, the
outside case office.
2. LINUXK/1 has provided information for operational purposes on
a number of subjects and/or individuals in which the Station has an in-
terest or some sort of requirement from others (1.8., Mario Monteforte
:).
Rabu, 2 sea of papers fell of Major Alics Pre
Sierra, one of Yen Sosa's followers, at the time of their Guatemala re-
voll effort in 1902. Lee E. MILECHZADIE has ¿one through the papers and
has had about 170 frames ads. The negatives will be forwarded to Head-
quarters.
_
3. The affair between LIHLICE/1 and LICOOXY/1 is, temporarily a:
least, suspended. Undoubtedly, the return of LIMLUCK/1's wife had a good
dcal to do with this plus the rest that pressure was being put on the two
principals by the Station. Whether this separation can be maintained per-
manently is difficult to say, but LIMECK/1 has been put on notice that
he is goin to be subject to penalty is it ion's. Outside of that, LIN.
LACK/1 has been quite responsive to any requirements imposed on him; on
the other hand, he has not been reporting on his personal situation and
contacts as fully as he should. This will shape up however.

Communism in Latin America, written by Juan Jose Arevalo, former
President of Guatemala. The nature and extent of subject's relationship
with Arevalo is therefore pertinent to our investigation.

As you know, Viola June Cobb, known to your agency, personally
knows Arevalo and worked with him on the translation of his book, "The
Shark and the Sardine.” It is therefore possible that Cobb may be in
a position to furnish some information which can be of assistance to
this Bureau. We would appreciate if your agency would interview Cobb
and endeavor to obtain answers to the following:
(1) What information does she have concerning the relation-
ship between the subject and Arevalo regarding the book, "anti-Cuasumine
in Latin America"?
(2) Does she have any information indicating that subject
is in any way affiliated with foreign political parties or governments?
(3) Does she know of any contractual agreement existing
between subject and Arevalo or between subject and any other foreign
principals?

Does she know of anyone else who may be in a position
to furnish information concerning subject?

In the event that Cobb is in a position to furnish infor-

she would be willing to testify in court.

with STUART, even managed to get the BONTEFORTE Toledos to
invite STUART to dinner at their apartment. There were
tentative discussions of collaborating in the distribution of
COSTA Amic books in the United States and of publishing
some book of MONTEFORTE Toledo's.
However, both COSTA Amic and the NOWPKFORTE Toledos
told me that they found STUART offensively vulgar and were not
at all enthusiastic about having anything to do with him.
Two weeks ago, OSIGULDA sketched the outline of a
book (contemporary history of U.S. and Latin American relations)
he hopes STUART will want to publish, and sent the outline
up to him.

1. On 29 May ODENVY asked KUDESK whether KUBARK had a
current interest in LICOOKY as they had questions concerning Juan
Jose AREVALO and Lyle STUAET which they wanted passed to her.
If we had no current contact they wanted to know whether we
had any idea of her present whereabouts.
2. KUBARK orally told ODENVY that we formerly utilized her.
as a sub-source and we believed we could reestablish contact with
her in order to pass to her the ODENVY questions. ODENVY was told
that she was in Mexico.
3.
ODENVY subsequently furnished the attached list of
questions. It is requested that the Station pass this list to
LICOOKY-1 and obtain from her, answers to be forwarded to
Headquarters for passing to ODENVY. The Station is asked to
comment on whether her testimony in court might be prejudicial
to any KUBARK operations, or whether the Station can see no
objection to such a court appearance.

LYLE STUART
AREVALO
“AFTIKOMUNISMO EN AMERICA LATIKA"
Early in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arévalo told me that Stuart
was prodding him about getting another of his books translated, to take ad-

far beyond speaking terms with Stuart and therefore declined to have anything
further to do with him. About three months later, Arévalo told me that Start
was going to publish "Antikomunismo en America Latina" and that a young American
student, married to a Mexican, Angela delli Sante Arrocha (who had written
"Arevalo, Fensador Contemporaneo")* was doing the translation into English.
Early in 1963, Arévalo told me that the translation hadn't been satisfactory
and therefore Stuart had obtained a re-translation, by Charleton Beals.

When Stuart was here in Mexico in June, be told Dr. Osequeda that he was
very happy about the way the book was selling.
Inasmuch as Stuart has paid Arévalo only 10 percent of moneys received by
Stuart on "The Shark and the Sardines" sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in which the author receives 10 percent of the money represented by
number of copies sold multiplied by the retail sales price) I would, assume he
is no more generous with "Antikomunismo". I can ask Dr. Osegueda the exact
terms, but I haven't been able to see Osegueda this week.

Dr. Osegueda apparently has had a secret longing to get something of his
own printed in English. He seized upon the opportunity of commenting Deals'
introduction to "Antikomunismo" in order to write to Stuart this spring.
wrote very cordially back to Osegueda, hoping to meet him on a trip to Mexico
in June. When Osegueda confessed to me his correspondence with Stuart, he
sought to make me see it as an attempt to speak with Stuart about the royalties
Stuart has never paid me.
When Osegueda finally did see Stuart here during the book congress in June,
he only very timidly and very, very briefly touched upon the royalty problem, and
indeed went to a great deal of trouble to serve Stuart by introducing him to

However, both Costa Amica and the Monteforte Toledos told me that they
found Stuart offensively vulgar and were not at all enthusiastic about having
anything to do with him.
Two weeks ago, Osegueda sketched the outline of a book (contemporary history
of U.S. and Latin American relations) he hopes Stuart will want to publish, and
sent the outline up to him.
