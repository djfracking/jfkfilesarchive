1. Adolph Jay ALBRECHT, born 15 June 1926 in New Jersey, is
an industrial advertising copywriter currently residing in
Stockholm, Sweden. The holder of U.S. passport No. D 294080,
issued 18 April 1963 at New York City, Subject served with the
United States Navy from about 1947 to 1955, on active duty forw
only two weeks, however. As of November 1963 Subject said he
was employed by the Andersson and Lembke Advertising Agency
Luntmakargaten 95, Stockholm.
2, On 29 November 1963 Subject, of his own volition,
visited the American Embassy in Stockholm and asked to speak
with the embassy "security officer." He was interviewed by a
EXP
BEC 15 1964
representative of this Agency (5) Subject said that a former Swed
girlfriend, Charlotte ABERG (Swedish citizen, born ca. 1943
told him that Karl-Erik RIDDERSTRALE (Swedish citizen, born
24 September 1922), while drunk on 15 November 1963, predicted
that within two weeks President KENNEDY would be assassinated
while on a trip among his own people. Following the assassination
Charlotte was upset and called ALBRECHT on 27 November 1963 to
inform him of RIDDERSTRALE's statement made while he was visiting
Charlotte and her mother on 15 November. Charlotte described
RIDDERSTRALE as normally quiet and refined and one of her
mother's suitors. According to Subject, RIDDERSTRALE, though
wealthy and a member of Swedish nobility, is a left winger and
strong supporter of Fidel CASTRO.

Through Subject, arrangements were made for Charlotte
ABERG to be interviewed at the American Embassy on 4 December 1963.
Charlotte related substantially the same story as did Subject,
with minor contradictions. She said RIDDERSTRALE's comments_
were made about ten days before the assassination and that he
had not given a two-week deadline%3B he merely said, "soon." 4
She said she knew nothing about RIDDERSTRALE's background.
Charlotte was advised to report the foregoing to Swedish
authorities. Following an interview with Swedish police officials,
Charlotte returned to the American Embassy on 9 December 1963.
