She arrived in Havana a few hours
after Castro left town. Americans were
still welcome there in those days, and
Cuban castoms officers seldom searched
tourists' luggage.

recommended to the CIA that it try to
prevent prosecution, but Roselli was
convicted of violating interstate gam-
bling laws. He went to jail, returning
in 1974 to Plantation to do battle
against government efforts to deport
him.
In 1971 the CIA asked the Immigra-
tion and Naturalization Service to
"forestall public disclosure of Roselli's
past operational activity with the CIA"
that might occur if deportation pro-
ceedings were pursued. The INS
agreed to keep the CIA informed, but

day: 'Jesus, what's Maheu thinking?'
said another of Roselli's brothers-in-
law, Peter Cardillo of New Jersey.
The public doesn't know what Ma-
heu is thinking, whether he worries if
pro-Castro Cubans are exacting retri-
bution for sins of 16 years ago. Maheu's
secretary in Las Vegas says she doesn't
know where her boss is or when he'll
be returning to his office. He report-
edly has some business interest in
Egypt, a part of the world that seems
to hold some fascination for the Castro
plotters; Giancana kept an apartment
in Beirut and, just before his death,
told a friend he had some sort of deal
brewing there. And Roselli longingly
eyed the opening of gambling casinos
in the land of the new oil millionaires.
In Tampa, Santos Trafficante, an-
other of the original Maheu group, also
refuses to talk with the press. But un
like the others, he did not testify be-
fore the Church committee so the pub-
lic has no inkling of his thoughts on
the Castro assassination attempts.
Whether Roselli's killing was one of
retribution for a public or a private
matter, Johnny Roselli was a testa-
ment to an era that has passed. His life,
which would have remained largely
unnoticed save for the Senate's CIA
hearings, seemed straight from the
pages of a Mafia novel: allegedly
brought into the United States illegally
at the turn of the century, Roselli
clawed his way from the mean streets
of Boston and Chicago to the relative
glamor of Hollywood, Las Vegas and,
finally, Miami. Along the way, a simple
strain of patriotism-which impressed
the CIA enough to mention it to the
Church committee-put him in a rope-
dancer's position of sometimes receiv-
ing, sometimes taking advantage of his
knowledge of the darkest side of gov-
ernment.
While some have speculated that he
was killed for talking too much to gov-
ernment investigators, Roselli was
hardly a loudmouth in the league of a
Joe Valachi, who sang for televised
Senate hearings on the Mafia in 1963.
Fourteen years ago Roselli confided in
his lawyer, Washington attorney Ed-
ward Morgan, that he had been told by
Cuban sources in Miami that John
Kennedy's killing was ordered and ar-
ranged by Castro, but he lived with his
secret.
The day after Roselli's body was
scooped from its crude coffin, his
brother-in-law in New Jersey, Peter
Cardillo, told me: "Down deep, in a
way, I probably hope it was connected
with (the Castro affair). At least then
Johnny, he would have died for a
cause.

Roselli Probe
By RON LaBRECQUE
Sen. Gary Hart (D., Colo.) made an unannounced trip to
Miami Friday for a private meeting with homicide detectives to
underscore the strong interest of the Senate Select Intelligence
Committee in the John Roselli murder investigation and to insure
that federal agencies cooperate with local police.
The FBI was ordered into the case last week by Attorney
General Edward Levi after pressure from the Senate committee.
"We're not here to solve the crime, Hart said, "we want to
find out if there is any connection between (Roselli's) death and
* his testimony before the Committee.

ROSSELLI CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS
1955
1960
Meets Maheu at insurance friend's home.
Late July/early August. Maheu calls. Working for government. Recruit
Rosselli only. Meet Brown Derby, L.A., for lunch. Long talk about
project in Cuba. Rosselli wants verification.
2nd meeting, L.A., discuss further details, no discussion of specific
techniques. Plan to meet in N.Y. for verification.
Sept. 14, 1960. First meeting in N.Y. at old Plaza Hotel. Rosselli
introduced by Maheu to O'Connell. Rosselli "knew" O'Connell worked
for the CIA. Rosselli agrees to work on Cuban project.
Sept. 25, 1960. Maheu and Rosselli travel to Miami to begin making
contact with Cubans to be recruited for mission.
(Between Sept. 25 and the Bay of Pigs, a series of recruitments, meetings,
and arrangements were made. The following is an outline of events that
is not necessarily in chronological order.)
Meeting
Meeting where Maheu is introduced to Trafficant❤.
where Maheu is introduced to Giancana. Giancana was, according
to Rosselli, to only be a "back up man." Rosselli states
Giancana had nothing to do with the actual operation. Trafficant❤
was used, according to Rosselli, as a translator.
Meeting with O'Connell, Maheu, Rosselli, and two Admirals
discuss the Cuban project.
Rosselli, in his contact with the Cubans, "invents" the cover
story that he represents some Wall Street business interests who
want to see Castro eliminated. Rosselli trusts Cubans he has
recruited because they are part of the Bay of Pigs operation.
1st attempt at assassination involved the use of pills. Maheu
and Rosselli met with Cuban #1 and #2 (?). Maheu opened up his
briefcase and gave the pills with instructions for their use to
Cuban #1. Maheu also had $10,000 he gave the Cubans for doing
the project. Rosselli did not know of the money. Rosselli states
he received no remuneration for his work on the project, in fact,
he paid out $800 for gas for a speed boat to deliver two or three
man parties for guerrilla raids into Cuba.
Prior to Bay of Pigs there was no discussion of using guns to
assassinate Castro.
Rosselli's cover name was "John Ralston."

August 13, 1976
I recently discussed with Agent Richard Taylor of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation my recollections of pre-
testimony interviews with Mr. John Rosselli prior to Rosselli
testifying under oath in June of 1975. It is my recollection
that there were several meetings between myself as counsel for
the Committee, and Rosselli and his attorneys Rosselli and his
attorneys expressed on numerous occasions fear for the well-being
of Rossellik They insisted and the Committee agreed that
would conduct interviews prior to the sworn testimony at
location away from the Senate so as to avoid any publicity
During these interviews Rosselli on more than one occasion
stated that he was taking a great risk in testifying. He was
worried about retaliation and particularly worried about his
relatives with whom he was living in Florida al cannot recall
Rosselli specifying exactly who he want most afraid of but he
declined to testify about Glancana (until after Giancana
refused to identify any of the Cubana who were involved in
assassination plots, and was reluctant to mention Santos
Trafficante by name In fact, I cannot recall Rosselli ever
mentioning Trafficante by name and only very vaguely responding
to questions if the questioner used the name Trafficante.

At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different
projects. These would range from using plastic explosives to
booby trapping Castro's desk. Rosselli would relay these on
to Maheu, who, in turn, would contact the CIA. Most projects
were vetoed, but the CIA did supply a short wave radio to the
Cubans in Florida, to try and make contact with their people
in Havana.
Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no
specific point when it was announced. But, at sometime Rosselli
assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.

I spoke with Senator Hart today about setting up interviews
in Miami for Friday, August 20, in the Rossell matter. He will
be calling you about these arrangements
I will try to have a subpoena for Santos trafficante signed
by Senator Baker before leapes for the convention.
We how-

members of the Committee (under the Rules) to issue the subpoena
Therefore, I have asked Martha to poll members on two questions:
(1) Authority to is

Who Killed John Roselli?
a
E'RE GOING TO tell you a little story now.
Once there was a President who was murdered.
His brother was murdered too. A long time after they
died some very strange facts came to light. It turned
out that while they were running the government,
the government was trying to get two Mafia mobsters
to arrange the murder of someone else—the head of
a small, hostile neighbor state. It also turned out that
one brother-the one who was President-appar-
ently had a girlfriend who was the girlfriend as well
of the mobsters. And one of the mobsters, whose
nickname was Momo, was prominent on the list of
criminals the President's brother was trying to put in
jail. The story may sound complicated, but life is com-
plicated, and the complications in this case got even
more so. For when a committee of the Congress
wanted the two mobsters to come and tell them some-
thing about all this, only one of them-the one
named Johnny- came. The other one, Momo, was
murdered in his house a week before they wanted
him to testify. Johnny, however, told his story to one
committee in the Congress and then came back―qui-
etly to tell some more things to another committee
which was in fact looking into the murder of the
President. Then Johnny went to Florida. Then no one.
could find him. Then some fishermen found him.
Dead. In an oil drum.
But we haven't told you the strangest part of all
yet, the part you're really not going to believe. It is
that when the great national political community of
solons, scribes, policemen, spies and managers of the
general wellbeing heard about poor Johnny, they
said: "Oh, my goodness." Some of them went farther,
of course. They said: "Fancy that!" But most of them
didn't say anything at all except: "Yawn."
Forgive us for lapsing into storybookese. We do it
for a reason which is that the simple unadorned facts
of the John and Robert Kennedy-Fidel Castro-CIA-
Mafia-Momo Giancana-Johnny Roselli-Judith Exner-
Church Committee-Schweiker Committee saga need
to be put forward in stark outline for their magni-
tude to be understood. Is it really, as the sophisticated
wisdom goes, “paranoid" on our part to brood about
the suggestive and possibly monstrous interconnec-
tions between all these facts and to wonder why they
are not the object of intense press and government
scrutiny? What accounts for the general indifference
in high places? What accounts for the eagerness with
which we all seem to accept that familiar tipoff that
we shall be hearing no more about the latest crime-
i.e., the pronouncement that Mr. Roselli's dispatch to
an oil drum and Beyond had "all the earmarks of a
gangland slaying." Those are the good old "ear-
marks" we only hear about when it is next to certain,
that we shall hear nothing more.
'
The supposition of course is that the Gang which
runs gangland has its reasons and its methods and
that, disagreeable as these may be, they really lie out-
side the proper realm of public concern because they
E
amount to a system of justice which 1) only affects
those dumb enough to get involved in it in the first
place and 2) tends only to punish those who have
committed what the rest of us would regard as hei-
nous crimes anyway. Not that these are things people
say-they're things people can be expected to as-
sume. But we think in this case the assumptions have
even less validity than they would have on a clear
day, which isn't much. And that is because if we
know anything, we know that the Mafia operations in
which Messers. Giancana and Roselli figured had be-
come intertwined with the operations of the United
States government. Never mind that the decisions of
the early 1960s which made this so may rank among
the most abominable decisions ever taken in the U.S.
government. The plain fact is that, given the provoca-
tive and suggestive history of the two men, it is not
possible for either Congress or the Executive Branch
to look the other way or to complaisantly accept the
earmarks-of-a-gangland-slaying bromide.
5
After Mr. Giancana was killed, the Church Commit-
tee inquired of the FBI whether its proposed meeting
with him had figured in his murder. The FBI re-
ported that it had no evidence to this effect. The
then-director of the CIA, William Colby, felt obliged
to state that the CIA had had nothing to do with the
murder and Mr. Colby likewise pronounced the
other day that he was certain the CIA had not done in
Mr. Roselli. The mere fact that the questions, to
which these were meant to be the answers, had been
raised tells us, anyway, that much more in the way of
inquiry is wanted. The newly formed Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence has now asked the Justice
Department to make an investigation of Mr. Roselli's
death. We think the Department should comply and
that the investigation, despite FBI Director Clarence
Kelley's disclaimer of jurisdiction, should have the
Attorney General's personal attention. Such atten-
tion is needed because of the elaborate and not en-
tirely reassuring history of relationships between the
FBI and the CIA and the various participants in the
whole sorry saga. We are not suggesting that any
agency of government-or even any of those agen-
cy's fringe retainers were the murderers. We are
suggesting that there is an overlay of potentially em-
barrassing information sufficiently pervasive to keep
• an awful lot of people from wanting to have this
thing aired. We also think that the Select Committee
should reserve the right to pursue the matter. Con-
gress, after all, can hardly be expected to sit idly by
while its witnesses are being done in. Nor do we see
how the public in general and the political establish-
ment in particular can turn their attention away un-
til we are all satisfied that a much greater effort has
been made by the government-which means both
the Executive Branch and the Congress-to discover
what elements were at play in this series of appalling
crimes and scandals.

1961
After the Bay of Pigs (April 1961)
Rosselli felt "sorry for the poor bastards left on the
beach." Rosselli felt indirectly responsible for their
deaths since he had encouraged many of them to partici.
pate in the invasion Two or three weeks after the
invasion, Rosselli was contacted in Los Angeles by
O'Connell, a meeting was arranged for at the airport
hotel in Miami. Rosselli went there and was introduced
to Harvey! O'Connell said Harvey was now in charge of
the Cuban project. Harvey told Rosselli he was to cease
all contact with Maheu and Giancana. Further, Harvey
stated that the government was still interested in using
Rosselli for intelligence-gathering operations. Rosselli
would report information from the Cubans to Harvey about
personalities and events in Cuba. Rosselli would also
relay on to his Cuban contacts requests for specific in-
formation from the CIA.
Sometime between the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban
missile crisis, Harvey gave Rosselli six poison capsules.
Rosselli, in turn, gave them to his Cuban contacts who
were to take them to Cuba, where another Cuban or Cubans
would use them to assassinate Castro. Rosselli never
learned the details of what happened, but the project ob-
viously failed. At one point, Rosselli remembers hearing
over the radio that Castro was very ill! A short time
later, he recovered.
Sometime before the missile crisis, Rosselli arranged,
pursuant to Cuban #1 request, for a van loaded with rifles
and ammunition to be delivered in Florida. O'Connell and
Rosselli watched the Cuban contact pick up the van and
return it empty. Rosselli assumed that these guns were
going to be used by the two or three-man raiding parties
in Cuba to assassinate Castro and overthrow the government.

Hi!
During the Cuban missile crisis, Rosselli was in Chicago.
He contacted Harvey at Harvey's mother's home in Indian-
apolis and left his number in Chicago. Harvey then called
him, told him to go to Washington, D.C. From Washington,
D.C., Rosselli traveled to Florida where he stayed for
the duration of the Cuban missile crisis. He, at times,
would, through his Cuban contacts, attempt to verify the
location of the Russian missiles in Cuba. Rosselli claimed
that this had been successful. After the Cuban missile
crisis, Harvey called Rosselli and told him to stop all
contacts with any and all persons involved in past Cuban
missions. Harvey never stated why the missions were being
called off.

Rowan Tap
Rosselli said that he understood that Giancana had
asked Maheu for a tap on Dan Rowan.
Maheu gave
Rosselli two stories. The first was that he was
doing Giancana a favor and the second was that there
was a real intelligence value in that Maheu was
afraid that Giancana or Rowan might be giving out
intelligence information that would be of value to
enemies of the United States. Rosselli had not heard
of the names Dubois or Belotti or Fred Harrison. He
admitted that Harvey had discussed the tap with him,
but both Harvey and Rosselli were mad that the opera-
tion had gone on. Giancana obviously knew about the
tap. Maheu did ask Rosselli to get bail money for
the two tappers who were caught and thrown in jail.
Maheu suggested that Rosselli could get a hotel to
turn over the bail money. Finally, Rosselli arranged
to have a man with a green carnation in his lapel
meet and transfer the bail money. He never received
any of this money back. Rosselli claims that he did
not know what type of tap went on. He admitted that
he had been questioned by the FBI but he gave no
answers. Rosselli knew that Maheu had been questioned
by the FBI.

P.S. A couple of grizzly facts:
Over the past few years
there have been quite a few anti-Castro deaths in the
Miami area Car bombs and shootings have been the usual
means of death. Second, we received a report today that
another body was pulled up in the Hudson River. Another

First, some background information.
Yesterday,
August 9, Senators Inouye and Baker met with Directors
Kelley and Bush to discuss Roselli's death. The FBI
doesn't want to touch this with a ten-foot pole. At the
meeting, Jim Adams told Inouye and Baker that the FBI had
been told by Justice (Richard Thornburg) that it had no
jurisdiction in this case. Levi had, apparently, not been
consulted. Senators Baker and Inouye (especially Baker)
requested Kelley to take this up directly with Levi. Today,
a letter was sent to Levi, signed by Baker and Inouye, urg-
ing Justice to authorize FBI involvement.

George Bush was
extremely upset about this case and the allegations that
the CIA was involved in Roselli's death. He said that he
would personally contact Levi to request that the Depart-
ment grant jurisdiction to the FBI to investigate.

Committee on four separate occasions to testify on three

The second meeting occurred a week or ten days later. At this point,
Rosselli was instructed to proceed to New York for an introduction to the
government official. He At both the first and second meetings asked for an
hour or more and various aspects of the proposed prof projects, were discussed
but nothing was mentioned of specific techniques.
Rosallisen went to NYC.
coinciding
Rosselli remembered his arrival in New York: giting with a visit N by
[Khrushchev] Eisenhower, Castro, Nasser, and perhaps Krushev. He said it was noteworthy
because New York was crawling with officials from all over the world. Rosselli
paid his own fare from Los Angeles to New York and stayed at the old Plaza Hotel
on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. He was given the cover name John Ralston.
11:
?
The meeting in New York took place in a hotel room. In attendance were
Maheu, Rosselli and "big" Jim O'Connell, and two or three other people who
did not explain why they were there. Jim O'Connell was introduced as a CIA
official. Rosselli was unclear as to whether this was stated explicitly or
whether through the whole context of discussions it became clear that he worked
for the CIA. At this point, Rosselli was satisfied that Maheu was working for
the government and, therefore, agreed to work the Cuban mission described at
their first meeting. Rosselli was not sure as to the length of his stay in New
York at this time. He did remember going to lunch with Maheu a number of times
and talking about the particular projects.
After his stay in New York, he traveled to either Washington, D. C. or
Florida. He was uncertain as to the exact location but he did remember there
were series of meetings between himself and Maheu to discuss further plans
about the attempted assassination. There was only one further meeting with
O'Connell, involving these preliminary stages. At this point, he only discussed
techniques of assassination with Maheu. Rosselli remembered staying in Maheu's
Falls Church home it had a tennis court) during his stays in Washington.
There still had been no discussion of the cover story (that Rosselli was a
private citizen representing a group of private businessmen from k New York.)
①sta
??
When Rosselli reached Florida, he made his contacts with the Cubans and
then arranged for the Cuban's to meet with Maheu. He trusted the Cubans he came
in contact with because they, according to themselves, were working on the Bay of
Pigs operation, which had not occurred as of yet. There were times when they would
stay at Arthur Godfrey's hotel the Kenilworth Hotel, in Florida. At times he
registered under the name Rollins. This was to allow him to maintain his cover
while Maheu, still working for Hughes, was able to register under his own name,
so that Hughes believed that he was doing his work. The operation went on in
terms of Rosselli arranging meetings with his Cuban contacts and then having
further discussions about specifics with Maheu. At times; O'Connell, from
the CIA, would visit with Maheu and Rosselli. One time, before the 1960 election,
O'Connell brought with him two Admirals, one of whom, Rosselli thinks, was retired.
with
At this point, Rosselli also was telling his Cuban contacts the cover story,
namely that he represented private business interests in New York who were interested
in seeing Castro done away with. The Cubans, at this point, had not met withJim
O'Connell, but had met with Maheu. Immediately after the Bay of Pigs, Maheu
left and Rosselli only met once more with O'Connell. Then he also left for the West
Coast. The
The two attempts at assassination, both involved the use of pills. One attempt
was before the Bay of Pigs and the other was sometime after. The first means was to
use a capsule filled with a special poison that could be spilled into the food of
Castro and cause him to die of poisoning that was not traceable and made his death

SUBJECT:
SUMMARY OF A MEEETING WITH MR. JOHN ROSSELLI
BEGAN AT 111:35 a.m., JUNE 21, 1975, IN ROOM 711 of the WATERGATE HOTEL
19
PRESENT AT THE SESSION: MR. MICHAEL MADIGAN, MR. PATRICK SHEA OF THE SELECT
COMMITTEE STAFF, MR. ROSSELLI, MR. THOMAS WADDEN, MR. JAMES CANTILLON, MR. LESLIE
SCHERR.
At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Madigan asked Mr. Rosselli if he felt
a need for any protection. He stated; emphatically, "No," that he was able to
take care of himself Mr. Madigan made it clear that the Senate Select Committee
could provide U/S/ Marshalls for Mr. Rosselli during his stay in Washington.
This offer was rejected.
Mr. Rosselli stated that Giancanna had no involvement, to his knowledge,
with any of the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro. Maheu did deal with
higher authorities in government but stated that Rosselli was only the contact,
Giancana has a backup man. Rosselli was very concerned about the adverse
publicity in recent times, about the CIA and he thought it was unfortunate from
the Agency's point of view that the Giancana name had been linked to the Agency.
►
Rosselli was upset by the harassment he had been under by the FBI. He
pointed to the 1966 Frier Club incident as an example. He said in 1966 he had
been approached by the FBI to provide information on inside basis about organized
crime and when he had refused 18 months later he was indicted. Again, the first
week in June of 1970, the FBI had offered him cooperation but he refused.
Rosselli first met Maheu twenty years ago. He was introduced through a
life long friend who is dead now, named Spitzle, who was in the insurance business.
This first meeting happened in Los Angeles, in 1955. Maheu, at the time, was
running Maheu Associates in Washington, D.C. The meeting was only a social
gathering. There was nothing specifically discussed about activities of the CIA.

In July or August, Maheu called Rosselli and stated that he was working for
the government and had been specifically asked to recruit Rosselli. Maheu Nax
stressed that it was to be Rosselli and no one else. They agreed to meet for lunch
at the Brown Derby in Los Angeles. Maheu described the project as an intelligence
operation involving Cuba. Maheu mentioned specifically Castro, Che Guevara, and
Raoul Castro. It was Rosselli's feeling that Maheu had recruited him because of
his known Cuban connections in Florida. These connections were unrelated to
gambling. There was no money mentioned by Maheu to Rosselli for payment for
services.

The alleged support of Wall Street business men had not been mentioned and
was a cover invented (by Rosselli.later. At the end of their first meeting, they
agreed to meet again at which time Maheu would verify to Rosselli that he was
working for the government. This verification would be by introducing a
government official of higher-authority to Rosselli.

Harvey wanted to know all that Rosselli knew about Cuba in an intelligence line.
Harvey told him at this meeting to have no further contact with Maheu
WHE
and that he should not talk further with Giancana. He also said that he, Harvey,
was in charge of the operation and that Maheu should take or that Rosselli should
take his orders from Harvey. At this point the original project, using pills,
was considered defunct.
1.
with Herver
After this first meeting, Rosselli again contacted his Cuban people. He-
made several trips, that is, Rosselli made several trips with Harvey in Florida,
some down in the Keys to see what type of operations were continuing. One of
the projects Harvey had Rosselli doing was verifying CIA reports by using Rosselli's
own people who were in frequent contact with Cuba. The intelligence reports dealt
both with personalities in the Cuban hierarchy, as well as differentongoing
operations. Rosselli paid his own bills wit before the Bay of Pigs but after, Harvey
would usually pick up the tab.
☐☐
Harvey approached Rosselli with the proposed mission to try for a second
time to assassinate Cuba[3] Harvey said that the new xpills would really work
and were much stronger. Harvey gave Rosselli six pills, then Rosselli gave those
six pills to his Cuban contact. There were no special instructions on how'
to handle the pills and his Cuban contact said that they would be passed into Cuba
and used.
At this time, Rosselli had no ongoing contact with Maheu, but may have run
into him in Los Angeles. Maheu knew that Rosselli was still working on the Cuban
project and that he, Maheu, was out. Rosselli never got any report back on what
happened to the six pills but he assumed that they had been unsuccessful He did
hear a xax report over a radio or TV station, that Fidel Castro was deathly
111, but then, shortly thereafter, he recovered.
Rosselli arranged for the CIA to supply a panel truck loaded with carbines
for use by his Cuban contacts to make two or three-manned party raids into Cuba,
hopefully assassinating Castro and overturning the government.
for use by this Cuban contacts to make two by chroo chamaest part
During the Cuban missile crisis, Rosselli was in Chicago. He contacted
Harvey at Harvey's mother's home in Indianapolis and left his number in Chicago.
Harvey then called him, told him to go to Washington, D.C. From Washington, D.C.;
Rosselli traveled to Florida where he stayed for the duration of the Cuban missile
crisis. He, at times, would, through his Cuban contacts, attempt to verify the
location of the Russian missiles in Cuba. Rosselli claimed that this had been
successful! After the Cuban missile crisis, Harvey called Rosselli and told him
to stop all contacts with any and all persons involved in past Cuban missions.
Harvey never stated why the missions were being called off.
1
The only money that Rosselli ever put up was $800 to buy gas for the speed-
boat that would deliver the two or three-man teams to Cuba to do guerrilla operations.
He stressed throughout the interview that he had never received any money and that
besides this $800 he had never given any money for. His last contact with Harvey
was in June of 1963 or shortly there before, when Rosselli found out that Harvey
was being transfered to Rome and he made a special trip to Washington to say goodby
to him.

look like a heart attack or by natural causes. Rosselli contacted a little
Cuban whose relative was a chef for Castro. At this time, Cubans could still
travel between Florida and Cuba. It was agreed that the CIA would manufacture
the poison capsule. It would be turned over to O'Connell, to Maheu, to Rosselli,
and from Rosselli to the Cubans. Maheu brought the capsule to Florida to the
Fontaineblen Hotel. The Cubans came up to the room, Maheu opened up his brief
case, with Rosselli and the Cubans present, and gave them capsule, plus $10,000
how dollars. The money had come from the CIA and was considered partial payment

of using these pills here was no discussions with the Cubans, at this meeting,
about $250,000 dollars. That figure was used by Maheu after his first meeting
with the Cubans, described what the a CIA might put up to help the families
of men injured or killed in this attempted assassination, Rosselli thinks that
the meeting with the money and capsules was after the election. The number one
Cuban contact that Rosselli had would from time to time, make requests of Rosselli
to be relayed on to the CIA for equipment. The CIA did provide, for instance,
a short wave radio, which was supposed to be used by the Cubans in Florida to
contact Cubans in Cuba about the success or failure of the poison pill mission.
Rosselli was sure that the pills were sent to Cuba but he has received no
explanation as to what happened.
Another project was for the Cubans to receive plastic explosives from the
#2 CIA and give them to frogmen on their side that in turn would place them on ships
EYE
in Havana harbor and blow them up. The CIA refused to do this because of the
ease with which plastic explosives could be traced back to the government agencies
such as the CIA. Maheu did a discuss the use of cigars that would make
Castro's hair drop off. According to Rosselli lose his ability to govern the
country. Another proposal was that there be a booby trapped desk. Each of these
latter two projects were proposed by Cuban refugees who said they had people
in positions vis a vis Castro who could achieve the assassination.
Prior to the Bay of Pigs, there was no discussion of guns. Rosselli claimed
to have a better idea than Maheu, namely that with far fewer men than were involved
in the Bay of Pigs, perhaps a hundred, they could land in Cuba and do the job
successfully Rosselli's Cuban contact at the time was traveling to New York and
New Orleans for meetings. Rosselli was not sure about what the meetings were
about but said that they were related to the overthrow of Castro. Another proposal
put forward was to purchase a speed boat and use some type exploding seashell

The night before the Bay of Pigs Rosselli went to his number one Cuban's
house and spoke with him. The Cuban contact said, "See you in Havana." Rosselli
expressed serious reservation about the possibility of success for the operation.
Rosselli left Florida right after the Bay of Pigs. His total time on this
a particular attempt at assassination in Florida was three or four months.
Post-Bay

Rosselli felt sorry for the poor bastards left on the beach." He felt
indirectly responsible for having encouraged the many of them to participate
in the operation. He went home and stayed in Las Vegas and Los Angeles for awhile.
A few weeks after the Bay of Pigs, Rosselli was contacted by Maheu or O'Connell,
he's not sure. He did meet with Jim O'Connell in Florida a few weeks later. They
had arranged to have rooms at the Airport Hotel. Rosselli was not sure as to what
his name, what name he registered under, but at this meeting in Florida he met a
new CIA man, named Harvey. The first time ne Maxx met Harvey, Rosselli was told

intelligence value in that he was Maheu was afraid, that||Giancana or Rowan
might be giving out intelligence information that would be of value to enemies of
the United States. Rosselli had not heard of the names Dubor Belotti or Fred
Harrison. He admitted that Harvey had discussed the tap with him, but both Harvey
and Rosselli were pissed off xxx that the operation had gone on. Giancana
obviously knew about the tap. Maheu did ask Rosselli to get bail money for the
two tappers who were caught and thrown in jail. Maheu suggested that Rosselli
could get a hotel to turn over the bail money. Finally, Mr. Rosselli arranged
to have a man with green carnation in his lapel meet with "Mr. Doakes" for a transfer
of the bail money. He never received any of this money back. Rosselli claims
that he did not know what type of tap went on. He admitted that he had been
questioned by the FBI but he gave no answers and he knew that Maheu had been
questioned by the FBI.
11
During his early contacts with Maheu in 1959 and '60, in setting up the
Cuban operation, Maheu was setting up a guard system for different Hughes'.
operations, such as Hughes Aircraft or other corporate interests.
Rosselli can't remember whether he ever introduced Giancana as Mr. Sam
Gold. He claims to have no business relationship with Giancana. Rosselli's
only business interests was the ice machines in Las Vegas! He ran those by himself
and had no contact with Giancana. When asked about Joe Santa
Trafficanto,
Rosselli stated that he used him only as an interpreter but not as a contact for
recruiting other Cubans for his mission.
Mr. Thomas Wadden stated that he was receiving no fees for his counsel,
for his representing Rosselli, now. The status of Mr. Cantillon or Mr. Scherr
was not clear. There was discussion as to the Committee paying the expenses
of Mr. Rosselli's transportation from Los Angeles and there was discussion as to
the limits, if any, to be placed on the Committee's inquiry of Mr. Rosselli's
contacts with the Cubans, how they had been developed, and what other operations
did go on.

sonally as a traitor if he doing something wrong in the debate. When he saw the
guidebook for Marines, he smiled to me, and he told me: "Well, listen, Carlos!
don't try to do an invasion with that guidebook for Marines, because that is an
old one and that will be a failure." That was his joke in that moment.

After that we went to the debate, and I think that you have the whole history
of the debate, you have the transcription and everything, [so] that I don't have
to go inside that, because that is subjective, not objective. You have the ob
jective, and that is the debate.
FATHER
Mr. LIEBELER. That is right. We do have a transcript and we listened to it on
the tape last night over at the television station too.
Mr. BRINGUIER. And there is something that I want to show you too. I told
to you about the training camp that were across the Lake Pontchartrain.
Mr. LIEBELER. Yes.

Indicating photograph.] This is the spy
who was inside the training camp! The Christian Democratic Movement turned
him over to the FBI, and the FBI was questioning him in Miami. The Christian
Democratic Movement found a letter, according to this information, from this
guy directed to Carlos Lechuga, foriner Cuban Ambassador to Mexico and now
Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations in New York. In that letter the spy,
Fernando Fernandez, was warning Lechuga that they have to be alert from that
date to August 8, and the day that Oswald came trying to infiltrate my orga-
nization was on August 5. This sounds for me strange in all this matter.
[Indicating.] Here is another interview from Fernandez here 3 days later.

Mr. BRINGUIER. Fernandez wrote a letter to Lechuga in Mexico.

Mr. LIEBELER. Lechuga is a member of the Castro government?

Mr. BRINQUIER. Yes; they were training Cubans over here' to make a com-
mando action against Castro, but they find out that there was a Castro spy
inside the training camp, and they went back to Miami with the people and with
him, and they turn him over to the FBI. I think that after that the leader
for the Christian Democratic Movement or that the FBI didn't found nothing,
because was not against the law to spy inside an anti-Castro organization. It
was against the law to spy inside the US. Government but not inside the anti-
Castro organization. And my feeling-and this is the question that I am asking
myself in New Orleans we are about 900 miles from Miami In Miami is where
the headquarters of all the anti-Castro groups. I could not find any reason

$
for Oswald to come to me and offer me his service to train Cubans in guerrilla
warfare at the same moment when there was a secret anti-Castro training camp
in New Orleans and a Castro spy was inside that training camp. That for me
is because, if he was willing to infiltrate one active organization, he will go
directly to Miami and he will offer his service over there in Miami, but not in
New Orleans where it is not publicly known tha. there was something going on
at that moment. I believe that that was the only time here in New Orleans that

there was something like that, and it was a coincidence. And there is another
coincidence too for me, and that is that when Oswald left the city he went to
Mexico, and the letter from Fernandez that was intercepted here was to. Mexico
too, and Oswald visit the Cuban consulate in Mexico, and the Fernandez letter
was to the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico. For me, that is a big doubt.

Mr. BRINGUIER. You see, after the debate, the same night of the debate, I
went to the radio station here in New Orleans and the local papers and the
United Press International office, and I gave a press release. If you want a
copy, I could give you a copy. I gave a copy to the Secret Service.
•
The most interesting thing is the four things that I asked to the Secret
Service of New Orleans. I think that this is the second one where I said,
"Write to your Congressman asking for a full investigation of Mr. Lee H.
Oswald, a confessed Marxist" [producing document]. And that was 3 months
before the assassination.
Mr. LIEBELER. Do you have another copy of this?

Mr. BRINGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. For the training of people for military action against Castro?
Mr. BRINGUIER. Right.
Mr. LIEBELER. And that was not public knowledge at that time?

Mr. BRINGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER! So you are tying this up in your mind by considering the pos-
sibility that Oswald was, in fact, a Castro agent?
T
Mr. BRINGUIER. That is right.
Mr. LIEBELER. And did know about the existence of this training camp, be-
cause Mr. Fernandez had already himself infiltrated that training camp?
Mr. BRINGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. And that Fernandez had told Oswald about the existence of this
camp and had asked Oswald himself to try to infiltrate that camp for your
organization?
.{1
Mr. BRINGUIER. Excuse me.
HAR
Mr. LIEBELER. Is that correct?
1.
Mr. BRINGUIER. Well, the only thing that I don't believe is that Fernandez
had told directly to Oswald. What I believe is that Fernandez had informed
some people outside the United States, and these people had informed Oswald and
had gave to Oswald the order to try to infiltrate the Cuban group here in New
Orleans.

1
Mr. BRINGUIER. I beg pardon? I don't understand the words.

t
Mr. LIEBELER. As I understand, part of the hypothesis here, the theory, re-
lates to the fact that Fernandez said to Lechuga, "We must be careful, or we
will be in danger,"-up until about August 8. Now does that statement have
anything to do with Oswald?
E
Mr. BRINGUIER. Well, what I think is this: He send that letter to Lechuga, and
on August 5 Oswald came to me offering his service to train Cubans, all in the
same period of time. Something that never was happening here in New
Orleans, that there was a secret anti-Castro training camp, and the chairman
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee trying to join the Cuban group here in
New Orleans. Those are the facts. I don't want to tell something that I am
not sure about. I just want to show you that tremendous coincidence or that
connection.

Mr. LIEBELER. Now it doesn't seem likely, does it, that Oswald would go around
handing out literature in the streets like he did if he was actually attempting
to infiltrate the anti-Castro movement?
IL
Mr. BRINQUIER. Remember that that was after I turned down his offer and
after I told him that I don't have nothing to do with military activities and
that here there is nothing, and that I turned down completely him. He didn't
went openly to do that before the attempt to infiltrate the training camp:
he went openly to do that after he was turned down.

Mr. LIEBELER. Do you know of any conceivable association between anybody

Mr. BRINGUIER. No.

Mr. LIEBELER. Would you have any way of obtaining information of that
sort
as a result of your anti-Castro activities and contacts? If there were such
person as this, do you think you would be likely to know about it?

11
Mr. LIEBELER. If there were such a person, that is to say, some agent of the

would have, had access to that information or you would have been likely to
find out about it?

Mr. BRINGUIER. You see, that is a hard question, because here in the city you
have a lot of persons. There are some who are pro-Castro, there are many
who are anti-Castro.
(anti-Castro. Even among the Cubans you could have some Castro
agents here in the city and you could not have control of everybody.
But there is something else: The owner of the Havana Bar-the Havana Bar
is located in 117 Decatur Street, just two door or three door from my store
the owner of the Havana Bar is a Cuban; and he and one of the employees
over there, gave the information to me after Kennedy's assassination not:
before that Oswald went to the Havana Bar one time. He asked for some:
lemonade. He was with one Mexican at that moment, and when Oswald was
drinking the lemonade, he start to say that, sure, the owner of that place had
to be a Cuban capitalistic, and that he argue about the price of the lemonade.
He was telling that that was too much for a lemonade, and he feel bad at that
moment, Oswald feel bad at that moment-he had some vomits and he went
out to the sidewalk to vomit outside on the sidewalk. These persons here from
the Havana Bar told me that the guy, the Mexican, who was with Oswald, was
the same one that one time the FBI told them that if they will see him, call them
immediately because that was a pro-Communist. I remember that was between
August 15 and August 30 was that period of time. I could not locate that
because I start to find out all these things after the Kennedy assassination, not
before, because before I did not found any connection. They did not told
nothing of this before to me. Between the 15th and the 30th the brother of
the owner of the Havana Bar came to my store asking me to call the FBI, be
cause he already saw one automobile passing by the street with two Mexicans,
one of them the one who had been with swald in the bar, and he told me

exiles in a street demonstration and being "officialy cautioned" by the
police, events which robbed me of what support I had leaving me
alone."334
H
In spite of those claims, the Commission has not been able to un-
cover any evidence that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration
in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident men-
tioned above, which occurred 8 days after Oswald wrote the above
letter to V. T. Lee. 335 Bringuier, who seemed to be familiar with many
anti-Castro activities in New Orleans, was not aware of any such
incident. 336
T
Police reports also fail to reflect any activity on Oswald's
part prior to August 9, 1963, except for the uneventful distribution of
literature at the Dumaine Street wharf in June, 337 Furthermore, the
general tenor of Oswald's next letter to V. T. Lee, in which he sup-
ported his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy of the charges
made against him and a newspaper clipping reporting the event, sug-
gests that his previous story of an attack by Cuban exiles was at least
greatly exaggerated. While the legend "FPCC 544 Camp St. NEW
ORLEANS, LA." was stamped on some literature that Oswald had
in his possession at the time of his arrest in New Orleans, extensive
investigation was not able to connect Oswald with that address, al-
though it did develop the fact that an anti-Castro organization had
maintained offices there for a period ending early in 1962.33
Commission has not been able to find any other indication that Oswald
The
had rented an office in New Orleans. In view of the limited amount
of public activity on Oswald's part before August 9, 1963, there also
seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed "thousands"
of circulars, especially since he had claimed to have printed only 2,000
and actually had only 1000 printed. In addition, there is no evidence
that he received any substantial amount of materials from the na-
tional headquarters.340
☐☐☐
'
'
In another letter to V. T. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald wrote
that he had appeared on Mr. William Stuckey's 15-minute television
program over WDSU-TV called “Latin American Focus" as a result
of which he was "flooded with callers and invitations to debate's ect.
as well as people interested in joining the F.P.C.C New Orleans
branch." 34 WDSU has no program of any kind called "Latin Ameri-
can Focus." 842
Stuckey had a radio program called "Latin Listening
Post," on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on August
17, 1963.343 It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to
all of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringuier's attempting to learn
more about the true nature of the alleged FPCC "organization" in
New Orleans. 344
| || |
Oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers
and invitations to debate. This would have made him a real center of
attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union
and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.
The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result of the street
fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently not enough
to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V. T. Lee in an appar-

Fair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful oc-
casion in Dallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,³16
Oswald's first public identification with that cause was in New Or-
leans. There, in late May and early June of 1963, under the name
Lee Osborne, he had printed a handbill headed in large letters "Hands
Off Cuba," an application form for, and a membership card in, the
New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. 317 He
first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the
vicinity of the U.S.S. Wasp, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street
wharf in New Orleans, on June 16, 1963.318 He distributed literature
in downtown New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because
of a dispute with three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August
16, 1963.319 Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police, and
at his own request, by an agent of the FBI.320 On August 17, 1963, he
appeared briefly on a radio program 321 and on August 21, 1963, he
debated over radio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos Brin-
guier, one of the Cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on
August 9.322 Bringuier claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had
attempted to infiltrate an anti-Castro organization with which he was
associated 323

While Oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above,
his "organization" was a product of his imagination. 324 The imaginary
president of the nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,325 the
name that Oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon.3
Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because
it rhymed with Fidel," 327 to her husband's membership card in the
New Orleans chapter. She testified that he threatened to beat her if
she did not do so.328

Orleans police that it had 35 members, 5 of which were usually present -
at meetings which were held once a month.930
TN
.1.
Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba activities may be viewed as a very
shrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created
publicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of Oswald's
reluctance to describe events accurately and of his need to present
himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than
was justified by reality. This is suggested by his misleading and some-
time untruthful statements in his letters to Mr. V. T. Lee, then
national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated August 1.
1963, Oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed to
have rented for FPCC activities had been promply closed 3 days
later for some obsure reasons by the renters, they said something
about remodeling ect!, I'm sure you understand." 331 He wrote that
"thousands of circulars were distrubed" 332 and that he continued to
receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored
"to keep ansewering to the best of my ability." In his letter to
V. T. Lee, he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf
of FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to an attack by Cuban

A Mission to Cuba: Tale of the Doomed Raiders
BY PAUL MESKIL 4/24/175
Fifth of a series
On March 17, 1960, President
Eisenhower authorized the CIA to
form a guerrilla urmy of Cuban
refugees and invade Cuba. Shortly
thereafter, the CIA dispatched
agent. Frank Sturgis to Guatemala
to confer with President Miguel
Ydigoras about setting up training
bases in that country.
This "secret" mission was quickly.
discovered and reported by the Guate-
malan news media.
WUS
. "I had planned to break into the
Cuban Eni bassy while 1
in
Guatemala City," Sturgis told this re-
porter recently, "but the president sug.
gested I leave the country because of
all the publicity. The newspapers and
TV reported I was a CIA agent and
was trying to obtain bases for the
Cuban invasion."
Over the next year, the CLA trained
Cuban recruits in Guatemala, Panama,
Puerto Rico and the United States.
Sturgis, a murine combat veteran of
World War II, trained about 50 Cubans
in the Florida Everglades.
Sturgis was part of the agency's
super-secret Operation 40, an infiltra-
tion and intelligence-gathering group
NW 50955
that was to go Into Cuba before the
Bay of Pigs assault.

Some former CIA agents describe:

"It was a top CIA project," he says."
"Most of the mon in it were Cubans;
who had been trained by, the U.S.
Ariny. I am not saying that Operation
30 had an assassination squad. There
are reports that there was one, but I'm
not saying so.
To infiltrate
"The prime purpose was infiltration,
not assassination. They (group mem-
bers) were to infiltrate Cuba, and con- d
tact anti-Castro military leaders, politi-
cal leaders and underground people.
And they could kill--if they had to, if
it was really necessary."
D
Chief of Operation 40 was Jose Jon-
quin Sanjenis, a former Castro aide who
defected and came a CIA agent. Two
of his cousins also worked for the agih.
ry.
Early in 1961, the CIA learned that
a group of Cuban military officers was
plotting to overthrow Castro. The lead-
er of this plot was Major Humber:
Sori Marin, a former Havana lawy
who drafted the Castro penal code
which made firing squad executions
legal. Sori Marin had been adiut
general of Castro's army, presiding
judy at the 1959 "war crimes" trial.

that sent hundreds of Batista loyalets
to the firing squads, and Castro's first
minister of agriculture. But by 1961 he
had turned against the Castro regime.
His partners in the anti-Castro con.
spiracy included other Cuban army,
navy and air force commanders, the
chief of Castro's secret police, the depu-
ty finance minister and the head of the
Cuban Sugar Institute. They planned a
military uprising during which Castro
and his Communist advisers would be
killed.
As soon
as the CIA learned what
they were up to, Operation 40 went into
action. Agents slipped into Cubs, con
tarted the conspirators and asked thein
to time the military revolt to reincide
with the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Presidents of the several Central American Republic s
and the leading figuras among the Cuban exiles in Mian
New York and Washington, were known to have the sanction
of the United States Government. On July 16, 1963,
SOMOZA left Miami and returned to Nicaragua.
On July 15, 1963, the "Miami News" contained
an article stating that there is growing speculation in
Miami that Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY is quictly
backing certain Cuban exiles, such as MANUEL ARTIME BUESA

On July 26, 1963, SANTIAGO ALVAREZ RODRIGUEZ
advised he had talked with LUIS SOMOZA about four hours
while SOMOZA was in Miami during the middle of July, 1963.
ALVAREZ said that it is his opinion SOMOZA was acting ea
an intermediary between the United States Government and
the Cuban exiles.
On August 20, 1963, ALVAREZ advised that nothing
has yet developed concerning the SOMOZA plan; it is now
not clear what SOMOZA is offering, or what the United States
Government's position or attitude is in this matter. ALVAREZ
said it is obvious SOMOZA cannot afford, either as a private
individual or a representative of the Nicaraguan Government,
to back such a military program by Cuban exiles, and will
have to have the backing and support of the United States
Government to go on with his plan.
On July 30, 1963, FERMIN FLEITES, member of the
Executive Committee of the MDC, advised that about a week
ago, a Nicaraguan Army officer visited the IOC Readquarters,
and in the name of SOMOZA, offered camps, military equipment
and bases in Nicaragua. This individual also offered to
pay the expenses of moving the MDC operations to Nicaragua.
FLEITES explained that the MDC had taken no
positive action concerning this matter, and had adopted a
"wait and see" policy to ascertain what attitude the
United
ted States Government would take concerning this matter.

On August 23, 1963, ALFREDO BORJAS. Intelligence
Chief of the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionario (MRR)
anti-CASTRO organization of MANUEL ARTINE, advised that the
MRR-Comandce of CARLOS BANDIN is a dissident group.
BORJAS
said this through his contacts in the latter organization,
he had ascertained that only about five members of BANDIN's
organization landed in Cuba at the time of the June 20,
1963 invasion hoax.
BORJAS said the CRC press releases were a publicity
stunt which backfired and destroyed any credibility and
activity the CRC may have had up to that time. When the
press found out it was a hoax, ANTONIO PACEO and CARLOS BANDIN
resigned, blaming the CRC for the scandal which they both
helped to create.
II. THE SOMOZA PLAN
On July 16, 1963, MIGUEL CARCIA, in charge of
public relations for the CRC, announced that LUIS SOMOZA,
former President of Nicaragua, had recently been in
Washington, D. C.; reportedly conferred with United States
Government officials, and about ten days ago arrived in
Miami, Florida.
GARCIA said that SOMOZA conducted a series of
meetings, in which nearly all of the well-known Cuban
exile political and action group leaders attended. At
these meetings, SOMOZA claimed he had talked to all the
Presidents of the Central American Republics, and these
Presidents are willing to help Cuban exiles in the form
of training camps, military equipment, and bases of
operation from which to attack the present government of
SOMOZA indicated that his meetings with the

organization Armed Forces of Cuba in Exile, stated that
about a month ago, LUIS SOMOZA told EMILIO NUNEZ PORTUONDO,
former Cuban delegate to the United Nations (UN), that
he (SOMOZA) had talked to United States Attorney General (AG)
ROBERT KENNEDY.
AG KENNEDY reportedly said it was necessary for
SOMOZA to work out the Cuban problem and to unite Cuban
exiles. SOMOZA recommended that MANUEL ARTIME BUESA be
designated as the leader of the Cuban exiles.
DE LEON advised that there was later a meeting in
Miami at the home of Nicaraguan Army Captain JOSE ALEGRETT
between SOMOZA and a number of Cuban exile leaders. At this
meeting, SOMOZA said there was a possibility of Nicaraguan
support for the Cuban exilé anti-CASTRO movement, but first
the exiles would have to accept ARTIME as their leader. There
was considerable opposition to this suggestion by the exile
leaders attending the meeting.
On September 12, 1963, PAULINO SIERRA MARTINEZ,
former attorney and textile mill operator in Cuba, advised
he had recently visited Nicaragua and conferred with LUIS
SOMOZA concerning help to Cuban exiles.
SIERRA said there are no training camps in
Nicaragua or Central America for Cuban exiles, and all the
proposed aid and backing has progressed no further than the
talking stage. SIERRA said it seems to him that everyone
is waiting for the United States Government to give the
"green light".

How U.S. Made Unholy Alliance With the Mafia
By PAUL MESKIL
Fourth of a sarles
14/23/75
When Fidel Castro threw the
American gangsters out of Cuba,
they vowed to return-over his
dead body.
Their determination to get rid of
Cart was shared by many high-placed
American officials and this
common
cause led eventually to an unholy al-
liance between the CIA and the mob.
The strange story of CIA agents and
Bíafia mobsters plotting together
against Castro was pieced together from
Interviews with police, federal agents,
ex-agents and underworld sources.
Meyer Lansky, the crime syndicate's
financial genius, and Santo Trafficante,
Mafia boss of West Florida and Hava-
n, got out of Cuba immediately after
the hasty exit of their benefactor, dicta-
tor Fulgencio Batista. The overseers of
their gambling casinos remained on the
island, nervously waiting for the axe to
fall.
"I was in touch with all the casino
owners and operators in Havana." said
Frank Sturgis, who was Castro's casino
Inspector during this period. "Fidel

Book V, p. 63-64
In March of 1964, the Warren
Commission requested from Director
Hoover information on certain pro-
Castro and anti-Castro organizations
which were active in the U.S.
including the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, and Alpha 66, among
others. The Bureau furnished less
than a full and satisfactory
response and did not disclose the .
fact that the CIA had operational
interests in certain of the entities

Book V, p. 65
It is known that the CIA took an
interest in the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee with which Oswald was
associated. According to Bureau
documents, the Agency advised the
Bureau that they were considering
the use of disinformation that might
embarass the Committee in areas where.

Book V, p. 61- In December, 1963, the CIA learned that
63
a Cuban American had crossed the border
from Texas into Mexico, on November 23
and arrived in Mexico City on November 25.
He stayed in a hotel until the evening of
November 27, when he departed on a
regularly scheduled Cubana airlines flight
to Havana using a Cuban courtesy visa and
an expired U.S. passport. He was the only
passenger on the flight. In March, 1964
the Agency received a report from a
source which alleged that the same Cuban
American had received a permit to enter
Mexico City on November 20 in Tampa,
Florida. The same source said the Cuban
American was somehow involved in the
assassination.
The Agency did not follow up on this
report other than to ask a Cuban
defector about his knowledge of the
Cuban American's activities. The FBI
did investigate the reported unusual
travel but did not fully report the
results of their investigation to their
Warren Commission. Their investigation
showed that this individual had lived
in Tampa and Key West and was pro-Castro.
He had traveled to Cuba in May of 1962
and had a brother in the Cuban military
who was studying in the Soviet Union.
On November 17, 1963, the Cuban American
was at a get-together at the home of a
member of the Tampa chapter of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. This was the
same Fair Play for Cuba Committee that
Oswald had possibly contacted in May of
1963.

The AMLASH operation was insecure
prior to the Fitzgerald meeting
with AMLASH, a meeting that
Fitzgerald was urged not to under-
take by several in the Agency.

NW 50955
DocId: 32423630 Page 169
In late July 1964, an FBI informant
reported that the CIA was meeting with
AMLASH for the purpose of assassinating
Castro. Informant also reported that
AMLASH was unhappy with the CIA's efforts
and that Attorney General Kennedy had
refused to support the plan but that the
plan had not been completely put to rest.
This information was not disseminated
outside the Bureau at the request of the
informant. But the Bureau notations
indicate that the Bureau was looking
into an underworld plot against Castro
that might be coincidental with the
AMLASH plan. The Bureau had first been
informed of AMLASH-CIA meetings in
October 1963. That information did not
indicate assassination involvement.

--- Image 157-10014-10242_page_169.jpeg ---
Book V, p. 78 Victor Espinosa, a Cuban exile, involved
in the transporting explosives to New
Orleans in 1963, contacted INS with
information about the AMLASH operation.
This information was turned over to the
FBI which informed the CIA. Both
agencies interrogated Espinosa in June
of 1965 and found that he knew that
AMLASH and others were planning a coup
which involved the assassination of
Castro and that the CIA had been
involved with AMLASH and others in the
planning.
Espinosa and AMLASH were life-long friends
but during the interrogation he gave no
indication that he was aware of the 1963
AMLASH-CIA meetings. Espinosa's
information noted in the 1967 IG Report
suggests a link between the AMLASH
operation and the CIA plots to assassinate
Castro using underworld contacts.
Therefore, Espinosa's information raised
the possibility that underworld figures
who were aware of the Harvey plots may
have been aware of the AMLASH operation.
CIA reaction to this interrogation was
to terminate the operation immediately.

Individuals outside the CIA had
been brought into the operation,
and the Agency learned that one
of these individuals was in
clandestine contact with Cuban
intelligence (Cable from
European station to CIA Head-
quarters, 3/18/65).

Book V, p. 79 In mid-1965 the CIA interrogated Tepedino,
New York jeweler, who had been involved
with the AMLASH operation from the
beginning. The report concluded that
the subject was deceptive during the
interrogation and withheld pertinent
information in one or more relevant
areas. Tepedino lied in response to
questions dealing with AMLASH's and his
ties to Cuban intelligence. Tepedino
stated that AMLASH had no plan to over-
throw Castro. Tepedino stated AMLASH
had strong connections with Cuban
intelligence and was probably cooperating
with it in various ways. Although
AMLASH never mentioned these connections
to his CIA case officers; Teledino
stated that AMLASH had mentioned them
to him and almost everyone else he had

met.

Book V, p. 79 The FBI made the connection between
Espinosa's 1963 activities and the
fact that in 1965 he was knowledgeable
of CIA involvement in plans to
assassinate Castro. However, there
is no evidence that either the CIA or
FBI investigated this connection
until 1967.

the assassination of President Kennedy.

Okay now, what happened

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.
And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you
go into that?
Well he was very fond of everything German. He
said he read
and my father, you know, tried
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.
And he offered you a job, right?
Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts, and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well.
My father is diplomatic and they
exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and
stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.
How old were you then?
Nineteen, nineteen years old.
Did you get off the ship and stay there?

asked me for my phone number and address in New York

So, I was as surprised, I was very surprised.
How long was it did you leave New York to go to
Havana?
Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,
and he said yes. I am in Havana Hilton, you call
me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright I
believe you I said because how else would you have
my number.
He said "I want you come back. I think
about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you
come back. And it was a joke really, I liked the
Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,
and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so
I would have enough for the return trip home because,
I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island
in general. So I, and I still didn't believe him
that he would send the plane.
Did he send the airplane?
Yes.
What kind of an airplane did he send?
A Cubana airliner with...
Four engines?
Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.
I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on
the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party
and I was home alone studying. Oh no, in fact I was
reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro
and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus
and Pedro
and they showed me identification. One came in military
uniform, the other in civilian clothes. One smiled,.
one didn't. One said, "Are you ready?" And one said,
"We go now. Fidel want very much to see you."
(Laughter).
And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like
in shock. I didn't know what to do. So they said they
were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane
would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I
haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

The same day I arrived in New York. Because my

morning. I guess the previous...
Well he went back to Germany with the ship, right?
Where did you go?
I was living with my brother in New York City.
My brother was a translator for the United Nations
and I was alone living in New York City going to
the Merchantson Banker School.
Well how did you get back to New York City from
Havana?
On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the
cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.
Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left
that night, left Havana that night...
Yeah.
went over to New York and then from New York went
back to Europe, right?
.
Yes. Yes. I thought about Fidel and he pointed out
this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed. I
was young, I don't know. And I thought that...
He called, he called you, he knew just about what
time you were going to arrive in New York and when
you got there he called you, what, the same, the same
day you got there?
The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I
heard "hello".
Did he speak Cuban or English to you?
I guess.
He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice.
he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I
think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.
I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep."

One lady attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...
Oh this was more business or something like that?
Yes business.
Everybody was trying to promote this
and that with Fidel.
FS:
Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the
door locked. And I was in there, in his suite, and
Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and

Right.
And so forth. And then it was suggested about well
you know the American government may not like it.
You're gonna have all the American business interests
put pressure on the State Department which would put
pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and
they would have the agents, they would send new agents
into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,
closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA
had contact with the 26th of July movement.
As a
matter of fact that they were exchanging information
with Castro...
Uh hum.
which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups
so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power
struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So
Fidel, with the help of CIA...

you.
You didn't want to but it happened.
Yes.
And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in
his Cuba, right?
I was in his Cuba alright.
Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate
Intelligence Committee has got is the things that
Fidel has stated against the United States government
if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so
forth when the new election time comes because at that
time the President of the United States was Eisenhower
and it looked like that the Democrats were going to
win the election and he felt that if a new government,
which was discussed among the top military people, if
the new government came in and if they decided that they.
didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what
he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,
that if the United States government decided to go and
turn against him and put pressure on him he would do
likewise to the United States government. And he was
going to export his revolution in Latin America. These
are the things that you heard...

ahead and tell them the name of these here people how
you gonna do it?
Mmm.
You know we get back to the same thing again. Yeah,
you're looking for protection. So far the people
you've worked with, so far this man Pucci who you
saved his life, and saved another undercover agent's
life whose working with the FBI. These people are
powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't
that correct? One time they almost threw you out of
an 18 story building. Another time you got pistol-
whipped. You did all this crap for these people
here yet they will do nothing to go ahead at the
present time, and this is on record in their own
files and so forth, yet you cannot move them to give
you or your children any protection. This piece of
tape is going to go right to Senator Baker's office,
it'll go to Howard Liebengood for him to listen to,
to evaluate it and turn this tape over to the proper
authorities which will be the Justice Department.
You can call Howard Liebengood to see if he has
received those codes from the Albanian Embassy from
me. You can call him and find out, and also you
can call him at the same time and let him know if
a tape has been turned over to him. As a matter of
fact when I get there Friday and leave this in his
office I will instruct his people in the office to
get a hold of you, because I'm gonna leave your phone
number with Senator's Baker's people, with Senator
Baker is on, has a Committee on Intelligence...
Mm-hmm.
He's got the committee. It's a new Committee that has
been formed on intelligence. See, now I am turning this
information over to the proper authorities. See. And
this information is not going to go to any newspaper
or anybody...

got a hang-up, you know I guess, with them working on
practically all my adult life.

Alright, how many people were on the tenants' list?
****
We had, the building consisted of 300 units, which
300 apartments, my husband had access to files. Each
Soviet file read the same Permanent Mission of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic resident, and I
got interested. Then one day an agent came at 9 o'clock
in the morning, and my husband had been previously
working with Treasury and other agencies, including
this agent which I'll name, that's Al Chestone.
His first name was what?
Albert, Albert Chestone.
What agency was he with?
The FBI.
Special Agent, FBI?
Yes, counterintelligence.
Sector of the FBI
Yes, political. And, my husband had known him
previously working with the Polaris missile, Polaris
missile thing. This was before I met my husband or
married him. He did something with the Polaris
missile thing. And my husband was paid by this same
agent. Anyway, we, he came daily and we went over the
tenants' list and we sort of dissected everybody in
the building.
Alright now, were you recruited by this agent?
Yes, he said are you willing to work and I said, well,
why not? He said it doesn't consist of much, a few
burglaries (laughter). . . .

you and your husband doing the burglaries or you by

Well when you did these burglaries...
We all did them together. They're were about 5, 6,
7 cars. One stationed in front of the Soviet Mission.
Suppose, say like they were interested in one Soviet
who they lost track of, who was supposed to be in
Washington, D. C., and then they found him all of a
sudden in our building because they had surveillance
across the street. That's the first thing they set
up surveillance, a camera, high-power camera across
the street. That we were pointed out to. That

Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door
over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,
hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,

Out from Miami spreads a wave of vio-
lence. Terrorists' aim is to topple Castro, free
Cuba. Nearly all Cuban refugees share this
dream. But the acts of a few zealots create
trouble for fellow exiles and for the U.S.
Reported from
MIAMI and WASHINGTON
Terrorism by radical Cuban refugees has become a thorny
problem in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and, in the
view of some authorities, a potential threat to the lives of
American leaders.
The terrorists' goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from
its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro.
In pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence
from Miami across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba but
also to Mexico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama-even across
the South Atlantic to Argentina.
They have engaged in a series of bombings in the U.S. and
abroad. They have carried out military-style attacks on
Communist ships. They are strongly suspected of several
killings.
A federal grand jury in Miami is investigating their activi-
ties and their leaders.
Now, as a new Administration prepares to take over in
Washington, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists will step up
their attacks in an effort to thwart any turn toward reconcili-
ation with Castro.
Officials familiar with their operations warn that some of
the Cuban extremists will stop at nothing, not even at
assassinating members of the Carter Administration.
"The Cuban terrorists are the most highly trained assassins
in the world today," says one U.S. official.
Many of the terrorists were trained by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency in the days when this country was trying to
overthrow Castro, or kill him.
The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee recently held
hearings on the Cuban-terrorist threat. It heard this testimo-
ny from Lt. Thomas Lyons, head of a special antiterrorist
squad of the Dade County public-safety department in

Miami, where Cuban refugees
are concentrated:
"The overwhelming major-
ity of the Cubans in Miami are
strongly anti-Castro. That's
why they came to Miami in
the first place. They are also
law-abiding citizens who, with
minor exceptions, manifest
their opposition to Castro in
legal ways.
"However, there are a small
number of individuals whose
hatred of Cuban Prime Minis-
ter Fidel Castro and Commu-
nism has led them to engage
in extralegal actions and to
violate the laws of the country
which gave them sanctuary.
These individuals use Dade
County as a base for international terrorism ☐ against
governments allied with Cuba, Cuban shipping, Commu-
nists, purported Communists and individuals who take a
stand against their terrorist-type attacks. . . .
***Some Cuban groups purporting to be involved in terror-
ist-type attacks against the Cuban Government are no more
or no less than outright criminals, feeding upon the Cuban
population and diverting the collected funding for their own-
purposes."
Other investigators charge that the terrorists, to finance
their crusade, have dealt in cocaine and prostitution and in.
extortion from wealthy fellow refugees.
The number of hard-core terrorists is small; officially
estimated at fewer than 300. But their reach is wide. In this
year alone they have either bragged about or been accused
of such acts as:
• Machine-gun attacks on the high seas against vessels
from Cuba and other Commúnist nations.
• Bombing a wide variety of targets in the United States,
Latin America and Portugal.
• Planting-a bomb that caused the crash of a Cubana
Airlines plane near Barbados on October 6, with the loss of
73 lives.

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.
The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with
a Mr. Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and
the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.
The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their
own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the
apartment. The Albanians are more, they allow their
children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their
mission, which they blocked a complete fire exit was

they had about 30, 30 families who resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my
husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in
charge of the building. That same day they had a so-
called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,
the first thing I looked out the window when I heard
the shooting I called the Bureau and I said, "Get me
Al Chestone fast." I said I don't have Louis here.
I said I need help. I have a demonstration. I don't
know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here started this demonstration.
So then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like.
Yeah.
So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line...
Marita, what we're going into details is something
that is a story.
Oh, alright.
So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.
Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and
especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese
into the United Nations, which they did. It was that
speech, which I have the original copy of. Ambassador
Rocco Nocco sounds crazy, but that's his name, Rocco

Nocco, and they were, they were sloppier, and the
agent Al Chestone told me convince them, you know,
case 'em, keep going up and down the steps, what
time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was
the most valuable source of information for the
Bureau, and that was...
Garbage and trash.
Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you
know, and that was my job because I had the patience.
Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because
I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which
was the disposal system in the building from 31 floors
down in other words when they threw their garbage
out that it would come out in brick form, block form,
brick crushed, which in fact was not true.
HOOD
But they believed it?
They believed it. They trusted us. Louis and I were
the only ones allowed in the mission. We were the
only ones.
Now this mission is that building you were talking
about.
That's still there.
ML:
FS:
Still there.
ML:
FS:
ML:
:
Very much there. That's the code that you have.
Right.
So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go
after midnight when they put their garbage out in the
hall, pick up the bags. Take them down to the service
entrance and take the bags at home, take 'em home.
And go through the orange peels and chicken bones and
gather torn up letters, this was before they got smart
and bought a shredder (unintelligible). And I would
turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would
past it together and give it to the Bureau and some
of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among
them was one code, now...

Very valuable, yes. The...
And this was turned over to who?
To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on
a hunch lucky. Because it was just at the time when
the Red Chinese entered the United States, first
came here. Mr. Huang Yua, and I met them. We met
them first before anybody met them, Louis and I.
And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in the
morning and I just had a hunch and I got up and I
said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do
some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room.
So I went downstairs and I waited and sure enough
around 3:30 these bags started to come down from the
21st floor.
3:30 in the morning?
3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them
closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut
the machine off and I got these, I got this code,
I caught it in other words, but it....
This is the code you turned over to me?
This is the first code, the very first code, at the
risk of having my hands chopped off because if I
'didn't shut that machine off in time I could have
been hurt. But I got it. The first code was very
valuable. It was sent to Washington.

these bags of stuff and if you hadn't have turned
off the machine you would have got your hand either
chopped up or cut off, and so forth. What did, were
you saying about Al, Uncle Al?
Uncle Al slept and I did the work, and by the time I
got upstairs and took the orange peels and everything
out of the garbage and separated the letters and
every tiny little piece with tweezers and everything,

put it all in a box, right down to every piece. I
ruined my rugs and everything. And Uncle Al would
come at 8:30, 9:00 in the morning and I would still
be up separating the garbage and he'd be all fresh
and ready for work and I had just come back from the
garbage room. And...
You stayed awake all night?
Yeah, with the tweezers and I use to run out of
skotch tape which was frustrating cause I couldn't
stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,
so he brought me a big box of skotch tape which
was very kind of him. Then I would give it to him
and he'd, he'd have coffee, tea and toast or whatever.
And I'd say, "Now I want to go to sleep. And he'd

That's alright, it don't matter.
I forgot really. But we were very close to him. His
wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and
she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to
have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first
met her, like my daughter. My daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and
the little girl, at sixteen, Irene was sent back to
the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father
was heartbroken. I guess like any mother and father
when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I
do so and pass along to them empirin and codine #4,
which is a pain killer which they smuggled over to

it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. I don't know...
Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?
Well, now we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?
He was the KGB spy that they lost and thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia.
He was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They lost him and they were
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. And he, we had a lot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also knew I had diamonds and he asked me,
(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"
What did he call you?
Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.
Oh, that's in Russian?
Yes.
And we always exchanged Russian words and I
know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,
you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a
fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind
of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and
the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small
number of the 600,000 exiles who settled in the
U.S. have become extremists.
Highlights of events in those 18 years, some
involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the
extremists-
1961: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and
trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala and Nica-
ragua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south
shore. The invasion was a failure.
1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released
by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ran-
som in drugs, food, medical equipment and other
supplies from "private contributions." President
John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban
exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a
liberated Cuba.
U.S. launched its secret "Operation Mongoose".
a plan to use Cuban exiles in paramilitary war
against Castro while U.S. maintained an economic
blockade to shake the island's economy. The attacks
generally failed.
1964: Cuban extremists in New York City fired a
mortar shell at United Nations as Cuba's Ché Gue-
vara addressed the General Assembly.
1967: Cuban exile specialists and U.S.-trained
Bolivian troops trapped and killed Guevara and
some of his Communist guerrillas in Bolivia.
1968-72: Cuban-exile extremists bombed ships
of nations considered to be friendly to Castro, ter-
rorized other exiles to keep them in line.
1972: Cuban exiles trained by Central Intelli-
gence Agency took part in Watergate break-in, later
testified that they thought it would help their anti-
Castro campaign.
1973: U.S. and Cuba signed agreement aimed at
controlling hijacking of aircraft and piracy of ships
at sea.
1974-76: Cuban extremists exploded more than
100 bombs in Miami area in two-year period, hitting
offices of the FBI, a State attorney and the Miami
police department.
Exile terrorists attacked airline offices and consul-
ates of governments that have diplomatic relations
with Castro. Bombings took place in Jamaica, Mexi-
co, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Panama, other countries.
Fishing boats based in Cuba and Soviet cargo
ships were attacked by high-speed motor launches
manned by exile extremists.
Terror reached its peak with the bomb sabotage
of a Cuban airliner and the death of 73 passengers
and crew last October 6-near Barbados. Police
seized Cuban exiles in Caracas, Venezuela, on suspi-
cion of involvement in the sabotage. Castro can-
celed U.S-Cuba hijacking agreement..

a former Chilean Ambassador in Washington, D.C., on Sep-
tember 21.
• Kidnaping two Cuban officials in Argentina.
• Attempting to kidnap a Cuban consul in Mexico.
Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do
they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about
what they may do in the future?
To answer such questions, Orr Kelly and Carl J. Migdail of
the U.S. News & World Report staff dug deeply into the
records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes
though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law-
enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.
BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM
After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became
apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state,
800,000 Cubans "voted with their feet" and fled their
homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United
States. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of
them live in the Miami area.
The majority of these immigrants are law abiding. But
Miami's "Little Havana" provides a culture in which the
virus of violence can grow.
www.d
· “In Miami," explains one refugee leader, "the Cubans
keep their national identity, their heritage, traditions,
hatreds and their hopes of going back to their homeland.
And they know they can't go back until Castro is gone. So
they dream of toppling Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in
other places in the United States seems very possible in the
atmosphere in Miami."
In the early 1960s, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the
Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitable.
It was U.S. policy to drive him from power. There was an
attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 with an
army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in secret by the
CIA. The invaders were not given the air cover necessary for
a successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only
180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The
Cubans felt betrayed.
Then came other American moves against Castro. There
was a secret "Operation Mongoose," which included efforts
to assassinate the Cuban leader. The United States backed an
economic blockade of Cuba in an attempt to prevent Castro
from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipment from
abroad. Later, Cuban refugees were used to carry out secret
operations not only in the Caribbean but also in other parts
´of Latin America-and even in Africa.
To many Cuban refugees, attacking Castro and Commu-
nism became a way of life.
Since then, however, American policy has failed to match
in intensity the fierce anti-Castro passion of the more mili-
tant refugees. In recent years, prominent members of the
U.S. Senate have visited Cuba. In 1973, Cuba made an
agreement with the United States to curb the airplane
hijackers who had been using Cuba as asylum. There were
moves on both sides toward normalization of relations be.
tween Cuba and the U.S.
As their hopes of American action against Castro ebbed,
some Cuban refugees turned to violence on their own. .The.
box on this page gives the chronology of developments.
TERRORIST LEADERS AND TACTICS
Though their numbers are small, the 300 or fewer active
terrorists have organized themselves into many groups.
Stogas of one group chalked on the walls in "Little Havana"
have barely begun to fade before they are replaced by the

And I'm in the middle. So, anyway, I go, I go to the
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She
needed material. Now as soon as we walked into the
mission everybody there I know because they reside in
the building. And they all say, "Ilonka Marischa
blah, blah, blah, blah." And I'm very friendly with
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you
want?", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please.
I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he
is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...
What wire are you talking about?
A wire on me
Oh.
Because...
That the agents (unintelligible)
Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian
way...
Yeah.
And he'll feel that and I'm dead.

realize what a bomb this is? This top KGB spy wants
you?"
And I said, "Well", I say "he's not really my
type.", I said but again, the best interests of the
country, but how far do you want me to go? And he
said "all the way". I said what is all the way? He
said, "You start with a Christmas card." Well the
Christmas card was answered by Oleg going to Louis
and saying, "I got Ilonka's Christmas card. Where is
she living, Louis?" You know, so John talked me into
calling the mission. I call up the mission, across
from 19th precinct, and I said, "Oleg, this is Ilonka
Marischa. Hello darling", you know, and this, this
and this. And I said oh boy everything is wired and
everything from the mission anyway. But he's top dog
there. He is top dog in the mission. He has the.
say. He's a very important person in the Soviet
mission. Anyway, John okays a telephone coil pickup
that I have on my phone to a Soni tape recorder. We
make a tape of this because John Kotter is sitting on
pins and needles waiting for me to replay that tape
on what Oleg tells me, you know? Oleg doubletalks
but we get a message that we want to meet, you know?
So they had some kind of a security council and we
made a date and it was postponed. Oleg called up
and apologized which I also have on tape. And each
time the Bureau was very happy. We're gonna start a
blossoming relationship here, you know, and end up
with photographs and better something, which I don't
think I would have gone all the way. But that's what
their idea was so they can exchange at a later date.
Blackmail?
Well...
into
Blackmail him / giving them information
(unintelligible).
Say like they get one of our, one of our pilots, right?
And if we don't get our pilot back they expose Oleg,
right? Or make him..

I said Oleg's in the United Nations. Why don't you
tell me these things before that they're delayed at
a security council meeting, you know, instead of me
letting, letting me sit there. You know these are
all the little things that use to annoy me...
Yeah.
that they have to screen things first before, you
know - check things out, don't have to make a blunder
like that. Anyway, I said I left Oleg a note. I
said now you go home and I'm going to take it easy
and they, we tried, and I said, "You know, John,
you're just going to get me so involved with Oleg.
I'm not going to end up in bed in a motel room
upstate somewhere with Oleg so you can come in and
take photographs. That's not my stick." I said
I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in
bed. I said that's too big a pawn for me and I'm
not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,
perpetrator has and wants to blackmail me with and I
asked the FBI to please help me with that.
Who's the perpetrator?
The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,
aka David Ring, who broke into my apartment and stole
this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with it. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He
pistol-whipped me and I asked the Bureau for help.
Did he try to throw you out the 18 story build-, window?
Yes.
He did what?
Yes, he tried to push me out the window.

So what happened?
fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk my
way out of it. It was just one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left. I don't believe it. And my husband
said "yes, she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it. And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay together." Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until my
husband made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it damn plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over. Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street.
I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on 88th Street?
You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me. You can feel it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up, Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.
With the FBI?
Now
FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,
"John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out
with me.
And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
"Hey, wait a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put my
phone number on the bottom, something you know?
Or I'll happen to be there when he's going into the
building, or I'll bump into him." I said you don't
just call him up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I've been avoiding him. So, anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing. I said what
have you got planned, John. And he says, "Do you

diamonds, and Al, what do I do. Go ahead, talk to
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.
I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.
I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
"Money, why does anybody want diamonds." I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?' And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So
he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash.
How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?
Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for
you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred thousand dollars worth because
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds." And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got
the diamonds. Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in the apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington, D.C. Uncle Al said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld or give them
the cash." I said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C.
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick
because he was in my house with a hundred thousand
dollars worth of uncut, hot diamonds.
By himself?
By himself, and I was supposed to get the cash from
Oleg.
Oleg said on a Thursday and Uncle Al came on

Like you say, eyes were watching you.
Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.
Sure.
Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.
For what reason?
He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?
Yeah, he thought you were Russians.
He thought I was a Russian.
Or a Russian sympathizer.
Right, especially going in with a child and I looked
very...
Yeah.
American. Anyway, I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And I said, he said "Are
you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?"
Yeah.

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of
the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested on the assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBI. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My
husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I
worked for him and I don't know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.
They even, off duty...
The off-duty police, police officers take my children
home...
And they spend time at the house?
And they spend time at the house in their free time

until last month, last week and I've just, and I need
help. There is no help. I mean since last month and
I don't want my children hurt. They've already been
hurt.
Alright, I promise to turn this tape and the code over

Who in turn will turn the information over to the
proper officials in Washington, D. C.
Yes. I don't mean to embarass the Bureau. I know how
important it is but at this point I need help

You an American citizen?
Yes.
Were you born here?
Born in Braemen, Germany on August 18, 1939 and my
mother registered me at birth with the Consulate
because she was stuck in the war over there, but I
am an American citizen, not naturalized or anything.
I was registered as an American citizen.
How old were you when you came to the United States?
I was about 12, came over on the U.S.S. Henry Gibbons,
American troop transport, because my mother worked for
the United States Army.
Okay, now we're going to go ahead and jump. You went
to Cuba what month and what year and on what ship?
I met, I went, I took several trips with my father
who was Commander of the oceanliner Berlin. I met
Fidel...
What was your father's full name?
Commander Heinrich Frederick Lorenz.
And how old was he?
Approximately 50-something, 55, when I first, I went
on several trips to Cuba before I met Fidel with,
but I was a little girl.
When's the first time you went to Cuba after Fidel
took over the government on January 1, 1959?
I met Fidel February 28, 1959, on one of my father's
cruises where Fidel came aboard with several of his
men. He said he saw the oceanliner from the Havana
Hilton balcony and he took a launch with his Chief
of the Navy, what's his name, I forgot, Castagna..

Forget it, forget about it, we can go ahead. Who
else was there besides the chief of the Cuban navy.

slogans and initials of yet another group. Among groups
named in testimony before the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee are: Accion Cubana, or Cuban Action; Alpha
66, a name adopted when victory in 1966 seemed possible;
FLNC, standing for Frente de Liberacion Nacional de Cuba,
which means Cuban National Liberation Front, and Pragma-
tistas, which means what it sounds like-pragmatists.
group calling itself Zero issued a "death list" of people
marked for killing and, according to officials, several persons
on the list soon died violent deaths.
Dade County's antiterrorist head, Lieutenant Lyons, says
he has stopped trying to keep track of the groups and instead
concentrates on trying to solve the crimes that they are.
suspected of having committed. He has no shortage of
business. Here is a sample of the violence attributed to
terrorists in the last two years:
• Since February, 1975, there have been at least seven
assassination attempts directed against refugee leaders who
were viewed as opponents of the terrorists' tactics. Three
men were shot to death. One was killed by a bomb. Three
other attempted killings failed, but a prominent radio broad-
caster lost both legs below the knees when a bomb ripped his
car apart.
• On Dec. 3-4, 1975, bombs blasted the Miami office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Social Security office, a
State unemployment office, two post offices, a bank, a State
attorney's office and the Miami police-department headquar-
ters. A man accused of those bombings, and also the bombing
of the Miami International Airport two months earlier, was
acquitted recently in a federal court. He is to be tried again
in a State court.
• A number of bombs have been exploded in New York.
One blew out the window of the Venezuelan consulate on
Fifth Avenue, across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral.
• On Feb. 12, 1976, a Soviet freighter, the Dzhordano
Bruno, was sitting motionless 35 miles off Cuba's north coast
while its tanks were being cleaned. Suddenly a small boat
raced close to the freighter and raked it with heavy machine-
gun fire. No one was injured.
• On April 6, 1976, two Cuban fishing boats were attacked
and a fisherman was killed.
• On Sept. 21, 1976, in Washington, D.C., a bomb ex-
ploded in a car and killed Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean
Ambassador to the U.S. under the Marxist regime of the late
President Salvador Allende. Although the crime is officially
insolved, there have been persistent reports that the bomb
was planted by Cuban terrorists as a "favor" to the secret
olice of the present anti-Cominunist Government in Chile.
NEW TERRORIST STRATEGY
Leaders of the terrorist bands are hard to identify. But one
an has emerged as an apparent leader: Dr. Orlando Bosch,
pediatrician. He was caught firing a bazooka at a Polish
p in Miami harbor in 1968 and was sentenced to 10 years
prison.
Dr. Bosch was released on parole after four years, but he
ortedly returned to the movement. He is now under
st in Venezuela, charged along with three other men-in
nection with the Cuban airliner bombing. Dr. Bosch is
ribed as the leader of the group calling itself Accion
ana.
June of this year, Dr. Bosch called a small group of his
activists together in the Dominican Republic. They
sharply divided on policy and strategy.
_ He wanted to avoid the risks of further attacks in the
1 States and to concentrate their efforts against Cástro
this country. Others held out for continuing their
ies both here and-abroad.

Automobile bombing that killed a Cuban refugee in Miami is one
of many unsolved crimes attributed to anti-Castro terrorists.
to focus their efforts outside the U.S. To direct the activities,
a new group was formed with the initials CORU, which stand
for Coordinacion de Organizaciones Revolucionaires Unidas
in Spanish or Co-ordinating Committee of United Revolu-
tionary Organizations in English.
American law-enforcement officials say that members of
CORU have the backing of powerful forces, perhaps even
the governments themselves, in some countries of Latin
America. The terrorists are described as "at home" in Haiti,
the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Chile. They are well
armed for terroristic acts, as shown in the box on page 32.
Since the June meeting, a new wave of terrorism has swept
across the Caribbean and beyond. Bombs have damaged
Cuban airline facilities in Barbados, Jamaica and Panama.
Two Cuban officials were kidnaped in Argentina.
On July 23, three men who had flown from Miami carrying
three coffee cans filled with plastic explosive attempted to
kidnap Cuban Consul Daniel Ferrer Fernandez in Mérida,
Mexico. He escaped, but a Cuban fisheries expert was killed.
The most serious act of terrorism came on October 6,
when a Cubana Airlines DC-8 exploded in flight shortly after
taking off from Barbados. The plane fell into the sea, killing
73 persons including members of the Cuban national fencing
team.
In messages to news media, both CORU and El Condor, a
group unheard of previously, claimed responsibility for the
crash of the plane.
Dr. Bosch, who has traveled freely on documents appar-
ently provided by officials of Governments friendly to the
anti-Castro movement, was picked up in Venezuela and on
November 2 was charged with homicide in connection with
the plane crash. Three other men are similarly charged.
The arrests of Dr. Bosch and his cohorts, instead of
reducing terrorist violence, may actually stimulate more
violence. El Condor, in a message to the United Press
International on November 19, said the four men held by the
Venezuelans are innocent and warned that, if they are
convicted, planes of the Venezuelan International Airways
will be attacked. On the same day, CORU sent a message'
saying it would join with the Honduran Anti-Communist"
Alliance in attacks on three airlines that plan excursion
flights to Havana.
Roberto Carballo, a militant leader of veterans of the Bay
of Pigs invasion, denounced the threatened attacks. "It aids
Castro by making all Cuban exiles look like mad bombers,"
Carballo said.

CRACKDOWN BY LAW OFFICERS
Since last spring, there has been a sharp. reduction in
terroristic violence in the Miami area. That may be as much
due to a successful counterattack by law-enforcement agen-
cies as to the policy that was adopted by CORU last June.
Early this year, an antiterrorist task force was organized

to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.
And he offered you a job, right?
Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts, and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well. My father is diplomatic and they
exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and
stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.
How old were you then?
Nineteen, nineteen years old.
Did you get off the ship and stay there?
No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,
asked me for my phone number and address in New York
and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't
believe it.

He called, he called you, he knew just about what
time you were going to arrive in New York and when

The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I
heard "hello".
Did he speak Cuban or English to you?
He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess
he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I
think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.
I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep.

CUBAN EXTREMISTS
[continued from preceding page]
includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po-
lice, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,
its agents work closely with it.
With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of
the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of
suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-
pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence
can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to
prosecute them.
A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might
have some knowledge of terror operations.
Efforts of law-enforcement officials to deal with the terror-
ist groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists
seem to know what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons
relates that one suspect "identified one of my officers who
had never met him before, called him by name and told him
what section he worked in and what his duties were."
Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties. Most of
them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Govern-
ment. Many have had several roles: members of the U.S.
Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee
leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found
the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to."
A further complication is the heavy infiltration of the
terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence
corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as
agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to
discredit the refugees and influence American policy.
The Cuban Prime Minister has "surfaced" enough of such
agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Early this year,
for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was
named in Senate committee testimony as having been in-
volved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana.
In an April 22 broadcast by Radio Havana, De Armas said
that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a
man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had
provided him with the explosives.
In a speech on October 15, Castro boasted of a double
agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions

ment and instructions he has received.'
Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other
acts of violence. "Who else but the CIA. . . can carry out
these acts?" Castro asked.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.
involvement in the airliner bombing. He said: "I can state
categorically that no official of the United States Govern-
ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in
contact with the American Government has had anything to
do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this
totally reprehensible."
The CIA declines to discuss Cuban refugee terrorism.
Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously
doubt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for
some of its earlier activities, is still involved in operations
against the Castro regime. However, the agency is described
as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist
groups. “We have absolutely no contact with the CIA," says
Lieutenant Lyons. "I'd like to, but they don't talk to us." One
reason for that attitude may be that laws bar the CIA from
domestic law-enforcement activities.
Other laws, or the lack of them, also complicate the fight
against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved
in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless
the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it
illegal to conspire in this country to commit crimes abroad or
to export arms without a license.
Although shocked by the October 6 airliner bombing, U.S.
officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for
the FBI to enter that case.
With such handicaps as these, law-enforcement officials say
they can look forward to only limited success against the
terrorists. Any real solution to the problem must come from
within the Cuban refugee community-and investigators
state that the co-operation they get there does not extend to
cases of violence committed outside the U.S.
WHAT HAVE TERRORISTS GAINED?
As officials size up the effects of the terrorist campaign:
The only tangible accomplishment has been to push Castro
into renouncing the antihijacking
treaty, thus discouraging efforts to-
ward a diplomatic reconciliation be-
tween the United States and Cuba.
A further measure comes from this tally
of extremists weapons confiscated by Mi-
ami- law enforcement officers so far in
1975-76

1 20-mm cannon, with 100 rounds of
explosive ammunition

Despite all the terrorist plots and
attacks, Castro remains firmly seat-
ed as head of a Communist regime
in Cuba. And it appears to the refu-
gees almost inevitable that the.
movement toward some kind of ac
commodation with Castro will be
resumed by American policy mak-
ers. Throughout Little Havana,"
the fear is widespread that Jimmy
Carter, when he becomes Presi
dent, will give new impetus to this
movement, and that their homeland
will never be liberated from Com-
munist rule.
To both officials and Cuban-refu
gee leaders, it seems inevitable that.
the terrorists will continue their at
teinpts to keep the two countries
apart by the only method they
know further acts of violence

you gonna do it?
Mmm.
You know we get back to the same thing again. Yeah,
you're looking for protection. So far the people
you've worked with, so far this man Pucci who you
saved his life, and saved another undercover agent's
life whose working with the FBI. These people are
powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't
that correct? One time they almost threw you out of
an 18 story building. Another time you got pistol-
whipped. You did all this crap for these people
here yet they will do nothing to go ahead at the
present time, and this is on record in their own
files and so forth, yet you cannot move them to give
you or your children any protection. This piece of
tape is going to go right to Senator Baker's office,
it'll go to Howard Liebengood for him to listen to,
to evaluate it and turn this tape over to the proper
authorities which will be the Justice Department.
You can call Howard Liebengood to see if he has
received those codes from the Albanian Embassy from
me. You can call him and find out, and also you
can call him at the same time and let him know if
a tape has been turned over to him. As a matter of
fact when I get there Friday and leave this in his

get a hold of you, because I'm gonna leave your phone

SUBJECT: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION OF JANUARY 19, 1977
I called Larry Callahan at 2:00 p.m. to advise him that
the Commiteee desired to interview Mr. Gene A. Boren, of
the IRS, at the earliest available opportunity and requested
his advice and assistance to accomplish this. Callahan was
nervous about the Committee's eagerness to proceed in response
to the memorandum for fear that we would be interfering with
an on-going criminal investigation.
He noted the FBI was looking
into this and he would have to check with the Bureau to
ascertain the feasibility of proceeding unilaterally. I told
Callahan we did not want to interfere with a criminal investi-
gation and that I did not feel that our interview of the IRS
employee would fall into that category. Callahan referred to
a possible obstruction of justice on the part of that employee
in that the information had been withheld for approximately
five years.
At 2:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from Paul Daly
urging Committee restraint in unilaterally investigating
subject matter. Daly noted the Bureau had just received this
information and was intending to interview the IRS employee.

Well, I, yes.
Alright now, these burglaries, did they consist of
you and your husband doing the burglaries or you by
yourself?
Well my husband had the master keys.
Right, alright.
And...
Well when you did these burglaries...
We all did them together. They're were about 5, 6,
7 cars. One stationed in front of the Soviet Mission.
Suppose, say like they were interested in one Soviet
who they lost track of, who was supposed to be in
Washington, D. C., and then they found him all of a
sudden in our building because they had surveillance
across the street. That's the first thing - they set
up surveillance, a camera, high-power camera across
the street. That we were pointed out to. That
everybody who went in and out of the building was
photographed.

him and we found him and he's in the building and we
want to get in the apartment. We feel he has, for
national security reasons, we want to enter that
apartment. Louis, will you cooperate?" You know?
And my husband said, "Alright".
Did he said he had to discuss it with you?
They discussed it in front of me.
I mean did your husband say he had, he would discuss

No, no, but he did, but he didn't ask me because I
asked my husband later, I said, "Louis, if you refuse

know immediately someone was in the apartment.
Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door
over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,
hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,
this, not Cuban general, this Russian general, who is
a top KGB agent...
Yes.

leave something on the door.
Yes.
They inspected the door, right? And they didn't find
anything?
Right.
Right. So they opened the door. In other words, what-
ever they touched...
But they made a mistake inside on one break-in and

In the apartment, approximately 10-15-20 minutes.

memo to the Committee's attention so promptly, as the Bureau
had intended to brief the Committee at the conclusion of their
investigation. Daly seemed most concerned that the IRS delay
in bringing the matter to the Bureau's attention and assured
us that the Bureau was desirous of cooperating fully. He
noted the information had been furnished by Justice absent
a specific inquiry from the Committee and that we were being
unreasonable if we desired to pursue the matter further at
this time. I asked Daly what information was available at the
Bureau on Brading and Hunt. He said there was a large quantity
of information available on both and that he felt he could pull
that material which related to the assassination quickly, but
would be reluctant to produce the information in its entirety.
I told him to ascertain this afternoon what information could
be produced immediately and he said that he would.
At 2:45 p.m. I talked again with Callahan who indicated

the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.
The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their
own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the

children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their

time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was
the most valuable source of information for the
Bureau, and that was...
Garbage and trash.
Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you

Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because
I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which

they had about 30, 30 families who resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my
husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in
charge of the building. That same day they had a so-
called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,.

know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here started this demonstration.
So then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like.
Yeah.
So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line...
Marita, what we're going into details is something
that is a story.
Oh, alright.
So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in the

said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do
some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room.

considerable time went by before Attorney General, Levi could
address the issue of whether or not to entrust this matter to
the Bureau. Approximately one week ago, Justice went to Jim
Adams of the FBI with the request to look into the allegation
and was surprised to find that Adams was already apprised of
the situation and investigating, i.e., general indexes.
Apparently, Adams had been in receipt of similar information
in recent days.
Yesterday, in response to the Attorney General's request
for information, Paul Daly hand carried to Callahan the Bureau's
response (which is dated January 14) and today Callahan hand
carried the package to us over Assistant Attorney General
Uhlmann; s signature.
Callahan advised that Daly was upset that
the Committee had been so promptly advised for fear that we
would interupt the Bureau's inquiry. Callahan apologized for
the lack of responsiveness on the part of Justice and the Bureau
but things are in disarray with Levi about to depart. I assured
Callahan we did not desire to interfere in the investigation
but desired to be promptly informed of any developments and
that we would stay in touch with Paul Daly in that regard
Callahan promised to expedite any Committee requests as
made.

him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.
I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.
I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
"Money, why does anybody want diamonds. I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?" And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So
he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash.
How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?
Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for
you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred thousand dollars worth because
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds.".. And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got
the diamonds. Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in the apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington, D.C. Uncle Al said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld or give them
the cash. I said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C.
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,

stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,

Berzofsky, the Second Secretary to the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republic.
What was his first name, do you know?
Mmmm, I forgot...
That's alright, it don't matter.
I forgot really. But we were very close to him. His
wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and
she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to
have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first
met her, like my daughter. My daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and
the little girl, at sixteen, Irene was sent back to
the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father
was heartbroken. I guess like any mother and father
when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I
do so and pass along to them empirin and codine #4,

them all. They all love my daughter. But we're
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know?
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you
want?", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please.
I'd like to speak to him.' And she called and he
is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...
11
What wire are you talking about?
A wire on me.
Oh.
Because...
That the agents (unintelligible)
But my
Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian
way...
Yeah.
And he'll feel that and I'm dead.
Right.
Right in the mission. That's not my proper there.
Right.

a Wednesday and the whole thing...
So what happened?

fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk my
way out of it. It was just one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left. I don't believe it. And my husband
said "yes, she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it." And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay together. Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until my
husband made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it damn plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over. Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street.
I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on 88th Street?
You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me.
You can feel it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up, Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.
. With the FBI?
Now
FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,
"John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis.. He wants to go out
with me. And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
"Hey, wait a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put my
phone number on the bottom, something you know?
Or I'll happen to be there when he's going into the
building, or I'll bump into him." I said you don't
just call him up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I've been avoiding him. So, anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing. I said what
have you got planned, John. And he says, "Do you
That's the idea.

with the permission of
the FBI. We exchanged jewelry, clothes, and everything
else. We were just one mother to another mother.
Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and
it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. I don't know. . .
Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?
Well, now we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?
He was the KGB spy that they lost and thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia. He was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They lost him and they were
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. And he, we had a lot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,
In other words he asked you to go out, did he ask
(unintelligible)
Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also knew I had diamonds and he asked me,
(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"
What did he call you?
Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.
Oh, that's in Russian?
Yes.
And we always exchanged Russian words and I
know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,
you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a
fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind
of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of
the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested on the assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBI. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My
husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I
worked for him and I don't know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.
They even, off duty...
The off-duty police, police officers take my children
home...
And they spend time at the house?
And they spend time at the house in their free time
when they should be home with their families.
Well you have saved the life of two people, right?
I would think so.
Well, you have.
Yes.
When, one of the, who are the two people you saved
their lives?

Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.
Sure.
Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.
For what reason?
He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?
Yeah, he thought you were. Russians.
He thought I was a Russian.
Or a Russian sympathizer.
Right, especially going in with a child and I looked
very..
Yeah.
American. Anyway, I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And I said, he said "Are
you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?"
Yeah.

I need some type of help for my children, because of
this man Pinno threatening to expose my dealings with
the FBI and to the foreign press. I just caught up
in this thing since 1959 and I've been with it up
until last month, last week and I've just, and I need
help. There is no help. I mean since last month and
I don't want my children hurt. They've already been
hurt.
Alright, I promise to turn this tape and the code over
to Senator Baker's committee, right?
Yes.
Who in turn will turn the information over to the
proper officials in Washington, D. C.
Yes. I don't mean to embarass the Bureau. I know how
important it is but at this point I need help
desparately for my kids. They're 6 and 14 and they
don't deserve what they have to go through. The

I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in
bed. I said that's too big a pawn for me and I'm
not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,

asked the FBI to please help me with that.
Who's the perpetrator?
The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,

this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with it. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He

Committee was considering going to Dallas and interfering with
the investigation. He specifically that the Director be given
an opportunity to talk with Inouye prior to any such action.
I told Daly that it was merely the Committee's desire to go

to Senster Mansfield expressing our concern over the rush of
the Central Intelligence Agency to destray large quantities of
secret government documents. da believe the Select Committee
on Intelligence should review with CIA Director Bush what
specifically the Agency intends to destray before defag se.
It is likely that there are numerous pemoranda and other documents
which are of extreme importance to the committee, which are central
to the committee's executing the Sonately sandate of comprehensive
and complete oversight of executive intelligance ^eneles.
Be noge that the Senators serving on the Intelligence
Cospeittee take whatever steps necessary to stop the destruction
af materials by the Central Intelligence Agency until such time
as the Committee can review the content and Importance of that date.

to our request. Our action was taken to facilitate the inquiry being

In accordance with your letter of 10 June 1976, we have
extended the period of the moratorium on the destruction of certain
records which were the subject of your letter of 27 January 1975
in connection with S. Res. 21. The moratorium will expire on

In addition, before any such records are destroyed, we
shall transmit to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence copies
of the record schedules which are submitted to the National Archives.
and Record Service for their approval prior to the destruction of any
records. The same will be done with respect to those routine
administrative records which, although not involved under S. Res. 21,
were withheld from routine destruction during the life of that Resolution.
I am confident that suitable arrangements can be made for review of
documents before they are destroyed if this is the desire of the Select
Committee.
It is hoped that these arrangements are fully responsive to

Honorable Michael J. Mansfield

133 Russell Bldg.
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator Mansfield:
agn
George Bush's letter to Senator Hugh Scott, with a copy to
you, of the 2nd of Jusse is disturbingly ambiguous. In stating
that the CIA now believes itself relieved of the reappasibility
of maintaining data "which were subjest to investigation by the
Rockefeller Commission and the Select Committee," the Agency
failed to make any effort to identify what materials were targeted
for destruction and which weren't. Further, the next to last
sentence of Mr. Bush's letter, "I trust you (Senator Scots) a
that this action is now necessary and appropriate, and I would
appreciate your confirmation of this understanding," has led
same observers in the Senate to conclude no destruction will
take place until such donfirmation is been given. This does
not appear to be true. Reither the press office nor the legis-
lative contúléhat would confirm that destruction of date has not
already occurred, or would not occur without acquisence from the
Senate Leadership. To the contrary, the legislative counsel's
office informed this group that the "process" of destruction has
already begun.
The action of the General Intelligence Agency is wrong.
3
The new Select Committee on Intelligence should have been
consulted prior to the destruction of any materials which might
be vital to the proper functioning of that committee and which
in any case are within the legislative and oversight domain of
that commite Chairman Inouye and Vice-Chairman Baker, along
with the membership of the Intelligence Committee should have
the opportunity to review the data selected for destruction and
to determine, in conjunction with the CIA, theppropriety of
destroying or maintaining such data.

that the Central Intelligence Agency "not destroy, remove from [its] pos-
session or control, or otherwise dispose or permit the disposal of any
records or documents which might have a bearing on the subjects under
investigation, including but not limited to all records or documents per-
taining in any way to the matters set out in section 2 of S. Res. 21."
In response to this request, the Agency placed in effect a complete
moratorium on the destruction of records, including normal administrative
records scheduled for routine destruction.
The purpose of this letter is to advise you that it is our intention to
proceed with destruction of records, now that the Select Committee has
completed its investigation and issued its final report. We have so advised
Senator Church.
Along with the backlog of routine administrative records, the Agency
will destroy records which were collected and maintained by the Agency
and which were subject to investigation by the Rockefeller Commission
and the Select Committee. The Agency is required to destroy much of
this latter material by the Privacy Act of 1974 (P. L. 93-579) and by
Executive Order 11905. Of course, all records destruction will be fully
consistent with other applicable laws, Presidential directives, and the
requirements of pending litigation and Justice Department investigations.
I trust you agree that this action is now necessary and appropriate,
and I would appreciate your confirmation of this understanding.
I am sending a duplicate of this letter to Senator Hugh Scott.
Sincerely,
Bul
George Bush

HE NEW YORK TIMES,
Hunt Sons Charge
C.I.A. Used Agents
To Embezzle Funds
K&T100 Hunt
DALLAS, July 22 (UPI)-Two
sons of H. L. Hunt, the late
billionaire contending they
were discriminated against be-
cause of their conservative
views, charged today that the
Central Intelligence Agency in-
filtrated the family oil empire
and used secret agents to help
embezzle more than $50-mil.
lion from them.
The brothers, Nelson Bunker
Hunt and W. Herbert Hunt,
said new Federal charges that
they had tried to cover up
a family wiretapping scheme
were a further result of an
attempt by the C.I.A. to discred-
it the Hunt oil empire. They
said they held the C.I.A. re-
sponsible for earlier. Federal
charges that they had spied
on aides of their father,
They said their refusal to
allow the C.I.A. to use their
overseas Hunt Oil Company af-
filiate for espionge had led
to the Federal charges against
them.
"After turning down the
C.I.A., a massive embezzlement
scheme involving loses of over
$50-million from the Hunt Oil
Company were uncovered," the
brothers said in a news release,
"An investigation disclosed
that some of the Hunt employes
involved in the scheme were
secret Government agents.".
A spokesman at C.I.A. head-
quarters outside Washington
said, "Since it appears such a
complicated matter, the agen-
cy's legal people would like
time to find out what it is all
about."
A Federal grand jury yester
day charged the Hunt brothers,
Percy Foreman of Houston, a
criminal lawyer, three other
attorneys and a retired Texas
industrialist with obstruction
of justice for allegedly trying
to thwart the wiretap investiga-
tion.

Senator Mike Mansfield

Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Senator Mansfield:
You may recall that some weeks ago you were kind enough to arrange a
meeting between myself and Mr. William Miller, of the staff of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence. You arranged this meeting for me so that I could
present documents, which I showed you, relating to possible CIA illegal activ-
ities in Indochina. Specifically, as you know, I have long been interested in
the problem of who carried out the massive defoliation raids against Cambodia,
one year prior to the U.S. incursions into that country and during a time when,
formally, there were normal relations between the United States and the Royal
government of Cambodia. After talking with you about the matter, I met, for
about one-half hour, with Mr. Miller and showed him the documents I showed you.
He made some notes and assured me that the question of possible illegal activ-
ities of the CIA in Indochina, including Cambodia, was on the agenda of his
committee. Sometime ago, I wrote Mr. Miller to find out when he expected the
committee might look into Indochina. However, as has been the case since
August, with respect to communications from this committee, I have as yet re-
ceived no answer, not even an acknowledgement of receipt. I have just read
in the press that the Senate Intelligence Committee expects again to look at
Chile, Cuba, etc., but there is no indication of any interest in Indochina.
I would greatly appreciate your help in learning whether, in fact, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence will look into possible illegal confert opera-
tions of ".S.
. intelligence agencies in Indochina. I would also appreciate
your views as to what I should do to get an investigation of the massive clan-
destine herbicide attack on Cambodia (1969). This was a unique operation in
technological history of foreign relations and as a biologist I am most inter-
ested and concerned to get the full story on this bizarre incident. If the
Senate Select Committee will not ask obvious questions of the intelligence
community, I would greatly appreciate your views on whom I should turn to, to
ask these questions.
I want to thank you again for your help on my last trip to Washington.
I
regret that I have to keep bothering you about this matter, but I do hope you
understand my concern, based on my personal observations in Indochina, that
the facts about covert operations there be publically determined.
Sincerely yours
E. W. Pfeiffer

JMM) Met with Senator Frank Church regarding
a letter he had written to Professor E. W. Pfeiffer of the University of
Montana, stating that Senator Church had reliable information that Air
America was responsible for defoliation operations in Cambodia. A
copy of Senator Church's letter had been sent to the Director for comment
by Professor Arthur H. Westing, Windham College in Vermont. I
explained to the Senator we were much concerned over this allegation and
the Director authorized me to deny it categorically. I added that while we
were not prying into the identity of the Senator's source, we were curious
as to whether this source's allegations were based on honest mistake or
malice. If the former, I suggested the Senator might wish to straighten
him out. Senator Church said he couldn't remember off hand where he
learned this information but would check his files. He said he fully accepted
our denial.

Dear Mr. Wallach:
As decided in our phone conversation today, I am
writing to you about a conversation I had last week in
Paris with an official of the Royal Government of Cambodia.
He informed me that CIA-directed activities hostile to his
government are presently occurring in his country, and that
these activities are being launched from bases in Thailand.
I would greatly appreciate your assistance in finding out for
me whether any agency of the U.S. Government is presently
carrying out activities against the Royal Government of
Cambodia.
I greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk with
you in person recently, and thank you for your interest
and help.
Sincerely yours,

With Respect to Intelligence Activities
Room 607, Capitol Hill Hotel
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Mr. Miller:
Recently I discussed with Dr. E. W. Pfeiffer, University of Montana
zoologist, an incident in which he has had an abiding concern: the
herbicide attack that occurred in eastern Cambodia in the spring of
1969.
As I understand it, from my talks with Dr. Pfeiffer and from my
review of the correspondence he has received from various agencies,
there is no doubt that the attack actually occurred, that it was
large and significant, and that the nature of the chemicals and
aircraft involved indicate that the U.S. had a direct role in
carrying it out.
Yet it seems the State and Defense departments, the CIA and the
"private" CIA-affiliate Air America have all denied in one way or
another that they conducted the attack.
The obvious question is who did make the attack? Who ordered it,
why was it ordered and under what authority? Dr. Pfeiffer has
indicated your committee is looking into this matter and that the
affair may ultimately be discussed in the course of Select Committee
hearings at some point.
Is it possible for you to tell me the status of your inquiry? Would
it be appropriate at this time for our newspaper to interview Dr.
Pfeiffer and write a news story on the documents he has received,
or would such a study benefit from new information your committee
efforts may resurrect within the near future?
Thanks in advance for your interest. We have followed with great
interest the Select Committee efforts to date.

Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Miller:
Through the good offices of Senator Mansfield, we met some
weeks ago to discuss certain problems related to possible CIA
activity in Cambodia. As you know, I am particularly interested
in why the CIA cannot or will not find out who carried out the
massive herbicide attack against Cambodia in the spring of 1969.
The CIA has under the Freedom of Information Act provided me
with some documents from my file which bear directly upon this
strange episode and Senator Church's efforts to find out information
for me. When we met you indicated that CIA activities in Indochina
were to be investigated by the Select Committee. I would greatly'
appreciate knowing about when you think this subject will come
up. I would also very much like to submit some of the documents
I have received from the CIA and my personal testimony to the
Committee. I believe that Professor A. Westing and myself were
the last official guests of the Sihanouk regime before it was
temporarily deposed.
I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.

Memorandum
MM
To: Terry Lenzner
From: Jim Moore
Subject: Robert Maheu John Roselli
2/14/74
:
Hereis a summary of what I have done on the Roselli-Maheu
connection.
Yesterday I spoke with David Nissen, who prosecuted Roselli in
1968 for being an unregistered alien and for being involved with hidden
owners in the Friar's Clubi case. Nissen never met Maheu or spoke with
him. However, he did remember that stories about Maheu and Roselli
being involved in anti-Castro plots did come to his attention when he was
investigating and prosecuting Roselli. He couldn't remember the source.
of those stories, saying that his information came from many people,
including Justice Department lawyers in Washington and the FBI. One
story he heard was that Maheu tried to intervene in Washington, either
through direct contacts in the FBI or at Justice or through Edward P.
Morgan, to kill the Roselli prosecution on the basis that Roselli had helped
the United States in Cuba. Maheu was reportedly an old CIA agent,. Nissen
remembers hearing at some point that Roselli had gone to Cuba in an attempt
to assasinate Castro.
Nissen said that there are extensive files on Roselli maintained by
the FBI or the Department. Nissen had a vague recollection that the files
contained a story about Maheu somehow being involved in a wiretap on Sam
Giancona, for whom Roselli worked. Nissen also remembered information
about a meeting between Maheu and Giancona regarding Cuba, but he couldn't
remember any of the specifics.

When Roselli came up for sentencing, he was represented by Tom
Wadden, who had been associated in some capacity with Edward Bennett
Williams. Wadden filed a motion to reduce sentence and included with it
two columns by Jack Anderson that recounted the story of Roselli and Maheu
trying to assasinate Castro. Nissen thought the motion might also have
included an affidavit from Edward P. Morgan. The government successfully
resisted the motion on the grounds of fraud, since Wadden produced no
witnesses or documentation to support his claim. I called the Federal Court
in Los Angeles, and they have sent the motion for reduction of sentence and
attached papers to us. The Clerk there told me that in addition to the Anderson
columns, the motion included affidavits from Anderson and Les Whitten
vouching for the unnamed source of the columns...
Roselli is now in Florida so he can be reached, but, according to
Nissen, Giancona is in exile somewhere in Mexico.

Dear Professor Pfeiffer:
Please forgive my delay in replying to your
last letter of March 29, 1971. Although the De-
partment of State has offered to make the Seventh
Air Force Study available to me at the Department,
I frankly have not had the chance to get down and
study it.
I have been told, however, that Air America
was responsible for the Cambodion defoliation. My
source was not the State Department, but rather an
individual who is in s position to know the facts
in this matter.
It would be most useful to have a full study
of the extent and the effects of our defoliation
program in Southeast Asia. Perhaps you and Arthur
Weeting and others could get together to make a pro-
posal for a study of this nature.
With best wishes,
fincerely
Sincerely,

philosophy is not one of promotion of

says. "Each of us has his own interests.
All of us operate in the oil business,

eople think of him as a sort of a Mr.

o be committed, he goes into that little
hone booth and comes out with an 'S':

lucky 11 trusts
run basically by employees of the com-
pany. We all will continue to operate
out of the Hunt Oil office."
Maxfield, who has been observing
the Hunts for nine years as Lamar's
partner, believes that Hunt Oil and
Placid Oil will carry on the monolithic
base of the family fortune. "It's like a
tree trunk, with each brother having
his own branch," he says. "Oil is not an
expression of the personality of the
sons as it was of the old man. The ex-
pression of the brothers will be in the
branches-Ray in real estate; Lamar
sports; Bunker horses, commodities,
and agriculture; Herbert in real estate,
residential development, and commodi-
ties." And while the brothers are
branching out, Maxfield believes, "they
will run the oil companies collectively
with a professional staff."
The bedrock of Lamar's personal for-
une is the trust that his father set up
or him in 1935 as part of a tax
trategy planned with the aid of yet-
ran Hunt attorney J. B. McEntire. At
hat time, a trust was established for
ach of the Hunt children. In 1958, the

The size of these trusts is

Lamar Hunt observes
at, since the bulk of H. L.

ing for Ray to be the per-.
on who looks after it." La-
har adds: "It does not mean

is an oft-delayed trial ahead for
Bunker and Herbert Hunt on the wire-
tapping charges, but there is also the
threat of more indictments against
them by a federal grand jury that has
been sitting in Dallas for more than a
year. The Hunts claim their wiretap-
ping activities were aimed at uncov-
ering suspected embezzlements from
their father's food concern. In their
only statement on the matter, over a
year ago, they cited "extensive, unex-
plained losses" suffered by the com-
pany, "We only sought to protect our
father and his property, as any others
would have done," they said.
But one of the wiretappers, Jon Jo-
seph Kelly, says that the tapping was
prompted by Bunker's and Herbert's
suspicions that someone was trying to
influence H. L. Hunt to leave the bulk
of his estate to the second Mrs. Hunt
and her children. Three of the wiretap
victims back up Kelly's version.
Just two weeks ago, in their syndi-
cated column, Jack Anderson and Les
Whitten aired a recurring Dallas ru-
mor that the grand jury is looking into
an alleged "$50,000 to $60,000 payoff"
from Bunker to the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, James O.
Eastland of Mississippi, in return for
Eastland's assistance in getting a pa-
role for the other wiretapper, Houston
private eye Patrick W. McCann III.
Eastland wrote a letter on McCann's
behalf, but Bunker has denied that
there was any payoff.
The Dallas grand jury is said to be.
mulling the Eastland connection, as
well as the circumstances surrounding
the three-year lapse between the wire-
tappers' arrest and the indictment of .
Herbert and Bunker on Feb. 28, 1973. A
Hunt family lawyer told Dallas Morn-
ing News investigative reporter Earl
Golz that Bunker managed to strike a
bargain with the Justice Dept. in which
"there would be no prosecution of the
Hunts if they performed certain ac-
tions; they performed the actions, but
there was an indictment anyway."
The actions, reportedly made after
1972 meetings with former President
Richard M. Nixon and former Attorney
General Richard Kleindienst, included
Bunker's providing Justice with a list
of Al Fatah agents in the U.S. He had
secured the list privately because he
feared he was on the Al Fatah death
list because of his Libyan holdings.
H.
For the Hunts, the wiretapping epi-.
sode has proved disastrous. Bunker and
Herbert could receive prison sentences.;
And, more than anything else in the
family's history, it has torn the tightly
woven curtain of secrecy behind which
the family has lived and worked for
more than four decades.

MEMORANDUM
PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.
:
To:
Senator Ervin
From: Terry Lenzner and Marc Lackritz
Subject: Relevance to S. Res. 60 of John Rosselli's e
testimony about his CIA activities
Summary:
John Rosselli and his attorney, Tom Wadden, object to
testifying about Rosselli's involvement with Robert Maheu in a
CIA-financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's.
The objection is based upon national security grounds as well as
an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to
our inquiry under S. Res. 60.
Testimony of Mr. Rosselli about this matter is relevant
and necessary to our investigation for a variety of reasons.
Facts:
andal Wilsos at
'
During the last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the
CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel
Castro. Among the participants in this plot were Robert Maheu and
John Rosselli. Maheu had a public relations business at the time,
and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime
figures (e.g. Sam Giancana) who had lost substantial gambling ·
investments when Castro came to power. Apparently, the plot
continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs
invasion, but it failed in attaining its objective of killing Castro.
Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis-
tence of the plot at that time.
Justice Department officials stumbled across this infor-
mation about the plot as a result of their investigation into an
illegal wiretap by Sam Giancana in the early 1960's.
Roselli, Harvey said he had a high

to O'Brien. Alternatively the objective was to discover if there was
any information about the plot that might be damaging to the Democrats
that O'Brien might possess from Maheu. And these concerns could
have been a possible motivation for the break-in to the offices of the
DNC and Larry O'Brien by four Cuban-Americans on June 17, 1972,
especially since their directions were to photograph any documents
relating to Cuban contributions or Cuban involvement in the 1972
Democratic campaign.
It is for these reasons that we wish to question John Rosselli
about the nature and scope of his activities with Robert Maheu in the
early 1960's.

The sensitive information was brought to the attention of
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and either he or then-Attorney General
Robert Kennedy ordered the prosecution of Giancana dropped in order
not to compromise national security considerations.
VHC and.
The Information about the alleged assassination plot then
lay dormant in a secret file in the Department of Justice until early
1969, when Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson requested the
file from the Deputy Chief of the Organized Crime Section. The file
was returned to Central Files shortly after it was taken out.
Sz wish
out the
Assistant Attorney General Wilson next requested the secret
Justice file in early 1971 in connection with his interview of Robert
Maheu on January 27, 1971 (see attached chronology). This interview
at the Department of Justice, in lieu of a grand jury appearance, was
arranged by a telephone call to Attorney General Mitchell on January 19,
1971, only one day after Jack Anderson published his first column linking
both Maheu and Rosselli to the CIA plot to kill Castro. (see attached)
However, the significance of Anderson's column on January 18,
1971, was that on the same day, Haldeman requested Dean to find out
what he could about the Hughes Maheu O'Brien relationship...
E
In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-
O'Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the
CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert
Maheu is advisable to avoid a "counter-scandal."
In addition, Assistant Attorney General Wilson showed the
sensitive "Castro file" to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971,
and discussed with him the political implications of the information.
Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971,
by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by
Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rosselli. Maheu
was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time.
Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file
with President Nixon, according to Wilson, who had advised him to do
SO.
Conclusion:
Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs
on Larry O'Brien in 1971 and 1972 was in part motivated by a fear that
Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot

In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the
narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both
cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics
informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Government
sources believe that he may have been killed to prevent him from
testifying. Because of his fugitive status, both indictments
against Sacco were dropped.
11
After Sacco's flight from his home in 1923, he spent some
time in New York and Chicago, and finally made his appearance in
Los Angeles in 1924 under the fictitious name "John Roselli.
Sources indicate that Sacco engaged in bootlegging and hijacking
during this period and police records show he was frequently
arrested on such charges as carrying concealed weapons,
picion of robbery.
and sus-
After 1930, Sacco became associated with the Al Capone
gang in Chicago and was also closely associated with organized
crime in Los Angeles. Reliable sources relate that he was an
executioner for the criminal organizations in both cities. In
1936, by demands and threats, Sacco forced his way into part
ownership of "Nationwide News Service," a horseracing information
service used by bookmakers across the country.
• After prohibition was repealed, Sacco left the bootlegging
business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios.
As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Jack Dragna,
Sacco soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for
the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was indicted on a charge of
conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers
and a labor union. Also indicted were union officials Browne
and Bioff, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La
Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna,
Paul DeLucia (aka Paul "the waiter" Ricia), Phil D'Andrea,
Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles "Cherry Nose",

the United States where they resided as aliens in East Boston.
Filippo Sacco completed the sixth grade in the public
schools of East Boston and was discharged from school in 1917.
By this time Filippo had two younger brothers and two younger
sisters. In 1918, Vincenzo Sacco died. His wife Maria and the
five children moved into the residence of Liberato Cianciulli
and a daughter was born in 1920. In 1922, Maria and Cianciulli
were married.
In 1922, Filippo had a job driving a horse-drawn milk
wagon and was nicknamed "Milky". However, in addition to his
legitimate occupation, Filippo had made connections with the
criminal element in East Boston and was engaged in marcotic
traffic with his headquarters in and around Maverick Square.
On September 14, 1922, Filippo sold morphine to a government
informant named Fisher while under surveillance by a narcotic
agent. On September 19, 1922, Filippo arranged for a large
sale from his "source" and was present and under agent sur-
veillance when the morphine was delivered. On September 29,
1922, Filippo Sacco and his "source" were arrested by Federal
narcotics agents. On October 18, 1922, the Federal Grand Jury
in Boston indicted Sacco for the sale of narcotic drugs and
two days later he was released on bail. While awaiting trial
in the narcotics case, in Federal Court, Sacco was arrested and
indicted in Massachusetts State Court for grand larceny and

PART TWO: JIM BRADEN
One of the most incredible bodies of recent information
concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research
done by Peter Noyes, a former CBS Producer and top inves-
tigative reporter.
j
☐
Last year, Noyes published a book, (Legacy of Doubt, which
summed up many of his findings, and which generally outlines
what Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the
assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual
and is largely based on substantiated information such as
police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police
Department, the California Attorney General's Office, and
Texas police officials.
Though the Noyes book (like most recent assassination books)
did not sell well or receive much press attention, it has
been regarded as a valuable contribution by most of author
Noyes' fellow Warren Commission critics..

It can definitely be said that almost all of Noyes' findings,
particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,
have been factually substantiated and are solidly established
by official police records.
Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a
mysterious man who was picked up by the police at the scene
of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the
shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who
thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified
himself under the false name of Jim Braden, was released
shortly thereafter following brief questioning by the Dallas
Sheriff's Office.
Author Noves uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his
true identity during five years of investigative research.
T
And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune
of being picked up at the scene of the assassination for
"looking suspicious" that the Warren Commission critics now
believe ranks with James McCord's mistake of leaving masking
tape on the doors during the Watergate break-in as the ultimate
fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

Nevada Gaming Control Board refused to allow the Tropicana to
open as long as Sacco was associated with its operation, where-
upon the hotel owners were forced to buy back the gift shop lease
at a cost of $180,000, reportedly about thirty times the amount
paid for the lease.
During the above period, Sacco also involved himself in the
production of shows for the Tropicana, but again the Gaming
Control Board refused to allow him to participate in any capacity
and he sold his interest. Following his ouster from the
Tropicana, Sacco sold ice machines to most of the Las Vegas hotels
at prices far in excess of prices on the open market. Sacco has
also received numerous "finders fees" from various Las Vegas
hotels and casinos for which few if any services were performed.
In October 1960, Sacco and T. W. Richardson were involved
in placing a wire tap on the telephone of comedian Dan Rowan in
Las Vegas at the request of Chicago gangster Sam Giancana.
In May 1968, Sacco was convicted of failing to register as
an alien and report his address annually. In the course of that
trial, it was shown that birth records in Chicago, Illinois, had
been forged in an effort to make it appear that Sacco had been
born there as John Rosselli. Sacco has long been a close friend
of Edward J. Barrett, County Clerk, Cook County, Illinois, in
whose office the birth records for Chicago were kept.
Among Sacco's underworld associates are the following:
Al Capone head of the Chicago underworld gang;
Charles F. Fischetti - a Capone lieutenant;
Micky Cohen
Jack Dragna
gambler and racketeer;
leader of the Cosa Nostra, Los Angeles,

In July 1948, Sacco's parole was revoked because of his con

until November 1948, when his parole was reinstated.
after Sacco's parole terminated in March 1954, William Bioff, a
key Government witness at the extortion trial was murdered by
the bombing of his vehicle. (The trial judge reportedly had
warned the defendants that if anything happened to Bioff while
they were on parole he would hold them responsible.) Two other
co-defendants of Sacco have also been victims of gang slayings.

Upon his release from prison, Sacco returned to Los Angeles
and again associated himself with a movie studio. Reliable
sources report that this was a front and in fact, through his
close association with Sam Giancana of Chicago, Sacco received
the responsibility of overseeing the concealed interests in
Las Vegas casinos of the Chicago underworld.
Sacco immediately
became a powerful figure in Las Vegas. He travels back and
forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles extensively and asso-
ciates with the known Cosa Nostra members and major gamblers.
Rosselli appeared before the Kefauver Committee investi-
gating organized crime and falsely testified concerning his
association with underworld figures and even his own personal
background.
During the period 1956-1958, Sacco was very active in
the construction and pre-opening operation of the Tropicana Hotel,
and Sacco received the lease to operate the gift shop.

Numerous prospective witnesses in the course of investiga-
tions concerning Sacco's criminal activities have expressed or
displayed fear at the prospect of being called to testify
against him, and a number of witnesses have refused to testify.
In the Friars Club trial, it was apparent that a number of
witnesses deliberately perjured themselves in order to exonerate
Sacco, including Friedman, Vinnie Donato, Lee Deer, and Nat Ross.
Defendant Sacco was convicted in the Friars Club case in
December 1968 of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering
enterprise and interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained
securities. He was also convicted of making a false statement in
his income tax return. Sacco has had a long practice of concealing.
the source and nature of his income. He was sentenced to five years
in prison.
In view of Sacco's extensive criminal record extending back
more than 40 years, as well as his membership and participation
in the organized criminal syndicate known as Cosa Nostra, we
strongly urge that defendant Sacco's sentence not be reduced for
any reason whatsoever. He is a genuine menace to society and,
in particular, to those witnesses who have testified against him.

Interview of John Roselli
On Wednesday February 20, 1974, Scott Armstrong, Marc Lackritz and Bob
Muse interviewed John Roselli at the office of Roselli's attorney, Tom Wadden,
888 17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., telephone 833-1440. Also present were
Wadden's associates Bryan B. McMenamin and Leslie Scherr.
Wadden began the interview by noting that for the first time, he had
discussed with Roselli the Maheu Cuban matter with which we were concerned; and
found that it presented a great problem of national security. Accordingly he had
tried to reach Senator Ervin, an old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade the
Senator from allowing this interview to go forward. He did not get in touch with
Ervin directly but talked to a staff member in Ervin's office, whom he would not
identify. He further noted that Roselli was insistent upon not giving any information
about his Cuban activities and would rather go to jail than be compelled to testify
about the matter. Thus the interview was not productive insofar as Roselli's
involvement with Maheu in 1960 was concerned. However Wadden did allow us to inter-
view Roselli about his background and we reserved the right to have an executive
session before a Senator where John Roselli might be compelled to testify about his
involvement with Maheu in Cuba. (It should be noted that Wadden would not identify
his privilege claim other than saying it related to national security.)
John Roselli presently resides with his sister and brother-in-law, a Mr...
and Mrs. Joseph Daigle at 522 Southwest Temp Corner, Plantation, Florida 33314. His
telephone number there is area. 305 581-6585. He has been living in retirement with
them since he left jail at the end of last summer. Prior to moving to Florida he
had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the
Friar's Club case, a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman,
Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no involve-
ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)
With regard to Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for the first time in the mid-50's
in either Washington or California through a mutual acquaintance, Herman Spitzel.
When questions were asked as to what his subsequent involvement with Maheu was,
Roselli's attorney instructed him not to answer any questions on the ground of
national security.
He
Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had made arrangements for
Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966.
said that he had received a call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu, no one wanted to give
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles
and went up to Las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses
at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for
seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas. Kolod acquiesced and told
Roselli that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,
but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years. When the New Years date
was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice from Kolod and
were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to allow them
to stay. At the same time he told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels and avoid
any problems. Maheu responded that he was of the impression that Hughes didn'tà

want to get involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want
to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of
trying to sell the hotel, and approached Kolod and asked if he would be willing to
sell it. Kolod replied that if Roselli could make arrangements to sell it he would
receive a finder's fee. Roselli then turned around and -asked Maheu if he wanted to
purchase it. Maheu responded that he would and Roselli turned the matter over to
his attorney Ed Morgan who then handled the matter until the end. Roselli also
instigated some talk about the possibility of purchasing the Sands and, while he did
not negotiate it, received at a later date from Ed Morgan a check for $95,000 which
represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands.
Roselli noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he
did not negotiate with him because he found him less agreeable than Kolod. He said
that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of them related to matters
concerning the Las Vegas hotel industry.
With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that
time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas interests. He noted that
Morgan did not represent him in his Friars' Club defense (but did arrange for Jim
Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney to handle the matter). He said that he had no
trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted
Morgan implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John Roselli to be represent
by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal
from the Friar's Club.

his holdings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started
in 1967 when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work out
and Roselli resigned as President of the gift shop. Thereafter he made an arrange-
ment with a Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify him
against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop. This arrangement has worked
out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from
the gift shop. He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly
treated by the Hughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier.

Since 1967 Roselli has seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall
the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had
terminated with Hughes. He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the time while
his wife was having a foot operation; and that he called Roselli to have supper.
Roselli has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other
than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for
Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.
He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went
to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever
Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no cubsequent substantiv
discussions with Peter Maheu.
He indicated he knew nothing about Larry O'Brien, Tony Hatsis, or Jack
Cleveland. Similarly, he has no recollection of ever having met Bebe Rebozo, and
knows of the person only through newspaper articles.

For Jim Braden, whose true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,
is a man with singularly awesome direct ties to the highest
levels of the Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to
the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities
of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and
outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an
indispensable link or leader of organized crime's
far flung network of "controlled violence" specialists
and professional hit men.
-
Braden's involvement with the Mafia's highest echelon
"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast
and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris-
diction. According to federal authorities working with the
Justice Department's organized crime strike force units, and
according to other high government sources cited by author
Noyes, Jim Braden is now serving as personal courier for
Meyer Lansky.
The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up
under a false name across the street from the Texas Book
Depository just moments after the shots were fired on
November 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized.
Though there were several innocent witnesses or bystanders
in the area of the assassination who were also arrested or
brought in for questioning by the Dallas police, all of whom
were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at
that precise moment does in fact raise an incredible specter,
and may indeed have been the monumental slip-up that critics
of the Warren Commission now attest to.

Los Angeles, he remembers being represented by James Cantillon a Los Angeles attorney
He remembers that this grand jury was convened sometime in the summer of 1970 and
that his appearance took place before he went to jail, which was January 25, 1971.
He has no recollection of David Nissen, the prosecutor, ever having made a comment
about Maheu; nor did he question Roselli about his recollection of his involvement
with Maheu in the Cuban undertaking. Roselli had very bad words about Nissen and
mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-
ment discussing Roselli's background, which Roselli, and Wadden both said was very
inaccurate.
Roselli has no recollection of being asked to be an informer by Nissen.
Hedoes remember, however, being approached by two FBI agents in 1966 about the
possibility of being an informer. This possibility is discussed in the court files..
Roselli recalls appearing four or five times before the Frontier Hotel
grand jury. He answered questions extensively only on the first day and thereafter
appeared at the request of Nissen and waited around. Wadden indicated that we should
make a request of Judge Byrne or whoever else might have access to those grand jury -
minutes to get Roselli's testimony about the Frontier. Roselli does not recall

had no recollection of Maheu appearing there but, after being advised by Wadden
that Maheu's appearance was well noted in the paper, he said he may have read about
it.
He said he has no recollection or knowledge of Bob Maheu ever making an
application on Roselli's behalf for reduction of sentence.
With regard to political contributions, he has never had any discussions
with Rebozo, or had any conversations with anyone about any contributions (of over
$10,000) to a Presidential campaign. He has no recollection of the Teamsters making
any substantial contributions to the Presidential Campaign. Similarly he has no
knowledge of ferry Thomas making any contribution.
Rosselli has no recollection of ever discussing with Maheu any of
Maheu's problems or contacts with the Administration. Specifically, he does
not recall Maheu ever talking about Stans or any involvements Stans may have
had with Thomas or Greenspun.
He knew nothing about any use of stolen stocks.
With regard to Jim Crosby, Jack Davis and Mary Carter Paoint Co. he
knew nothing. Similarly he knew nothing about Jim Golden.
He had no knowledge of Bob Peliquin or Intertel's involvement at
Paradise Island. Wadden chimed in by noting that he had been an old associate
of Hundley and had gone to Paradise Island with Hundley about 7 years ago to
look at the Paradise Island set-up.
Roselli has never talked with or met Jack Caulfield. Nor does he
recall ever having any private individuals interview him while he was in jail.
He recalls however, that three officers from the Immigration Department once vis-
ited him and told him about the detainer that was being held on him. Similarly,
while he was in jail, the IRS interviewed him in Los Angeles about the finder's
fee he received in the Frontier Hotel. The investigation may have related somewhat
to Maheu, but, since it was so short, he does not recall what the discussion
about Maheu concerned. He noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,
Rebozo or any members of the Administration."

Roselli's attorney instructed him not to answer any questions on the ground of
national security.
Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had made arrangements for
Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966. He
said that he had received a call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu, no one wanted to give
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles
and went up to Las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses
at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for
seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas. Kolod acquiesced and told
Roselli that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,
but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years. When the New Years date
was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice from Kolod and
were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to allow them
to stay. At the same time he told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels and avoid
any problems. Maheu responded that he was of the impression that Hughes didn't

Los Angeles, he remembers being represented by James Cantillon a Los Angeles attorney
He remembers that this grand jury was convened sometime in the summer of 1970 and
that his appearance took place before he went to jail, which was January 25, 1971.
: He has no recollection of David Nissen, the prosecutor, ever having made a comment
about Maheu; nor did he question Roselli about his recollection of his involvement
with Maheu in the Cuban undertaking. Roselli had very bad words about Nissen and
mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-
ment discussing Roselli's background, which Roselli, and Wadden both said was very
inaccurate.
Roselli has no recollection of being asked to be an informer by Nissen.
Hedoes remember, however, being approached by two FBI agents in 1966 about the
possibility of being an informer. This possibility is discussed in the court files.
i
Roselli recalls appearing four or five times before the Frontier Hotel
grand jury. He answered questions extensively only on the first day and thereafter
appeared at the request of Nissen and waited around. Wadden indicated that we should
make a request of Judge Byrne or whoever else might have access to those grand jury
minutes to get Roselli's testimony about the Frontier. Roselli does not recall
having talked to Bob Maheu about his appearance before the grand jury. He said he
had no recollection of Maheu appearing there but, after being advised by Wadden
that Maheu's appearance was well noted in the paper, he said he may have read about
it.
He said he has no recollection or knowledge of Bob Maheu ever making an
application on Roselli's behalf for reduction of sentence..
:.
With regard to political contributions, he has never had any discussions.
with Rebozo, or had any conversations with anyone about any contributions (of over
$10,000) to a Presidential campaign. He has no recollection of the Teamsters making
any substantial contributions to the Presidential Campaign. Similarly he has no
knowledge of ferry Thomas making any contribution.
Rosselli has no recollection of ever discussing with Maheu any of
Maheu's problems or contacts with the Administration. Specifically, he does
_ not recall Maheu ever talking about Stans or any involvements Stans may have
had with Thomas or Greenspun.
He knew nothing about any use of stolen stocks.
With regard to Jim Crosby, Jack Davis and Mary Carter Paoint Co. he

knew nothing.
He had no knowledge of Bob Peliquin or Intertel's involvement at

of Hundley and had gone to Paradise Island with Hundley about 7 years ago to
look at the Paradise Island set-up.

while he was in jail, the IRS interviewed him in Los Angeles about the finder's

to Maheu, but, since it was so short, he does not recall what the discussion
about Maheu concerned. He noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,
Rebozo or any members of the Administration.

3. The information contained in said articles was
made available to me by persons employed by the United States
Government who, in the past, have supplied me with accurate and
truthful information as pertains to other subjects.

and I conducted an impartial and independent investigation
regarding John Rosselli's activities as described in Exhibit A,
which were performed at the behest of Agents of the United

Sixteen, Seventeen and Eighteen of the Indictment, and one year imprisonment
to run concurrently with Count One and a fine of $5,000.00 for Count

$55,000.00.
On January 18th and 19th, 1971, there appeared in newspapers
throughout the country nationally syndicated articles by columnist
Jack Anderson alleging that defendant had assisted the Central Intelligence
Agency of the United States Government as set forth in said articles.
The affidavits of Jack Anderson and his assistant, Les Whitten, are
attached hereto and included therewith are copies of the columns, set forth
as Exhibits A and B. Exhibits A and B were published on the 18th and 19th
of January, 1971. Attached as Exhibit C is a follow-up column which

of the office records of columnist Jack Anderson, which were released
and published on April 18th and April 27th, 1971.
The undersigned is informed that at no time prior to the
sentencing of defendant were the matters set forth in Exhibits A and B
of the attached affidavits brought to the Court's attention. It is the belief
of the undersigned that had these matters been brought to the Court's
attention they would have materially affected the sentence handed down.
by the Court in this case.
Defendant proposes to file and serve additional affidavits in
support of this written motion and to present the testimony of at least one
witness at the hearing on July 6, 1971. The additional affidavits and/or

he twice reaffirmed his "high regard" for Rosselli. I advised
him I was making an affidavit on Rosselli's behalf and he ex-
pressed concern for Rosselli, asked his present status and said
he would "follow up" on Rosselli's behalf from his end.

On my first call, in January, I asked Harvey if it
were not true that he had personally intervened with the Justice
Department in order to mitigate the government's prosecution of
Rosselli on the basis that Rosselli had done a formidable service
for his country. Harvey said "this is a long story

I don't
think it ought to be printed." I asked him whether it was not
true that he had a high regard for Rosselli. "I still do," he
earnestly replied.

again in Indianapolis in February and asked him whether he could
comment on our story about Rosselli which by now has been pub-
lished widely in the United States. He declined to comment.

Jim Braden's Arrest On November 22
Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police
officers on the scene at the Texas School Book Depository
following the assassination.
Within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,
Deputy Lewis confronted a man across the street from the
Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was "acting.
suspiciously."
Deputy Lewis questioned the man for several minutes before
taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interrogation.
The man identified himself as Jim Braden, and said that he
was in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy
Lewis became even more suspicious over the way the man first
tried to identify himself. Instead of producing his driver's
license, the common means of identification, the man pulled
out a gasoline credit card instead.
The man who identified himself as Jim Braden strongly protested
when Deputy Lewis told him that he would have to take him in
for further interrogation.
At the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary
statement. Braden, then 48, told the police that he was in
Dallas on oil business and had been there for two days. He
said he was staying at the Cabana Motel, s short distance away
from the scene of the assassination. Braden said he had been
walking down the street by the Texas Book Depository at the
time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.
Jim Braden further stated that he was confronted by Deputy
Lewis inside a building across the street from the Depository
during an attempt to make a telephone call following the
shooting.
Braden was shortly thereafter released by the Dallas Sheriff's
office. Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made
of possible criminal records relating to him.
}
Two months later, in late January of 1964, Jim Braden was
interviewed by two FBI agents at his office in Beverly Hills.
The Warren Commission's investigation was then in full swing
and witnesses to the assassination were being questioned by
the FBI and other authorities. In his FBI interview, Braden
gave the same account as he had given to the Dallas police on
the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on
Braden's interrogation further stated that, "Braden has no
information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to him."

Rosselli arranged bail money for the two men who were caught

Giancana laughed when Rosselli discussed tapping incident with
him, but gave no clues to the reason for the tap.

government; he was patriotic.
Rosselli knew Trafficante before "operation" started.
Rosselli maintained some contact with Maheu after Harvey took

Rosselli first met Maheu in approximately July, 1960,
pursuant to a telephone call from Maheu. At their first
meeting, Maheu told Rosselli that a high government official
had requested that Maheu recruit Rosselli to "fight Communism
90 miles away from Florida" to recruit Cubans to assassinate
Castro.
New York
Rosselli had second meeting with Maheu and went to New York
in September under the alias of John Rawlston [Castro was
in New York at this time]. Rosselli met Jim O'Connell of
CIA, plus "three others."
Florida
O'Connell, Maheu and Rosselli met in Florida hotel approxi-
mately one week after New York. Rosselli introduced Giancana
to Maheu. Also introduced X (Trafficante) to Maheu. Obtained
permission from Maheu to bring Giancanainto project.

O'Connell called Rosselli after Bay of Pigs. Met in Florida
not long after Bay of Pigs with William Harvey, O'Connell and
Rosselli. Harvey told Rosselli that he wanted Rosselli to
have nothing to do with Maheu and not to use Giancana connections.
Rosselli indicates that pro-Castro people in Florida probably
had inkling of assassination attempts.
During Missle Crisis, Harvey asked Rosselli to see if "they"
had any intelligence on us, on the missiles.

Rosselli talked with Bill Harvey prior to his testimony before
the Select Committee to see if Harvey had objections and
Harvey only suggested that Rosselli protect those people whose
lives and whose families might be jeopardized by his testimony.
Rosselli stated he did not know the five so-called Watergate
burglars Hunt, McCord, Barker, Martinez or Sturgis.
Roselli had no doubt that the Cuban operation was on behalf
of the CIA and not Mr. Hughes.
Rosselli stated that his Cuban contacts were never informed
that this was a CIA project, but that he represented a Wall
Street business.
In the period 1967-1968, Rosselli failed to register as
alien and faced criminal charges.
Rosselli describes how he is brought into the operation
Maheu's contact and O'Connell's satisfying him that they
were government representatives.
an
Rosselli stated that Sheffield Edwards was not overly concerned
with the FBI's contacting Rosselli.
Rossell's reason for not informing his sources that it was
a CIA operation was because he believed he would be more
successful doing what he was doing by representing big
business.
When the FBI contacted Rosselli in both 1966 and 1970
they hinted that they wanted Rosselli to provide information
about United States gambling interests.

Howard--
In re your "battle plan" memo to Hart
and Garn, I think you should consider possible
wis com of our Committee making some kind of
very low-key anouncement that we're doing
something. Purpose would be two-fold--to
prevent getting wholly co-opted by new
House Committee (and agencies making a
claim that since House is doing it, they can
ignore us---also to put House on notice there
is specific area we have carved and will
continue to carve out for ourselves). Most
important, we must do something affirmative to
insure that the sources out there come to us.
If we say nothing, potentials which just gō
to House under assumption that that's the only
thing going on.
Attached is the type of low-key someone
could say in response to an inquiry (which
I assume Spencer gets lots of).

Jim Braden's True Identity Energes
In early 1969, Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began investigating the mysterious California
"oil man."
Noyes originally received a tip about Braden from a
former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney
Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.
The FBI man told Noyes of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.
Noyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at either
of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no forwarding addresses.
Noyes then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Motor Vehicles told Noyes that Braden's
license (H751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego
county in November of 1966. Braden has also listed new
business and home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred miles apart.
The Department of Motor Vehicles' records on Jim Braden
also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original
name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's
to Eugene Hale Brading, which is Braden's true identity.
On September 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination,
Eugene Hale Brading had notified the Department that he had
legally changed his name to Jim Braden, and he requested a
new license under that name. The license was granted.
I'
Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a false
identity assumed by Eugene Brading, investigator Noyes
contacted the Intelligence Division of the California
Attorney General's Office, and had a check run on the
mysterious Brading.
•
Noyes was told that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.
He's got à long rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections."
Noyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's
(Jim Braden's) police records.

BARA
I had a long talk this morning with Congressman Gerald R. (Gerry) Ford
(R. Michigan) in his office. He asked that I come up to see him. Upon arriving he
told me he wanted to talk in the strictest of confidence. This was agreed to.
SILD
8- Ford told me he was somewhat disturbed about the manner in which
Chief Justice Warren was carrying on his Chairmanship of the Presidential Commission.
He explained that the first mistake that Warren made was his attempt to establish a
"one man commission" by appointing a Chief Counsel, Warren Olney, that was his own
protege. Ford stated that after the mention of Olney's name by the Chief Justice, at
their first meeting, Allen Dulles, former Director of CIA, protested quite violently.
Because of Dulles' protest, the other members told Warren that they would like to know
(more about Olney prior to giving their consent.
W
On the occasion of their second meeting, Ford and Hale Boggs joined
Dulles. Hale Boggs told Warren flatly that Olney would not be acceptable and that
he (Poggs) would not work on the Commission with Olney. Warren put up a stiff
argument but a compromise was made when the name of Lee Rankin was mentioned.
i to
[Warren stated he knew Rankin and could work with him.
NI
de i
Ford told me that he was currently having problems inasmuch as the
majority of the members of the Commission desired to go along with the recommendatio
made in Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach's letter to the Commission dated 12-9-63-
In this letter, Katzenbach recommended that the Commission make an immemuate
press release pointing out that the FBI report clearly showed there was no international
conspiracy or collusion and that Oswald was a loner. Ford stated he was a minority of
one that did not want to give out any press release until the Commission had had a
thorough opportunity to review and discuss the FBI report. (I noted that the report was,
on his desk at the time of our meeting.)

The Brading "rap sheet" contained an incredible 35
seperate entries covering virtually every phase of
criminal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,
operating a gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop
lifting, receiving stolen property, and selling wartime
gas ration coupons on the black market.
Most of these arrests had been made under the name of
Eugene Hale Brading, but the police dossier on him also
showed a handful of other aliases, including Harry Eugene
Bradley, Gene Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,
and inevitably, Jim Braden.
"Jim Braden was the last entry shown on Brading's
records.
Incredibly, investigator Noyes found that due to the fact
that the Dallas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or
run a make on him, his true identity of Eugene Brading was
never discovered by the FBI or the Warren Commission at the
time of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren
Commission had only routinely included Braden's short state-
ment about being in Dallas on "oil business" in a police
exhibit on witnesses contained in Warren Commission Hearing's
Volume XIX! Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at
face value.

My Turn
¡
Donald E. Schulz
Kennedy and the Cuban Connection
Co
onspiracy theories are fashionable,
sometimes even fruitful, as in the
case of Watergate. So it is not surprising
that recent revelations of the Senate In-
telligence Committee have resurrected
an old question: what connection, if any,
did the Castro government have with the
assassination of John F. Kennedy?
Current speculation is that the Cuban
dictator, having learned of CIA plots
against his life, decided to strike back.
returning violence for violence, with
consequences that are now history. In-
deed, the recent report of the Schweiker-
Hart task force, while finding no hard
evidence to support this theory, did un-
cover some interesting new leads. More
than that, it established that a CIA-FBI
"cover-up" had deprived the Warren
commission of vital information that pre-
vented it from seriously exploring the
possibility of Castro's involvement and
that consequentry there is no longer any
reason to have faith in its picture of the
Kennedy assassination."
And so we may well have a reopening
of the investigation. At last.
Given all this, it seems appropriate to
examine the record of the period. A small
but interesting body of published testi-
mony and reminiscences describes and
amply documents a little-known cam-
paign of accommodation launched by
Washington and Havana in the weeks
preceding that fateful day in November
1963. Actually, the origins of this tenta-
tive and ultimately ill-fated rapproche-
ment may be traced to the previous
spring, when, Castro, increasingly de-
pendent on his Soviet sponsors, found
himself obliged to embrace the banner of
"peaceful coexistence" in order to obtain
economic and military agreements need-
ed to assure the continued development
of his revolution. In practical terms, this
meant the normalization of relations
with the United States.
A MESSAGE FOR CASTRO
It was not until September 1963, how-
ever, that this campaign began to show
results. At that time, William Attwood, an
adviser to the U.S. delegation to the
United Nations, told his superiors he had
word that Castro wanted an accommoda-
tion. John Kennedy got the message and
approved a "discreet contact" with the
Cuban U.N. representative, Carlos Le-
chuga. Subsequently, communications
were established and meetings held
to discuss the prospect of negotiations.
By early November, Kennedy had de-
cided to push toward an opening with
Cuba in hopes of taking Castro out of the
Soviet fold and erasing the memory of
the Bay of Pigs. The Americans sought a
meeting to draw up an agenda for later
discussions. On Nov. 18, this message
was transmitted to Havana. Shortly
thereafter, Lechuga was instructed to set
forth such a plan for U.S. consideration.
Even as these developments were un-
folding, a second dialogue was taking
place through an unofficial envoy-the
French journalist Jean Daniel. On Oct.
24, Kennedy had received Daniel in the
White House. The President, it seems,
had learned of the Frenchman's forth-
coming visit to Cuba and had decided to
seize the occasion to send Castro a mes-
sage. The essence of this communication
was a strong hint that the United States
would be willing to normalize relations
providing certain conditions were met.
What were those conditions? One, clear-
ly, was an end to Castroite subversion.
The U.S. had a special responsibility to
contain Communist expansionism. As
long as Havana continued to export revo-
lution, the economic "blockade" of the
island would remain in effect.
ACCOMMODATIONS
Beyond this, not much was definite.
The American negotiating position had
not yet been worked out. Even so, hints
of possible Cuban participation in the
Alliance for Progress and of the desire of
the United States to see a decline in
Soviet influence on the island suggested
further avenues for discussion.
Bearing this message and an invitation
to revisit the White House upon his re-
turn, Daniel set off for Cuba. There he
found a remarkably receptive Fidel Cas-
tro. Indeed, during the course of a six-
hour interview the lider máximo found
occasion to praise the American Presi-
dent for his sincerity, realism and "good
ideas": Kennedy might yet understand
that there could be "coexistence be-
tween capitalists and socialists, even in
the Americas." Castro was convinced
that normal relations could be restored
"on the basis of mutual respect for sover-
eignty." His country needed peace in
order to concentrate on the socio-eco-
nomic tasks of the revolution. The issue
of subversion would not be an obstacle.
Cubans would naturally "feel solidarity"
with their revolu-
tionary brethren in
other lands. But ul-
timately, each na-
tion would have to
determine its own
destiny, and "if they
choose regimes oth-
er than ours, this is not our business."
This was two days prior to President
Kennedy's death.
I mention these developments be-
cause they provide an important-and
perhaps crucial-frame of reference for
Congressional investigators and the pub-
lic alike. They are not, of course, proof of
innocence. But they are suggestive:
would Castro have been so intent on
coming to terms with a man he was
conspiring to kill? One may seriously
doubt it. In point of fact, the assassina-
tion would bring a quick end to Washing-
ton's interest in accommodation.
POSSIBLE SCENARIOS
Still, this is not to rule out the possibil-
ity of a "Cuban connection." Govern-
ments often behave in inconsistent and
self-defeating ways. Indeed, even as the
Kennedy Administration was taking
these first covert steps toward rap-
prochement, the CIA was engaged in an
attempt on Castro's life. If, due to a lack
of political control and a prevailing at-
mosphere of cold-war hostility, U.S
agents could be conducting such activi-
ties in direct conflict with Presidential
policy, it is not difficult to imagine simi-
lar distortions on the Cuban side. Only a
few weeks earlier, Castro had publicly
denounced U.S.-sponsored assassina-
tions and even threatened retaliation.
Might not some overzealous security of-
ficials have taken this for tacit authority
to set up a "program of elimination"?
But all this remains speculation. It is
possible to envision any number of sce-
narios that might have led to the fatal
events of Nov. 22. In lieu of hard evi-
dence, however, it seems only fair to give
Castro the same benefit of the doubt that
Kennedy has been accorded-namely,
that he be considered innocent until
proved guilty. It is hoped that the inves-
tigations to come will proceed on the
basis of that assumption.

science at Ohio State University, is writ-
ing a book on the Cuban revolution.

PART TWO: JÍM. BRADEN
One of the most incredible bodies of recent information
concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research
done by Peter Noyes, a former CBS Producer and top inves-
tigative reporter.
Last year, Noyes published a book, Legacy of Doubt, which
summed up many of his findings, and which generally outlines
what Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the
assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual
and is largely based on substantiated information such as
police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police
Department, the California Attorney General's Office, and
Texas police officials.
Though the Noyes book (like most recent assassination books)
did not sell well or receive much press attention, it has
been regarded as a valuable contribution by most of author
Noyes' fellow Warren Commission critics.
It can definitely be said that almost all of Noyes' findings,
particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,
have been factually substantiated and are solidly established
by official police records.
Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a
mysterious man who was picked up by the police at the scene
of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the
shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who
thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified
himself under the false name of Jim Braden, was released
shortly thereafter following brief questioning by the Dallas
Sheriff's Office.
Author Noyes uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his
true identity during five years of investigative research.
And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune
of being picked up at the scene of the assassination for
"looking suspicious" that the Warren Commission critics now
believe ranks with James McCord's mistake of leaving masking
tape on the doors during the Watergate break-in as the ultimate.
fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

For Jim Braden, whose true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,
is a man with singularly awesome direct ties to the highest
levels of the Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to
the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities
of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and
outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an
indispensable link or leader of organized crime's
far flung network of "controlled violence" specialists
and professional hit men.
Braden's involvement with the Mafia's highest echelon
"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast
and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris-
diction. According to federal authorities working with the
Justice Department's organized crime strike force units, and
according to other high government sources cited by author
Noyes, Jim Braden is now serving as personal courier for
Meyer Lansky.
-
The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up
under a false name across the street from the Texas Book
Depository just moments after the shots were fired on
November 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized.
Though there were several innocent witnesses or bystanders
in the area of the assassination who were also arrested or
brought in for questioning by the Dallas police, all of whom
were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at
that precise moment does in fact raise an incredible specter,
and may indeed have been the monumental slip-up that critics
of the Warren Commission now attest to.

The Brading "rap shect" contained an incredible 35
seperate entries covering virtually every phase of
criminal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,
operating a gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop
lifting, receiving stolen property, and selling wartime
gas ration coupons on the black market.
Host of these arrests had been made under the name of
Eugene Hale Brading, but the police dossier on him also
showed a handful of other aliases, including Harry Eugene
Bradley, Gone Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,
and inevitably, Jim Braden.
"Jim Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's
records.
Incredibly, investigator Noyes found that due to the fact
that the Dallas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or
run a make on him, his true identity of Eugene Brading was
never discovered by the FBI or the Warren Commission at the
time of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren
Commission had only routinely included Braden's short state-
ment about being in Dallas on "oil business" in a police
exhibit on witnesses contained in Warren Commission Hearing's
Volume XIX. Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at
face value.

Jim Braden's True Identity Energes
In early 1969, Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter.
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began investigating the mysterious California
"oil man."
Noyes originally received a tip about Braden from a
former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney
Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.
The FBI man told Noves of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.
Noyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at either
of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no forwarding addresses.
Noyes then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Motor Vehicles told Noyes that Braden's
license (H751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego
county in November of 1966. Braden has also listed new
business and home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred miles apart.
The Department of Motor Vehicles' records on Jim Braden
also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original
name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's
to Eugene Hale Brading, which is Braden's true identity.
+
On September 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination,
Eugene Hale Brading had notified the Department that he had
legally changed his name to Jim Braden, and he requested a
new license under that name. The license was granted.
Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a false
identity assumed by Eugene Brading, investigator Noyes
contacted the Intelligence Division of the California
Attorney General's Office, and had a check run on the
mysterious Brading.
Noyes was told that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.
He's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections."
Noyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's
(Jim Braden's) police records.

Jim Braden's Arrest On November 22
Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police
officers on the scene at the Texas School Book Depository
following the assassination.
Within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,
Deputy Lewis confronted a man across the street from the
Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was "acting
suspiciously."
Deputy Lewis questioned the man for several minutes before
taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interrogation.
The man identified himself as Jim Braden, and said that he
was in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy
Lewis became even more suspicious over the way the man first
tried to identify himself. Instead of producing his driver's
license, the common means of identification, the man pulled
out a gasoline credit card instead.
The man who identified himself as Jim Braden strongly protested
when Deputy Lewis told him that he would have to take him in
for further interrogation.
At the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary
statement. Braden, then 48, told the police that he was in
Dallas on oil business and had been there for two days. He
said he was staying at the Cabana Motel, s short distance away
from the scene of the assassination. Braden said he had been
walking down the street by the Texas Book Depository at the
time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.
Jim Braden further stated that he was confronted by Deputy
Lewis inside a building across the street from the Depository
during an attempt to make a telephone call following the
shooting.
Braden was shortly thereafter released by the Dallas Sheriff's
office. Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made
of possible criminal records relating to him.
Two months later, in late January of 1964, Jim Braden was
interviewed by two FBI agents at his office in Beverly Hills.
The Warren Commission's investigation was then in full swing
and witnesses to the assassination were being questioned by
the FBI and other authorities. In his FBI interview, Braden
gave the same account as he had given to the Dallas police on
the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on
Braden's interrogation further stated that, "Braden has no
information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to him."

Jim Braden (Eugene Brading) and The Mafia
Investigator Noyes began a thorough investigation of
Braden based upon all available police records and
documents.
What soon clearly emerged was a long record of involvement
by Braden (Brading) with many of the most notorious Mafia
leaders in the nation, a record of close association with
key figures in the national crime syndicate.
Following a string of arrests in the 1940's, dating all
the way back to his young adulthood, Eugene Brading had
moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1950.
(BRADING AND PEREIRA)
In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with Victor
Pereira, a man who was a close associate and confidante of
several Mafia members. Brading and Pereira became involved
in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement
of wealthy widows.
In 1951, Brading and his close friend Pereira were arrested
by the FDI in New York on a fugitive warrant issued in Texas.
The two men were charged with embezzling over $50,000 from
a wealthy widow whom Pereira had married shortly before
flecing with her money. Brading and Pereira were soon con·
victed of the charges and were each sentenced to 12 years
in prison.
However, Brading and Pereira were out free during the three
years of their appeals, and Brading was later paroled in 1959
after having served just five years of his sentence.
(BRADING AND THE SMALDONES).
:
During the three years of freedom under their appeals of the
convictions, Brading and Pereira left Texas (following still
another floccing of another wealthy widow) and moved to
Denver, Colorado.
In Denver, Brading became very closely associated with
two leading Mafia bosses in the Rocky Mountain area, Clyde
and Gene Smaldone.

Captain Hamilton's letter stated:
"This Department has under investigation Arthur
Lewis Clark, Sr., FBI 3709258, and a Roger Bauman.
These men are representing themselves as officials
of the Sunbeam Oil Company, 212 Roosevelt Theater
Building, Miami Beach, and both are spending money
vory lavishly."
"Clark has been arrested several times and has been
associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such
as James Fratianno, Victor Pereira, Eugene Brading,
Clarence Rhodes, Stephen Sambor and the Sraldone
brothers of Denver."
:
As investigator Peter Noves points out, the men listed
with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual "Who's Who"
of organized crime leaders between California and the Midwest.
(BRADING AND FRATIANNO)
Of these top llafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps
the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known
as "Jimmie The Weasel." Fratianno was known as perhaps the
Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.
In 1959, in his testimony before the Rackets Committee of
the California legislature, Captain Hamilton, the Chief of
LAPD Intelligence, stated that,
"We have long considered Fratianno to
be the executioner for the Mafia on
the West Coast."
Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committed that his Intelligence
Division had linked Jimmie Frationno to at least sixteen Mafia
executions.
Fratianno had once been arrested for the attempted assassination
of Los Angeles Mafia head Mickey Cohen in 1949. Cohen had
survived the bloody shooting which took the life of one of
his lieutenants. Fratianno. was later released due to insuf-
ficient evidence. Fratianno used the alibi that he had been
at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the
shooting. Licata later became the new head of the Los Angeles
Mafia, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of
the Mafia in Dallas, Texas.

!
The Smaldone brothers, who were also known as "Checkers
and Flip Flop," were the Mafia leaders in charge of the
syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from
the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show
that at one time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the
entire Pueblo area of Colorado.
The Smaldone brothers were notorious for the brutal brand
of violence they practiced in their operations. Brading
(Braden) became involved in many transactions with the
Smaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years
later, after Brading finally went to jail for the embezzlement
of the Texas widow, the Smaldone brothers regularly wrote
to him in prison, seeking his advice on various financial
matters.
(BRADING AND CLARK AND BAUMAII)
Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills
in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came
under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department
Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.
In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on
his close association in Beverly Hills with two "oil specu-
lators" from Miami, Arthur Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark
and Bauman were notorious Mafia figures with long police
records.
Brading's friend Clark had been one of the ton leaders of
the famous Purple Gang of the Mafia, which had operated
out of Detroit and Youngstown. The Los Angeles police had
placed Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had
compiled extensive information on their friendship with
Brading.
In 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD, Captain
James Hamilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission of
Greater Miami seeking information about Clark, Bauman, and
Brading.
Captain Hamilton, who was known as one of the foremost
experts on the Mafia in the nation, asked the Miami Commission
(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Mafia)
to inform him as to the involvement of several associates of
Clark and Bauman.
Among those named was Eugene Brading.

A report of the Senate Rackets Committee from 1964 states:
"Meltzer now is reported to operate a large
bookmaking and prostitution syndicate in
California. A major figure in the organized
underworld, he is known to all the important
narcotics traffickers throughout the United
States. He has also operated in Oklahoma,
Texas, Baltimore, Miami, Las Vegas, Boston,
and various areas of Canada, Cuba, Hong Kong,
Japan, Hawaii, and the Philippines."
(BRADING AND THE SICAS)
Joe,
In Los Angeles, Brading also became closely associated with
yet another top Mafia operation. Brading became a close
friend and associate of the notorious Sica brothers
Freddie, and George. The Sica brothers were particularly
brutal syndicate members specializing in narcotics.
In 1950, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles accused Brading's
friends, Joe and Freddie Sica, of heading the single largest
narcotics ring in the United States.
The Sica brothers were shortly thereafter brought to trial.
On the night before the trial opened, the government's
star witness, an informant named Abe Davidian, was mysteriously
shot to death in his mother's home in Fresno. The murder was
never solved and the Sica brothers were soon released for
lack of evidence.

Jimmie Fratianno was also suspected of complicity in
the murders of two men in 1951. Two men who made the
mistake of robbing the Mafia's Flamingo Hotel in Las
Vegas were found dead in a parked car following the
robbery. Both of their skulls had been shattered by
bullets fired behind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia
fashion.
Fratianno had also been linked to the famous murder of
Harry "Hooky" Rothman, who had been another close
associate of Mickey Cohen, the Los Angeles Mafia head.
Also, Fratianno was also linked to the disappearance of
another top member of the Mickey Cohen gang, Frank Niccoli.
Niccoli had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner
at Fratianno's home one night.
Fratianno was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-
man in northern California in 1952. Thomas Keen, a wealthy
gambler, had apparantly welched on a $80,000 gambling debt
that he owed the Mafia, and was blown to bits from a dynamite
charge hidden under the hood of his car.
Fratianno later served a six year prison term (1954-1960) for
extortion. In later years Fratianno became the central figure
involved in LOOK magazine's "expose" of San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto's alleged Mafia connections. LOOK alleged that
Fratianno had become a close friend of Mayor Alito and that
the Mayor had arranged for Fratianno to receive loans of over
$105,000 from a bank where Alioto served as Chairman of the.
Board. Alioto admitted that Fratianno was a "casual acquaintance"
of his, but denied that he had used any influence in the loans.
The Mayor also said that he had not known that the notorious
Fratianno was a member of the Mafia.
(BRADING AND MELTZER)
While in Los Angeles, Brading (Jim Braden) also became
connected with top Mafia leader Harold "Happy" Meltzer.
The LAPD Intelligence Division had originally become
aware of Brading's close relationship with Meltzer when
Brading's name was found on Meltzer's Christmas card list.
Meltzer was widely known as one of the most powerful Mafia
leaders in the entire nation.
The U.S. Senate Rackets Committee identified Brading's
friend Meltzer as a top Mafia boss in the areas of union
racketeering and narcotics.

Paul Rothermel, a former FBI agent who was Director of
Security for the Hunt Oil Company in Dallas at that time,
has' recalled that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting
the Hunt offices on November 21 in the company of three
other men. Rothermel has stated that the office log for
November 21 showed that Roger Bauman (Brading's old Mafia
friend) and Horgan Brown and Duane Nowlin "and friend"
visited the Hunt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states
that Braden was definitely the "friend."
(Security chief Paul Rothermel was later fired by H.L. Hunt's
sons after reports allegedly surfaced that Rothermel was
"suspicious" of a possible Hunt connection to the assassin-
ation. Following his termination by the Hunts, Rothermel
found that he was being illegally wiretapped. Rothermel
filed suit against Lámar Hunt and another one of H.L. Hunt's
sons, charging them with the wiretapping, and asking for
several million dollars in damages. The suit, which has
produced very damaging evidence against the Hunt brothers,
is still in the courts.)
Also on November 21, the day before the assassination,
according to a conclusion of the Warren Commission, Jack
Ruby was also on his way to the H.L. Hunt offices in Dallas.
The Warren Commission concluded that Jack Ruby drove a woman
friend of his to the Hunt offices sometime that same after-
noon. The woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub
as a stripper, drove with Ruby to the Hunt offices, apparantly
in search of employment. This does coincide with Braden's
visit to the same offices on that same afternoon.
The Warren Commission investigated several other possible.
links of Jack Ruby to the Hunts, including the still
unexplained fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found inside
one of Ruby's notebooks. But of these possible links, the
Warren Commission concluded only that evidence did indicate
that Ruby had driven to the Hunt offices on November 21.
Thus a possible Ruby-Braden connection on the day before
the President's assassination does indeed arise.

Jim Braden: Possible Link To Jack Ruby
The same inadequate investigative work which led the
Warren Commission to largely overlook Jack Ruby's solid
Mafia involvement, appears also to have been responsible
for the failure to uncover Jim Braden's true identity of
Eugene Brading during the official investigation into the
Kennedy assassination.
As shown in the previous account of Jack Ruby's very
substantial ties to the Mafia, Ruby was particularly
involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.
But beyond the multiplicity of evidence which indicates
that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden were both important Mafia
figures operating in the same general areas, at the same
general times, there is another single piece of evidence
which places both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the
day before the assassination.
Evidence indicates that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby
visited the Dallas offices of the N.L. Hunt Oil Company
on the afternoon of November 21, 1963, just twenty four
hours before the President was murdered. Obviously any
link which places both Braden and Ruby in the same place
at the same time on the day before the assassination does
of course raise further significant questions about a
possible relationship between the two men.
Jim Braden received permission from the U.S. Board of
Parole in Los Angeles to make a trip to Dallas, Texas on
November 13, 1963, four days before the assassination.
Braden was required to report all of his travels to his
Parole Board following his parole in 1959 for the embez-
zlement conviction.
On November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination,
Jim Braden checked in with the U.S. Parole Office in
Dallas. According to Roger Carroll the Chief Parole
Officer in Dallas, Braden (Brading) "advised that he
planned to see Lamar Hunt and other oil speculators while
hore." Lamar Hunt is the son of H.L. Hunt, the famous
right-wing oil billionaire.

the way back to his young adulthood, Eugene Brading had
moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1950.
(BRADING AND PEREIRA)
In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with Victor
Pereira, a man who was a close associate and confidante of
several Mafia members. Brading and Pereira became involved
in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement
of wealthy widows.
In 1951, Brading and his close friend Pereira were arrested
by the FBI in New York on a fugitive warrant issued in Texas.
The two men were charged with embezzling over $50,000 from
a wealthy widow whom Pereira had married shortly before
flecing with her money. Brading and Pereira were soon con-
victed of the charges and were each sentenced to 12 years
in prison!
However, Brading and Pereira were out free during the three
years of their appeals, and Brading was later paroled in 1959
after having served just five years of his sentence.
.||
(BRADING AND THE SMALDONES)
During the three years of freedom under their appeals of the
convictions, Brading and Pereira left Texas (following still
another fleecing of another wealthy widow) and moved to
Denver, Colorado.
In Denver Brading became very closely associated with.
two leading Mafia bosses in the Rocky Mountain area, Clyde
and Gene Smaldone.

Jim Braden: Possible Link To David Forric
Investigator Peter Noyes has turned up several pieces.
of information which indicate a possible connection between
Jim Braden and the mysterious David Ferrie.
David Ferric was the homosexual airline pilot and private
investigator whom Jim Garrison accused of participating
in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Six days after
District Attorney Garrison's charges were made public, David
Ferric was found dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His
mysterious death was finally ruled to have been a suicide.
David Ferric has been a target of investigation by critics
of the Warren Commission ever since the assassination. In
fact the FBI and Secret Service both investigated a possible
Ferrie role immediately after the assassination. It was
widely rumored in New Orleans and Dallas that Ferrie was to
have flown the alleged assassins out of the country following
the assassination. The Warren Commission decided not to include
the official Secret Service, and FBI reports on Ferric in the
26 Volumes of Hearings which were released after the Warren
Report was issued. However, the Justice Department did finally
release those reports to the National Archives in 1967 following
Garrison's public accusations.
same
Author Noyes has since established that both Jim Braden and
Davod Ferrie worked out of the floor of offices in a building
in New Orleans in the month or two immediately preceding the
assassination.
This is particularly significant due to the fact that at that
time the mysterious David Ferrie was employed as a private
investigator by Carlos Marcello, the top Hafia kingpin. It
is widely believed by most federal authorities that Carlos
Marcello ranks with his close friend Meyer Lansky as one of
the two single most powerful leaders of the Mafia's national
and international crime syndicate. Carlos Marcello heads the
Nafia empire centered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls
most of the Mafia activity in the southern part of the United
States.
In September and October of 1963, just weeks before the
assassination, David Ferrie was working out of the offices
of Carlos Marcello's criminal attorney, G. Wray Gill. Ferrie,
who was doing investigative work on a perjury charge that his
boss Marcello was then facing, worked out of Room 1707 in the
Pore Marquette Building in New Orleans.
At this same time, in September and October of 1963, Jim
Braden was operating out of Room 1701 in the Pere Marquette
Building.

According to Reid's informant, Marcello told his top
lieutenants, "Don't worry about that little Bobby
sonofabitch. He's going to be taken care of." The
informant stated that Marcello said that President
Kennedy himself would have to be killed first, and
that his brother would then follow. The informant
further stated that Marcello spoke of using some "nut"
to do the killings.

Braden was then commuting between New Orleans and
Beverly Hills, with the approval of his Parole Board.
Braden was working as a representative of his Mafia
friend Roger Bauman, the oil speculator. Braden worked
out of Room 1701, which was the office of his associate,
Victor Main, Jr., an oil geologist. This was just a short
way down the hall from David Ferrie in Room 1707.
Interestingly, in one visit to his Parole Office, Braden
"mistakenly" told his Parole Officer that he was working
out of Room 1706 which would have been the room next
instead of Room 1701.
door to Ferric
Thus a possible Braden-Ferrie connection in the weeks
just before the assassination does indeed arise in addition
to the possible Braden-Ruby connection. Both connections
definitely do seem to fall outside of or beyond the arca
which could reasonably be attributed to coincidence, chance,
or circumstance.
Beyond several sets of information which tend to indicate
that David Ferric had some contact with Lee Oswald at
various times, the critics of the Warren Commission have
particularly focused on Ferrie's ties to Carlos Marcello
and the Marcello Mafia empire.
In fact, in his interviews with the FBI and Secret Service
after the assassination, Ferrie claimed that he was with
Marcello at the very time of the assassination. Ferrie
stated that he was in court with Marcello on the afternoon
of November 22, which does appear to be true.
Carlos Marcello, along with Meyer Lansky, had become the
central targets of the Justice Department's Organized
Crime Division in the early 1960's, under the vigorous
direction of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
Marcello, known as "The Little Man," became one of Attorney
General Kennedy's most fierce enemies during that period.
Marcello once claimed that he had been kidnapped under orders
of Robert Kennedy and the Justice Department.
Ed Reid, author of The Greenfelt Jungle and widely recognized.
as one of the most respected experts on the Mafia in the
nation, has written that Carlos Marcello once threatened to
have President Kennedy and his brother murdered. Reid has
written that he was told of Marcello's threat by an informant
who attended a secret meeting with Marcello in New Orleans in
September of 1962.

The Special Unit of the LAPD, according to Noyes, dis-
counted the information regarding the RFK assassination,
but was indeed impressed by the Braden connection to the
1963 assassination. Noyes writes that Judge Byrne never
heard anymore about it after he forwarded the information
to the RFK investigators.
Later, Attorney General John Mitchell slected Byrne to
be Executive Director for the Scranton Commission that
investigated student unrest several years ago. Following
his work for the Scranton Commission, U.S. Attorney Byrne
was appointed U.S. District Court Judge by President Nixon,
the position he held at the time of the Ellsberg trial.

Jim Braden: Author Peter Noves And Judge Byrne
Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter who uncovered
most of the material regarding Jim Braden (Eugene Brading),
is a former classmate and close friend of Judge Matthew
Byrne, Jr., the U.S. District Court Judge who presided
over the Ellsberg Pentagon Papers trial last year.
As is now well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case
against Ellsberg after he was notified that the White
House "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
A short time later, it became known that President Nixon
had twice instructed John Ehrlichman to approach Judge
Byrne during the course of the Ellsberg trial and offer him
the position of Director of the FBI. This offer, which Judge
Byrne refused, has been regarded as a potential act of
bribery by some critics of President Nixon, and is currently
under investigation by the Soccial Prosecutor's Office.
It has been widely assumed that Nixon's fervent interest
in the outcome of the prosecution of Ellsbere may have
been the motivation behind his approach to Judge Byrne.
Author Noyes has written of his friend Judge Byrne's
involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 1969, after
Noyes had accumulated much of his information regarding.
the mysterious Braden, he took the information to his
friend, Matt Byrne, who was then U.S. Attorney for southern
California. Noyes had several talks with Byrne and has said
that Byrne was very impressed by the substantive evidence
which Noyes had gathered. During one of these meetings with
Byrne and another FBI man whom Byrne had invited to attend,
the FBI man told Hoyes that the FBI had never before known
that Jim Braden - the man arrested at the scene of the .
assassination in 1963 - was actually Eugene Brading. The
FBI man said that the Bureau must have made a big mistako
in not tracing down Braden's true identity and police record.
The FBI man was nearly incredulous over Noyes' evidence on
Braden.
Hoyes meanwhile had discovered that Jim Braden had also béen
in Los Angeles on the night that Robert Kennedy was assassinated
in early June of 1968.
Though Noyes couldn't find any significant information indicating
any Braden connection to the second Kennedy murder, he and his
friend Matt Byrne forwarded the information on Braden to the
Special Unit of the LAPD which was investigating the RFK death.

The Smaldone brothers, who were also known as "Checkers
and Flip Flop," were the Mafia leaders in charge of the
syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from
the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show
that at one time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the
entire Pueblo area of Colorado.
The Smaldone brothers were notorious for the brutal brand
of violence they practiced in their operations. Brading
(Braden) became involved in many transactions with the
Smaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years
later, after Brading finally went to jail for the embezzlement
of the Texas widow, the Smaldone brothers regularly wrote ·
to him in prison, seeking his advice on various financial
matters.
.
(BRADING AND CLARK AND BAUMAN)
Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills
in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came
under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department
Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.
In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on
his close association in Beverly Hills with two oil specu-
lators" from Miami, Arthur Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark
and Bauman were notorious Mafia figures with long police
records. $
Brading's friend Clark had been one of the top leaders of
the famous Purple Gang of the Mafia, which had operated
out of Detroit and Youngstown. The Los Angeles police had
placed Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had
compiled extensive information on their friendship with
Brading.
|
In 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD, Captain
James Hamilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission of
Greater Miami seeking information about Clark, Bauman, and
Brading.
Captain Hamilton, who was known as one of the foremost
experts on the Mafia in the nation, asked the Miami Commission
(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Mafia)
to inform him as to the involvement of several associates of
Clark and Bauman.
F
Among those named was Eugene Brading.

The La Costa Country Club had become, under the direction
of Moe Dalitz and Meyer Lansky, a key "watering hole" of
the syndicate. La Costa was originally financed through a
syndicate deal with James Hoffa of the Teamsters. One of
the Teamsters Union's billion dollar Pension Funds was used
in the financing of the project. La Costa became what is
known in the Mafia as "open territory" meaning that no
single Mafia family controlled it. La Costa was open to all.
Intelligence authorities in southern California have long
regarded La Costa as a. prime hangout for the Mafia. Some
officials have dubbed it "Apalachin West."
The syndicate had originally given Charter memberships in
La Costa to a number of Hollywood celebrities, so as to
soften the image of the plush resort. Among the members
were Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, and Bing Crosby.
Members of President Nixon's inner circle also became
frequent guests as La Costa, which is just twenty miles
away from San Clemente. Early in the Nixon Administration,
in 1969, Los Angeles Police were astonished to find Murray
Chotiner, one of the President's closest confidantes, living
it up at La Costa while the President was in San Clemente.
In February of 1973, while President Nixon was at San Clem-
ente, H.R., Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, Richard Moore, and
John Dean held a series of meetings at La Costa to discuss
the Watergate conspiracy, which was then beginning to
unravel.
John Dean gave lengthy testimony during the Ervin Committee
hearings regarding "the La Costa meetings." These meetings
at La Costa have since emerged as perhaps the most crucial
strategy sessions involved in the alleged cover-up of
Watergate by the President's closest aides. Dean testified
that the La Costa meetings took place over a period of two
days, February 10 12, 1973. Dean testified that the sessions
were held in a special villa at La Costa that was used by
Haldeman.
It has been during this same period of time, in the last
several years, that Eugene Brading (Jim Bradon) has become
one of the most important Mafia operatives at La Costa.
According to numerous intelligence reports, from California,
Nevada, and federal authorities, Brading is now suspected of
being the personal courier for national crime syndicate boss
Meyer Lansky.

The Nevada Gaming Board is continuing an investigation
into Braden's alleged role as syndicate courier for
"skimmed" gambling revenue from Las Vegas. Investigator
Noyes was told by several high government officials that
Jim Braden had indeed been identified as the personal
courier for Never Lonsky. One official disclosed that
Braden was suspected of taking over $72 million out of
the country for the syndicate. Another official said
that was a "low estimate."
In the summer of 1971, Braden came under renewed investi-
gation by California authorities following an incident at
La Costa.
A janitor at La Costa opened Braden's golf locker to make
a routine inspection. Out of the locker tumbled a bundle of
well over $100,000 in cash.
Author Noyes was informed by one official that the bundle
had contained at least $120,000 in cash, and another Cal-
ifornia official put the amount at closer to $200,000.
During questioning regarding the incident, Braden stated
that he had received the money from an oil transaction,
and that he had temporarily stored it in the locker. Later,
one of the officials working on that particular investigation
of Braden, told Hoves that Braden had also been given the use
of two planes owned by Howard Hughes to fly Mafia gambling
cash out of Nevada and the country.
At present, Eugene Brading, alias Jim Braden, is still
operating out of La Costa.

Jim Braden: Where He Is Today
:
Immediately following the assassination of President
Kennedy, Eugene Brading (Jim Braden) had an upturn in
his personal finances.
Brading later reported a large increase in revenue from
an oil well he had an interest in back in Louisiana. He
reported the large increase in revenue from the well for
the month of November 1963.
A month later, in December of 1963, Brading became a
charter member of the exclusive (and very expensive)
La Costa Country Club in southern California. Later that
year, 1964, Brading and his old syndicate oil friend
Roger Bauman established the "B And B Cattle Company.
The company was set up in Chicago and was presumably
named after them, "B And B," though neither of the two
men are listed as corporate officers. It was also during
this same period that Brading made a substantial investment
in two lots in Coral Gables, Florida.
In 1965, Brading's lengthy parole was finally terminated.
He soon bought a new home near the La Costa Country Club
which he had joined, and he also bought a house for his
parents in Santa Barbara.
And it is at the La Costa Country Club that the mysterious
trail of Jim Braden, or Eugene Hale Brading, finally ends.
The La Costa Country Club, which Brading had joined as one
of its 100 Charter members in January of 1964, is one of
the more notorious Mafia properties in the nation.
The most powerful force behind La Costa is Noc Dalitz, one
of Heyer Lansky's single closest associates. Noe Dalitz had
been the leader of the early Mayfield Road Gang in Cleveland,
and had been the founder of the actual Cleveland syndicate,
one of the most powerful forces in the national crime syndicate.
Hoe Dalitz had been one of the Mafia's biggest investors in
Las Vegas, and it had been Dalitz who had personally helped
set up the Howard Ilughes empire in Las Vegas. Dalitz had
sold much of his own holdings to Howard Hughes in the late
1960's.

CIA Withheld Data in JFK Probe
After President John F. Kennedy
was struck down on Nov. 22, 1963, the
Central Intelligence Agency received
evidence suggesting that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro arranged the assassi-
nation in retaliation for attempts on
his life.
Yet sources privy to the secret dis-
cussions at the highest levels of the
CIA during those hectic days now tell
us that the CIA deliberately withheld
the evidence from the Warren Com-
mission investigating Kennedy's death.
Our sources cite two reasons for
holding back this evidence. One was a
resolve to cover up the secret that the
CIA had enlisted Mafia mobsters to kill
Castro.
There also was a legitimate concern
that the Castro revelations might in-
flame the American people, whose
grief could have turned into a terrible
wrath that might have precipitated
.some rash action.
Only a few key people knew about
the CIA plot to assassinate Castro. One
was Attorney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy, who was his brother's personal
watchdog over the CIA. It has now
been established that Robert Kennedy
was briefed on May 7, 1962, about the
attempt to use underworld killers to
knock off Castro.
Two days later, Robert Kennedy cau-
tioned the CIA not to go ahead with
the assassination without consulting
him. Since Robert Kennedy rode herd
on the CIA, it must be assumed that he:
was kept advised of subsequent assassi-
nation attempts. However, there is no.
documentary evidence of this.
Records now available show that

eral at his McLean, Va., home for
nearly three hours.

Morgan refused to identify his
sources because it would have violated
the attorney-client privilege. But he
was an attorney of such stature that
we didn't doubt his word. He had been
chief inspector of the FBI. He had di:
rected the historic congressional inves
tigation of the Pearl Harbor bombing.
Later, he ran the investigation into the
excesses of the late Sen. Joseph McCar-
thy.
We got Morgan's permission, to
write a cautious story. We confirmed

source. Then on March 3, 1967, we

The next day, according to records
now available, Kennedy's secretary.
called for a copy of the May 7, 1962,
memo, which summarized the briefing
he had received on the assassination
plot.
On March 7, 1967, we reported more
details. "A reported CIA plan in 1963 to
assassinate Cuba's Fidel Castro," we
wrote,
may have resulted in a
counterplot by Castro to assassinate
President Kennedy."

Cuban Link to JFK Death

Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli. the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retali
ation, were involved in the assassina.
tion of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private.
conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who participated in
meetings between Rosselli and the
CIA.
○ An FBI "blind memorandum" on
an interview with Morgan dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without
identification of the interviewee, in.
last June's Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.
Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and "thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-
patched to the United States for the
purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken-
nedy."
Because neither Morgan nor Ros-
selli was identified in the Senate re-
port, the significance of that portion
of the 106-page document was dis-
counted at the time it was published
in June, before Rosselli's disappear.
ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post, however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
were the sources of the testimony that
suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-
nedy murder.
Morgan's account, according to a
summary of the FBI interview, was
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-
sion about a Cuban connection to the
Kennedy
from
"feedback" furnished by sources close
to Castro who were involved in the CIA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

"His (Morgan's) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
uals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey," the FBI in-
terview summary stated.
A long-time associate of Rosselli
who was interviewed separately by
The Washington Post, said there was
no question in the slain mobster's
mind that President Kennedy was
killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal
for the CIA schemes against the Cu-
ban leader.
"He was positive; he was sure," said
the associate, who knew Rosselli well
and was in contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
home on July 28. The associate, who
does not want to be identified pub-
licly, is scheduled to be interviewed
this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-
cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-
selli's contacts in the early 1960s with
CIA case officers overseeing the at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination-including
the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA has been that there was no
evidence that implicated the Castro
government or any of its agents.
"
However, the CIA's involvement in
the schemes to assassinate Castro
was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
circle of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity. President Johnson apparently
first learned about the schemes only
after a March 7, 1967, column by the
.late Drew Person, which prompted
Johnson to order a CIA investigation
of the highly sensitive episode.
Full details of the CIA-underworld
collusion in the plots to kill Castro
did not surface publicly until the pub-
lication last year of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee's assassination re:
port and the ensuing report last June

Then Marie became sick, and Frank
arranged her escape. Two Cuban offi-

Captain Hamilton's letter stated:
"This Department has under investigation Arthur
Lewis Clark, Sr., FBI 3709258, and a Roger Bauman.
These men are representing themselves as officials
of the Sunbeam Oil Company, 212 Roosevelt Theater
Building, Miami Beach, and both are spending money
very lavishly."
Clark has been arrested several times and has been
associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such
as James Fratianno, Victor Pereira, Eugene Brading,
Clarence Rhodes, Stephen Sambor and the Shaldone
brothers of Denver."
As investigator Peter Noves points out, the men listed
with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual "Who's Who"
of organized crime leaders between California and the Midwest.
(BRADING AND FRATIANNO)
Of these top Mafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps
the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known
as "Jimmie The Weasel." Fratianno was known as perhaps the
Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.
In 1959, in his testimony before the Rackets Committee of
the California legislature, Captain Hamilton, the Chief of
LAPD Intelligence, stated that,
"We have long considered Fratianno to
be the executioner for the Mafia on
the West Coast."
Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence
Division had linked Jimmie Fratianno to at least sixteen Mafia
exccutions.
Fratianno had once been arrested for the attempted assassination
of Los Angeles Mafia head Mickey Cohen in 1949! Cohen had
survived the bloody shooting which took the life of one of
his lieutenants. Pratianno was later released due to insuf-
ficient evidence. Fratianno used the alibi that he had been
at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the
shooting. Licata later became the new head of the Los Angeles
Mafia, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of
the Mafia in Dallas, Texas.

The JFK Assassination: Curiosity in Havana
An inquisitive American learns many things on a
visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high
officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the
investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-
opened. They are convinced that there was a Cuban
factor in the murder.
*Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban.
government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos.
Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed
closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence
Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-
sion investigation. The Cubans are well aware that the
doubts center on the failure of the CIA and the FBI to
inform the Warren Commission of the several plots
mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge
of these plots appears to have been withheld even
from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible.
for investigating the President's murder and for sup-
porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-
sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-
ble involvement of either the Cuban government or.
Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed
by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-
sible and a new inquiry imperative.
The situation is murkier and more perplexing than
ever. Those who are resistant to conspiracy theories
and who have been prepared-even, eager to be-
lieve that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone can no
longer rely on the Warren Commission report as an
"The writer is a senior fellow of the Council on For-
eign Relations.
adequate prop for their predilections. The commis-,
sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1963, at about the
very hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the
Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-
ing Cuban official (code-named AMLASH and re
cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur
der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba, a French re-
porter, Jean Daniel, was spending the day with Cas-
tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed
by President Kennedy in a brief interview at the
White House on Oct. 21, persuading Castro that Ken-
nedy wanted to explore ways to normalize relations.
Thus, at the moment the President was killed, U.S.
policy toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only
on two tracks but in opposite directions, and move.
ment on either track could have provoked violent re-
sponse by one or another Cuban faction..
Perceptions inside the Cuban government re-
sponded to both tendencies in U.S. policy. There is
good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation
involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept
one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CIA even-
tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was "inse-
cure" and terminated it. Among other discoveries.
within two days of the assassination it was known (but
not to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH had
been in contact with Soviet personnel in Mexico City,
where Oswald had gone in September 1963 to visit
hoth the Cuban and Soviet consulates. Whether these
facts are significant or merely coincidental, one can-
not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with
some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit
Cuba, implying that, had his request been granted.
the finger of suspicion would surely have pointed at
Havana.
Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM-
LASH to Castro was the sequence of events on Sept. 7,
1963, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-
ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding
year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called
in Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker for an un-
expected interview. Only three Western reporters-
were based in Havana at the time and their contact
with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban
leader had a message he wished to get on the record
through Harker. He charged that the United States
was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S..
leaders that "if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-
nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe."
This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory
and more understandable now that we know what
Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United
States was in fact stepping up its covert operations
against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet
it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol-
icy as it was then evolving.
For months afer the missile crisis of 1962, Castro
had been displeased with the Soviets, and there are
signs that he was interested in an opening to Wash-
ington. On Sept. 5, the Cubans quietly proposed talks
with the Americans at the United Nations, and Ken-
nedy soon responded with interest. Also, in early Sep-
tember the Time magazine bureau chief in Buenos
Aires, Gavin Scott, travelling on a Canadian passport,
spent two weeks in Cuba. Although key U.S. officials
have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that
occasion, the Cubans recall his questions and com- .
ments as hinting of American interest in a possible ac,
commodation, much as they were later to interpret
the discussions between Jean Daniel and Castro.
Then and now the Cubans' attitude toward Ken-
nedy has been a compound of political antipathy and
personal admiration. While critical of Kennedy's role.
in various counter-revolutionary efforts, Castro and
his associates voice a warm, almost affectionate re-
gard for the President's courage and realism. They.

profess to have seen his death as a grave setback to
more hopeful relations between the two countries.
The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment.,
the same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a
more mature, poised and forward-looking leader with
whom they could have done business.
With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu-
. late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an..
ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.
They emphasize that assassination is incompatible
with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they
never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre-
vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny
Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the.
CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with
Cuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder.
Castro has said publicly that he has no proof "count-
er-revolutionary elements" planned the assassination,
but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Further
investigation may still be inconclusive, but, far from:
seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-
tions, the Castro regime welcomes such an inquiry.
* Their curiosity seems greater than their complicity.

was
FBI that Rosselli wanted' to "keep
square with the bureau" but
afraid that the mob might kill him for
talking.
In 1967, after he was arrested for
gambling fraud at the Friars Club: in
Beverly Hills, Rosselli approached his
former CIA case officer, William Har-
vey, who sought unsuccessfully to¨in-
tercede in the prosecution.
It was against this background that
Morgan went, first to Drew Pearson,
and then the FBI, with Rosselli's sen-
sational allegations of CIA plotting
against Castro and the Cuban counter-
espionage directed against President
Kennedy.
Last April Rosselli told the Senate.
Intelligence Committee he had no rec-
ollection of either receiving informa-
tion that Castro retaliated against
President Kennedy or of having dis-
cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei-
ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic
memory loss or that Morgan's state-
ment to FBI agents nine years earlier
was a pure invention, a serious risk
for an established Washington lawyer.
No committee source could explain
the discrepancy, and Morgan declined
to confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
állegations against the Cuban govern-
ment or his recent testimony.
The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with Morgan was sent, to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: "No further investigation is
being conducted by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau.”
The Senate intelligence committee,
in commenting on this position, said
that "had the interviewing agents
known of the CIA-underworld plots
against Castro, they would have been
aware that the lawyer had clients who
had been active in the assassination
plots."
On March 21, FBI headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House, the attor-
ney general and the Secret Service. It
did not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan's allegations.
On the evening of the following
day, President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to the White
House. The next morning; March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen-
eral to prepare a report on the CIA
involvement in the assassination plots
-Operation Mongoose-of which
Helms had full knowledge at the time:
they were executed.
4
By May 22, Helms briefed President;
Johnson on the results. There is, how-
ever, no evidence that Helm's briefed;
the President on the November, 1963,
plot-one of eight major schemes on
- 3 -
Castro's life from 1960 to 1965-to as-
sassinate the Cuban leader through
the employment of an agent with the
cryptonymn AMLASH. His identity
was revealed as Rolando Cubela, a
1961 CIA "recruit" with close access
to Castro.
CIA operatives turned over assassi-
nation equipment to Cubela during a
* Paris meeting on November 22, 1963-
the day President Kennedy was killed
in Dallas. There has been subsequent
speculation that the mercurial and
talkative Cubela was either a double
agent or being monitored by Cuban
intelligence.
During the later days of his presi
dency, Mr. Johnson spoke cryptically
of a "Caribbean Murder Incorpo-
rated" targeted against Fidel Castro.
The inspiration for that statement un-
doubtedly was the CIA inspector gen-
eral's report he ordered Helms to have
prepared.
Within the past year, Rosselli and
two of his co-conspirators in the Cas-
} tro assassination schemes have died,
Giancana at the hands of a profes-
sional hit man and Harvey as the re-
sult of a "massive heart attack" last
June.
1
Mrs. William Harvey, the widow of
the deceased CIA official, said she
suspected no foul play in her hus-
band's death. She did, however, tell.
The Washington Post that she re-
ceived a call after Rosselli's disappear.
ance in late July warning her that Cu-
bans appeared to be attempting to
wipe out all those who participated in
the anti-Castro plots.
The call, she said, came from an old
friend who was acquainted with Ros-
selli's sister, whose name is Edith Dai-
gle. Mrs, Harvey said that Mrs. Daigle
told the mutual acquaintance that the
Rosselli family had received a tele.
phone threat from unidentified Cu-
bans prior to Rosselli's disappearance.
She also said that Rosselli had gone to
meet the Cubans in an effort to pro-
tect his family.
Mrs. Daigle could not be reached by
The Washington Post. But another sis-
ter of Rosselli said she had heard of
no such threats or warnings.
Harvey, who died at age 60 and
`whose exploits as a clandestine opera-
tor are both legendary and controver-
sial within the agency, testified to the
Senate Intelligence Committee. He
had become Rosselli's case officer in
Operation Mongoose and supplied the
mobster with poison pills, explosives,
detonators, rifles, handguns, radios
and boat radar for transmission to!
anti-Castro Cuban agents. Harvey and
Rosselli, a CIA superior testified to
the Senate committee, "developed a
close friendship.".
'
Another CIA official who worked
with Rosselli, James P. O'Connell, was
asked if he knew whether the agency
transmitted information to the mob-
ster on possible Cuban involvement in
the Kennedy assassination. He replied
that he was out of the country at the
time Kennedy was killed, and had no
further comment.

'
Two months before the Kennedy as-
sassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, who.
was identified by the Warren Commis-
sion as Kennedy's murderer, had trav-
eled to Mexico City in an attempt to
gain entry to Cuba. According to the
Warren Commission, Oswald repre-
sented himself as the head of the New
Orleans branch of the Fair Play for
Cuba organization and a friend of the
Cuban Revolution.
Some three months before Kennedy
was killed, Castro told Associated
Press reporter Daniel Harker that
U.S. leaders aiding terrorist plans to
eliminate Cuban leaders would them-
selves not be safe.
A U.S. government committee coor-
dinating policy toward Cuba at the
., time agreed there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate in some
fashion. However, it concluded Castro
would not risk a major confrontation
with the U.S. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.
I
1
On the same day Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CIA officer met with a
high-ranking Cuban official, who had
said he would kill Castro, to tell him
the U.S. would provide him with ex-
plosives and a poison pen device.
While the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient to justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassination was part of a
conspiracy, it also said .U.S. 'agencies
did not properly investigate the assas-
sination or tell the Warren Commis-
sion about the CIA plots on Castro's
life.
"There is no indication that the FBI
or the CIA directed the interviewing
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community," the Sen-
ate committee said.
According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder. the
FBI never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia.

agencies in the Kennedy assassination
and investigation.
The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters.
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum
¡weighted with chains but buoyed by
gases from decomposition on
on the
ocean's surface off the coast of Miami.
The specific cause of death was deter-
mined by an autopsy to be asphyxia-
tion.
Last year, an underworld colleague
of Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited by the
CIA in the effort to kill Castro, was.
found shot to death in his Chicago
home in what police described as a
highly professional job by assailants
who penetrated the mobster's per-
sonal security screen. Giancana was
due to testify before the Senate Intel-
¡ligence Committee shortly after his
demise.
1
Neither murder has been solved.
The possibility that Rosselli's mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schemes
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.
The involvement of Rosselli. Gian-
cana and other underworld figures-
principally Santos Trafficante of
Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution-in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.
The tangled chronology of suppres
sion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-
li's murder adds significance to those
events.
Here is the sequence, pieced to-
gether from the testimony given to
Senate intelligence investigators:
Columnist Drew Pearson went to
the late Chief Justice of the United
States Earl Warren late in January,
1967, and told him that a Washington.
lawyer had confided to him that one
of his clients said the United States
"had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro
had decided to retaliate."
Warren declined Pearson's sugges
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-
tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,
1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho
over, informing him of the allegations.
}
• Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an "eyes-
only" basis. There is no record of FBI
meetings or discussions of those alle-
gations. At that point the sensitive let-
ter bounced back and forth in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
racy.
The job of responding to Rowley's
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI's General Investigative Di-
vision who was given responsillity for
. the overall assassination investigation
in March 1964.
This official's job was complicated
by the fact that he had never been in-
formed of what Hoover and his closest
circle of confidants in the FBI learned
early in 1962-that the CIA was
deeply involved in
assassination
attempts against Castro, and promi-
nent American underworld figures, in-
cluding Rosselli and Giancana, had
been recruited for the attempts...
So on Feb. 15, 1967, the FBI official
prepared a draft reply to the Rowley
letter for his superiors saying "our in-
vestigation uncovered no evidence in-
dicating Fidel Castro officials of the
Cuban Government were involved
with Lee Harvey Oswald in the assas-
sination of President Kennedy. This
'bureau is not conducting, any investi-
gation regarding this matter." The
TBI official added in later testimony
that "everyone in the higher echelons

Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished a column on March 7, 1967, ref-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro's life in 1963 "may
have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy."

Ten days later, Marvin Watson, one
of Lyndon Johnson's chief deputies,

"Under the circumstances,' De-
Loach concluded in a memo for the.
files, "it appears that we have no al-

and then furnish the results to Wat

The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI's General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate
1
committee concluded was "puzzling"
because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had been as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foreign involvement in the
assassination.
Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA's assassina-
tion plots against Castro. Both agents
testified eight years later that they
were "surprised" when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to U.S. at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.

Could Rosselli Have Linked
Castro Plot to JFK Death?
By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Staff Writer
In 1960, when the CIA was try-
ing to set up a delicate attempt on
the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to
a man once described as "the big-
gest flag waving SOB in the coun-
try" West Coast underworld
I figure Johnny Rosselli.
Rosselli - a seemingly improba-
ible conspirator in a government
plot got the "flag-waving" label
from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana,
then Chicago's top crime boss and
a man Rosselli brought into that
'same plot.
Now both are dead, murdered in
the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro only
recently made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission
are vital clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy assassination.
The aeaths of Giancana, in June
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in
Washington, where on Friday the
House of Representives voted to re-
open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder.
REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.), who will be chairman of the.
panel, said he is "convinced" a con-
spiracy was involved in Kennedy's:
death.
Now, in the aftermath of the vi-:
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-
selli, the question arises of what
role, if any, the Kennedy White
House played in the early 1960s
"deal" the CIA made with the two
underworld figures to have Castro.
murdered.
Whether the Kennedy White
House knew about about the CIA's
plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found.
out after the contacts were ended),
the CIA's use of the underworld
seems ironic in retrospect.
✓ Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-
forts to disable organized crime are
well documented.
:
IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy
wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to
the Senate Rackets Committee, he
too quoted Giancana to make a
point.
He told about Giancana's inter-
view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War II, when
he was asked what he did for a liv«
ing.
"I steal," Giancana is said to
have replied.
¡ So Sam Giancana didn't go to
war and years later would boast to
Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
he stayed out of the Army la-
beled unfit by telling the truth.
"What's wrong with the syndi-
cate?" Kennedy, quoted Giancana.
"Two or three of us get together
on a business deal and everybody
says it's a bad thing. Businessmen
do it all the time and nobody
squawks."
A Senate committee began stu-:
dying the Kennedy questions more
than a year ago as it looked at co-
vert CIA activities.
IN AN addendum to the Senate
Intelligence Committee's interim
report last November, Sen. Howard
Baker (R., Tenn.) said, "It is my
personal view that on balance the
likelihood that presidents (the re-
port dealt with Dwight Eisenhower
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)
assassination plots is greater than
the likelihood that they did not.".
Just to trace Rosselli's history
(with the CIA is mind-boggling for
the investigators. Yet, it is just one
aspect of the search for his killer.
Wwww
Johnny Rosselli born on the
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and
71 when he died was not first
and foremost a CIA operative.
*His greater role as evidenced by.
two convictions, his associations
and to some extent his own com-
ments, was as an influential, if
publicly lesser known, organized
crime figure.
HIS ASSOCIATION with other
identified underworld members.
was monitored by law enforcement
agencies as recently as several.
weeks before his July 28 disap-
pearance.
By all accounts, Rosselli was as
charming man, dressing in expen-
sive clothes, married for only two
(years in the early 1940s
1940s and
known most of his life as one who
easily attracted women.
1
He was an immigrant who told
[in a short autobiography written
about 1967 that his "life of crime"
began as a teenager in Boston, at-
tempting arson for his stepfather
and stealing $50 on his own. As her:
traveled west, finally to settle in
California, his attention turned to
(bootlegging, gambling and dab-
bling in the movie business.
IT IS said that Rosselli guarded
the West Coast gambling interests
for Giancana's Chicago syndicate.
Why Rosselli was chosen by the
CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-
clear, although CIA officials have
'since testified that they wanted the
kind of contacts in Cuba which or-
ganized crime had made during the
pre-Castro days when Havana was
a gamblers' haven.
Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence with
Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid-
ered the key underworld gambling
figure in Havana.
The unraveling of CIA and un-
derworld conspiracies, an awesome
web spanning decades, is left to a
team of nine in the Metro Homicide
Division. It is a team now clearly
consumed by the task which has
been a full-time operation since
Rosselli's body was pulled from
Dumfoundling Bay on Aug. 7.

Hughes eventually bought the
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.
What Rosselli told the federal
grand jury about the Frontier, in
1971 is unknown.. Rosselli didn't
testify later at the trial at which:
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-
izzi and the Emprise Corp., among:
others, were convicted.
ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in
jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select Committee
Crime probed the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports and one
area they looked at was Emprise
and the Frontier Hotel case.
At the time of the conviction, the
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately,
because monitored, wiretapped'
conversations showed that the two
had talked about "murder, the kill-
ing of certain individuals.
"
An intimate associate of Rosselli.
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli's grand jury appear-
ance could have led to his death.
"They know Johnny didn't talk to
the grand jury," the associate said.
JOE BREEN said Rosselli hadn't
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that "he's never even seen the gift
shop."

Since his prison release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn't
trying to regain power: according
to his friends. "He had no muscle,'
said an associate."I can't believe
Rosselli was getting back into mob
stuff."
But at the same time, 'many of
the associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized crime fig-
ures on the West Coast.
Several associates speculate that
Rosselli. wanted to get involved in
casino gambling, preferably in the
Middle East, and was looking for
someone with money to back him..
"MY IMPRESSION was that he
was broke." Morgan said. "He told
me last year, 'I'm in bad financial.
straits.'
Scheer said Rosselli's income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
_ernment fines.
One friend said that just before
Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac-
cepted Giancana's offer of money.
The friend was to act as the inter-
mediary. “Let me figure out what
my next (attorney's) tab will be,
the friend. quoted Rosselli as say-
ing.
Rosselli is described as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-
tle offending.
A California woman who had
known Rosselli for about 40 years
. told The Herald, "If you were.
around him for 30 minutes you'd
like him because he would regard
you as a human being."
"If you had a headache he would
either get you an aspirin or send
someone to get one. I said some-
thing significant there he would
get it or he would send someone

he wasn't a pansy, but he wasn't a

THAT THE Metro team is even
Involved is happenstance. Rosselli
lived in Plantation, Broward Coun-
ty, with his sister and brother-in-
law. It's just that his killers chose
to dump his body in Dade.
While several detectives
detectives
their instincts lead them to con-
clude that the Rosselli murder was
an internal underworld affair, all
on the team are aware of the pres-
sure on them to search each clue'
that leads back to the CIA-Castro
affair.
With Rosselli's death this sum-
mer, the newly appointed Senate
¡ committee saw its list of knowl-
edgeable witnesses further trim-
med. Some of those witnesses have
died violently and some from natu-
ral causes.
When Giancana was murdered in
June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle - even
though. the murderer is still un-
known.
The death of Rosselli, who had
appeared before the committee
three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con-
cern on Capitol Hill.
THE SAME night Rosselli's body
was identified the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
into an oil drum Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for the FBI to
get involved in the case. (Several
days later, Attorney General Ed-
ward Levi ordered FBI involve-
ment.)
It wasn't until several weeks
later, however, that what
known to Baker became public
knowledge.
A section of the former commit-
tee's April report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967 went.
to Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren (chairman of the
then-disbanded Warren Commis-
sion) to say that two of his clients.
believed they knew about Cuban.
agents in the United States who
conspired in the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.
THE INFORMATION eventually
reached the FBI, but as the Senate
committee concluded this year, the
1967 FBI probe was slipshod and
incomplete.
One of the clients referred to in.
the report has since been identified"
as Rosselli. And it has since been
learned that Rosselli was con-
vinced he held a vital clue to the
JFK murder.
:
"There was never the slightest
doubt in John's mind that Castro
was responsible for the assassina-.
tion of Kennedy," said Edward P.
Morgan, the attorney referred to in
the report.
Morgan is an attorney of no
mean stature in Washington. He
served as chief counsel to the joint
congressional committee which
studied the Pearl Harbor attack,
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
years was chief inspector of the
FBI.
ROSSELLI told Morgan about
the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-
partment of Justice was vigorously
attempting to deport Rosselli for
being an illegal alien.
Rosselli, Morgan said, "was cer-
tain that the people he (Rosselli)
put around Castro in the CIA plot
turned right around and killed Ken-
nedy. The people he still knew (in
1967) did it."
Rosselli, according to Morgan,
decided to talk about his CIA activ- :
ity in hopes of decreasing the pres-
sure from the FBI and Department:
of Naturalization and Immigration,.
both Justice Department agencies.
Several friends of Rosselli, in-
cluding Morgan, say they are con-
vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli
to become an organized crime in-
formant by threatening to have:
him deported if he didn't coopera-.
te.
IN 1961, through a bungled
wiretap effort, the FBI became.
aware of Rosselli's CIA activities.
While Giancana and Rosselli :
were in Florida planning the opera-
tion, Giancana wanted to return to
Las Vegas to check on his girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he
suspected of dating comedian Dan
Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori-
da, it was agreed that a bug would
be placed in her hotel room and her
conversations monitored.
But the private detective they
hired, with CIA money it has since
been learned, was discovered and
arrested. Eventually the police in- :
vestigation led back to the Castro
plotters.
Prosecution was avoided when
the CIA intervened and said the
"national interest" would be dam-
aged if the plot information be-
came public.
WHEN THE wiretap case was
again to be investigated in 1966,
this time by a Senate committee
headed by the late Sen. Edward
Long (D., Mo.), the CIA again step-
ped in to stop it.
Morgan was told about the pend-
ing investigation by Rosselli and
Robert Mahue, a former FBI
agent-turned Howard Hughes aide
who was the CIA's. initial link to
Rosselli.
Mahue told Morgan that both he
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to
appear before the committee. Mor-
gan said he called Lawrence Hous-
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous-
ton went to Long and the investi-
gation was dropped.
MORGAN SAID he knew, as the
Senate committee recently empha-.
sized as well, that all information.
about the CIA plots which could
have been the incentive for pro-
Castro forces to kill Kennedy
had been kept from the Warren
Commission.
"I was an admirer of Earl War-
ren, Morgan said. "(His) report
said that Oswald alone killed.
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli.
that the Chief Justice could put his
name on a report which didn't as-
sess the most significant piece of
evidence bearing on the killing of
Kennedy."
The information Morgan had
was passed to Warren via colum-
nist Drew Pearson, a mutual
friend. Eventually, it reached the
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-
rect orders from President Lyndon
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-
vestigation was not vigorously pure
sued.
THE SENATE Intelligence Com-
mittee compared that apparent. in-
action with a statement former FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover made to
the Warren Commission on May 5,
1964. Hoover said, "well, I can as-
sure you so far as the FBI is con-.
cerned the case will be continued:
in an open classification for all-
time. That is, any information com-
ing to us or any report coming to:
us from any source will be thor-
oughly investigated, so that we
will be able to prove or disprove
the allegation.
A Senate Committee staff mem
ber commented recently, "what is
really happening is that the investi-
gation which the FBI should have
done in 1967 and no one can
come close to explaining why it
wasn't is actually being done
now."
HART, AS have local investiga-
tors, has established three possible
scenario's for Rosselli's death: his
recent organized crime activity, re-
taliation for his Castro assassina-
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.

was a "Cuban factor" in the JFK
death, but they see it as a result of

article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-

tions in Washington.

vana recently and met with Cuban.
officials including Deputy Prime
Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.
they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Gi-
ancana and Johnny Rosselli
surely have some connection with
1 Cuban exile politics and the 'Kenne-
dy murder," Frye wrote.
THERE HAVE been theories re-
cently propounded to show why
both pro and anti-Castro forces
could have wanted to get JFK out
of power in 1963.
On the one hand, there is the re-
port of French journalist Jean Dan-
iel, who was the bearer to Castro
1 of an offer from JFK for calmer re-
lations. Castro was reportedly
%
'
agreeable. The report stated that
Daniel later was lunching with.
Castro when word came that Ken-
nedy had been shot. Daniel de-
scribed the Cuban leader as genu-
inely shocked by the news.
It has since been learned that
probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
from a CIA agent in what was a
long-running anti-Castro effort.
That Cuban agent was code-named
AM/LASH, and he has since been
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi-
nation plotting.
WHETHER JFK had knowledge
of, or perhaps even approved, any:
of the assassination plots will prob~;
ably never be known.
His closest advisers, who testi-
fied before the Senate Committee,
all said he had no knowledge of
such plots and would never have
approved of them.
The same month Rosselli was
passing poison pills to his Cuban
contact at a meeting at the Fon-
tainebleau, March of 1961, former
Florida Sen. George Smathers, a
friend of Kennedy, said he and
Kennedy discussed the ramifica-"
tions of a Castro assassination.
Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-
cussion was more of a "brain-pick-
ing" session.
AT LEAST one high-level CIA
official did testify he believed the
White House was being briefed on
the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of "plau-
sible deniability."
That, according to the recent
Senate report, "can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed."
Another alleged link between'
the White House and the under-
world plotters, first made public by
the Senate Committee, has also
been denied by virtually everyone
involved. Judith Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have
been friend and lover to both Gian-
cana and JFK, introduced to both
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in
the Castro plotting, those close to
both Giancana and Kennedy have
said.
A MAN with access to Kenne-
dy's closest advisers told The Her-
ald recently, "The Giancana-Ros-
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner
thing. I was there. Sure JFK knew
her, but he was naive about those
kinds of things."
.
There is documentation to show
that on March 22, 1962, Hoover
lunched privately with Kennedy
and presumably gave him his first
information linking Exner with the
gangsters. The final recorded
phone call between the White
House and Exner was made only a
few hours later.
Another possible link discussed
in the Senate report shows that the
same unidentified Cuban to whom
Rosselli passed the poison pills.
prior to the Bay of Pigs operation
in April of 1961, was among a
group of Cuban exile leaders who
met with JFK following the inva-.
sion fiasco.
IT IS known that several of the
Cubans with
with whom Rosselli
worked have been identified, but
investigators say that not all are
known.
:
}
As a condition to his appear-.
ances before the Senate Committee
in the past year, it was agreed that
Rosselli "would not state the
names or confirm the existence of
those agents whom he knew:
about," Rosselli's attorney Leslie
Scheer said.
The friends and acquaintances of
Rosselli who could be contacted by
The Herald all said they never
heard the names of the Cuban
; agents,
But a committee source cau-
tioned, "they (Cuban agents) read
the committee's report, they know
who's being referred to."
ANOTHER Rosselli
attorney,
Tom Wadden, a partner of Edward
Bennett Williams, said, “Yes, I
think he had more knowledge":
than he testified to.
Searching Rosselli's more recent
past for enemies also presents
problems, investigators say.
The decline of John Rosselli ap-
pears to begin in the late 1960s. In
1967, he was convicted in a card-
cheating scandal at the posh, celeb-
rity-filled Friar's Club in Los An-
geles where the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ac-
cording to investigators.
Deportation pressures were also
mounting at this time.
ROSSELLI entered prison on the
conviction in 1970 where he would:
serve three years of a five-year.
sentence.
In 1971, he was brought to a.
federal grand jury in Los Angeles
which was probing whether some

Rosselli, too, had, an interest in
the Frontier, which opened in 1967.
He owned the gift shop concession
along with a partner named Joe.
Breen. How Rosselli obtained the
concession is unclear, but Breen.
said it gave Rosselli an income of
about $60,000.
ROSSELLI at one time had been
a major influence in Las Vegas.

Vegas were found dead in a parked car following the
robbery. Both of their skulls had been shattered by
bullets fired behind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia
fashion.
Fratianno had also been linked to the famous murder of
Harry "Hooky" Rothman, who had been another close
associate of Mickey Cohen, the Los Angeles Mafia head.
Also, Fratianno was also linked to the disappearance of
another top member of the Mickey Cohen gang, Frank Niccoli.
Niccoli had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner
at Fratianno's home one night.
+1
Fratianno was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-
man in northern California in 1952. Thomas Keen, a wealthy
gambler, had apparantly welched on a $80,000 gambling debt
that he owed the Mafia, and was blown to bits from a dynamite
charge hidden under the hood of his car.
Fratianno later served a six year prison term (1954-1960) for
extortion. In later years Fratianno became the central figure
involved in LOOK magazine's "expose" of San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto's alleged Mafia connections. LOOK alleged that
Fratianno had become a close friend of Mayor Alito and that
the Mayor had arranged for Fratianno to receive loans of over
$105,000 from a bank where Alioto served as Chairman of the
Board. Alioto admitted that Fratianno was a "casual acquaintance"
of his, but denied that he had used any influence in the loans.
The Mayor also said that he had not known that the notorious
Fratianno was a member of the Mafia.
.
(BRADING AND MELTZER)
While in Los Angeles, Brading (Jim Braden) also became
connected with top Mafia leader Harold "Happy" Meltzer.
The LAPD Intelligence Division had originally become
aware of Brading's close relationship with lieltzer when
Brading's name was found on Meltzer's Christmas card list.
Meltzer was widely known as one of the most powerful Mafia
leaders in the entire nation.
The U.S. Sonate Rackets Committee identified Brading's
friend Heltzer as a top Mafia boss in the areas of union
racketeering and narcotics.

To advise you that an Agent of the Secret Service, when
testifying before the President's Commission, denied making certain
statements to FBI Agents which were subsequently reported to the
Commission. :
DETAILS:
In Volume II of the hearings before the President's
Commission commencing on page 61 there appears the testimony
of Roy H. Hellerman, Assistant Special Agent, White House Detail,
U. S. Secret Service on 3-9-64.
*In Charge
R
Under questioning by a Commission member, Kellerman
was asked about certain statements reportedly made by him on
11-22-63, to SA's Francis X. O Neill, Jr. and James W. Sibert,
of our Baltimore Office, which appear in the 12-10-63 Dallas
report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling (page 3, paragraph
4). SA's O'Neill and Sibert were under orders to be observers
during the autopsy of President Kennedy at the National Naval
Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, which commenced on the
evening of 11-22-63, to be of assistance to the Secret Service;
and to look after the Bureau's interests.
Our Agents, in conversation with Kellerman, sometime
during the evening of 11-22-63, learned of certain information
portions of which were reported as follows:
"He advised he heard a shot and immediately
turned around, looking past Governor Connally
who was seated directly in back of him, to the
President. He observed the President slumped
forward and heard him say, 'Get me to a hospital.
Mr. Kellerman then heard Mrs. Kennedy say,
'Oh, no!', as the President leaned towards her.

A. Rosen to Mr. Belmont Memo
RE: PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION
The Commission in questioning Kellerman made specific
reference to the underscored portions of the above paragraph
as it contradicts some of Kellerman's testimony. Kellerman
claims he did not hear the President nor Mrs. Kennedy say
these things and had never told our Agents that he had. In
part of Kellerman's denial he stated "I don't know where they
got those quotes."
OBSERVATIONS:.
:
1
1
Kellerman is claiming our Agents furnished inaccurate
accounts of a conversation with him. It is to be remembered
that at the time this conversation with our Agents reportedly
took place 11-22-63, Kellerman had been a security guard in
the President's car and more than likely was upset and feeling
remorse over the days episode. In his testimony before the
Commission hebendeavored to give the impression that he acted
calmly and immediately took command, issuing logical instructions
after the President was hit. The conversation reported by
our Agents made it appear Kellerman reacted normally to the
tragedy and not dramatically as indicated in his testimony,
as he didn't order the driver to the hospital until after the
President had so directed.
It is felt our Agents reported accurately what
Kellerman told them on 11-22-63, and that Kellerman's testimony
3 months later is the result of considered deliberation, on
his part, to paint the most favorable picture possible, under
the circumstances, for the Secret Service.
Consideration has been given to discussing this matter
with Chief Rowley of Secret Service, however, since it is the
word of our Agents against Kellerman's, it is not felt any good
purpose would be served by this course of action.
RECOMMENDATION:
Affidavits are being obtained from our Agents Sibert
and O'Neill attesting to the accuracy of their report and
refuting Kellerman so that we will be in a position to show
any future inquirer that we recognized this contradiction and
did something about it.

2. We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria
Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-
mitted the 'information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we
have not been able to locate any documents relating to this
matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.
3. We have been unable to locate any documents which
would indicate that there was
a response to DIR 86054 from
Mexico City.

Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

A report of the Senate Rackets Committee from 1964 states:
"Meltzer now is reported to operate a large
bookmaking and prostitution syndicate in
California. A major figure in the organized
underworld, he is known to all the important
narcotics traffickers throughout the United
States. He has also operated in Oklahoma
Texas, Baltimore, Miami, Las Vegas, Boston,
and various areas of Canada, Cuba, Hong Kong,
Japan, Hawaii, and the Philippines."

(BRADING AND THE SICAS)
Joe,
In Los Angeles, Brading also became closely associated with
yet another top Mafia operation. Brading became a close
friend and associate of the notorious Sica brothers
Freddie, and George. The Sica brothers were particularly
brutal syndicate members specializing in narcotics..
In 1950, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles accused Brading's
friends, Joe and Freddie Sica, of heading the single largest
narcotics ring in the United States.
The Sica brothers were shortly thereafter brought to trial.
On the night before the trial opened, the government's
star witness, an informant named Abe Davidian, was mysteriously
shot to death in his mother's home in Fresno. The murder was
never solved and the Sica brothers were soon released for
lack of evidence.

Mexican Comunists who had contact with Oswald,

of their having been in a group with Oswald here last fall.

Jim Braden: Possible Link To Jack Ruby
The same inadequate investigative work which led the
Warren Commission to largely overlook Jack Ruby's solid
Mafia involvement, appears also to have been responsible
for the failure to uncover Jim Braden's true identity of
Eugene Brading during the official investigation into the
Kennedy assassination.
TIL
As shown in the previous account of Jack Ruby's very
substantial ties to the Mafia, Ruby was particularly
involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.
But beyond the multiplicity of evidence which indicates
that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden were both important Mafia
figures operating in the same general areas, at the same
general times, there is another single piece of evidence
which places both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the
day before the assassination.
Evidence indicates that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby
visited the Dallas offices of the H.L. Hunt Oil Company
on the afternoon of November 21, 1963, just twenty four
hours before the President was murdered. Obviously any
link which places both Braden and Ruby in the same place
at the same time on the day before the assassination does
of course raise further significant questions about a
possible relationship between the two men.
Jim Braden received permission from the U.S. Board of
Parole in Los Angeles to make a trip to Dallas Texas on
November 13, 1963, four days before the assassination.
Braden was required to report all of his travels to his
Parole Board following his parole in 1959 for the embez-
zlement conviction.
☑F
.
On November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination,
Jim Braden checked in with the U.S. Parole Office in
Dallas. According to Roger Carroll, the Chief Barole.
Officer in Dallas, Braden (Brading "advised that he
planned to see Lamar Hunt and other oil speculators while
here." Lamar Hunt is the son of H.L. Hunt, the famous
right-wing oil billionaire.

Honorable 5. Lee Rankin
The personal description of Ruby as obtained by
Special Agent Flynn on March 11, 1959, did not in itself contain
the remark "known Dallas criminal." This remark was added to
the description by Special Agent Louis M. Kelley at the time
when he was assisting in the preparation of the report of Special
Agent Manning C. Clements at Dallas dated November 30, 1963.
Enclosed herewith is the affidavit of Special Agent Louis M.
Kelley at Little Rock, Arkansas, dated June 4, 1964, setting
forth his basis for adding the remark "known Dallas area
criminal" to the description of Ruby as it appears in the report
of Special Agent Manning C. Clements at Dallas dated November 30,
1963, and in the enclosure to my letter to you of April 7, 1964.
The summaries concerning the ten named individuals in
your letter of June 1, 1964, are currently being prepared and
will be forwarded to you promptly upon completion.

Paul Rothermel, a former FBI agent who was Director of
Security for the Hunt Oil Company in Dallas at that time,
has recalled that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting
the Hunt offices on November 21 in the company of three
other men Rothermel has stated that the office log for
November 21 showed that Roger Bauman (Brading's old Mafia
friend) and Horgan Brown and Duane Nowlin "and friend"
visited the Junt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states.
that Braden was definitely the "friend."
(Security chief Paul Rothermel was later fired by II.L. Hunt's
sons after reports allegedly surfaced that Rothermel was
"suspicious" of a possible Hunt connection to the assassin-
ation. Following his termination by the hunts, Rothermel
found that he was being illegally wiretapped. Rothermel
filed suit against Lamar Hunt and another one of H.L. Hunt's
sons, charging them with the wiretapping, and asking for
several million dollars in damages. The suit, which has
produced very damaging evidence against the Hunt brothers,
is still in the courts.)
1
Also on November 21, the day before the assassination,
according to a conclusion of the Warren Commission, Jack
Ruby was also on his way to the H.L. Hunt offices in Dallas.
The Warren Commission concluded that Jack Ruby drove a woman
friend of his to the Hunt offices sometime that same after-
noon. The woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub
as a stripper, drove with Ruby to the lunt offices, apparantly
in search of employment. This does coincide with Braden's
visit to the same offices on that same afternoon.
The Warren Commission investigated several other possible
links of Jack Ruby to the Hunts, including the still
unexplained fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found inside
one of Ruby's notebooks. But of these possible links, the
Warren Commission concluded only that evidence did indicate
that Ruby had driven to the Hunt offices on November 21..
Thus a possible Ruby-Braden connection on the day before
the President's assassination does indeed arise.

I arrived at Dallas, Texas, November 23, 1963, to
assist in the investigation of the assassination of President
John Fitzgerald Kennedy and related matters. On or about
November 24, 1963, I was assigned to review all previously
existing files and current information as to Jack L. Ruby and
to prepare an insert based on such file review for inclusion
This insert was to include such
in an investigative report.
physical description and biographical data as were available
from the file review and from information developed on
November 24, 1963. I had before me at the time I dictated
the insert information which had been obtained on November
24, 1963, by other Special Agents of the FBI and from the
Identification Division files of the Dallas Police Department.
The Dallas Police Department records, under Dallas Police
Department No. 22255, included information concerning arrests
of Ruby dating from February 4, 1949, to March 14, 1963.
In dictating the physical description and biographical
data concerning Ruby, I possibly included under the heading
"Remarks," "Known Dallas area criminal," based on the fact I
had before me Ruby's identification record from the Dallas
Police Department, which listed several arrests in the Dallas
area. This would have been the only thing on which such an
observation could have been based.

Dear Mr. Rankin:
Your letter of June 1, 1964, requesting summaries
of FBI reports with regard to ten named persons and certain
information regarding the contact by Special Agent Charles W.
Flynn with Jack L. Ruby on March 11, 1953, is berewith
acknowledged.
19ge,
As you were advised by my letter of February 27,
1964, Jack Ruby was contacted by Special Agent Charles W.
Flynn of the Dallas Office on March 11, 1959, in view of his
position as a night club operator who might have knowledge of

was to determine whether or not Ruby did have such knowledge,.
and if so, if he would be willing to furnish information to
this Sureau. Ruby was advised of the FBI's jurisdiction in
criminal matters, and he expressed a willingness to furnish
information. A personal description of Ruby was obtained by
Special Agent Flynn on the occasion of this contact on
March 11, 1959, but no information or other results were
obtained. Between March 11, 1959, and October 2, 1959, Ruby
was contacted on eight other occasions, but he furnished no
information whatever and further contacts with him were
discontinued.

The Washington Merry-Go-Round
FBI Withheld Data on JFK Slaying
By Jack Anderson
and Les Whitten
WHOST 10/27 1,
The FBI withheld from the
Warren Commission hundreds
of documents about the
assassination of President ..
Kennedy.
These are raw FBI files,
which
the commission
requested but never received.
They contain no startling
information that will overturn
the commission's verdict, but
they reveal intimately how the
FBI handled its most im-
portant case.
In the margins of some
suppressed memos, the late
FBI chief, J. Edgar Hoover,
scribbled caustic comments in
blue ink. He was critical of
almost everyone involved in
the investigation, from Dallas
police chief Jesse Curry to
President Lyndon Johnson.
Confidential notes kept by
one top FBI official, for
example, quote Hoover as
warning: "Johnson may
become very dictatorial. We
* must keep our guard up."
Sources familiar with the
suppressed documents say the
contents were summarized
and submitted to the Warren
Commission. But there were
some subtle, perhaps
deliberate, omissions.
The documents show that
Hoover brought pressure on
his subordinates to rush out a
preliminary report on the FBI
investigation before the
murdered President's
brother, Robert F. Kennedy,
returned to his desk as
Attorney General.
The confidential notes quote
Hoover as instructing his
subordinates to get the report
out of the Justice Department
"before Bobby gets back."
Apparently, the FBI chief
also feared Deputy Attorney
General Nicholas deB. Kat-
zenbach might tamper with
the report before forwarding it
to the Warren Commission.
Hoover told his aides to alert
President Johnson's major-
domo, Walter Jenkins.
"Let Jenkins know after
report is out of our hands."
Hoover directed. "Let Jenkins
know what Katzenbach is
doing. Might cause long delay.
Must
consider any
not
alteration."
Thirteen days after
President Kennedy was
gunned down in Dallas,
Hoover delivered a detailed
report to Katzenbach naming
Lee Harvey Oswald as the
assassin. Katzenbach kept it
four days before submitting it
to the commission.
The crusty old G-man was
furious at the Dallas police
chief, meanwhile, for leaking
the story that the FBI had
investigated. Oswald but had
failed to alert the Secret
Service.
9
"This is the lowest level in
history of Bureau since I have
been director," Hoover
lamented, according to the
confidential notes.
He contended that Oswald
had never been seen with
firearms, had written no hate
letters against U.S. leaders.
As a former defector, he also
knew he was a marked man
whom the FBI was watching.
"With that background,"
.
grumbled Hoover. "how could
he be security risk? No in-
dication of violence so far as
our records show. . . Oswald
could have hollered false
him.
arrest if we had arrested
19
The FBI chief commented
that Chief Justice Earl
Warren, who headed the
commission, "would have
been first one to holler" about
Oswald's rights. Citing the
criticism of the FBI, Hoover
commented: "This is one of
the rough ones."
He felt, therefore, that
President Johnson should
have endorsed the FBI report.
"President should have .
backed up report," com-
plained over, "based on
evideze gathered by the
FRI."
In private remarks that
were never intended to be
repeated outside his inner
circle, he made deprecating
remarks not only about
· President Johnson but about
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.). who was then
preparing to run against LBJ
for the presidency.
"Goldwater has no sound
advisers around him," Hoover
noted. But his comment on
Johnson was more deadly:
"LBJ's speeches are dull."
The Warren Commission
adopted a resolution,
meanwhile, calling for "the
raw materials upon which any
reports given to the com-
mission are based, together
}
•
with all raw materials and
reports relating to the work of
the commission since the date
of any and all earlier reports.'
J. Lee Rankin, the general
counsel, followed up with a
"Dear Edgar" letter to the
FBI chief requesting the full
files
" as promptly as
possible." But they were
never delivered.
A commission lawyer,
remembering those days;
more than a decade ago,
told us: "Nobody ever got the
FBI's own files." In 1963-64.
another staff member pointed
out, the FBI "could do no
wrong," so no one pressed too
hard for their internal
records.
Now 12 years after the
'Kennedy assassination, a
fascinating story is still locked.
in FBI files awaiting a public
reopening. We will tell part of.
The story in future columns.
Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-
Pa.), chairman of the Benate
intelligence subcommittee
investigating
the
assassination, is seeking the
full story from the FBI.

Footnote: FBI spokesmen
stoutly defended the FBI's
findings and the thoroughness :
of the investigation. They
conceded that "informative"
and "deliberative" memos
were not given to the com-
mission. But "everything they
needed was given them. They

The Washington Merry-Go-Round
Oswald-Agent Contact Covered Up
W Past 10/288
By Jack Anderson
and Les Whitten
The late J. Edgar Hoover, in
his zeal to protect his beloved
FBI, engineered a cover-up 12
years ago to keep the Warren
Commission from learning
about the ties between FBI
agent James Hosty and
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.
The formidable Hoover,
whose bulldog visage had
become a national symbol of
law and order, intervened:
personally when the Warren
Commission began to zero in
on Hosty.

on the Dallas police force, Lt.
Jack Revill, that the FBI had
a file on Oswald. Revill
repeated the conversation to a
superior who ordered him to
put it in writing.
Now, 12 years later, Hosty
has admitted destroying a
threatening note, which
Oswald delivered to the FBI
office in Dallas a few days
before shooting President
John F. Kennedy

This might have saved

grizzled FBI chief complained
that Hosty had "diarrhea of

nevertheless, sought to cover
up the FBI's embarrassment.

gave the Warren Comnission a

notebook. The summary

Jan. 27. 1964, Hoover
acknowledged that Hosty's

notebook.
The G-man also gave what
purported to be a full account
of the FBI's contacts with
Oswald. The last contact, he
reported, had been on Aug. 10, :
1963. "We did not interview
Oswald in Dallas, Texas, or in
Irving, Texas, prior to the
assassination of President:
Kennedy," Hoover added.
Interestingly, he used the
word "our" to describe the
last contact with the FBI. But
on Feb. 6, in a sworn affidavit,
Hoover changed the wording
in a curious way. He swore
☐ that Oswald had no contact
with FBI "agents" after Aug.
10, 1963.
It is now known, of course,
that Oswald appeared at the
FBI office in Dallas a few days
before the assassination. At
that time, just as Hoover said,
he did not speak with any FBI
"agents." But he spoke with
ah FBI receptionist, who
passed on his threatening note
to the agents.
It is imposisible to know
whether the late FBI chief
subtly switched the word
"our" to "agents" in order to
hide his knowledge of
Oswald's violent threat.

The Washingto Port, 9/9/76.
CIA Withheld Data in JFK Probe
After President John F. Kennedy
was struck down on Nov. 22, 1963, the
Central Intelligence Agency received
evidence suggesting that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro arranged the assassi-
nation in retaliation for attempts on
his life.
Yet sources privy to the secret dis-
cussions at the highest levels of the
CIA during those hectic days now tell,
us that the CIA deliberately withheld
the evidence from the Warren Com-
mission investigating Kennedy's death.
Our sources cite two reasons for
holding back this evidence. One was a
resolve to cover up the secret that the
CIA had enlisted Mafia mobsters to kill
Castro.
There also was a legitimate concern
that the Castro revelations might in-
flame the American people, whose
grief could have turned into a terrible
wrath that might have precipitated
some rash action.
Only a few key people knew about
the CIA plot to assassinate Castro. One
was Attorney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy, who was his brother's personal
watchdog over the CIA. It has now
been established that Robert Kennedy
was briefed on May 7, 1962, about the
attempt to use underworld killers to
knock off Castro.
Two days later, Robert Kennedy cau-
tioned the CIA not to go ahead with
the assassination without consulting
him. Since Robert Kennedy rode herd
on the CIA, it must be assumed that he
was kept advised of subsequent assassi-
nation attempts. However, there is no
documentary evidence of this.
Records now available show that
Robert Kennedy informed FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover of the plot on May 10,
.
DROPOUTS
1962. Yet neither Kennedy nor Hoover
later divulged this important informa
tion to the Warren Commission.
Of course, various CIA officials also
knew about the assassination scheme.
Not the least of them was the late CIA
chief Allen W. Dulles, who approved
the original plan. He later served on
the Warren Commmission, yet he sat
silently throughout the investigation
without mentioning the Cuban angle.
Within hours of President Kenne-
dy's death, the U.S. embassy cabled in-
formation from Mexico City suggest-
ing that the Cubans may have been be
hind the assassination. Our sources say
that the CIA developed similar infor-
mation in Washington.
The first person to reach Robert
Kennedy's side after the shooting was
CIA Director John A. McCone, who re-
mained alone with the Attorney Gen-
eral at his McLean, Va., home for
nearly three hours.
McCone swore to us that Castro's
name was never mentioned during the
three hours. But CIA records show
that the next day. McCone not only
mentioned Castro to the new Presi-
dent, Lyndon B. Johnson, but briefed
him on the information from Mexico
City.
Yet no one brought the Cuban.
connection to the attention of the War-
ren Commission. We were the first to
get word of the anti-Castro plot to.
Chief Justice Earl Warren, the com-
mission chairman, four years later.
We are now free to reveal our role
in the drama. Two of our confidential
sources, CIA agent William Harvey
and mobster John Rosselli, are dead. A
third source, attorney Edward P. Mor-
gan, has waived the confidentiality we
had promised him.
Morgan told us in January, 1967,
about the CIA-Mafia assassination plot
against Castro. He raised the possibil-
ity that the plot could have backfired,
against President Kennedy. There
were suspicious circumstances, he
pointed out, indicating that Castro
may have learned of the attempts on
his life and may have retaliated
against Kennedy.
Morgan refused to identify his
sources because it would have violated
the attorney-client privilege. But he
was an attorney of such stature that
we didn't doubt his word. He had been
chief inspector of the FBI. He had di-
rected the historic congressional inves-
tigation of the Pearl Harbor bombing.
Later, he ran the investigation into the
excesses of the late Sen. Joseph McCar-
thy.
We got Morgan's permission, to
write a cautious story. We confirmed
the general outlines from a CIA
source. Then on March 3, 1967, we
wrote that Robert Kennedy "may have
approved an assassination plot, which
then possibly backfired against his late
brother."
The next day, according to records
now available, Kennedy's secretary
called for a copy of the May 7, 1962,
memo, which summarized the briefing
he had received on the assassination
plot.
On March 7, 1967, we reported more
details. "A reported CIA plan in 1963 to
assassinate Cuba's Fidel Castro," we
wrote,
may have resulted in a
counterplot by Castro to assassinate
President Kennedy."

Jack Anderson WPost 7/27.
Did the Castro Plot Backfire?
The late Robert Kennedy was tor-
mented by the terrible thought, ac:
cording to intimates, that he may have
helped trigger the assassination of his
brother:
We raised this possibility in January
1971, when we first revealed that the
CIA had plotted to assassinate Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro. It has taken us
4½ years to get the rest of the story.
Loyal associates of Robert Kennedy,
rushing to defend his memory, have
sworn that he knew nothing about the
assassination attempts and, contradic-
torily, that he put a stop to them. Both
accounts are incorrect, according to
sources with an intimate knowledge of
the events.
Not only was he fully aware of the
CIA's attempts to kill Castro, but after
President Kennedy was gunned down
in Dallas, Robert was devastated by
the possibility that the CIA plot may
have backfired against his brother.
3
The preparations to knock off Castro
began during the last months of the
Eisenhower administration as part of
the Bay of Pigs planning. President
Kennedy, who inherited the fiasco,
swore to friends afterward that he
would like "to splinter the CIA in a
thousand pieces and scatter it to the
winds."...
Instead, he appointed his brother,
Robert, to oversee the CIA, with in-
structions to shake it up. Characteristi-
cally, Robert began investigating the
undercover operations from top to bot-
tom. His purpose was to prevent an-
other Bay of Pigs.
our
He became fascinated, say
sources, with the CIA's covert activi-
ties. Eagerly, he pursued the details
down through the lower-levels. As one
source put it, "He was like a wide-eyed
schoolboy."
In the process, he learned about the
continuing effort to eliminate Castro,
an operation known inside the CIA as
the "executive action plan." In fact,
Robert took a special interest in the
“Not only was he fully aware of the CIA's
attempts to kill Castro, but after President
Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas, Robert
Kennedy was devastated by the possibility that
the CIA plot may have backfired against his
brother.”
activities against Castro. One insider,
former Deputy Defense Secretary Ros-
well Gilpatric, told us the focus "on
the Cuban situation" was intensified in
1961 at Robert Kennedy's "insistence."
The President eventually put Robert
in charge of a counter-insurgency com-
mittee, called the Special Group,
which concentrated upon harassing
Castro. One member, former CIA chief
John McCone, acknowledged that the
group had "directed mischievous
things against Castro like infiltrating
saboteurs, blowing up bridges and car-
rying on general confusion." .
McCone insisted, however, that "the
group at no time gave any considera.
tion to any assassination plot." We
have established that the "executive
action plan" was directed by William
Harvey, the CIA operative whom we
linked to the assassination plot in our
original 1971 story. We have also
learned that he reported to the late
Desmond Fitzgerald in CIA headquar
ters. We have been unable, however, to
identify the next link in the chain of
command.
Nevertheless, wholly reliable sources
insist that Robert Kennedy knew
about the plot against Castro and did
nothing to stop it. The intended tar-
get, Fidel Castro, also knew about it.
One assassination, squad reportedly..
was apprehended on a Havana roof top.

within range of Castro's movements,
about March 1, 1963.
The Cuban premior, in an interview
with Associated Press correspondent
Daniel Harker the following Septem-
ber, warned that U.S. leaders would
find themselves in danger if they at-
tempted to do away with Cuban lead-
ers.
"United States leaders should think
that if they are aiding terrorist plans
to eliminate Cuban leaders, they them
selves will not be safe," Castro told.
Harker.
Two months later, President Ken-
nedy was shot down in the streets of
Dallas. The accused assassin, Lee Har-:
vey Oswald, had been active in the
pro-Castro movement and had traveled
to Mexico to visit the Cuban embassy.
a few weeks earlier.
The first person to reach Robert
Kennedy's side after the shooting was
CIA director John McCone, who re-
mained alone with Robert at his Mc-
Lean, Va., home for nearly three
hours. All others, including Robert's
priest, were turned away. But McCone
swore to us that Castro's name was
never mentioned during the agonizing
three hours.
Other sources. say that Robert,
clusion for the next few days. Al-
deeply despondent, went into semi-se.
though he bottled up his feelings, they
..
knew him and understood the circum-
stances well enough to realize he
blamed himself for his brother's death.
There was little doubt, they say, that
he believed the CIA's attempts against
Castro put into motion the forces that
brought about his brother's martyr-
dom.
On January 18, 1971, we reported:
"Among those privy to the CIA con-
spiracy, there is still a nagging suspi-
cion-unsupported by the Warren Com.
mission's findings-that Castro became
aware of the U.S. plot upon his life
and somehow recruited Oswald to re-
taliate against President Kennedy."
It has now been disclosed that the
Warren Commission was told nothing
about the CIA's plot to kill Castro
even though the late Allen Dulles, the
CIA chief who initiated the plot, sat on
the commission.
According to the final report, the
commission investigated "literally doz.
ens of allegations of a conspiratorial
contact between Oswald and the Cuban
government" but found no substance
to any of them.
The Cuban premier himself, in an in-
terview with Frank Mankiewicz and
Kirby Jones, emphatically denied hav-
ing anything to do with the Kennedy-
assassination.

"It is . . . very interesting that this
man Oswald, who was involved in the
assassination, traveled to Mexico a fewd
months prior to the assassination and
applied for a permit at the Cuban cm-
bassy to travel to Cuba, and he was
not given the permit," said Castro.
"But I ask myself why would a man
who commits such an act try to come
here. Sometimes we ask ourselves if
someone did not wish to involve Cuba
in this, because I am under the impres-
sion that Kennedy's assassination was
organized by reactionaries in the
United States and that it was all a re-
sult of a conspiracy. . . We have never
believed in carrying out this type'
of activity of assassination
adversaries."

Smudge Only Clue in Rosselli Case
It was a grisly end for John Rosselli,
the dapper, debonair mobster about
town, who had been a familiar figure
in the glittering night spots of Holly.
wood, Las Vegas and Havana.
His killers shot or stabbed him in the
stomach. The autopsy indicates they
may have shot him and then dug out
the bullet with a knife. Then they bru-
tally hacked off his legs. It is possible
that he was still alive when they
stuffed his body into a 55-gallon drum.
They wrapped chains around the
drum to weight it down and tossed it
into Biscayne Bay. The autopsy sug-
gests he may have died of asphyxiation
inside the drum before it hit the wa-
ter. The gases from the decomposing
body floated the heavy container to
the surface. It was discovered, with its
nightmarish contents, 10 days after
Rosselli had disappeared from his sit
er's home in Plantation, Fla.
The police withheld the gruesome
details of his death while they
searched for his killers. We began our
own investigation, meanwhile, after an
appeal from his associates.
We first encountered Johnny Ros-
selli more than five years ago. We
were investigating his role in the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency's plot to assas-
sinate Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
The CIA case officer, William Harv.
ey, told us that Rosselli had been the
hero of the abortive adventure.
Harvey broke his oath of secrecy be
cause he thought it might help Rossel-
li, who was in trouble with the law.
The CIA agent had nothing but praise
for Rosselli's daring.
In the strictest of confidence, Ros-
selli himself confirmed that he had di-
rected six assassination attempts

were the only reporters he would talk
to.
So when he vanished last month his
associates came to us for help. We
were suspicious, of course, that his dis-
appearance was linked to the Castro
caper. But our investigation has now
produced evidence to the contrary.
We have learned, for example, that
Rosselli was not the amiable, retired
old duffer he pretended to be. He be-
gan in the big time as a bookkeeper for
Chicago's notorious Al Capone and be
came a specialist in white-collar
crimes. It's a profession, apparently,
that he never gave up.
31 Competent sources say that, be
tween rounds on the Florida golf
courses, Rosselli was involved in stolen
securities and financial swindles. His
operations reportedly were resented
by Santo Trafficante, who has been
identified in Senate testimony as the
Mafla chief in Florida.
Rosselli came to Florida from Las
Vegas, where he allegedly represented
the Chicago mob. Our sources say that
he handled millions in illegal gambling
money, which he forwarded to the
Chicago underworld. There are re-
ports that Chicago crime lord Tony Ac-
cardo felt he had been short-changed
by Rosselli.
Still earlier, Rosselli spent time in
the slammer, first, for extortion and,
later, for a card swindle. Those who
know him say he had developed a taste
for the good life. He dressed in the lat-
est styles, dined at the best restaurants
and dated beautiful women. The
thought of going back to prison,
'friends say, horrified him.
To avoid prison, he began to talk to
the government as early as 1970. He
gave information, according to our
sources, which resulted in a grand jury
confrontation for Tony Accardo. The
surly mobster took the fifth. But Ac-
cardo grumbled to associates that he.
would pay back Rosselli some day.
Rosselli was also blamed for passing:
information to the government, which
led to the conviction of Detroit mob :
ster Anthony Zerilli. He is now serving
a four-year sentence at Sandstone fed-
eral penitentiary for racketeering.
Perhaps the last straw was Rosselli's
testimony in the Castro case. He identi-
fied two mobsters, the late Sam Gian-
cana and Santo Trafficante, as being
involved in the assassination attempts.
It's no secret in the underworld that i
Trafficante detests publicity.
Our sources believe that the Mafia !
bosses finally became fed up with Ros-
selli. His execution would have re-
quired the approval of the top leaders,
our sources say, because it was almost.
certain to bring the federal govern-
ment into the case.
Who were the vicious killers? The
only clue is a smudge spot on the win-
dow of Rosselli's car. One of his assail-
ants probably had used a greasy hair
pomade.

Jack Anderson and Les Whitten
Behind John F. Kennedy's Murder
Mafia mobster John Roselli may
have taken the secret of the John F.
Kennedy assassination with him to his
death. He was brutally murdered a
few weeks ago, his backed-up body
stuffed into an oil drum and dumped
into Miami's Biscayne Bay.
Before he died, Roselli hinted to as-
sociates that he knew who had ar-
ranged President Kennedy's murder.
It was the same conspirators, he sug-
gested, whom he had recruited earlier
to kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
By Roselli's cryptic account, Castro
learned the identity of the underworld
contacts in Havana who had been
trying to knock him off. He believed,
not altogether without basis, that Pres-
ident Kennedy was behind the plot.
The Cuban leader, as the supreme
irony, decided to turn the tables and
use the same crowd to arrange Ken-
nedy's assassination, according to
Roselli's scenario. To save their skins,
the plotters lined up Lee Harvey Os-
wald to pull the trigger.
Roselli could never be pinned down
on names or details. It was also diffi-
cult to assess whether he knew what
he was talking about or whether he
merely described what he thought
might have happened. Certainly there
is no real evidence to support Roselli's
story. But there are enough curious
circumstances to justify telling it. Here
are the fascinating highlights.
The ruggedly handsome Roselli, a
flamboyant mobster with underworld
contacts in Havana, was recruited by
the Central Intelligence Agency in
1960 to assassinate Castro. He had no
authority, however, over the under-
world elements in Havana.

fact, Trafficante had been lodged for a
period in a Cuban jail, an indignity
that didn't endear Castro to him.
After Trafficante made it back to his
Florida haunts, he left part of his or-
ganization behind in Havana. Some of
ganization behind in Havana. Some of
his henchmen even managed to de-
velop contacts in Castro's inner circle.
These were the people Roselli wanted
to use to knock off Castro.
But Roselli didn't have the stature
inside the Mafia to make the necessary
arrangements with Trafficante. So
Roselli called in his patron, the Chi-
cago godfather Sam (Momo) Giancana,
to deal with Trafficante.
As Roselli's associates tell it, he per-
suaded Giancana that it would be to
their advantage to win the good will of
the CIA. Convinced. Giancana flew
down to Florida to make the prelimi-
nary arrangements.
Once Giancana and Trafficante set it
up, Roselli used the Havana under-
world to plot Castro's demise. At first,
they tried to plant poison pills, sup-
plied by the CIA, in Castro's food. The
pills would have made it appear that
he died of natural causes. When this
failed, snipers were dispatched to a
Havana rooftop. They were caught.
The word reached Roselli that some
of the plotters had been tortured and
that Castro had learned about the
whole operation.
The CIA called off the Roselli opera-
tion in March, 1963, but recruited a
Castro associate, Rolando Cubela, to
murder Castro.

Jim Braden: Possible Link To David Ferric
Investigator Peter Noyes has turned up several pieces
of information which indicate a possible connection between
Jim Braden and the mysterious David Ferrie.
David Ferric was the homosexual airline pilot and private
investigator whom Jim Garrison accused of participating
in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Six days after
District Attorney Garrison's charges were made public, David
Ferric was found dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His
mysterious death was finally ruled to have been a suicide.
David Formic has been a target of investigation by critics
of the Warren Commission ever since the assassination. In
fact the BI and Secret Service both investigated a possible
Ferrie role immediately after the assassination. It was
widely rumored in New Orleans and Dallas that Forrie was to
have flown the alleged assassins out of the country following
the assassination. The Warren Commission decided not to include
the official Secret Service and FBI reports on Ferric in the
26 Volumes of Hearings, which were released after the Warren
Report was issued. However, the Justice Department did finally
release those reports to the National Archives in 1967 following
Garrison's public accusations.
+
Author Noyes has since established that both Jim Braden and
Davod Ferrie worked out of the floor of offices in a building
in New Orleans in the month or two immediately preceding the
one of
This is particularly significant due to the fact that at that
time the mysterious David Ferrie was employed as a private
investigator by Carlos Marcello, the top llafia kingpin. It
is widely believed by most federal authorities that Carlos
Marcello ranks with his close friend Meyer Lansky as
the two single most powerful leaders of the Mafia's national
and international crime syndicate. Carlos Marcello heads the
Mafia empire centered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls
most of the Mafia activity in the southern part of the United
States.
In September and October of 1963, just weeks before the
assassination, David Ferrie was working out of the offices
of Carlos Marcello's criminal attorney, G. Wray Gill. Ferrie,
who was doing investigative work on
work on a perjury charge that his
boss Marcello was then facing, worked out of Room 1707 in the
Pere Marquette Building in New Orleans.
At this same time, in September and October of 1963, Jim
Braden was operating out of Room 1701 in the Pere Marquette
Building
have President Kennedy and his brother murdered. Reid has
written that he was told of Marcello's threat by an informant
who attended a secret meeting with Marcello in New Orlean's in
September of 1962.

Actually, we reported
as far back as Jan. 18,
1971, that the CIA had ar-
ranged six assassination
attempts against Castro
in the early 1960s. Now
that the story has been
revived, it might be use
ful to recount the details.
The plot began as part

on the island.
To carry out the assassination, the CIA
selected an underworld figure who could be
disowned. He was hawk-faced John Roselli,
identified in confidential FBI files as "a top
Mafia figure" who watched over "the con-
cealed interests in Las Vegas casinos of the
Chicago underworld."
Roselli represented himself as an oil man
seeking revenge against Castro for his sei-
Kure of oil holdings.
For the first try, the CIA furnished Ro-
selli with special poison capsules to slip
' into Castro's food. The poison was supposed
to take three days to act. By the time Cas-
tro died, his system would throw off all
traces of the poison, so he would appear to
I be the victim of a natural if mysterious ail-
ment.
Roselli arranged with a Cuban, related to
one of Castro's chefs, to plant the deadly
pellets in the dictator's food. On March 13,
1961, Roselli delivered the capsules to his
contact at Miami Beach's glamorous Fon-
tainebleau Hotel..
A couple weeks later, just about the right
time for the plot to have been carried out, a
report out of Havana said Castro was ill.
But he recovered in time to rout the Bay of
Pigs invasion on April 17, 1961..
Although both the murder plot and the in-
vasion failed, the CIA continued trying to
get rid of Castro. The Cuban who had
sneaked the poison into Havana was never
seen again.
Roselli arranged for triple-strength cap-.
sules to be slipped into Castro's food several
weeks after the Bay of Pigs. But once again,
the plot failed and the conspirators disap-
peared.
Four more attempts were made on Cas-...
tro's life thereafter, using assassination
teams equipped with high-powered rifles,
explosives and two-way radios. Roselli per-
sonally made midnight powerboat dashes to
deliver the teams at secret landing spots on
the Cuban coast.
The assassination teams never got a shot
at Castro, although the CIA learned that the
last group reached a rooftop within range.
This occurred around the last of February
or first of March, 1963. :
Nine months later, President Kennedy'
was gunned down in Dallas by Lee Harvey
Oswald, a fanatic who had been active in the
pro-Castro movement and had paid a myste-
rious call upon the Cuban embassy in Mex-
ico City a few weeks before the dreadful day
in Dallas.
Sources familiar with the CIA conspiracy
can't shake a nagging suspicion-unsup-
ported by the Warren Commission's findings
-that Castro may have become aware of
the U.S. plot upon his life and, therefore,
may have recruited Oswald to retaliate
against President Kennedy.

has the cozy resonance of "home-style

These family affairs are, of course,
meddled into by the constabulary, but
rarely with much enthusiasm.
This may be because police success
at nabbing perpetrators of "gangland-
style killings" has never been such as
to get them into the world series of
detection, with the result that inces-
sant failure may have dulled their
appetite for the hunt.
Or, it may be because policemen
believe the subjects of "gangland-style

time for. I don't know, and I certainly
don't mean to impute either languor,
timidity or indifference to America's
homicide squads. I simply point out
that once a murder has been called
"gangland-style," apprehension of the
perpetrator almost invariably fails to
occur.
This raises the question whether
"gangland-style" murders might pos-
sibly be catching among people who
don't come from gangland. Consider
the Roselli case. The body is found in
the customary barrel, with the cus-
tomary weights, in the customary
water. It bears the customary bullet
holes. Roselli's publicized standing in
gangland seems to leave an open-and-
shut case, which the police will quietly
shut as soon as possible...

it rrot follow that it is also known by,
let us say, some hot-tempered waiter
whom Roselli has been consistently

If that waiter wanted to take his
revenge and get away with it, is it
not logical that he would do it "gang-
land-style," so the police could forget
it, rather than by scalding Roselli to
death in public with a tureen of lobster
bisque?

According to Reid's informant, Marcello told his top
lieutenants "Don't worry about that little Bobby

Terrorist Activities
Charged to Cubans
By Police in Miami
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UPI)
-Militant pro-Castro and anti-|1
Castro groups in the Miami
area are engaged in terrorist
activities both in and outside t
the United States, according to e
testimony given before a Šen-
ate subcommittee and released R
today.
W
The testimony came last May re
before a Judiciary subcommit-w
tee on internal security headed gi
by Senator James O. Eastland, ar
Democrat of Mississippi. It said ri
that as many as 50 Cuban
groups of various shadings had th
been operating in Miami at any a

track down terrorist elements p
in the greater Miami area.
Lieutenant Lyons said mostle
Cubans in the area were hard-c
working and industrious; but v
some individuals "use Dade e
County as a base for interna-
tional terrorism against allied
governments of Cuba, Cubank
shipping, Communists, purporty
ed Communists and individuals
who take a stand against their
terroristic-type tactics."
During the last two years,
Lieutenant Lyons said, there
have been four homicides "with
strong indicators on each that
the motivations were political
in nature and terroristic, by de-
sign.".
Mr. Diaz said that some. Cas-
tro groups had infiltrated exile
organizations and that there
were plans to assassinate Latin-
American diplomats and for-
eign ministers.
Lieutenant Lyons said his
unit received Information from
a confidential source early this
year that there would be a
attempt on the life of Secretary th
of State Henry A. Kissinger'
during his February visit to
Costa Rica.
The Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation and the Secret Service
were notified, he said. A well-
known fugitive exile, Orlando
Bosch, was jailed after illegally
entering Costa Rica. There no
incidents during the Kissinger
visit..
He did not mention the Cen-

forts to use Cuban exiles in
Florida and American gangsters

tro.

Two weeks ago, the body of
underworld figure, John
Roselli was found stuffed in a
chain-weighted, 55-gallon drum
floating in a bay near Miami.
Mr. Roselli had testified last
year before the Senate Select
Committee on Intellegence Ac-
tivities that he and a Chicago
gangster, Sam Giancana, were
hired by the C.I.A. to recruit
Cubans to kill Mr. Castro. Mr.
Giancana was shot and killed
by unknown persons last year)
just before he was testify be-
fore the Washington panel.

Plot to kill
Kissinger
blocked

WASHINGTON
retary of State Henry Kissinger in Costa Rica six months
ago was blocked by US and Costa Rican authorities four
days before it was supposed to be carried out.
A reported plot to assassinate Sec-
We have pieced together the story from secret testimo-
ny before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and
from interviews with Cuban exiles and US intelligence
sources.
A Cuban terrorist named Orlando Bosch Avila was re-
ported to be gunning for Kissinger. The attempt on the
Secretary's life was expected, according to underground
reports, during his visit to Costa Rica last February.
Shortly before Kissinger's arrival, Bosch slipped into
Costa Rica on a false passport. But the FBI and Secret Ser-
vice had been alerted. They traced Bosch's movements and
notified the Costa Rican authorities. The suspected assas-
sin was arrested and clapped into a tiny jail cell four days
before Kissinger got to town.
The plot to kill Kissinger apparently grew out of his
overtures to improve relations with Cuba's Fidel Castro
back in 1972. This reportedly upset an anti-Castro terrorist
band, known as Cuban Action, which Bosch headed.
We reported part of the story two years later after a
lengthy investigation in Miami. In columns on Sept. 1 and
Nov. 12, 1974, we warned that anti-Castro terrorists
planned an "assassination
men and businessmen who supported a... thaw." We noted
against American congress-
that Kissinger had been in touch with Castro.
The first hint that Kissinger, himself, was one of the
targets came later from Carlos Rivero Collado, son of the
man elected to the presidency of Cuba in 1958. Rivero was
active in the anti-Castro underground in Miami's little
Havana. But he later re-defected to Cuba where he gave a
fascinating interview.
"I have known privately since 1972," he said, "(about)
the plan to assassinate the US Secretary of State." He said
the plot had taken "certain form" by 1973 and had been
"actualized" by 1974.
Then, in a reference to our 1974 columns, he added:
"This fact which, I repeat, I've known privately, has been
corroborated by the US journalist Jack Anderson."
B
,
Rivero named Bosch as one of the 18 anti-Castro l
ers who had conspired to kill US and other leaders pron
ing a Cuban-American detente. Bosch already had b

parole and fled to Venezuela ir 1974.
Months later, he was reported to be in Curacao, pr
tected by Chilean gunmen. He bragged, according to th
reports, of his "money, friends and protection."
Florida's Dade County Public Safety Department, be
cause of the huge Cuban population in Miami, has excellen
ties throughout Latin America. In early 1976, the county's
terrorist expert, Lt. Thomas Lynch, picked up some electri-
fying news.
He told the Senate Subcommittee about it in secret tes-
timony. "We received information from confidential sourc-
es," he swore, "that there was going to be an attempt on the
life of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger... We passed the
information on to the FBI, and they had also received the
information, and we notified the Secret Service, as they.
have the protective duty for the Secretary of State."
The plot was linked to Kissinger's two-day stay in Cos-
ta Rica, and Bosch was picked up and questioned. He was
held on a false passport charge until Kissinger was safely
out of the country.
Bosch later insisted: "My only crime was entering the
country with a false passport." Certainly, it was never.

Danespally Santos Trailkante of
Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution-in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CLA and FBI until recently.

The tangled chronology of suppres
gion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
erived little public attention. Rossel-
li's murder, adds significance to those
Events..
"'
Here is the sequence, pieced to-
gether 'from the testimony given to
Senate intelligence investigators:
* Columnist Drew Pearson went to
the late Chief Justice of the United
States Earl Warren late in January,
1967, and told him that a Washington
lawyer had confided to him that one
of his clients said the United States
"had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro
had decided to retaliate."
Warren declined Pearson's sugges-
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-
tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,

President had in tructed that the FBI
interview (Mo) concerning any
knowledge he ht have regarding
the assassination of President Ken-

DeLoach told Vatson that it ap.

terviewed, and en if he was inter-
viewed he would probably not divulge
the identity of his sources . . .
" Wat
son persisted, however.
"Under the circumstances," De-
Loach concluded in a memo for the
files. "it appears that we have no al
ternative but to interview (Morgan)
and then furnish the results to Wat-
son in blind memorandum form."
The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI's General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate
committee concluded was “puzzling"
because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had been as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foreign involvement in the
assassination.
Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA's assassina-

over, informing him of the allegations.
Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an "eyes-
only" basis. There is no record of FBI
meetings or discussions of those alle-
gations. At that point the sensitive let-
ter bounced back and forth in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
racy.
The job of responding to Rowley's
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI's General Investigative Di-
vision who was given responsillity for
the overall assassination investigation
in March 1964.
This official's job was complicated
by the fact that he had never been in-
'formed of what Hoover and his closest
circle of confidants in the FBI learned
early in 1962-that the CIA was
in assassination

deeply
attempts against Castro, and promi-
nent American underworld figures, in-
cluding Rosselli and Giancana, had
been recruited for the attempts.
So on Feb. 15, 1967. the FBI official
prepared a draft reply to the Rowley
letter for his superiors saying "our in-
vestigation uncovered, no evidence in.
dicating Fidel Castro officials of the
Cuban Government were involved
with Lee Harvey Oswald in the assas
sination of President Kennedy. This
bureau is not conducting any investi-
gation regarding this matter." The
FBI official added in later testimony
that "everyone in the higher echelons
read this..."
Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished a column on March 7, 1967, ref-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro's life in 1963 "may
have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy."
testified eight years later that they.
were "surprised" when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to U.S. at.
tempts to assassinate Castro.
"These agents stated that they
the lawyer's
could not evaluate
| (Morgan's) allegations or question him,
in detail on them, since they had not
been briefed on the CIA assassination
efforts," the Senate committee ob-
served.
On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-
ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan.
In a Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-
gan was reported to have acknowl-·
edged that his clients were "on the,
fringe of the underworld" and that
they faced "possible prosecution in a
crime not related to the assassination

Morgan said his clients "were called
upon by a governmental agency to as-
sist in a project which was said to
have the highest governmental ap.
proval. The project had as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made, including
the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-
ment and the placing of informants
within key posts in Cuba.'
"
Morgan also told the FBI. according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed "teams of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States
for the purpose of assassinating Presi-
dent Kennedy."

It was not clear then-nor is it to-
day why Morgan came forward at
1 that time to bring Rosselli's story to
the ears of the nation's highest law
enforcement authorities.
.
It may be relevant that Rosselli had
serious legal problems at the time.
In May, 1966, the FBI threatened to
deport him for living in the United

Last April Rosselli told the Senate
Intelligence Committee he had no rec-
ollection of either receiving informa-
tion that Castro retaliated against
President Kennedy or of having dis-
cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei- .
ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic

established Washington lawyer.
Na ommittee source could explain
fle discrepancy, and Morgan declined
confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
allegations against the Cuban govern-
mon his recent testimony.
The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with Morgan was sent to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: "No further investigation is
being conducted by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau."
The Senate intelligence committee,
in commenting on this position, said
that "had the interviewing agents
known of the CIA-underworld plots
against Castro, they would have been
aware that the lawyer had clients who
had been active in the assassination
plots."
On March 21, FBI headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House, the attor-
ney general and the Secret Service. It
did not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan's allegations.
On the evening of the following
day. President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to the White
House. The next morning, March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen-
eral to prepare a report on the CIA
involvement in the assassination plots
-Operation Mongoose-of which
Helms had full knowledge at the time
they were executed.
By May 22, Helms briefed President
Johnson on the results. There is, how.
ever. no evidence that Helms briefed
the President on the November, 1963,
plot-one of eight major schemes on
Castro's life from 1960 to 1965-to as-
sassinate the Cuban leader through
the employment of an agent with the
cryptonymn AMLASH. His identity
was revealed as Rolando Cubela, a
* 1961 CIA "recruit" with close access
to Castro.
'
CIA operatives turned over assassi-
nation equipment to Cubela during a
Paris meeting on November 22, 1963-
the day President Kennedy was killed
in Dallas. There has been subsequent
speculation that the mercurial and
talkative Cubela was either a double
agent or being monitored by Cuban
intelligence.
1
During the later days of his presi-
dency, Mr. Johnson spoke cryptically
of a "Caribbean Murder Incorpo
rated" targeted against Fidel Castro.
The inspiration for that statement un-
doubtedly was the CIA inspector gen-
eral's report he ordered Helms to have
prepared.
Within the past year, Rosselli and
two of his co-conspirators in the Cas-
tro assassination schemes have died,
Giancana at the hands of a profes-
sional hit man and Harvey as the re-
sult of a "massive heart attack" last
June.

suspected no foul play in her hus
band's death. She did, however, tel

ance in late July warning her that Cu
bans appeared to be attempting to
wipe out all those who participated in
the anti-Castro plots.
The call, she said, came from an old
friend who was acquainted with Ros-
selli's sister, whose name is Edith Dai-
gle. Mrs. Harvey said that Mrs. Daigle
told the mutual acquaintance that the
Rosselli family had received a tele.
phone threat from unidentified Cu-
bans prior to Rosselli's disappearance.
She also said that Rosselli had gone to
meet the Cubans in an effort to pro-
tect his family.
Mrs. Daigle could not be reached by
The Washington Post. But another sis-
ter of Rosselli said she had heard of
no such threats or warnings.
Harvey, who died at age 60 and
whose exploits as a clandestine opera-
tor are both legendary and controver-
´sial within the agency, testified to the
Senate Intelligence Committee. He
had become Rosselli's case officer in
Operation Mongoose and supplied the
mobster with poison pills, explosives,
detonators, rifles, handguns, radios
and boat, radar for transmission to
anti-Castro Cuban agents. Harvey and

Rosselli, a CIA superior testified to

Another CIA official who worked
with Rosselli, James P. O'Connell, was
asked if he knew whether the agency

ster on possible Cuban involvement in
the Kennedy assassination. He replied
that he was out of the country at the
time Kennedy was killed, and had no
further comment.
Two months before the Kennedy, as-

was identified by the Warren Commis-
sion as Kennedy's murderer, had trav-
eled to Mexico City in an attempt to
gain entry to Cuba. According to the
Warren Commission, Oswald repre-
sented himself as the head of the New
. Orleans branch of the Fair Play for
Cuba organization and a friend of the
Cuban Revolution.
Some three months before Kennedy
was killed, Castro told Associated
Press reporter Daniel Harker that

A U.S. government committee coor-
dinating policy, toward Cuba at the
time agreed, there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate in some.
fashion. However, it concluded Castro
would not risk a major confrontation
with the U.S. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.
On the same day Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CIA officer met with a
high-ranking Cuban official, who had
said he would kill Castro, to tell him
the U.S. would provide him with ex-
plosives and a poison pen device.
While the Senate Intelligence Conf-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient to justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassination was part of a
conspiracy, it also said U.S. agencies
did not properly investigate the assas-
sination or tell the Warren Commis-
sion about the CIA plots on Castro's
life.
"There is no indication that the FBI
or the CIA directed the interviewing
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community," the Sen-
ate committee said.
According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder, the
FBI never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia.

Slain Mobster Claimed
Cuban Link to JFK Death
By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern identification of the interviewee. in
Washington Post Staff Writers
Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retall-
ation, were involved in the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private
conversations with a longtime associ- .
ate of Rosselli who participated in
meetings between Rosselli and the
CIA.
An FBI "blind memorandum" on
an interview with Morgan dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without

ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post, however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
were the sources of the testimony that
suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-
*nedy murder.
Morgan's account, according to a
* summary of the FBI interview, was
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-
ision about a Cuban connection to the
Kennedy
"feedback" furnished by sources close
from
Eto Castro who were involved in the CIA
* plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

"His (Morgan's) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
tuals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey," the FBI in-
terview summary stated.
A long-time associate of Rosselli
who was interviewed separately by
The Washington Post, said there was
no question in the slain mobster's
mind that Président Kennedy was
killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal:
for the CIA schemes against the Cu..
ban leader.
"He was positive; he was sure," said
the associate, who knew Rosselli well."
and was in contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
home on July 28. The associate, who
does not want to be identified pub.
licly, is scheduled to be interviewed
this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-.
'cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-
selli's contacts in the early 1960s with
CIA case officers overseeing the at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination-including
the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA-has been that there was no
evidence that implicated the Castro

last June's Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.
Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and "thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-
patched to the United States for the
purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken-
nedy."
Because neither Morgan nor Ros-
selli was identified in the Senate re-
port, the significance of that portion
of the 106-page document was dis.

in June, before Rosselli's disappear-

* However, the CIA's involvement in
the schemes to assassinate Castro
was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
circle of the U.S. intelligence commu
nity. President Johnson apparently.
first learned about the schemes only
after a March 7, 1967, column by the
late Drew Person, which prompted
Johnson to order a CIA investigation
of the highly sensitive episode..
"
Full details of the CIA-underworld
collusion in the plots to kill Castro
did not surface publicly until the pub-
lication last year of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee's assassination re-
port and the ensuing report last June
on the possible role of the intelligence
agencies in the Kennedy assassination
and investigation.
The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters,
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum
Weighted with chains but buoyed by
gases from decomposition on the
ocean's surface off the coast of Miami..
The specific cause of death was deter
mined by an autopsy to be asphyxia-
tion.
* Last year, an underworld colleague
of Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited by the
CIA in the effort to kill Castro; was
found shot to death in his Chicago!
home in what police described as a
Highly professional job by assailants
who penetrated the mobster's per-
sonal security screen. Giancana was
que to testify before the Senate Intel-
Egence Committee shortly after his
demise.
.'
Neither murder has been solved.
The possibility that Rosselli's mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schemes
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

Connection Between Amlash Operation and Investigation
of JFK Assassination
The staff's memorandum of January 5, 1976, postulated that the
Amlash operation might have had some effect on CIA's response to
the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination. On January
9, 1976, the staff asked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and
after a delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to
review the file on January 23 and 26.
Summary of Amlash File
}
1
Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with
case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-
tion in secret writing and explosives. Interest in Amlash continued
after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA
agents until mid-1963. Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-
lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962
undoubtedly made CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.
*
In any event, DIR 48198 to Rome of 19 June 1963 states that
Amwhip, a Cuban exile who assisted CIA, had sent a letter as part of
an "activation effort to reluctant dragon. Presumably, Amlash was
"reluctant dragon" and was, by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.
In late August, Amlash traveled with a large contingent of Cuban
officials and athletes to Porto Alegre, Brazil. He cabled Amwhip
about his arrival on August 29. This cable apparently was the signal
that he was prepared to meet Amwhip in Porto Alegre.
Amwhip and two CIA case officers met with Amlash in Porto Alegre
between September 5 and 8. The two case officers have testified to
the Committee about their understanding of events at this series of
meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.
CIA messages tell a different story. Porto Alegre 0704 to DIR of 7
September stated that Amlash told Amwhip he felt there were only two
ways of getting rid of Castro. The first was an invasion by U.S.
forces which Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was
an "inside job." Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.
He referred to the explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier
as "too cumbersome" for his purposes.
DIRs are messages sent from Langley. NCI

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro
Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the
Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-
tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish
to review.
The three operations involved are:
(1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal
warehouse and pier;
(2) a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in
a harbor;
and
(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding
in coastal waters.
All of these operations would have been approved three months ago,
and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted
because of high seas. While it is always hard to predict the noise
level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the
small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December
which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation
approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it
seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed in your first review
of the Cuban problem).
The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small
sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally, if we
call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.
We thus
have an opportunity to choose.
I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.
I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle
of covert sabotage against Cuba. I know that Rusk has never liked it
and that McNamara thinks it does very little good. McCone and the CIA
are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the
Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

Jim Braden: Author Peter Noves And Judge Byrne
Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter who uncovered
most of the material regarding Jim Braden (Eugene Brading),
is a former classmate and close friend of Judge- Matthew
Byrne, Jr., the U.S. District Court Judge who presided
over the Ellsberg. Pentagon Papers trial last year.
As is how well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case
against Ellsberg after he was notified that the White
House "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
A short time later, it became known that President Nixon
had twice instructed John Ehrlichman to approach Judge
Byrne during the course of the Ellsberg trial and offer him
the position of Director of the FBI. This offer, which Judge
Byrne refused, has been regarded as
bribery by some critics of President Nixon, and is currently
under investigation by the Soccial Prosecutor's Office.
a potential act of
It has been widely assumed that Nixon's fervent interest
in the outcome of the prosecution of Ellsberg, may have
been the motivation behind his approach to Judge Byrne.
Author Noyes has written of his friend Judge Byrne's
involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 1969, after
Noyes had accumulated much of his information regarding
the mysterious Braden, he took the information to his
friend, Matt Byrne, who was then U.S. Attorney for southern
California. Noyes had several talks with Byrne, and has said
that Byrne was very impressed by the substantive evidence
which Noves had gathered. During one of these meetings with
Byrne and another FBI man whom Byrne had invited to attend,
the FBI man told Noyes that the FBI had never before known
that Jim Braden

the man arrested at the scene of the
FBI man said that the Bureau must have made a big mistake
in not tracing down Braden's true identity and police record.
The FBI man was nearly incredulous over Noyes' evidence on
Braden.
Noyes meanwhile had discovered that Jim Braden had also been
in Los Angeles on the night that Robert Kennedy was assassinated
in early June of 1968.
Though Noves couldn't find any significant information indicating
any Braden connection to the second Kennedy murder, he and his
friend Matt Byrne forwarded the information on Braden to the
Special Unit of the LAPD which was investigating the RFK death.

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters.
cabled on 9 September that, based on what little feel Headquarters
had, Amlash appeared hopeless as an intelligence performer and should
be approached as a chief conspirator allowed to recruit his own co-
horts. He should be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist
him, initially in "FI and Ops reporting" and then progress to sabotage
and more serious matters on an orderly basis. (DIR 67110 to Porto
Alegre, JMWAVE and Rio.)
On 11 September, Porto Alegre 0708 to DIR summarized the intel-
ligence information Amlash had given on Soviet units in Cuba, saying
all IRBM and bombers had been removed. By this time Amlash had left
Brazil apparently heading for a vacation in Europe.
A document in the file dated 16 September and marked OFPA 72775
appears to be a transcript of a conversation obtained by covert means.
There is no indication as to where the conversation takes place, but
it probably is in the Cuban Embassy in Paris.
"Mary:

I don't want to imagine things but
this thing of Amlash.
It is either a tremendous secret or a

I believe it is a top secret matter."
By letters of September 14 and September 16, Amlash stayed in
contact with Amwhip. Paris station apparently was picking up responsi-
bility for Amlash at this time, since Paris 0706 to DIR dated 19
September asks for some background material on Amlash.
On 19 September, JMWAVE 4580 to DIR warns that Amlash is part of
an anti-communist group in Cuba and details the membership of his group
as well as a communist group. The message also notes that Fidel is
allegedly aware of the two groups and acts as moderator between them
in order to maintain cohesion in the Government of Cuba.
Nevertheless, Amwhip is asked to continue to work with Amlash
and is assigned to accompany him around Europe. According to Paris
0934 to DIR dated 7 October, Amlash met with case officer 0* on 5
October. Case officer ○ sat and listened permitting Amlash to get
everything off his chest. Amlash seemed to be complaining about the
low level espionage matters that had been discussed at the September
meeting in Brazil, implying he had a more valuable role. Case officer
O "provided necessary assurances his feelings not in fact true and
that his case receiving consideration highest levels. (emphasis added)""

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized
the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash. Amlash was to
be told the U.S. was prepared to give full support to Amlash's coup.
He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November 18
and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters
had approved giving Amlash scopes and rifles and other equipment. The
memo ended by stating that "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash
operation be kept to a minimum."
'
Pari 1564 to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called
on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return to
Cuba in order to see case officer 0 "if it something interesting." The
CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but that it was
to be a meeting which Amlash had requested. (Obviously, CIA wanted to
give Amlash the "technical support" he felt he had not been promised in
the 29 October meeting.)
-
Case officer O flew from the U.S. so as to arrive in Paris on the morn-
ing of November 22 for this meeting.
Pari 1607 to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23 November
is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting
had taken place. It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to
Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that
day.
The file contains no outgoing cable to Paris on November 23 or
any other time telling Paris to break contact with Amlash.
**
On 25 November, a contact report was prepared. There is reason
to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages
and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash. The first two pages
have dark type as though prepared on a typewriter with a new ribbon.
The type on the third page is much lighter as though prepared on a
typewriter with an old ribbon. It made no mention of the passing
of a poison pen to Amlash.
On November 27, Pari 1669 to DIR reports information obtained
in October possibly by clandestinely listening devices. A source com-
plained bitterly about official (Cuban) visitors to Paris and how they
denigrate the revolution. The source said she wished she had a con-
cealed tape recorder to record these conversations. She named Amlash
as one of these visitors.

siderably, off his chest, a much more relaxed Amlash departed restating
his desire return Cuba to undertake 'the big job.

On October 15, London 5224 to DIR states case officer O met with
Amlash and Amwhip on 13 October. Although the case officer had been
forewarned by Amwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's
request for a high level meeting. "Amlash convinced that if such meet
does not take place at this time it will be almost impossible come out
again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite
decision. Also finds it difficult to believe why RFK who receives many
Cubans would refuse to see a major" such as Amlash. The message notes
the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest
target level which believe we cannot afford overlook.
This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's
role. DIR 75683 to London on 15 October directed case officer O to
return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.
The next meeting apparently took place on October 29.
One case
officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative
of RFK. He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that
the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-
communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership and which assumed significant control to invite the U.S.
to render assistance. He emphasized that U.S. support could come only
after a successful coup. Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,
the military would break up into 4 or 5 groups and the regime would
disintegrate. He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussion
but desired to know what technical support he could get.
Since Amwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was
asked about Amlash's reaction to the meeting. His reactions are
summarized in Attachment A to Amwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-
ber. Amwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.S.
government. While Amlash was satisfied on policy grounds, he was not
at all happy with the fact that he still was not given the technical
assistance for the operation plan as he saw it. Amlash could not under-
stand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised
a final solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.S. gave
much equipment and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions
against Cuban coastal targets. Amlash had accepted the fact he had to
work with the CIA, but CIA might lose him if it continued to procrastin-z
ate. Amlash talked about going to the French terrorist organization,
the OAS, but realized that was not feasible. The memorandum ends with
what apparently is the author's conclusion: "It is hoped that he does
realize that Havana must first be taken . or failing that, a
truly sizeable piece of land (say, almost an entire province) which
could be true rallying point.'

Agency could have no part in the assassination of a government leader
(including Castro) and it would not aid subject in his attempt. This
included the following. "We would not furnish the silencer, nor scope
nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift
a finger to help subject escape from Cuba should he assassinate Castro.'
The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash
in November 1964 by Mr. Sanchez.
Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash
through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.
Later documents on Amlash are also relevant to the September-
November 1963 Amlash operation. Several such documents report informa-
tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of
Amlash's plots against him. For example, Amlash's one time Cuban
mistress was believed to be working for Cuban intelligence and her
brother was known to be with Cuban intelligence. Pari 8242 to DIR
in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too
many Cubans. And, one CIA informant reported in 1966 on one known
double agent of Cuban intelligence working for CIA and said the CIA's
Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-
ligence. He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban
exiles who was knowledgeable of a number of the most important opera-
tions. Nevertheless, Amlash's file contains nothing to indicate any
detailed analysis of these possible penetrations of the CIA's Amlash
operation, although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-
port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.
One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers
gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given
a poison pen for self-protection. That document reports that Amlash,
and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for
self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.
Finally, although the staff has not reviewed all possible CIA
files to determine what other operations Castro might have been re=
ferring to in his September 7 statement, the Amlash file indicates
that some coastal landings of supplies in August were the only other
CIA operations conducted against Cuba in this time period.

The Special Unit of the LAPD, according to Noyes, dis-
counted the information regarding the RFK assassination,
but was indeed impressed by the Braden connection to the
1963 assassination. Noyes writes that Judge Byrne never
heard anymore about it after he forwarded the information
to the RFK investigators.
Later, Attorney General John Mitchell slected Byrne to
be Executive Director for the Scranton Commission that
investigated student unrest several years ago. Following
his work for the Scranton Commission, U.S. Attorney Byrne
was appointed U.S. District Court Judge by President Nixon,
the position he held at the time of the Ellsberg trial.

Scenario for B-9
This doctrine is based on the proposition that
the decision has been reached that the U.S. cannot live
with a Castro/communist regime in Cuba which continues
its present course of subversion and aggression in Latin
America and that we are determined to take appropriate
action to put an end to these acts.
1.
In the Venezuelan arms cache case now before
the OAS hold out for a "blank check" resolution. Settle
for a 13 vote majority regardless of Mexican, Brazilian,
or Chilean support.
2. If, despite 1. above, OAS waters down resolu-
tion, vote against the watered-down version.
3. If "blank check" resolution passed, proceed
to 5. below.
4. If watered-down resolution passed over our
protest, announce publicly that OAS no longer represents
an adequate hemispheric safeguard and therefore that the
United States must unilaterally declare (see 5. below).
5. Declare publicly that further aggression and
subversion by Castro in Latin America would be intolerable
to the United States and, in the event of a new act on the
part of Castro of the nature and magnitude of the Venezuelan

On 3 December, Headquarters furnished JMWAVE some details on the
Amlash meeting including the fact that he had been promised "full U.S.
support if he is successful in a real coup against the Castro regime.
He was also promised arms which will have to be furnished through
JMWAVE's operations.
A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE
on December 6, 7, and 8. Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE
authority to drop a cache of arms in Cuba. Then Headquarters called
off the operation. In DIR 87615 of 7 December, it is noted "major
top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which
should provide basis for decision."
JMWAVE complained about the change in orders in a cable of 8
December. JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message
indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher author-
ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-
layed and not run in December.
Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure
was to present infiltration operation plans to "higher authority"
even though there is a reasonable chance operation may be postponed
or delayed as was case with the scheduled operation. "This procedure
will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma-
tion needed when previously relaxed operation finally mounted." Head-
quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating
objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others. "Believe by
January, CIA should be in position better evaluate status of internal
assets."
By Pari 1914 of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left
Paris for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case
officer. DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio
on 2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on 1 December.
The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December
1963, is a long report on Amlash, but it does not contain information
relevant to the October-November activities. Nevertheless, in red pen
on the cover page appears: "Dec 1963 Not to leave this office on Nestor's
(Sanchez) orders." followed by initials that appear to be "GM."
.
One later document in the Amlash file contains more information
about the November 22, 1963 meeting. That document, a rough draft of
a biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)
appears to have been prepared in 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest
for a later plot against Castro. It states: "22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald
and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that this Agency would give him every-
thing he needed (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he wanted).
The situation changed when Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meet-
ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because
of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was decided that this

7.
Decide upon the type of action on the part
of Castro which would trigger action on the part of the
U.S. A rule of thumb could be: such action as would
represent serious, realized or potential, danger to the
stability of a Latin American state.
Latin American state. By this criterion
20 Castro-trained men and four tons of arms introduced
into northeast Brazil might not constitute a trigger,
whereas the same effort by Castro in a Central American
country might. The judgment can be unilateral and
subjective on the part of the U.S.
8.
Formulate a program for a post-Castro Cuba
giving full weight to the real changes which have taken
place there during the past five years and full recog–
nition to the need for channeling Castro's unfinished
revolution into constructive lines.
The above scenario should not be commenced unless
it is recognized that, although these actions are
primarily designed to deter Castro from his present course,
he may very well persevere in his policy. Under such
circumstances the U.S., having publicly embarked on the
doctrine, cannot then withdraw from the consequences.

6. Explain carefully through diplomatic
channels to the Soviet Union that the United States
finds the present behavior of the Castro/communist
regime in Cuba intolerable, that Cuba's activities in
Venezuela prove this to be so and that further acts
of violence of comparable danger or potential danger
on the part of Cuba will cause the U.S. to feel no
longer bound by any inhibitions against invasion or
other appropriate action. Urge the Soviet Union, in
order to reduce tensions in the Caribbean and permit
the U.S. to live peacefully with the Castro/communist
regime in Cuba, to assure that Cuba is restrained
from repeating its dangerous practices. Make it plain
to the Soviet Union that further behavior of this sort
by Castro will compel the U.S. to adopt drastic measures.
Point out to the Soviet Union the physical vulnerability
of Cuba as well as the effect a failure to resolve the
Cuban problem will have on the traditional policy which
the U.S. has pursued of not exerting pressures upon the
Soviets' European satellites. Make it plain that the U.S.
desires peace in the Caribbean and expects the Soviet
Union to achieve good behavior on the part of Castro.

SPECTRUM OF COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO CUBA
Accepting as valid the Attorney General's statement
that there is no point in discussing courses of action
with respect to Cuba until the fundamental decision is
made as to whether or not it is possible for the United
States to live with Castro, the following possible
courses of action are listed under the headings "Can
Live with Castro" and "Can't Live with Castro." Neither
of these headings is absolute; the courses of action
listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta-
bility of the Castro regime or conversely the urgency
to overthrow it.
COURSES OF ACTION
Can Live with Castro
A.
1.
Negotiate a detente with Fidel looking towards
full recognition of his regime and unlimited trade
between the United States and Cuba. The negotiator of
the detente would endeavor to secure from Castro com-
mitments not to engage in subversive activities in
Latin America and not to engage in polemics against
the United States. He would also endeavor to reduce
or eliminate, as a result of our concessions, Soviet
presence in Cuba and reduce the Cuban military machine
to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful
Latin American island republic.
No covert activities would be undertaken and
intelligence operations would be of a nature compat-
ible with our relations with a neutral power.

Advantages
If the plan works, this
would represent a satis
factory solution of the
Cuban problem, especially
if the Soviet presence
could thereby be eliminated.
3.

a.
Disadvantages
As plan almost sure not
to work, it would have grave
consequences throughout
Latin America as well as
serious domestic political
repercussions.
b. Even if plan ultimately
successful there would
be short term domestic
political losses and
short term weakening
U.S. position in Latin
America.
Do nothing. No specific efforts will be made
to arrange a rapprochement with Fidel but we would.
remain receptive to any advances made by him. No
covert operations would be undertaken and intelligence
operations would not include black maritime operations
into Cuba It would be hoped that Fidel, recognizing
the good faith and good will of the new Administration,
would make his own advances leading towards a satis-
factory detente.
Advantages
As in 1. above.
a.
Disadvantages
As in 1. above but less
short term domestic and
Latin American losses,
b. Even less chance of
success.
3. The present level of intelligence operations,
including U-2 overflights would be continued. Black
maritime infiltrations and exfiltrations of agents and
caches of intelligence gear would continue but no action
operations would be conducted. We would be "keeping an
eye on" Fidel both in Cuba and abroad but would be making
no effort to hinder his internal development.

Jim Braden: Where He Is Today
Immediately following the assassination of President
Kennedy, Eugene Brading (Jim Braden) had an upturn in
his personal finances.
Brading later reported a large increase in revenue from
an oil well he had an interest in back in Louisiana. Ho
reported the large increase in revenue from the well for
the month of November 1963.
A month later, in December of 1963, Brading became a
charter member of the exclusive (and very expensive)
La Costa Country Club in southern Californial Later that
year, 1964, Brading and his old syndicate oil friend
Roger Batman established the "B And B Cattle Company."
The company was set up in Chicago and was presumably
named after then, "B And B," though neither of the two
mon are listed as corporate officers. It was also during
this same period that Brading made a substantial investment
in two lots in Coral Gables, Florida.
In 1965, Brading's lengthy parole was finally terminated..
He soon bought a new home near the La Costa Country Club
which he had joined, and he also bought a house for his
parents in Santa Barbara..
And it is at the La Costa Country Club that the mysterious
trail of Jim Braden, or Eugene Hale Brading, finally ends.
The La Costa Country Club, which Brading had joined as one
of its 100 Charter members in January of 1964 is one of
the more notorious Mafia properties in the nation.
'
The most powerful force behind La Costa is Mod Dalitz, one
of Never Lansky's single closest associates. Hoe Dalitz had
been the leader of the early Mayfield Road Gang in Cleveland,
and had been the founder of the actual Cleveland syndicate,
one of the most powerful forces in the national crime syndicate.
☐☐
Hoe Dalitz had been one of the Mafia's biggest investors in
Las Vegas, and it had been Dalitz who had personally helped
sot up the Howard Ilughes empire in Las Vegas. Dalitz had
sold much of his own holdings to Howard Hughes in the late
1960's.

COMMITTEE
799 BROADWAY
NEW YORK 3, N. Y. ORegoa 4-8295:
a "ew rleans Chapter of FPCC. In fact, we would be very, very pleased to see this
take place and would like to do everything possible to assist in bringing it about.
We feel that the south-east is a very difficult area to work because of our lack of
contacts. Our only southeastern Chapter right now is that in Tampa, Florida which
I originally organized before coming up to work in the National Office.
I for one am convinced of the possibility of such an enterprise but know from
experience that it is quite a problem and requires some sacrifice on the part of
those involved.
You must realize that you will come under tremendous pressures with any attempt
to do FPCC work in that area and that you will not be able to operate in the manner
which is conventional here in the north-east. Even most of our big city Chapters have
been forced to abandon the idea of operating an office in public. The national office
here in New York is the only one in the country today and the New York City Chapter
uses our office too so it is the only Chapter with an office. Most Chapters have dis-
covered that it is easier to operate semi-privately out of a home and maintain a P.O.
Sox for all mailings and public notices. ((A P.O. Box is a must for any Chapter in the
organization to guarnatee the continued contact with the national even if an individuual
should move or drop out. We do have a serious and often violent opposition and this
proceedure helps prevent many unnecessary incidents which frighten away prospective
supporters. I definitely would not recommend an office, at least not one that will
be easily identifyable to the lunatic fringe in your community. Certainly,

Maximum effort would be made to increase the
countersubversion capabilities of Fidel's foreign
target countries.
Advantages
We would be maintaining
a clean hands attitude
towards Castro and our
policy would be more
compatible with that of
our major allies.

Disadvantages
Evidence of American
inaction would be
domestically assailable,
would be quickly sensed
by Latin American coun-
tries and would further
demoralize the exile
community.
b. We would be in effect
helping Castro to con-
solidate his position
at home and establish
his image abroad.
4. In addition to intelligence collection as in
3., we would engage in a "persuasive" economic denial
program employing diplomatic efforts and the coopera-
tion of U.S. corporations. Covert subtle sabotage
against selected Cuban imports (e.g. contamination of
lubricant additives).
Advantages
A carefully targetted
denial program with effec-
tive subtle sabotage is capa-'
ble of at least disrupting
the timing of Castro's
economic efforts. It may
have a measurable effect
on Cuba's one domestic
source of economic strength
sugar.
5.
Disadvantages
We will remain at odds with
our allies on Cuba trade.
We may delay but not prevent
Castro's progress.
i
In addition to actions in 3. and 4. above,
engage`in surveillance of suspected vessels or aircraft
carrying Cuban arms shipments by means of bilateral
agreements with individual countries in Latin America,
such surveillance to be accomplished without the use of
force in international waters and the use of force in
national waters.

Thank you for your prompt reply. Enclosed are your card and receipt, along

local requirements. Naturally, there a minimul regulations which must be mot.

It would be hard to concieve of a chapter with as few members as seem to exist
in the New Orleans area. I have just gone through our files and find that Lousiana

perhaps you could build a larger group if a few people would undertake the disciplined
responsibility of concrete organizational work.
We certainly are not at all adverse to a very small Chapter but certainly would
expect that there would be at least twice the amount needed to conduct a legal executive
board for the Chapter. Should this be reasonable. we could readily issue a charter for

The Current Situation in Cuba
The
During 1963 the situation in Cuba steadily worsened.
economy continued its decline and Castro was not able to halt:
the downward curve. Hurricana Flora intensified Cuba's economic
problems. Disillusionment and apathy among the great majority
of the population continued to grow, and enthusiasm was increasingly
restricted to a hard core. As popular support waned, coercion and
terror were employed more and more to maintain the regime's control.
Castro's drive to convert Cuba into a standard communist prototype
caused increasing disillusionment among his original followers.
His stature in the eyes of many Cubans and Latin Americans suffered
with the realization, in the aftermath of the October missile crisis,
that Cuba had been a pawn and Castro a cupe of Soviet policy.
Despite extraordinary efforts, Castro has not been able to
stop acta of defiance against his regime. Guerrilla activity,
although scattered and uncoordinated, continues. Spontaneous
acts of sabotage are common throughout the island. At great
risk refugees still elude his security forces and sea patrols
to escape from Cuba. In this atmosphere, externally mounted
raids against Cuban targets have added to Castro's sense of
frustration and helped sustain hope among the many Cubans dis-
illusioned with his regime.
During 1963 Cuba's international situation seemed almost as
bad as the domestic. Although chinks appeared in the wall, the
U.S. policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba was
holding up fairly well. Soviat-Cuban relations clearly were under
strain. Castro scored no foreign policy victories to provide a
mich needed psychological boost. His major effort to stimulato
Castro-type armed uprisings throughout Latin America failed to
disrupt the Venezuelan elections of December and netted a potentially
embarrassing exposure that Cuba had shipped arms clandestinely to
Venezuela, These internal and international trends and develop-
ments brought Cuba to a low point during 1963.
Within the past few weeks, however, five developments have
given the Castro regime an important political-psychological

lift. They ere:
1. The realization in the Caban Government that th
continuing high sugar prices in the world market
have enabled Cuba to expand its convertible
carIency reserves from about $20 million to
almost $100 million during the year.
2. The Soviet-Cuban trade protocol for 1964, signed
on January 11, and the Khrushchevassurances of
January 22, demonstrated a Soviet willingness to
maintain its aid and trade program at a very
substantial level and to support Cuban suger
prices. The protocol calls for Cuban-Soviet trade
to increase by 22 per ceat over 1963. Sovict
exports, about 40 per cent of which will be on
credit, will increase by at least 10 per cent.
3. The distinct possibility that the United States
policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba
may not be able to stand in the face of increasing
pressures frca Western countries to expand trade
with Cuba, extending credit if necessary.
British bus deal, with payment spread over a
five-year period, is an important political and
psychological trimph for Castro. Ita erosive
effects on potential Cuban suppliers are already
clear,
4. The recent rioting and violence in Panama, in which
Castro had some hand, will inject new revolutionary
fervor into Castroits activities. In addition,
Panama and its aftermath will take the play away
from the incident of the Venezuela arts cache.
The revolt in Zanzibar, in which Castro also had a
hand, is bound to impress Latin America as well as
other unstable areas with the length of Fidel's
arm and the potency of his doctrine.

economy. Proposala for expanding and intensi-
fying these activities are now being presented.
The execution of these additional measures depends
Lasically on a decision to incur the considerable
political costs and risks that are entailed.
2. The reduction of free-world shipping in the Cuba
trade: We have maintained diplomatic pressurs
on free-world nations to reduce and eventually
eliminate their ships in the Cuba trade. We have
denied U.S. financed cargoes in U.S. ports to
ships in the Cuba trade (NSAM 220, as amended).
To the same general end, we have employed existing
legislation, and the threat of additional legis
lation, restricting economic and military assist-
anve to countries with ships in the Cuba trade.
3. The reduction of free world, and the containment
of Soviet Bloc, air service to Cuba: We have
maintained diplomatic pressures on free-world
countries having, or wishing to establish, air
service to Cuba. We are invoking recent legis-
lation denying assistance to countries whose
ships and aircraft carry commodities to and from
Cuba. In addition, we have exerted diplomatic
pressures on free-world countries to deny their
facilities to Soviet Bloc and Cuban airlines
serving or trying to serve Cuba, or harass such
airlines.
The Unitation of free-world diplomatic relations
with Cuba: As opportunity has offered, we have
exerted pressure to persuade free-world countrica
to break diplomatic relations with Cuba or to
prevent the establishment of such relations with
Cuba.
5. Efforts to underming the Castro image abroad and
to fristrate Cuban attempts to enhance that imize:
By nema of diplomatic, propaganda and covert
measures we have endeavored to demonstrate the
weakness, failures and betrayals of the Castro
regine.

These recent developments have provided the upward

needed, lle now has a firmer base for his repeated claims
that Cuba has survived the full bront of a major Caited States
effort to destroy the Cuban revolution, claims likely to in-
press many Latin Americans as well as Cubans. In addition,
Castro now has the possibility of producing some tangible evidence
that his regize can restore forward momentum in the economy.
Consequently, the general position of the Castro regime is
much improved over that of three or four months ago.
II Current U. S. Policy and Prom
The ultimate U.S. objective is the replacement of the
present government in Cuba by one fully compatible with the
goals of the United States..
To attain this objective, we are trying, by exerting
nazizm pressure through all means short of the use of mill-
tary force, to create a degree of disorganization, uncertainty
and discontent in Cuba which will (a) predispose elements in
the military and other power centers of the regime to bring
about the overthrow of the Castro/Commmist group and the
elimination of the Soviet presence in Cuba; (b) weaken the
base for subversion in the Hemisphere; and (e) assist in
convincing the Soviets that they are backing a losing and
expensive horse.
In order to create the optimm situation just described,
se have been carrying out a program of integrated, ritually
reinforcing and mutually dependent courses of action. These
comprise:
The economic, political and psychological isolation
of Cuba frm the frne world
Denial of free-world markets and sorreas of

of overt and covert activities designed to
reduce free-world trads with Cuba and, especially,

1. Within Cuba: As indicated above, all our efforts
to bring about disorganization, uncertainty and

Cutside Cuba:
Multilateral: We have sought, through the CAS,
to obtain general Latin American recognition
of the seriousness of the subversive threat
and approval of recommendations of measures
to limit travel to and from Cuba, and the
transfer of funds and propaganda. At the
present time, we intend to expand and intensify
this effort through actions to be taken by the
QAS on the basis of the Venezuelan complaint
against Cuba. Beyond the activities in the OAS,
we have made special efforts with the Central
American countries and Pinama to have them
tighten controls on the activities and movement
of subversives, to develop inland and inshore
surveillance capabilities, to create effective
intelligence organizations and to establish a
system of intelligence exchange.
b. Bllateral: Through training, material assist-
ance and exchange of intelligence, we have
worked to improve the internal security
capabilities of individual countries.
Unilateral: In addition to multilateral and
bilateral measures, we have continued to
maintain our surface patrols in the vicinity
of Cuba, to improve our own comunications
systems and to develop our own intelligence
capabilities against subversive activities.

We bave maintained diplomatic pressure on the Soviets
to continue troop withdrawals and we have warned the
Soviets that we will not tolerate the use of Soviet
forces in Cuba to suppress popular uprising.
The collection of intelligence
We have mintained and improved our overt and covert
collection of intelligence to meet not only U.S.
strategic requirements but also operational require-
ments connected with our covert activities within Cuba.
We have maintained periodic high-level overflights
supplemented on a few occasions by low-level flights.
We have warned the Soviets and Cubans against inter-
ference with these flights.
Covert operations to weaken and undermine the Castro
Rezine
A detailed discussion of the covert elements of our
progrm appears in Section III.
As stated above, all these courses of action interact and
are interdependent. For example, our covert sconcnic denial
operations are designed to reinforce and be reinforced by our
overt masures of economic pressure. Both types of activities
directed against the econcay are intended to aggravate existing
ecomic difficulties and thus to increase the level of dia-
affection not only in the popular mass but particularly in
the power canters of the regime. This disaffection enhances
our ability to establish meaningful contact with figures in
the military and other power centers and to develop intelli-
gence sources. This disaffection is in turn intensified by
the evidence of vulnerability to outside attacks provided
by the success of covert sabotage and harassment activities.

The La Costa Country Club had become, under the direction
of Moc Dalitz and lever Lansky, a key "watering hole" of
the syndicate. La Costa was originally financed through a
syndicate deal with James Hoffa of the Teamsters. One of
the Teamsters Union's billion dollar Pension Funds was used.
in the financing of the project. La Costa became what is
known in the Mafia as "open territory" meaning that no
single Mafia family controlled it. La Costa was open to all.
Intelligence authorities in southern California have long
regarded La Costa as a prime hangout for the Mafia. Some
officials have dubbed it "Apalachin West."
The syndicate had originally given Charter memberships in
La Costa to a number of Hollywood celebrities, so as to
soften the image of the plush resort. Among the members
were Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, and Bing Crosby.
Members of President Nixon's inner circle also became
frequent guests as La Costa, which is just twenty miles
away from San Clemente. Early in the Nixon Administration,
in 1969, Los Angeles Police were astonished to find Murray
Chotiner, one of the President's closest confidantes, living
it up at La Costa while the President was in San Clemente.
In February of 1973, while President Nixon was at San Clem-
ente, H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, Richard Moore, and
John Dean held a series of meetings at La Costa: to discuss
the Watergate conspiracy, which was then beginning to
unravel.
2
John Dean gave lengthy testimony during the Ervin Committee
hearings regarding "the La Costa meetings. These meetings
at La Costa have since energed as perhaps the most crucial
strategy sessions involved in the alleged cover-up of
Watergate by. the President's closest aides. Dean testified
that the La Costh meetings took place over a period of two
days, February 10 - 12, 1973. Dean testified that the sessions
were held in a special villa at La Costa that was used by
Haldeman.f
It has been during this same period of time, in the last
several years, that Eugene Brading (Jin Bradon) has become
one of the most important Mafia operatives at La Costa.
According to numerous intelligence reports, from California,
Nevada, and federal authorities, Brading is now suspected of
being the personal courier for national crime syndicate boss
Meyer Lansky.

By the same token, the failure or elimination of one of these
mutually supporting courses of action jeopardizes the othera
and thus compromises the entire program.
Through 1963, these courses of action were having a measure-
able positive impact. We are now confronted, however, by a
series of developments, described in Section I, which threaten
to arrest or even reverse our forward movement. The situation
is particularly acute with respect to the maintenance of our
conomic pressures. This fact makes this review of our covert
operations particularly timely and important.
III. Concept of the Covert Action Program
The CIA covert action program aims at maintaining all
feasible pressures on Cuba and at creating and exploiting
situations in Cuba calculated to stimulate dissident elements
within the regime, particularly in the armed forces, to carry
out a coup. The objective of the coup would be to remove
the Castro/Commmists from the regime and to eliminate the
entire Soviet presence from Cuba. Recognizing that the U.S.
is engaged in a race against time with Cuba and its Soviet
ally to obstruct the consolidation of Castro's regina at tons
and to prevent bis from achieving his ambitions in Latin
America, we set the time frame for this program at about
eighteen meaths from June 1963.
As originally conceived and approved in June 1963, the
covert action program was based on the assumption that U.S.
policy precludes a military invasion or a full blockade of
Cuba which could lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Union.
In addition, the covert action program was and is predicated
on the thesis that its chance of success would defend heavily
on a sustained and intensive effort in other sectors, parti-
cularly the overt economic denial and political isolation
programs, by all elements of the United States Government.

that the cumulative psychological and political
impact within Cuba of sustained sabotage operations
is a necessary element in the accomplishment of our
mission.
Support of extonomous anti-Castro Cuben exile
These operations are intended to provide
a deniable activity, a means of supplementing and
expanding our covert capability and a mans of taking
advantage of untapped political and resistance resources
of the exila community. The program now includes tso
autonomous groups whose credibility as to autonomy is
strengthened by the facts that:
They are led by men whose prominence and status
in the Cuban exile comumity rakes plausible their

U.S. territory;
Both have natural, willing allies in power in
several Latin American countries;
Both are Cuben and employ Cuban nationals
exclusively;
Every item of financial and logistic support has
been handled in a manner as to provide mazimm
protection against proof of CIA or U.S. parti-
cipation..
The initial aim of these operations is to strengthen
the will to resist by increasing the tempo of sub-
version and sabotage largely maintained until now
by CIA; the crentual sia is to take the fight
from the coastline to the interior of Cuba,
The disadvantage of our autonomous operations is
that it is necessary to accept a lower order of

Of the foregoing inter-locking courses of action, items

are expected. Item (3) is the cubject of another paper which
is being prosented for concurrent consideration. Item (4)

Item (5) has been the subject of continual review since the

since 1 June. Insurgency and sabotage inside Cuba are not
part of a coordinated program; they are acts of individual
or small group defiance. They are stimulated by many factors,
and no one factor can be assigned entire credit. Sabotage
incidents, which include a high proportion of sugar cane
burnings, have a tendency to be seasonal, a fact which further
obscures statistical analysis. Although it is true that from
a low point in sabotage incidents during the summer of 1963
there was a heavy increase during the fall (following the
comancement of our raiding activity), we believe that clezzer
light is shed on the effects of our barassment program by the
statements of witnesses of varying points of view within Cuba
and by the acts of the Cuban regime itself.

attempted. All were successful. There was substantial
damage to the target; all participants were safely recovered

threats point up his acute sensitivity to internal resistance
and suggests that he feels his regime to be far from secure
from external threats. The Soviet Union, on the other hand,
hag reacted to the sabotage raids with much less vigor and
blaster than we anticipated. Their only sharp reaction,
aside from the expected propaganda, followed a scries of air
raids during August and September sponsored by Cuban exile
groups operating from Florida and for which the Agency had
no responsibility. They did no real damage, but they did
demonstrate that the Cuban air defense syston could be
breached, and they added substantially to the psychological
impact of our first two raids.
The Agency sabotage raids produced some very specific
results. For example, in the political and psychological
realm, Comadian Ambassador Kidd reported in late August
that the incidents that month, including the Santa Lucia
and Casilda operations "disturbed the feeling of consoli-
dation and tranquility which the Castro regime had succeeded
in creating in recent months." He reported that the Cubans
were uncertain and apprehensive over the possibility of a
U.S. campaign of subversion and sabotage because of Cuba's
vulnerability to such a campaign due to the "low ebb" of
enthusiasm for the Castro regime among the people. He also
stated that the raids had "raised hopes of those opposed
to the regime" and that "dispirited opposition had received
a fillip to its morale."
In a September report, Ambassador Kidd stated that
the "host immediate effect of such attacks is the psycho-
logical blow dealt to the stability of the Castro regime.
with consequent boost in opposition." Low morale and
dejection in the counterrevolutionary ranks of some months

On 4 September a reliable clandestine source in Cuba
reported that the reaction of the average man on the street in
Havana to the news of the attacks on Casilda and Santa Lucia
"astounding." Prior to the Cuban government's announce-
ment of the raids, the average nan on the street seemed
apathetic, depressed and in a low state of morale. Following
the announcement their mood changed to one of pleasure, joy,
and hope,. The observations of this source vare reinforced
by the statements of Cuban refugees who arrived in the U.S..
shortly after the Cuban amouncement of the raids.
A former Major in the Cubah Rebel Army who broke with
Castro reported after his exfiltration from Cuba in January
1964 that the 23 December Siguanes raid which destroyed a
P-6 patrol boat was a great boost to morale among disaffected
Cubane.
A Cuban Lawyer with extensive connections among Cubm
government officials and in the Western community in Bavana

sabotage operations are good among anti-reşime segments of

world is not forgetting the Cuban people, that the fight con❤

against Castro. Opposite morale effects are noted among the
pro-regime segments who have tended to remain notably quiet
about the regime after successful sabotage operations.
A Cuban coumamications technician employed by the Cuban

Cuba's defenses with good regularity. Raiding operations of
this sort, however, always present risk and we mist assume
that captured Cuban agents will reveal U.S. involvement as thay
have dona in the past giving Castro the opportmity to make
vociferous propaganda against U.S. aggression. In addition,
although Ehrushchov has not made Agency harassing raids the
subject of special protest (as he did in the case of the
exile air raids in August and September), a major step-up
in the frequency or scale as, for instance, an attack on
a major economic target such as Matanzas or Santiago, might
bring about a Soviet protest. The chance of a physical
rataliation by Castro as, for instance, an attack upon
U.S. installation in the Caribbean, although unlikely,
cannot be entirely discounted.
If Castro is to be brought down without overt military
action the main effort will have to come from inside Cuba,
We believe that there is sufficient evidence to show that
sabotage raids, despite the risk involved, are a necessary
stimulus to internal action which will need to be continued for
a considerable period to permit the tempo of internal acts to
zeach a point where it can become solf-sustained.
V. Imact of Cessation of Sabotage Oncrations
Recause of the visible and dramatic nature of sabotage
operations, their cessation would soon be noted by all
interested parties to and observers of U.Q/Cuban relations.
The cessation of these raids, bouever, disclaimabla by the
U.S. the raids themselves may be, would probably be inter-
preted in Latin America and certainly inside Chiba a3 a switch
of U.S. policy from one of discreet encouragement and support
of aggressive action against the Castro regime to one of
"coexistence" and eventual accommodation with a Castro/Communist
Cuba. Without constant and visible signs of offensive action
against Caba, a weakening process would be set in ration
which could well load the countries of Latin America to draw
their own conclusions from these indicators and embark on
accommodation policies of their owne Those governments in
Latin America already threatened by Castroites in their own
countries arellikely to be subjected to even stronger domestic
pressuxcs,

The Nevada Gaming Board is continuing an investigation
into Braden's alleged role as syndicate courier for.
"skimmed" gambling revenue from Las Vegas. Investigator
Noyes was told by several high government officials that
Jim Braden had indeed been identified as the personal
courier for Never Lansky. One official disclosed that
Braden was suspected of taking over $72 million out of
the country for the syndicate. Another official said
that was a "low estimate."
1
In the summer of 1971, Braden came under renewed investi-
gation by California authorities following an incident at
La Costa.
A janitor at La Costa opened Braden's golf locker to make
a routing inspection. Out of the locker tumbled a bundle of
well over $100,000 in cash.
Author Holles was informed by one official that the bundle
had contained at least $120,000 in cash, and another Cal-
ifornia official put the amount at closer to $200,000.
During questioning regarding the incident, Braden stated
that he had received the money from an oil transaction,
and that he had temporarily stored it in the locker. Later,
one of the officials working on that particular investigation
of Braden told Hoves that Braden had also been given the use
of two planes owned by Howard Hughes to fly Mafia gambling
cash out of Nevada and the country.
At present, Eugene Brading, alias Jim Braden, is still
operating out of La Costa.

The raids also had an impact on the Cuban military and
security forces. Certain areas and ports were placed on
special alort status. Forces are often rushed to defensive
positions; ground, naval, and air patrols are frequently
launched or intensified; and defensive positions in industrial
or agricultural complexes are marned to meet the real or
imagined threats. The raids interfere not only with routine
military training but also with work on construction and
agricultural projects which use military personnel. Raul
Castro personally investigated the Siguanea incident.
In addition, Castro expanded his coast watching network
from 46:observation posts at the end of June to 103 at the
end of October. Those posts have radio communications and are
manned by 10 to 25 full-time personnel. In a further effort
to scal Cuba's shores, at least 10 surface search radar stations
have been established since June, and we have evidence tenta-
tively identifying 7 more.
Castro's fear of rising dissidence and insurgency La
reflected in his initiation of a wide variety of repressive
measures. Many are bound to have adverse political, psycho-
logical or economic repercussions insido Cuba. He has con-
ducted almost constant anti-insurgent operations involving
mita of up to 2,500 men. Air, naval and ground force
elements have been put on special alert, either on a local
or island-wide basis, on at least 35 occasions during 1963
as a result of rumored or actual maritime operations. Resi-
dents in areas of querrilla activity have been forcibly
relocated, and restrictions have been placed on transportation
in suspect areas. In August 1963 a new internal accurity
force, the Locha Centra Fixatas, was formed to attempt to
cope with off-shore raiding parties. In September new training
courses were initiated for command cadres of "popular defense
units. The purpose of these units is to organize the people
to defend themselves against enemy attack and to protect
industrial centers and installations from sabotage..

Despite these measures to increase Cuba's defensive
capability against raids, we have continued to improve our
own infiltration techniques and are still able to penetrato

As this belief spreads, Western European and other free
world countries eager to trade with Cuba will come to feel
that they may safely ignore and evade, to an even greater
extent than they do now, U.S. appeals for the economic and
political isolation of Cuba. An important additional economia
effect would be the release into normal economic activity of
manpower and funds now tied up in defense against raids.
Finally, and most important, this development in time
is bound to have a severe demoralizing effect on the internal
resistance against Castro. The Cuban exile community and
particularly its militant and articulate elements would be
acutely sensitive to a cessation of raids and can be expected
to react vociferously. Judging from past experience, we
can expect a new surge of domestic political agitation on
part of the numerous Cuban exiles who have political
connections within the U.S.
In the event that it is decided to terminate CIA-
controlled sabotage and harassment operations, it cannot be
assumed that the autonomous groups, despite the greater
deniability of their actions, could take over entirely the
mission of furnishing proof of visible resistance to Castro
and inspiring internal elements to take the personal risks
Autonomous groups are
necessary to set a coup in motion.
As yet untested in their capability to conduct successful
sabotage and harassment operations on a sustained basis.
It is unlikely that in the next months the autonomous groups
will develop the ability to match CIA-controlled operations,
either in quantity or quality.
If sabotage and harassment operations were to be terminated
for the autonomous groups as well as for the Agency, its
support to the autonomous groups must also be terminated
completely as otherwise we would not be in a position to
insure that they would discontinue raids and sabotage.
Such termination would compound the effects of the cessation
of our own raids, particularly in those areas in the Caribbean
where the autonomous groups have been mast active.

VI. The Residual Program
In the event it is decided to abandon the core of the
covert program, we will be obliged to fall back on essentially
overt courses of action which are already operating but which
can be refined and intensified, provided the political risks
and costs are judged acceptable and we receive adequate
cooperation from our allies.
A. Action against free-world economic ties with Cuba
Because of the recent erosion of our efforts in this
sector and the clear intention of the Cubans and Soviets to
expand Cuban economic relations with the free world, a series
of recommendations to intensify this course of action has been
made and is now being presented. The basic issue in the
recommendations is our ability and willingness to incur the
political costs and risks that heightened economic pressure
would involve. Even if the recommendations are adopted
completely, we could have no real assurance that our attempts
to curtail Cuban-free world economic ties would be successful.
On the other hand, if the actions and commitments included
in the recommendations are not adopted, it is a near certainty
that; under present circumstances, our economic pressures will
be reduced to ineffectiveness. In any case, it must be clearly
recognized that no amount of economic pressure can by itself
bring in the Castro government, at least as long as the
Soviats are prepared to subsidize the Cuban economy. The
curtailment and disruption of Cuban economic ties with the
free world can only contribute, and then only over time, to
the creation of the optimum situation we are trying to develop.
The effectiveness of this contribution would be at least
sharply impaired by the relaxation of the pressure created
by covert operations. Beyond these considerations, we can
never have assurance that a foreign goverment cooperating
in the economic program will not pull out and virtually
collapse the program. Entire or even important reliance:
on economic pressure as a substitute for the covert program
would be to deliver the fate of cur policy into the uncertain
bands of governments which do not share our convictions and
sense of priority with respect to Cubs

B. CAS Action
As a result of the Venezuelan charges against Cuba arising
from the arms cache discovery, we have been considering a series
of measures which we would seek in the CAS. It should be noted
that the atmosphere for 01s adoption of strong measures has
deteriorated as a result of the Panamanian crisis. ☐
The measures which we have been studying include:
1. A breek in diplomatic relations
The principal effects of this measure, which would
mean action by five countries, including Brazil,
Chile and Mexico, would be to provide rather dramatic
evidence of Castro's isolation and to deny the Cuban
regina subversive facilities offered by its remaining
missions in Latin America. The measure would meet
heavy resistance from Maxico, Chile and particularly
Brazil.
2. A break in economic relations
:
Although this would have little practical effect
economically, it would have some utility as a means
of moral pressure on other free-world countries
trading with Cuba.
3. A break in air and surface communications
Over time this would lead to a reduction in the
Cuban ability to move subversives to and from Latin
America. It would be useful as a means of moral
pressure on other free-world countries having, or
wishing to establish, air services with Cuba. On
the negative side it would mean the temporary loss
of intelligence facilities and would have an adverse
effect on Cuban exile morale by closing on existing
escape route for persons inside Cuba,

guaranteed, In any case, if the Cuban base wera to be
strengthened by the relaxation of covert pressures or by
the weakening of economic pressures, we will be fighting
#gainst increasing odds.
D. Increased psychological and propaganda efforts
We can intensify our measures in this sector, including
major policy declarations on Cuba by the President and other
senior officers of the Government. The efficacy of such
afforts is entirely dependent, however, upon the substance
behind them. A propaganda offensive would be productive
only if there were credible evidence that our words were
being accompanied by successful actions in other sectors.
VII. Conclusion
The residual program set out above la substantially
weaker than the present program. Accordingly, the prospects
for attaining our ultimate objective of replacing the Castro/
Commmist regime, which have been by no means certain even
under the present program, would be very measurably diminished
under the residual program. The elimination of the core of
the present covert program, especially if accompanied by a
rejection or failure of the proposed expanded means of econcuie
pressure, would raise in sharp terms the question of the need
to exmine the two basic alternatives: the use of force or
accommodation.
VIII. Recommendation

present form and scope,

feeling the impact of this lack of freedom. I also believe
he now understands the extent to which he has been
misled, especially, for example, on Cuban reaction at
the time of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion. I also
think he is a realist; he is now registering that it is im-
possible to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the
explosive situation throughout Latin America, to dis-
appear.
Why the Missiles Were Installed
"There is one point on which I want to give you new
information. right away. I have refrained from doing
this until now; but today an attempt is being made to
frighten all mankind by propagating the idea that
Cuba, and in particular I, might provoke a nuclear war,
so I feel the world should know the true story of the
missile emplacement.
"Six months before these missiles were installed in
Cuba, we had received an accumulation of information
warning us that a new invasion of the island was being
prepared under sponsorship of the Central Intelligence
Agency, whose administrators were humiliated by the
Bay of Pigs disaster and by the spectacle of being
ridiculed in the eyes of the world and herated in US
government circles. We also knew that the Pentagon
was vesting, the CIA preparations with the mantle of
its authority, but we had doubts as to the attitude of
the President. There were those among our informants
who even thought it would suffice to alert the President
and give him cause for concern in order to arrest these
preparations. Then one day Khrushchev's son-in-law,
Adzhubei, came to pay us a visit before going on to
Washington at the invitation of Kennedy's associates.
Immediately upon arriving in Washington, Adzhubei
had been received by the American Chief Executive,
and their talk centered particularly on Cuba: A week
after this interview, we received in Havana a copy of
Adzhubei's report to Khrushchev. It was this report
which triggered the whole situation.
“What did Kennedy say to Adzhubei? Now listen to
this carefully, for it is very important: he had said that
the new situation in Cuba was intolerable for the Unit-
ed States, that the American government had decided
it would not tolerate it any longer; he had said that
peaceful coexistence was seriously compromised by the
fact that 'Soviet influences' in Cuba altered the balance
of strength, was destroying the equilibrium agreed
18
:
upon and [at this point Castro emphasized his state-
ment by pronouncing each syable separately] Ken-
nedy reminded the Russians that the United States
had not intervened in Hungary, which was obviously
a way of demanding Russian non-intervention in the
event of a possible invasion. To be sure, the actual word
'invasion' was not mentioned and Adzhubei at the
time, lacking any background information, sould not
draw the same conclusions as we did. But when we
communicated to Khrushchev all our previous informa----
tion, the Russians too began to interpret the Kennedy-
Adzhubei conversation as we saw it and they went to
the source of our information. By the end of a month,
the Russian and Cuban governments had reached the
definite conviction that an invasion might take place
from one moment to the next. This is the truth.
"What was to be done? How could we prevent the
invasion? We found that Khrushchev was concerned
about the same things that were worrying us. He asked
us what we wanted. We replied: do whatever is needed
to convince the United States that any attack ou Cuba
is the same as an attack on the Soviet Union. And how
to realize this objective? All our thinking and discus-
sions revolved around this point. We thought of a
proclamation, an alliance, conventional military aid.
The Russians explained to us that their concern was
twofold: first, they wanted to save the Cuban revolu-
tion (in other words, their socialist honor in the eyes
of the world), and at the same time they wished to
avoid a world conflict. They reasoned that if conven-
tional military aid was the extent of their assistance,
the United States might not hesitate to instigate an
invasion, in which case Russia would retaliate and this
would inevitably touch off a world war."
At this point I interrupted to ask how Cuba could
have been absolutely certain of Soviet intervention..
After all, I said, Stalin certainly “let down" Markos,
the Chief of the Greek Communist Resistance, because
such help would have conflicted with prevailing zones
of influence.
“I know,” Castro replied, "but the two situations
cannot be compared." Then he continued:
"Russia was much too deeply committed to us. More-
over, since then we have had every proof of the im-
mense solidarity of the Soviet people and its leaders.
You can see for yourself how clearly this solidarity is
manifest here. Then there is. something else, specifi-
cally apropos of Stalin. When I was in the USSR and
others, outside Russia, were reproaching Khrushchev
for taking a more conciliatory standhan Stalin toward
the capitalists, Khrushchev confided to me several ex-
amples, which I will not repeat to you, illustrating the
prudence, even the abdication of Stalin. He told me -
and I believe him that Stalin would never have em-

Aratoval for cooperative surveillance measures
against rovement of arms and men
The single most damaging OAS action to Castro would be
an authorization for the use of force in connection
with the movement of arms and nen. The chances of
getting a politically acceptable majority for such
ene vas estimated to be less than even before the
events in Panama and the prospects have diminished
since then. Such OAS actica would almost certainly
dramatize the Cuban issue domestically and inter-
nationally. At the present time, it appears that the
surveillance system which might be authorized by the
CAS would involve the use of force only in the
territorial waters of the countries for which the
offending shipments are destined. Thus the question
of OAS authorization for the use of force on the
high seas will not arise,
3. Condemnation of the Castro rerica
This would be a pro forma action, with only limited
psychological force.
Reaffirmation of previous CAS measures on controlling
Cuban-based and supported subversion
This would be of value as a means of reinforcing a
general effort in this sector (see C balow). It ia,
however, a purely defensive measure
°
In sum, this series of OAS measures would certainly
helpful and would constitute important multilateral progress.
The actions, however, are primarily psychological and
defensiva.
C. Increased efforts against subversion
He can probably increase and expand our multilateral,
bilateral and unilateral efforts to increase the ability of
Latin Americs to resist subversion. Such efforts are purely
defensive and external to Cuba. Po certain results can ba

The five sabotage raids run by CIA:
1. On 18 August the POL storage tanks at Casilda, Las
Villas Province were attacked using 4.2 mortara,
One tank car was destroyed and one storage tank
breached, causing considerable fire damage. ¦
On 19 August the sulphuric acid plant at Santa
Lucia, Pinar del Rio Province was attacked.
There was considerable fire damage and fuel
lines were broken. We have reports that asid
found its way into the turbines as à result
of the raid causing additional domaga.
3. On 30 September a lumbermill at Bahia de
Maravi, Orienta Province, a minor installation
of local economic importance, was 70 per cant
destroyed by a raiding party.
On 21 October an underwater demolition team
attacked a dredge in the harbor at La Isabelá},
Las Villas Province. The vessel was surk.
5. On 23 December an underwater demolition team
attacked a Cuban naval P-6 patrol boat in the
Sigumea, Isle of Pines, naval base. The
patrol boat was seriously damaged and may have
sunk. Thres Cuban naval personnel were killed
and 13 others injured in the explosion.

"
tive." Second question: What does the American gov-
ernment expect to gain from the blockade? Is the
economic isolation of Cuba a punishment or a political
maneuver?
Kennedy's reply: "Are you suggesting that the polit-
ical effectiveness of the blockade is uncertain [smile]?
You will see when you go to Cuba whether it is or not.
In any case, we can't let Communist subversion win in
the other Latin American countries. Two dikes are
needed to contain Soviet expansion: the blockade on
the one hand; a tremendous effort toward progress on
the other. This is the problem in a nutshell. Both battles
are equally difficult." (Silerice.) Then, a last comment:
"The continuation of the blockade depends on the con-
tinuation of subversive activities."
The interview was over. I did not really wish to sug-
gest anything, since I had never been to Cuba and,
on the other hand, I had heard from all sides tales of
the privations the Cuban people were suffering owing
to their isolated economic situation. But I could see
plainly that John Kennedy had doubts, and was seeking
a way out.
That same evening I recounted this conversation in
detail to an American colleague - an intimate friend of
President Kennedy, through whom I had obtained this
interview - and to the editor of The New Republic.
Both my confidants, who knew the President a thou-
sand times better than I, agreed that John F. Kennedy
had never before expressed him so specifically and
with such feeling on his understanding of the first
phase of the Castro revolution. They hesitated to draw
any political conclusions from his remarks. However,
they were not surprised at Kennedy's invitation to
come and see him again when I returned from Cuba.
In effect, John Kennedy displayed two basic charac-
teristics in his exercise of power: first, an overwhelming
degree of empiricism and realism. A man without a
particular doctrine, he reacted decisively to events, and.
only to events. Nothing but the shock of collision with
a problem was sufficient to make him come to a deci-
sion, and because of this, his decisions were unpredic-
table. At that point he had a consuming need for
information, and this need had increased a great deal
since experience had taught him not to rely solely on
official channels.
After this, I went to Havana.
Night Session
TAB M
In the "Pearl of the Antilles rum-perfumed and
steeped in triumphant sensuality," as Cuba is described
in those American tourist folders still lying about in
the hotels of Havana, I spent three closely packed and
intensive weeks, but thinking all along that I would
never get to meet with Fidel Castro: I talked with farm-
ers, writers and painters, militants and counter-revo-
lutionaries, ministers and ambassadors - but Fidel re-
mained inaccessible. I had been warned: he was snowed
under with work; as a result of the hurricane, the
Cuban government had been obliged to revise its whole
planning program; and then, above all, he no longer
had any desire to receive any journalists, least of all
Western newsmen. I had practically given up hope
when, on the evening of what I thought was to be my
departure date (the capricious plane which links
Havana with Mexico happily did not leave the next day
after all), Fidel came to my hotel. He had heard of mj
interview with the President. We went up to my
room at 10 in the evening and did not leave until 4 in
the following morning. Here, I shall only recount that
part of that interview which constitutes a reply to John
F. Kennedy's remarks.
Fidel listened with devouring and passionate inter-
est: he pulled at his beard, yanked his parachutist's
beret down over his eyes, adjusted his maqui tunic, all
the while making me the target of a thousand malicious
sparks cast by his deep-sunk, lively eyes. At one point
I felt as though I were playing the role of that partner
with whom he had as strong a desire to confer as to do
battle; as though I myself were in a small way that
intimate enemy in the White House whom Khrushchev
described to Fidel as someone with whom "it is pos-
sible to talk." Three times he had me repeat certain re-
marks, particularly those in which Kennedy expressed
his criticism of the Batista regime, those in which Ken-
nedy showed his impatience with the comments attrib-
uted to General de Gaulle, and lastly those in which
Kennedy accused Fidel of having almost caused a war
fatal to all humanity.
When I stopped talking, I expected an explosion.
Instead, I was treated to a lengthy silence and, at the
end of that silence, to a calm, composed, often humor-
ous, always thoughtful exposition. I don't know wheth-
er Fidel has changed, or whether these cartoons cari-
caturing him as a ranting madman which appear in the
Western press perhaps correspond to a former reality.
I only know that at no time during the two complete
days I spent with him (and during which a great deal
happened), did Castro abandon his composure and
poise. Here too, I shall let Castro speak for himself,
reserving only the possibility of correcting certain judg-
ments on these two political leaders based on my own
experiences in Cuba.
"I believe Kennedy is sincere," Fidel declared. "I
also believe that today the expression of this sincerity
could have political significance. I'll explain what I
mean. I haven't forgotten that Kennedy centered his
electoral campaign against Nixon on the theme of
firmness toward Cuba. I have not forgotten the Ma-
chiavellian tactics and the equivocation, the attempts at

* DECEMBER), 1963
"It is true that it was said then by other factions
that the real reason for installing the missiles was
because certain internal problems were driving the Rus-
sians to use us to provoke the United States. I am here
to tell you that the Russians didn't want and do not
today want war. One only need visit them on their
home territory, watch them at work, share their eco-
nomic concerns, admire their intense efforts to raise the
workers' standard of living, to understand right away
that they are far, very far, from any idea of provocation
or domination. However, Soviet Russia was confronted
by two alternatives: an absolutely inevitable war (be-
cause of their commitments and their position in the
socialist world), if the Cuban revolution was attacked;
or the risk of a war if the United States, refusing to
retreat before the missiles, would not give up the at-
tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose socialist solidarity
and the risk of war.
"Under these circumstances, how could we Cubans
have refused to share the risks taken to save us? It
was, in the final analysis, a question of honor, don't
you agree? Don't you believe that honor plays a role
in politics? You think we are romantics, don't you?
Perhaps we are. And why not? In any event, we are
militants. In a word, then, we agreed to the emplace-
ment of the missiles. And I might add here that for us
Cubans it didn't really make so much difference
whether we died by conventional bombing or a hydro-
gen bomb. Nevertheless, we were gambling with
peace of the world. The United States was the one
to jeopardize the peace of mankind by using the threat
of war to stifle revolutions.
the
"And so in June, 1962, my brother Raoul and Che
Guevara went to Moscow to discuss ways and means
of installing the missiles. The convoy arrived by sea in
three weeks. The United States was able to find out
that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it
took them two months to discover that these weapons
were guided missiles. Two months. . . in other words,
longer than we had calculated. Because, of course, we
were seeking intimidation, not aggression."
Alliance for Progress
The conversation now turned to the Alliance for Prog-
ress. "In a way," Castro said, "it was a good idea, it
marked
progress of a
a sort. Even if it can be said that it
was overdue, timid, conceived on the spur of the
moment, under constraint... despite all that I am will-
ing to agree that the idea inconstituted an effort
to adapt to the extraordinarily rapid course of events in
Latin America. Such as, for example, what we read in
he papers this morning - did you see the news? That
Argentina is nationalizing the oil industry? The Argen-
tine government! Do you realize what that means? This
will cause more commotion on the New York stock
exchange than Castroism! The Catholic and military.
conservatives of Argentina, the factions most closely
linked with American interests! There is talk of na-
tionalization of industries there, of agrarian reform
there... well and good! If the Alliance for Progress
provokes these developments, then it's not doing so
badly; all these things are consonant with the aspira-
tions of the people. I can look back to the days of
Eisenhower, or rather of Nixon, and recall the furore
which broke out when the United States and Cuba to-
gether decreed an agrarian reform which was to apply,
mark this well, only to landowners of over 200,000
hectares! Yes, 200,000! Yet the reaction of the trusts
was terrible at that time. Nowadays, in the other Latin
American countries, because the Communist banner is
used as a bogeyman, the reaction of the American
trusts is shrewder. They are going to choose strawmen,
so as to rule indirectly. But there will be difficulties.
1
"This is why Kennedy's good ideas aren't going to
yield any results. It is very easy to understand and at
this point he surely is aware of this because, as I told
you, he is a realist. For years and years American policy
not the government, but the trusts and the Pentagon
- has supported the Latin American oligarchies. All the
prestige, the dollars, and the power was held by a class
which Kennedy himself has described in speaking of
Batista. Suddenly a President arrives on the scene who
tries to support the interests of another class (which
has no access to any of the levers of power) to give the
various Latin American countries the impression that
the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators,
and so there is no more need to start Castro-type revo-
lutions. What happens then? The trusts see that their
interests are being a little compromised (just barely,
. but still compromised); the Pentagon thinks the strate-
gic bases are in danger; the powerful oligarchies in all
the Latin American countries alert their American
friends; they sabotage the new policy; and in short,
Kennedy has everyone against him. The few liberal or
allegedly liberal presidents who were chosen as instru-
ments of the new policy are swept out of office, like
Bosch in Santo Domingo, or else they are transformed.
Betancourt, for example, was not a Batista; now he
has become one.
"In view of all these things, how can the American
government seriously believe that Cuban subversion is
at the root of explosions taking place all over the
South American continent? In Venezuela, for example,
are you familiar with the situation there? Do you think
the Venezuelans need us to understand what's going
on in their country? Do you think we don't have
enough problems of our own? Right now I ask only
one thing: Leave us in peace to better our country's
economic situation, to put our planning into effect, to

educate our young compañeros. This doesn't mean we
do not feel solidarity toward nations that are struggling
and suffering, like the Venezuelan people. But it is up
to those nations to decide what they want, and if they
choose other regimes than ours, this isn't our business."
"We Have Always Lived with Danger"
. I asked Fidel where is this all going to end? How will
the situation develop? Even if the United States uses
against you what you call the alibi of Communism, it
still remains true that you have chosen Communism,
that your economy and your security depend on the
Soviet Union, and that even if you have no ulterior mo-
tives in this association, still the United States considers
that you are part of an international strategy, that you
constitute a Soviet base in a world where peace depends
on mutual respect for a tacit division of zones of in-
fluence.
"I don't want to discuss our ties with the Soviet
Union," Fidel Castro cut me short. "I find this indecent.
We have none but feelings of fraternity and profound,
total gratitude toward the USSR. The Russians are
making extraordinary efforts on our behalf, efforts
which sometimes cost them dear. But we have our own
policies which are perhaps not always the same (we
have proved this!) as those of the USSR. I refuse to
dwell on this point, because asking me to say that I am
not a pawn on the Soviet chessis something like
asking a woman to shout aloud in the public square
that she is not a prostitute.
"If the United States, sees the problem as you have
posed it, then you are right, there is no way out. But
who is the loser in the last analysis? They have tried
everything against us, everything, absolutely every-
thing, and we are still alive and getting better day by
day; we are still standing upright, and we plan to cele-
brate with greater festivities than usual, on January 1,
1964, the fifth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution!
The United States' policy of isolating us economically
is less effective with each passing day; we are increas-
ing our trade with the rest of the world. Even with '
Spain! We have just sold a shipment of 300,000 tons
of sugar to the Spaniards. Far from discouraging us,
the blockade is maintaining the revolutionary atmos-
phere we need to stiffen the country's backbone. Are we
in danger? We have always lived with danger. To say
nothing of the fact that you have no idea how many
friends one discovers in the world when one is perse-
cuted by the United StaN truly, for all these
reasons, we are not suppliants, we ask nothing. I'll
tell you something else: since the rupture and the
blockade, we have forgotten the United States. We feel
neither hatred nor resentment any more, we simply
don't think about the US. When I think of the problems
Public
.j
which diplomatic relations with the United States
would pose! The Swiss Ambassador representing the
US at present. I prefer to do business with him than
with 200 members of an Embassy among whom surely
some spies would be spotted.
"I have just talked to you as a Cuban revolutionary.
But I should also speak to you as a peace lover, and
from this viewpoint I believe the United States is too
important a country not to have an influence on world
peace. I cannot help hoping, therefore, that a leader
will come to the fore in North America (why not Ken-
nedy, there are things in his favor!), who will be willing
to brave unpopularity, fight the trusts, tell the truth
and, most important, let the various nations act as
they see fit. I ask nothing: neither dollars, nor assist-
ance, nor diplomats, nor bankers, nor military men --
nothing but peace, and to be accepted as we are! We
are socialists, the United States is a capitalist nation,
the Latin American countries will choose what they
want. All the same, at a time when the United States
is selling wheat to the Russians, Canada is trading with
China, de Gaulle respects Ben Bella, why should it be
impossible to make the Americans understand that
socialism leads, not to hostility toward them, but to co-
existence? Why am I not Tito or Sekou Touré? Because
the Russians have never done us any injury such as
the Yugoslavians and the Guineans have complained
of in the past, and because the Americans have never
given us any of the benefits for which these two nations
congratulate themselves today.
"As to this matter of fearing Soviet intentions in
Latin America through Cuba's, subversive activities,
this is just attributing to others one's own desire to
dominate. You said yourself just a little while ago that
the Russians have had enough of their Cuban involve-
ment. Economically this is obvious. This is why, speak-
ing from a military viewpoint, it is better not to force
nations to turn to the Russians for help. Really, it
seems to me that a man like Kennedy is capable of
seeing that it is not in the United States' interest to
pursue a policy which can lead only to a stalemate. So
far as we are concerned, everything can be restored to
normalcy on the basis of mutual respect of sover-
eignty."
In conclusion, Fidel Castro said to me: "Since you
are going to see Kennedy again, be an emissary of
peace, despite everything. I want to make myself clear:
I don't want anything, I don't expect anything, and
as a revolutionary the present situation does not dis-
please me. But as a man and as a statesmen, it is my
duty to indicate what the bases for understanding
could be."
All this was said two days before President Ken-
nedy's death.

MEMO to Boonstra, co to COS from LEGAT; Subject; OSWALD It is to be noted that the White
House was in receipt of a paper entitled "Possible Psychological Motivations in the Assassina-
tion of Pres. Kennedy" written by Jose I. LASAGA of Miami, Fla. This speculative paper attempted
to establish that the motivation of OSWALD in the assassination of Pres K. was Fidel CASTRO
or a CASTRO agent and that OSWALD was motivated during his trip to Mexi between 27 Salt and
2 Oct 63. The paper alleged that OSWALD held an extended interview with the Cuban Amb in
Mexi whom he met in a restaurant on the outskirts of Mexi from which restaurant they both
later left in the Amb's car for a talk without being overheard./ Source of this latter info
was alleged to be Salvador DIAZ Verson. This individual was interviewed at Miami. He stated
that while in Mexi 29-29 Nov 63 attending the Congress of the International Federation of
Professional Newspaper Organizations, he was at the offices of the newspaper Excelsior on
the night of 25 Nov 63. There he learned through the Mexi press that the Maxi gov had arrested

The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964)
contained the following: [OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)
"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve
the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.
Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and
stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was
being put on notice and should do everything in its power to
ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-
take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the
matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law
enforcement.
r
Mr. McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same
information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum "reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate
leading Cuban government leaders. This memo apparently had
been sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General.
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's memo contains the following:
"ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we
should take to establish the credibility of the report; also
communicate with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also I should
call the Attorney General personally."
The official minutes of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee
meeting (dated July 31, 1964) (referred to in 1967 IG report)
contain no mention of assassination or even of Cuba.
Mr. McCone's personal memorandum (dated July 31, 1964) had
only the following reference to Cuba:
"Proposed infiltration/exfiltration operations into Cuba for
August were approved and the July operations were noted."

Dear Mr. Wilson:
Re:

notice of charges
Before exercising my right to a freedom of information request for copies
of any and all available ( in accordance with the declassification processes
stipulated in Executive Order 11652 and its amendment of January 1974 ) files
of records and documents, both computerized and manual apposite of me and my
activities under my present and former names and pseudonyms, I hereby request
the complete and final estimate of charges for search and duplication services.
As regards the charges for these services, two matters may be worthy of
consideration. The first of them is that, given the proper access codes, the
execution of a computer search is neither difficult nor costly. And the second
is that in light of the controversial nature of my past, a waiver or reduction
of charges may conduce to the furtherance of the public interest. I therefore
respectfully request that these factors be considered in the making of a decision.
as to the cost of services.
In compliance with your request for identity verification ( pursuant to
provisions of the 1974 Privacy Act, section 552, subsections b and d ) I
hereby swear before a notery public as to my name and former names, my present
address, my date as well as place of birth, and my citizenship. Thanking you

Just as Secret Service men reacted instinctively, rushing to protect the
presidential party, reporters reacted instinctively to get the news-sketchy
as it was at first-to the world. United Press International's Merriman

his frantic rush to call the Dallas UPI bureau. Reproduced here is the result
of Smith's first efforts-the actual Teletype copy that almost immediately
clacked out of hundreds of UPI machines in newsrooms, radio and

DECEMBER 7, 1963
once more on Kennedy, and each time I eulogized the
intellectual qualities of the assassinated President, I
awakened the keenest interest in him.
The Cubans have lived with the United States in
that cruel intimacy so familiar to me of the colonized
with their colonizers. Nevertheless, it was an intimacy.
In that very sective city of Havana to which we re-
turned in the evening, where the luminous signboards
with Marxist slogans have replaced the Coca Cola and
toothpaste billboards, in the midst of Soviet exhibits
and Czechoslovakian trucks, a certain American emo-
tion vibrated in the atmosphere, compounded of re-
sentment, of concern, of anxiety, yet also, in spite of
everything, of a mysterious almost imperceptible rap-
prochement. After all, this American President was able
to reach accord with our Russian friends during his
lifetime, said a young Cuban Pellectual to me as I was
taking my leave. It was almost as though he were apolo-
gizing for not rejoicing at the assassination.
JEAN DANIEL
ROMANS
"Robert Frost wrote 50 years ago, 'nothing is true except as a man or men
adhere to it - to live for it, to spend themselves on it, to die for it. We
need this spirit even more than money or institutions or agreements."
- JOHN F. KENNEDY, November 18, 1963
By Saturday night, even the television seemed worn
out by attempt and failure and ceased to comment and
gave over to a succession of photographs of the col-
imns and the windows and the corners of the White
House and of the shadows of the great Lincoln_head
in Springfield and to a voice reciting "Oh, Captain,
My Captain." It is to be, then, the grand style. But the
ship has not weathered every storm; Mr. Kennedy is
not Abraham Lincoln; not because he is more or less,
but because he is a remembered physical presence and
Mr. Lincoln an image of the plastic arts. One's own
time is personal, not historical. Just how long will it be
before many of us will want to read a book about the
day Mr. Kennedy was shot?
The news of the President's assassination was given
by a taxi driver to three gentlemen as they left a hotel
on Arlington Street in Boston. They turned right
around and hurried back inside to attend to their in-
vestments. Packed with students and businessmen a
shuttle plane from Boston to Washington waited for
permission to take off when the captain came on the
intercom: "Folks, up here on the flight deck we've been
listening to the news and the President is dead." There
was only time to hear one woman say, "How dread-
ful" before three men went back to discussing plan
specifications. A college student reading Agamemnon
pa to visible attention. One of his notes read, "love-
ine." The plane took off, the stewardess collected
the money and started to serve drinks. Then the cap-
tain was back again. They had been listening to more
news, that is trying to listen to news because their
real job was to hear flight control. There had been a
gun battle in Dallas; a patrolman was killed; the police
had taken a man in vie theater. Vice President
Johnson was now the President. The talk of business
went on through this, and stopped only when the
tain again interrupted to say that the new President had
cap-
been sworn in aboard an aircraft. A few laughed.
They ask too much of us when they ask us to act up
to the grand style. We are not an emotionally affluent
people. And yet some of us always complained that
Mr. Kennedy did not seem quite emotionally commit-
ted enough. But now someone remembered with special
affection a moment late in the 1960 campaign. Mr.
Kennedy was in a motorcade and the Democratic gov-
ernor who was with him said how wonderful it was to
feel the love with which these crowds pressed forward
to feel the touch of their candidate. "Oh, dry up," Mr..
Kennedy said. It seemed now somehow a special grace
in him that he used only the real in emotion and ab-
stained from fabricating the expected. He had too much
respect for the grand style to counterfeit it; how much
truer to him might we have been if we had come down
in scale and if the many of us who must have remem-
bered the lines from Cymbeline had thought them
proper to speak
"Fear no more the heat of the sun/Nor the furious
winter's rages.

how many Presidents have been assassinated? Four
This is most disturbing! In Cuba, only one has been
assassinated. You know, when we were hiding out in
the Sierra there were some (not in my group, in an-
other) who wanted to kill Batista. They thought they
could do away with a regime by decapitating it. I have
always been violently opposed to such methods. First
of all from the viewpoint of political self-interest, be-
cause so far as Cuba is concerned, if Batista had been
killed he would have been replaced by some military
figure who would have tried to make the revolutionists
pay for the martyrdom of the dictator. But I was also
opposed to it on personal grounds; assassination is
repellent to me."
The broadcasts were now resumed. One reporter
felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy
was having in getting rid of her bloodstained stockings.
Fidel exploded: "What sort of a mind is this!" He re-
peated the remark several times: "What sort of a
mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations
after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin
Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it
mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes de-
cency, dignity, respect. There are even street urchins
who behave like kings in the face of death. Incidentally,
this reminds me of something else: if you write all
those things I told you day against Kennedy's
policy, don't use his name now; speak instead of the
policy of the United States government./
Toward 5 o'clock, Fidel Castro declared that since
there was nothing we could do to alter the tragedy, we
must try to put our time to good use in spite of it. He
wanted to accompany me in person on a visit to a
granja de pueblo (state farm), where he had been en-
gaging in some experiments. His present obsession is
agriculture. He reads nothing but agronomical studies
and reports. He dwells lyrically on the soil, fertilizers, .
and the possibilities which will give Cuba, enough
sugar cane by 1970 to achieve economic independence.
"Didn't I. Tell You"
We went by car, with the radio on. The Dallas
police were now hot on the trail of the assassin. He
is a Russian spy, says the news commentator.. Five
minutes later, correction: he is a spy married to a
Russian. Fidel said: "There, didn't I tell you; it'll be
_myturn next." Buty. The next word was: the
assassin is a Marxist deserter. Then the word came
through, in effect, that the assassin was a young man
who was a member of the "Fair Play for Cuba Com-
mittee," that he was an admirer of Fidel Castro. Fidel
declared: "If they had had proof, they would have said
-
he was
an agent, an accomplice, a hired killer. In
saying simply that he is an admiss, this is just to try
and make an association in people's minds between the
name of Castro and the emotion awakened by the
assassination. This is a publicity method, a propaganda
device. It's terrible. But you know, I'm sure this will
all soon blow over. There are too many competing
policies in the United States for any single one to be
able to impose itself universally for very long."
We arrived at the granja de pueblo, where the farm-
ers welcomed Fidel. At that very moment, a speaker
announced over the radio that it was now known that
the assassin is a "pro-Castro Marxist." One commen-
tator followed another; the remarks became increas-
ingly emotional, increasingly aggressive. Fidel then
excused himself: "We shall have to give up the visit
to the farm." We went on toward Matanzas from where
he
way
he could telephone President Dorticos On the
had questions: "Who is Lyndon Johnson? What is his
reputation? What were his relations with Kennedy?
With Khrushchevy? What was his position at the time of
the attempted invasion of Cuba?" Finally and most
important of all: "What authority does he exercise
over the CIA?" Then abruptly he looked at his watch,
saw that it would be half an hour before we reached
Matanzas and, practically on the spot, he dropped off to
sleep.
After Matanzas, where he must have decreed a state
of alert, we returned to Varadero for dinner. Quoting
the words spoken to him by a woman shortly before,
he said to me that it was an irony of history for the
Cubans, in the situation to which they had been re-
duced by the blockade, to have to mourn the death of
a President of the United States. "After all," he added,
"there are perhaps some people in the world to whom
this news is cause for rejoicing. The South Vietnamese
guerrillas, for example, and also, I would imagine,
Madame Nhu!
I thought of the people of Cuba, accustomed to the
sight of posters like the one depicting the Red Army
with maquis superimposed in front, and the screaming
captions "HALT, MR. KENNEDY! CUBA IS NOT ALONE. . . .
I thought of all those who had been led to associate
their deprivations with the policies of President John
F. Kennedy.
At dinner I was able to take up all my questions.
What had motivated Castro to endanger the peace of
the world with the missiles in Cuba? How dependent
was Cuba on the Soviet Union? Is it not possible to
envisage relations between Cuba and the United States
along the same lines as those between Finland and the
Russians? How was the transition made from the
'humanism of Sierra Maestra to the Marxism-Leninism
of 1961? Fidel Castro, once more in top form, had an
explanation for everything. Then he questioned me

When Castro Heard the News
Havana
It was around 1:72 in the afternoon, Cuban time. We
were having lunch in the living room of the modest
summer residence which Fidel Castro owns on magni-
ficent Varadero Beach, 120 kilometers from Havana.
For at least the tenth time, I was questioning the Cuban
leader on details of the negotiations with Russia before
the missile installations last year. The telephone rang,
a secretary in guerrilla garb announced that Mr. Dor-
ticós, President of the Cuban Republic, had an urgent
communication for the Prime Minister Fidel picked up
the phone and I heard him say: "Como? Un atentado?"
("What's that? An attempted assassination?") He then
turned to us to say that Kennedy had just been struck
down in Dallas. Then he went back to the telephone
and exclaimed in a loud voice "Herido? Muy grape-
mente ("Wounded? Very seriously?")
☑
.
He came back, sat down, and repeated three times
The words: "Es una mala noticia." ("This is bad news.")
He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another call
with further news. He remarked while we waited that
there was an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in Amer-
„can society and that this decd could equally well have
Di he work of a madman or of a terrorist. Perhaps
Vietnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The
second call came through: it was hoped they would be
able to announce that the United States President was
still alive, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel
Castro's immediate reaction was: "If they can, he is
ready re-elected." He pronounced these words with
satisfaction.
This sentence was a sequel to a conversation we had
held on a previous evening and which had turned into
an all-night session. To be precise, it lasted from 10 in
the evening until 4 in the morning. A good part of
the talk revolved about the impressions I recounted
to him of an interview which President Kennedy
granted me this last October 24, and about Fidel
Castro's reactions to these impressions. During this
nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself of
a relentless indictment of US policy, adding that in the
recent past Washington had had ample opportunity
to normalize its relations with Cuba, but that instead
it had tolerated a CIA program of training, equipping
and organizing a counter-revolution. He had told me
that he wasn't in the least fearful of his life, since.
danger was his natural milieu, and if he were to become
1 victim of the United States this would simply en-
his radius of influence in Latin America as well
as throughout the socialist world. He was speaking, he
said, from the viewpoint of the interests of peace in
ha.
TABM
both the American contingats
achieve this goai, a
leader would have to arise in the United States capable
of understanding the explosive realities of Latin Amer-
ica and of meeting them halfway. Then, suddenly, he
had taken a less hostile tack: "Kennedy could still be
this man. He still has the possibility of becoming,
in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the
United States, the leader who may at last understand
that there can be coexistence between capitalists and
socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be
an even greater President than Lincoln. I know, for
example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you
can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all
my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have
assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await
his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible
for everything, but I will say this: he has come to
understand many things over the past few months;
and then too, in the last analysis, I'm convinced that
anyone else would be worse." Then Fidel had added
with a broad and boyish grin: "If you see him again,
you can tell him that I'lling to declare Goldwater
my
friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election!"
This conversation was held on November 19.
Now it was nearly 2 o'clock and we got up from
the table and settled ourselves in front of a radio.
Commandant Vallero, his physician, aide-de-camp, and
intimate friend, was easily able to get the broadcasts
from the NBC network in Miami. As the news came
in, Vallero would translate it for Fidel: Kennedy
wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder
of a policeman; finally the fatal announcement: Presi-
dent Kennedy is dead. Then Fidel stood up and said to
me: "Everything is changed. Everything is going to
change. The United States occupies such a position in
world affairs that the death of a President of that
country affects millions of people in every corner of
the globe. The cold war, relations with Russia, Latin
America, Cuba, the Negro question. . . all will have to
be rethought. I'll tell you one thing: at least Kennedy
was an enemy to whom we had become accustomed.
This is a serious matter, an extremely serious matter."
After the quarter-hour of silence observed by all
the American radio stations, we once more tuned in
on Miami; the silence had only been broken by a re-
broadcasting of the American national anthem. Strange
indeed was the impression made, on hearing this hymn
ring out in the house of Fidel Castro, in the midst of a
circl. of worried faces. "Now," Fidel said, "they will

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach telephoned at 10:50 a. m.
He said he had just completed talking on the telephone with Alexis Johnson,
Deputy Under Secretary of State. Johnson told Katzenbach that insofar as
the investigation of this matter in Mexico is concerned, the State Department
felt this should be coordinated and directed by the FBI. State took the
position that the President's directive to the FBI extended to any activity
outside of the United States, as well as within the country. Insofar as the
Ambassador in Mexico is concerned, Johnson believed he should be kept
informed of any pertinent developments but that the Ambassador should not
(be running the investigation.
1
As to current developments, Katzenbach said that the last thing
he would want would be for the FBI to take Agents away from their investiga-
tive duties to prepare reports. He requested, however, that if there were
any pertinent developments he be orally briefed.

With further reference to his conversation with Alexis Johnson,
Katzenbach said he had been asked whether the State Department should make
a formal inquiry of the Soviet Government for information concerning Oswald
and his wife, particularly as to their activities in Russia. He asked that this
question be considered by the Director, as Katzenbach felt his views most.
important.
h
In thinking about the matter himself, Katzenbach noted if we
did not ask the Soviets for information there would be no answer should the
question of Oswald's stay in Russia be raised, other than to admit we had
made no inquiry. On the other hand, he observed that we could not place
any reliance on anything the Soviets said.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont!
following recommendations are submitted with reference to the points
raised by Mr. Katzenbach:
1. Insofar as making a formal approach to the Soviet Government,
we believe this undesirable. Such a formal request from the United States
will enable the Russians to put out an official statement entirely favorable
to them. The United States will have to accet this, since it is in response
to our formal request, and we won't be in a position to disprove it. The
State Department has responsibility here and we should not dictate the
position they are to take, but our views should be stated.
2. In connection with the investigation in Mexico, it is
recommended Katzenbach be informed that the State Department and
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have jurisdiction in dealing with foreign
governments and in getting investigative results and intelligence coverage
abroad; that while we are cooperating fully with State and CIA in Mexico,
the responsibility in this matter should rest with State and CIA.
1
If approved, Katzenbach will be so advised.

The Honorable Otis Pike; Chairman
House Select Committee on Intelligence,
Rayburn House Office Building,
Washington, D. C. 20515
Dear Congressman Pike:
Congratulations on your Committee's great service to the American elec-
torate in removing some of the mask of secrecy from the domestic covert
operations and funding of the CIA. Secrecy protected counterproductive
and indefensible covert operations for twenty-seven Mars. The light
of exposure and cleansing is now enhancing our countigis security. The
publishing of your excellent report over CIA and White House objections
is an act of courage the electorate will soon appreciate.
Reliance, however, by any Congressional committee on tandouts from the
CIA itself, is like an investigative reporter compiling his story from
government press releases. Neither is doing the job # employer paid:
it to do.
Finding the hidden CIA budgets for three or four times the billions of
dollars admitted to the electorate is a commendable achievement. But
what would your investigators have achieved if a law was already in
force imposing criminal penalties upon CIA employees to leaked infor-
mation to you? The CIA proposed secrecy law is a blacail weapon.
Intelligence, money and secrecy combing to constitute autocratic power
in our society. The Congress enjoys no intelligence service of its
own. It enjoys no offective control over sponding of funds hidden in
the budgets of non-CIA departments and agencics. If tourronders to
the doctrine of secrecy it is powerless indeed. To strengthen. Congress'
power I offer you my own counterintelligence service in place. The
sources have been carefully tested and accumulated since 1949.
The problem is, not leaking intelligence out of Committee; it is leaking
independent intelligence into it. Starting exactly one year ago today
I launched penetration offorty with a 19 page report aldressed to
"Chairman and Members, Select Committees on Intelligente Operations.
I hand delivered this report to every committee member's office. My
wife Nancy recorded the date, hour and person deliveret to.
On June 25, 1975 Edward Roeder III of your staff receipted for 103
pages of counterintelligence on CIA. This represented a distillation
of a quarter century of intelligence gathering. CIA control of the
Watergate breakin and coverup and CIA's investigation of my penetration
of their secrets is covered. The application to the U.S. Attornay and
three U. S. Special Prosecutors requesting investigatia and prosecution
of murder of American citizens within the U.S.A. is in your files.
Nevertheless, none of this intelligence leaked to recognition or invos-
tigation within the executive departments or your Committee.

On July 30, 1975 Emily Shoketoff of your staff receipted for a one page
notification distributed to chairmen and members that Anne P. Commandu-
ras, an employes of CIA's domestic assassination office, had been mur-
dered in her apartment house swimming pool by CIA assassin Eugene Hale
Brading.
I now enjoy the additional intelligence that Commanduras was executed
with a CIA dart gun such as that displayed to news cameras by a member
of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The intelligence weapon fires a
sliver coated with shellfish toxin that kills within seconds, dissolves
and leaves no mark. The CIA preserved their shellfish toxin supply in
direct contravention of on order of the President. Your Committee filed
this report without action along with over 200 additional counterintel-
ligence. Is this secrecy that protects national security?
Congressman Pike, you have exposed $10 billion of CIA funding mostly
hidden in another budget. Will you go for more? Then examine the
State Department, Treasury Department, Justice Department, White House
and Congress appropriations. All of these support personnel accepting
orders for covert domestic oporations from CIA.
You have uncovered CIA operations in the media. Investigate police
departments throughout the nation funded by LEAA that are responsive to
CIA ordors. In the Fairfax County, Virginia, police department alono
a CIA assassin has twice employed the badge of the department as cover
to gain entrance to domiciles to perform executions.
I again commend your Committee for resisting the pressure for secrecy
in publishing your report. I deplore your resistance to the leaking
of intelligence into your Committoo. The latter confines your Com-
mittee's intelligence to official and unofficial leaking channels of
the CIA. Please concede that there are other citizens as concerned
for the security of America as you are.
I respectfully request opportunity to confer with you, Congressman Pike,
or with your capable, diligent and honest staff chief, A. Searle Field.
I want to assist your Committee in recommending rezodial legislation
based upon 27 years of defining the problem,
Respectfully submitted,

Abraham Ribicoff and to

Dear Mr. Heacock:
COMMITTEE ON
GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510
March 8, 1976
2334- HIJ RL.
Falls Church, l'a, 22043
TEL. (103) 534-397.5
Thank you for writing to me regarding your knowledge of
I understand
the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency.
that you have discussed these questions at length with members
of the Committee staff.
On March 1 the Committee reported S. Res. 400 creating
a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities. The legislation
which was before us concerned only the establishment of a new
congressional committee; it did not involve revisions that would
significantly modify the structure or the powers of the CIA it-
self. The Committee has not been authorized to hire additional
staff personnel for the purpose of this legislation. Further-
more, we were under instructions from the Senate to report out a.
formal recommendation in the form of legislation by March 1.
I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you
have made because, if true, they represent grave examples of
corruption and criminality. It is my hope and intent that the
new committee created by the legislation we are considering,
once it is established, will have the jurisdiction and the re-
sources to explore the kind of issues which you raise.
I assure you that the entirety of the information you
have submitted to my committee will be made available to the
new Congressional oversight committee.
I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern-
ment Operations Committee which prevent us from undertaking the
investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material
you submitted to the new committee as soon as it is established...
For your information, I am enclosing a copy of S. Res.
400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure.
Sincerely,
Cake Ribia

Committee on Government Operations,

20510
Dear Scnator Ribicoff:
January 28, 1976
Destiny has chosen you the second time in seven years to chair à com-
mittee with capability of establishing legislative remedies to prevent
domestic and foreign assassinations, huge corruption within military
supply streams, multi billion dollar currency manipulation and massive
intervention of the CIA in domestic covert operations.
On or about March 6, 1959 you were the acting chairman of the Permanent
Investigations Subcommittee that heard Cornelius Hawkridge, my witness,
describe a multi billion dollar currency manipulation racket in South
Vietnam. Carmine Bellino, staff investigator, prevented Hawkridge from.
also testifying about truck convoys of stolen military arms and supplies
that he observed heading toward the Cambodia border, The "fence" for
these stolen arms was the fabulous Soviet KGB agent Jarques Iong, dos-
cribed by starf in your hearings to be a more Vistamoso commisuary
clork. The organized crime vendors of the stolen goods reached into
your Committee in Carvino Bellino to protect their lucrative racket.
Hawkridge later wrote you a letter covering this deficiency in testi-
mony. He pointed out the sale of aras generated funds used in cur-
rency mɔnipulation.
I aided the crippled Hawkridge aboard his flight at Seattle. Your Com-
mittos provided an ambulance to meet him for it was less than two
months since he survived an assassination attempt that killed his wife.
The Soviet KGB let a contract with organized crime's CEA assassination
facilities to kill them. The KGB considered Hawkridge a defector.
William S. Wood, alias Willian Poxley, CIA alias Hillice Harvey and
double agont for KGB fingered Hawkridge and his wife Aigola, a "baby
sitter" agent for West German and CIA intelligence. In the contrived
truck-car "accident" Hawkridge was crippled for life.
I met with CIA's Harvey as Boxley in November, 1968, in New Orleans
pursuant to my counterintelligence investigations. Harvey, witness
before the Sonata Intelligence Committee, has admitted his role as
organizer of the ZR/RIFLES Executive Action assassination capability
and his contacts with John Rosselli and San Giancana of organized crimo
to implement that capability. Harvey incorrectly jumped to the conclu-
sion for the KGB that Hawkridge was a cooperative sourts of much of my
accurate counterintelligence on KGB.
Hawkridge had precipitated your investigation by appealing to a Treasury
official. The official prevailed upon Senator John McClellan, then

United States Senato,

Washington, D. C. 20510
Dear Senator Church:
January 28, 1976
Ref: My lettor 11/20/71+
& encl. to Son. Weikor
forwarded & acknowledged
your letter li/7/75; your
acknowledgement data
5/5/75; my letter 7/11/75.
I commend the diligent efforts of you, the members and the staff in produc-
ing and especially in publishing the Committee's report on "Alleged Assa63-
ination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders."
Nevertheless, I must advise you that over 200 pages of counterintelligence
on domestic and foreign assassinations of the CIA I have provided or mado
available to staff and members has been disregarded or deliberately with -
held from members.
Consequently, as members are preparing to sign a final report, it is timely
to list some of the disastrous errors of the interim report. The errors
are the result of intentional misrepresentation and deceit of the Congress
and the American electorate by the CIA, its directors and employees.
(1) The ZR/RIFLE Executive Action program begun in 1960, headed by Wil-
liam Harvey, was designed as a domestic assassination capability.
(2) Under the direct planning and implementation of Harvey, a number of
domestic and foreign assassinations were executed.
(3) Harvey's real name is William S. Wood, alias William Boxley, alias
W. J. Wood. His assassinations in USA I have already reported.
(4) Among foreign assassinations with participation by Wood's domestic
team members on foreign duty are those of Lumumba and Trujillo.
(5) Orders passed by CIA for execution, rather than exiling or kidnapping,
caused the deaths of Ngo Diem, Ngo Nhu and Rene Schneider.
(6) CIA gave the code name WJ/NIN to the organized crime assassination
consultant employed to insure the killing of Patrice Lumumba. His
real name is Michael Genovese, alias Victor Resignio, son of Vito
Genovese, boss of bosses of the Mafia in Atlanta federal prison
until he died. Genovese enjoyed assassination authority independent
of CIA directors delegated by Meyer Lansky, boss of the American
international crime syndicate then. Neither President Eisenhower nor
President Kennedy conferred assassination authority upon CIA.
(7) Genovese, as Victor Resignio, directed an arms and supplies diversion
and currency manipulation racket in South Vietnam in 1966-67 that cost
the Treasury $51.8 billion, Executive Departments' total, not mino.
(8) Wood's crime team member that aided Genovese to assure Lumumba's death
was code named WI/ROGUE. He is Frank Sturgia, Watergate burglar.

Chairman of your Committee, to conduct it. He first exposed the famous
"Prysuneen" account in a New York bank. It was used to convert South
Vietnamese piastors to dollars, most of which ended up in three banks
in the shiekdom of Dubai on the Persian Gulf.
My further investigation beyond the Committee probe, sabotaged by Bel-
lino, established the dollars were used to requisition gold ingots
from the U. S. Treasury at $35 per ounce. These were remelted to con-
venient "taels" or wafers of gold for black market trading for Indo-
china currencies again at huge discounts. The conspirators enjoyed
government facilities for converting piasters to dollars at fantasti-
cally unrealistic official exchange rates. The exchange provided huge
profits to conspirators and huge losses to the Treasury.
This inflation machine is still at work, though at a reduced rate since
the end of the war in Southeast Asia. The entrepreneurs seek greener
pastures where new wars destabilize currencies. Perhaps Angola?
Hawkridge's real name is Cornel Solyom. His intolligence activities
for a decade were traced in a 64 page report in the possession of the
Senate and House Intelligence Committees and your Committee.
Senator Ribicoff, had the activities of CIA-Crime double agent Carmine
Bellino and Hawkridge's testimony been exposed in the public record in
1969, the trauma for you, for your Committee, for the Congress and for
Bollino
the American electorate would have been mercifully softened.
went on to become Chief Investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee.
He covered up the sources of $1,050,000 of so-called political donor
funds I have traced. He went on to instruct CIA agent Alexander But-
terfield in the White House to reveal the existence of the President's
tapes, thereby insuring his downfall.
A file of my letters to Senator Henry Jackson in 1969 were sont by him
Although
to your Committee. The intelligence was suppressed by Bellino,
your Committee published eight volumes of hearings in this investigation,
Hawkridge's vital testimony was deleted. My intelligence was disregarded.
The legislative remedies now being proposed to counter corruption of our
intelligence services can only be made adequate by exposing to public
view the depth of the problem of secrecy. I an alarmed at demands for
secrecy to support CIA covert operations such as those that led our
country into the most counterproductive covert operation in our nation's
history the war in Vietnam. Did the secrecy imposed by Bellino with-
in your Committee advance the security of the United States? Or did it
insure the greatest humiliation of our foreign policy and our armed
forces since the birth of our republic 200 years ago?
I am alarmed that criminal penalties are being proposed for public ser-
vants whose conscience impels them to notify Congress and the public of
irresponsible actions of men infected with the arrogance of power.

am alarmed that no witness has pointed a finger of blame at the Central
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 It is the Magna Charta of CIA's Don-
estic Intelligence Division. This act specifically provided cover for
CIA. It effectively repealed CIA's restriction to foreign operations
intended by Congreas to prevent a police state.
The 1949 act authorized CIA to conceal huge portions of its budget and
personnel within the budgets and personnel roster of domestic agencies
of government. These especially include employees on Capitol Hill,
in the White House, in the Department of Justice, in the Federal Aviation
Administration and in the Civil Aeronautics Board. Until the act is
repealed Congress will remain part of the problem, not part of the
solution.
When Cornelius and Angela Hawkridge were hit by the CIA's domestic
assassins on January 10, 1969 my anger overrode my caution. I wrote
all fifteen members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee February
23, 1969. I demanded that Hawkridge be heard by the Senate. Although
I received no replies, this forced Carmine Bellino's hand and Hawk-
ridge was subpoenaed. The recipients referred some letters to your
Committoc.
Six months earlier my letter of August 14, 1968 to the Foreign Relations
Committed enclosed a 606 page study entitled "Assassinations of the
Industrial State." It concluded with the startling premise I am now
prepared to prove to the Senate:
"It is my firm prediction that when the Foreign Relations.
Committees get to the bottom of the CIA's conspiracy to
usurp Congress' foreign policy authority they will also
have solved the conspiracies behind the continuing
assassinations of the industrial state."
I rely upon your fairness for opportunity to refute the claims of
William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, to testify and to aid
your Committee to draft legislation that will effectively prevent
abuses of power by the government's intelligence agencies.
As an Air Force officer before, during and after World War II, I am
concerned, as I know you are, that our country's security will be pro-
tected. I will testify for more effective legitimate intelligence and
counterintelligence services. Perhaps the most effective testimony I
can give is that which will establish that the CIA has been thoroughly
infiltrated and corrupted by double agents who owe their primary
loyalty to the Soviet KGB.

(9) Sheffield Edwards, witness produced by CIA as its Director of Secur-
ity, was a spurious subaltitution to deceive the Committes and the
American electorate. Recruited from organized crime, CIA coached
him to appear as the Edwards or Colonel Edward who directed the
carly alleged attempts to assassinato Fidel Castro.
The real Edwards who collaborated with organized crime's hit man John
Rosselli, his boss Sam Oiancana and Robert Habeu, agent of Howard
Hughes, oil tool billionaire, was E. Howard Humb, Watergate burglar.
Eduards was Hunt's CIA name. The CIA poisoned Sheffield Edwards
after his appearance to prevent his recall and possible exposure as
a fraud.
(10) John Rosselli accepted assassination orders from nob leader Giancana
who accepted orders in turn from Meyer Lansky.
(11) Committee witness Rosselli was the hit man who shot Giancana with a
special assassination weapon developed by CIA. I led the kidnapping
and execution of Janes Horfa, one time Teamsters' president even
as your hearings progressed.
(12) Witness Robert Mahuc executed the orders of Howard Hughes in contact-
ing Rossolli to implement a domestic assassination capability through
organized crime. Hughes issued orders to assassinte Fromier Ngo
Diem through Richard G. Danner, alias Cil Danner.
Danner precipitated the Hughes order to bug Laurence O'Brien's tole-
phone in the Watergate complex by being caught forwarding a $100,000
payment on President Nixon's San Clemente and Key Biscayne homes for
Hughes to the President's friend, Bebe Rebozo. Hughes suspected a
plot by defector Mahou and O'Brien to blow the eletion for Nixon.
"Gil" Danner was manager of the International Club in Saigon, owned
by the U. S. Embassy. He represented Hughes! interest in the $51.8
billion racket managed by Michael Genovese.
(13) CIA in 1949 established a Domestic Intelligence Division for covert
action within the White House, the Executive Departments, Congress,
political parties and the media.
;
(14) The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 was und as authorization
for CIA to implement domestic covert actions through funding and
personnel of domestic agencies of government. The Intelligence Direc-
torate of CIA is cover for domestic covert actions in the agency itself.
I am sure you will agree that had your staff investigated and confirmed my
counterintelligence during the year it has been available to you, the legis-
lative ramedias recommended by your proliminary report wald have been found
unacceptably weak by Committee, Congress and the American electorate. Please
permit me to meat and serve you with counterintelligence input.

martre nightclub. On 29 November 1955 SIM agents interrogated Dr. Armando CARDENAS
Aranguren, instructor of pathology at the University of Habana, and succeeded
in obtaining an admission from CARDENAS that Juan Pedro CARBO Servia and Rolando
CUBELAS Secades 2 had sought refuge at his house after the assassination of BLANCO
Rico and had remained there approximately three or four days. CARDENAS stated
during interrogation that CARBO had arrived at his house carrying a sub-rechine
gun. On the basis of CARDENAS' admissions, SIN officials are convinced that
CARBO and CUBELAS were the ones who killed BLANCO Rico.
2.
Implication of CARDENAS and CUBELAS resulted from the interception of a cable
by SIM sent from Miami, Florida, by a friend of CUBELAS to Virginia SECADES,³
mother of CUBELAS, in Habana. On 27 November 1956 Virginia SECADES was arrested
by SIM and taken to SIM headquarters for questioning concerning her son's parti-
cipation in the assassination of BLANCO Rico.. SIM agents were unable to obtain
any information from SECADES concerning her son's role in the killing but suc-
ceeded in learning that CARDENAS was a close friend of her son. On 29 November
1956 SIM agents picked up CARDENAS, who, under pressure, admitted that he was
☐ a homosexual, that CUBELAS was his intimate friend, and that he had hidden
CUBELAS and CARBO in his home for about four days. These admissions were made
at SIM headquarters in the presence of Colonel Irenaldo GARCIA Baez, deputy
chief of SIM, Lt. Col. Marcelo TASERNILLA, who was wounded during the shooting.
of BLANCO Rico, and other high SIM officials.
3. Interrogation of CARDENAS failed to reveal the destination of CARBO and CUBELAS
after they left the home of CARDENAS. On the basis of the intercepted cable,
dated 23 November 1956, however, SIM officials believe that CARGO and CUBELAS
fled to, the United States by ship, since both possessed visas to the United
States which were still valid. 4 CARBO and CUBELAS are believed to be in Miami
at the present time.

4. SIM has transmitted the results of interrogation of SECADES and CARDENAS to
President Fulgencio BATISTA, but the latter's reaction to these new develop-
ments is not known. Further action by the Cuban-authorities is complicated
by the fact that the Government's main witness, CARDENAS, is of dubious re-
liability, because of his homosexuality. CARDENAS is also reported to be
the doctor of the family of Santiago VERDEJA Neyra, Minister of Defense, who
vouched for him when he was arrested by SIM.
Field Comments:
1. Office files contain no previous record of CARDENAS in connection with
anti-BATISTA activities. A Dr. Armando CARDENAS was listed in Hov (defunct
newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party), issue of 22 April 1949, as one
of the persons who sent greetings to the World Congress of Peace Partisans,
scheduled to begin in Paris on 20 April 1949.
2. Both CARBO and CUBELAS have been the subjects in the past of denunciations
and arrests by the Cuban authorities as a result of their anti-BATISTA
activities. They were accused in August 1955 by Colonel Orlando PIEDRA,
chief of the Department of Investigations, of having fled from the police
from the site of an arms cache. In February 1956 CUBELAS was arrested and
tried on charges of participating in student disorders, according to articles
which appeared in local newspapers on 15 March 1955 and 1 April 1956. CARBO
was denounced by the Cuban police as one of BLANCO Rico's killers immediately
after the shooting incident at the Montmartre nightclub.
3. Office files contain no previous record of Virginia SECADES, Habana news-
papers of 29 November 1956 carried an item in which the University of Habana
Student Federation protested against the detention of Virginia SECADES by
SIM.
4. Files of the Consular Section, United States Embassy, Habana, revealed
that CARBO was issued a tourist visa on 3 June 1954 and that CUBELAS re-
ceived a similar visa on 15 October 1954. The files do not indicate
whether these visas were valid for a single entry or multiple entries, but
they could still be valid, on the basis of the dates of issue.

5.
Police officials announced immediately after the assassination of BLANCO
Rico that they had information as to the identity of the two assassins,

the latter. The police have failed to find the killers, however, and re-

possible that CARDENAS may have been forced by SIM interrogators to make
statements implicating CARBO and CUBELAS which were not altogether true.
6. The local press and radio reported on 29 and 30 November 1956 that United
States authorities were looking in New Orleans for two Cubans who were sus-
pected of being the killers of BLANCO Rico. They were identified by name as
Rolando CUBELAS Secades and Guillermo GARCIA Riestra. The latter, while a
student at the University of Habana, was accused of having participated in
an attempt against the life of Rolando MASFERRER in September 1949, accord-
ing to office files.
7.
Avance, Habana-afternoon newspaper, published the official SIM version of
CARDERAS' arrest on 30 November 1956; other newspapers carried it subse-
quently. It contained substantially the same information as reported
above, but it also implicated among others, former president Carlos PRIO Socarras
in the assassination of BLANCO Rico, alleging that PRIO had helped CARBO
and CUBELAS to escape from Cuba.

The parent

organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu-
tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regime
which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move-
ment which contributed greatly to the collapse of the Batista regime.
The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR
power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regime without
their participation. The original DR became Communist controlled and
directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an
entity used by the CIA as a unilateral asset in pursuing U.S. policy
objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally
terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and
material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed
or turned over the JMWAVE Station. The DRE was expected to continue as
an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.
3. The DRE files of both Station JMWAVE and Headquarters that are
available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear
in these files. WAVE cable 8049 (in 66782) of 22 November 1963, states

These entity files were independent of the JMWAVE Station files. Had
Station JMWAVE referred to its files in WAVE 8049 the cable would have
been worded, "according AlSPELL Station files." The file of AMHINT-53,
a former executive of the DRE, has also been reviewed and no reference
to Oswald was found. The file number which appears on WAVE 8049 is no
longer in use and the contents of this former file were transferred
into Oswald's and other 201 files by the CI Staff. A tape of the radio

Staff.
4. Re question number 3 (b) of reference: We have been 'unable to
determine if Station JMWAVE was instructed to review its files for
information on Oswald. For many years the CI Staff has been the focal
point for the collation of any and all information concerning Oswald
and if the JMWAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on
Oswald such information should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.

Dear Mr. Sturgis:
This is to acknowledge receipt by the FBI on
March 23, 1976, of your Freedom of Information-Privacy
Acts (FOIPA) request dated March 13, 1976.
Based on the limited information you provided,
it is not possible to make an accurate search of our
records. To insure an accurate search of our records,
please furnish your complete name, date and place of
birth, prior addresses, employments and any specific data
that would permit us to locate the documents you seek.
An exceedingly heavy volume of FOIPA requests
has been received these past few months. Additionally,
court deadlines involving certain historical cases of
considerable scope have been imposed upon the FBI. Despite
successive expansions of our staff responsible for FOIPA
matters, substantial delays in processing requests continue.
Since January 1, 1975, the FBI has received
a total of 17,204 FOIPA requests. Of these, our present
backlog is 6,782. In an effort to deal fairly with any.
request requiring the retrieval, processing and duplication
of documents, each request is being handled in chronological
order based on the date of receipt. Please be assured
that your request is being handled as equitably as possible
and that all documents which can be released will be made
available at the earliest possible date.

MEMORANDUM
TO:
Jim Johnston Paul Wallach
i
FROM:
Dan Dwyer
DATE:
SUBJ:
January 21, 1976
CIA Briefing with Raymond Rocca Regarding Oswald
Early in our investigation of CIA's handling of the Oswald case,
Raymond Rocca briefed Wallach, Dwyer and Greissing on November 11 and
13, 1975. Some of Rocco's comments merit consideration in light of
our present knowledge of the case.
1.
Opening of 201
Rocca explained that Oswald's 201 was opened by Betty Egerter::
from a list of American defectors 1958-1960 from the State Department.
2.
Status of 201, 11/22/63
Rocca explained that on November 22, 1963 all documents in the
Oswald 201 were originated by other agencies; Mexico City cable
traffic was not included in the 201 because it was routed through
a compartmentalized channel and therefore would not be circulated
via the 201.
3.
Oswald's Defection to USSR
With regard to Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, Rocca
said Oswald would have been of interest to the military and the FBI
and that CIA was only interested in the "information" aspect of the
case. Rocca could not cite any, example of a U.S. citizen defecting
on behalf of any interest of the U.S. government.
With regard to the "Hoover" memorandum of June 3, 1960 raising
the possibility that an imposter could be using Oswald's birth certifi-
cate, Rocca believed Hoover would not have generated it.
Rocca sug-
gested someone at the Bureau who was familiar with Soviet technique
of using birth certificates for illegals Larry McWilliams, Brannigan
or Cregar would have authored the memo. (Rocca could never establish
if, in fact, Oswald took his birth certificate with him to the Soviet
Union.) Rocca commented that the Bureau memo, sent to State and ONI,
should have been forwarded to CIA by State, but never was.
In Rocca's determination, Oswald was the only American defector
who was allowed to stay in Russia following a suicide attempt. Rocca
said that Oswald would have been subjected to one or two assessments
by the KGB.
TOP SECRET
NW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 574

--- Image 157-10014-10242_page_572.jpeg ---
22
Rocca referred to an SB study, directed by Lee Wigren and con-
ducted by Virginia Valpi which compared the Oswald case to other U.S.
defectors and their wives. SB concluded Oswald was not given special
handling by the KGB. Rocca maintains Oswald was given special treat-
ment. He believes Oswald's relationship with the "Red Cross" (from
which Oswald received financial assistance) and the Red Cross' relation-
ship with the KGB should be clarified.
Rocca also finds it peculiar that Marina married Oswald since
Marina's uncle was KGB. Rocca said that Oswald was the only defector
who married someone with a KGB connection of that kind. Rocca said that
the CIA developed this information after the assassination.
Rocca described Minsk as "not an unsensitive section" of Russia
and added that Oswald was the only American defector in Minsk, a white
Russian area.
Rocca commented on Oswald's surprise visit to the American Em-
bassy in Moscow by saying that "people don't do that kind of thing
in Russia'
Rocca believes Oswald's Soviet diary is bona fide. Rocca ad-
mitted that although there are perceptible changes in the quality
of Oswald's written material, Oswalds' mentality seemed conducive
to periods of attention to thoroughness and detail.
4.
Alleged Debriefing of Oswald
Rocca did not have any knowledge of an alleged debriefing of
Oswald in New York City by the DCD. Rocca said that if a debriefing
report existed, it would have been distributed in 00 series (overt
operations) of the DDI (now DDO). Rocca also noted that a debriefing
report would not have been filed in the Oswald 201. Rocca noted that
a Dr. Froyn (phonetic) supervised DDI records. Rocca also said that
Traveler's Aid was a legitimate charitable organization which had no
ties with the CIA.
5.
Oswald and Mexico City
.
Rocca said that Chief, WH could clarify aspects of technical.
operations on Cuban and Soviet Embassies. Rocca said that David
Phillips organized the technical surveillance..
Although the Cuban Embassy was officially closed on September
28, Rocca found nothing unusual about Oswald's visit there and meeting
Silvi Duran, Cuban consulate employee.
Rocca emphasized that Oswald's activities in Mexico City were
the responsibility of the FBI.

view under odd and difficult circumstances. If he
could be taken at his word, Castro had shed new
light on the Kennedy assassination mystery. I hoped
to learn even more at the formal interview, which
was still pending.
On July 17 I was telephoned at my hotel by Senor
Cordoso, who had tried to arrange the formal in-
terview.
Cordoso said: "I am glad you had the chance
of meeting the Prime Minister. You were very
fortunate."
I agreed and asked when my longer interview.

"Well, it crossed my mind. But I didn't give

we would be blamed - for something we had noth-

"It could have been used as an excuse for an-
other invasion try. In any case, people would have
tried to put it at my door."
Castro started to make his way to the edge of the
sidewalk.
As he did so, he added: "I was not responsible
for Kennedy's death. I will tell you that.
"I think he was killed by U.S. Fascists

"He has a lot of pressing engagements

This was the final decision, and I decided to make
arrangements to leave Cuba. I flew to Mexico City,
where I called at the high-walled Cuban embassy
to see if I could learn more about Oswald's two
visits there.
The grilled double gates were opened by a gate-
keeper to allow in some official-looking diplomatic
car.
I quickly showed him my Press credentials, and
asked if I could see anyone of authority inside the

Possible Oswald-Cuban Connections
Rocca described document gaps in the materials that the Russian
and Cuban governments forwarded to the WC via diplomatic channels.
He described these areas as "open and relevant.
11
Rocca drew attention to Oswald's Marine duty in California in
1958. Basing most of his analysis on testimony of DelGado, Oswald's
sergeant in California, Rocca maintained that Oswald had made contact
with the Cubans at the Cuban Embassy in Los Angeles. Rocca said that
DelGado had to release Oswald from guard duty because someone from Los
Angeles reinitiated contact while Oswald was on duty.
Rocca placed specific emphasis on Castro's "impromptu "comments
to Harker at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana on September 7, 1963.
Rocca viewed Castro's comments as a "message" to American leaders
and said it was a "very important signpost,
Rocca added that the
Mexico City Station brought Castro's comments to Headquarter's atten-
tion on 11/25/63. Rocca also viewed Castro's comments in terms of
Oswald's possible perception of them, since New Orleans Times Picayune
ran the Harker article on September 9, 1963. (This is the line Slawson
adopted: could Oswald have read the piece?).
In regard to the Castro comments (unfortunately my notes are
sketchy here) Rocca refers to a 10/24/63 cable, memo, or letter from.
"Des to Paris." He then refers to an 11/5/63 memo for the record and
said "man never heard from again." Rocca should be asked to clarify
these references.
Rocca briefly outlined Cuban-Russian relations in the early 1960s.
he described 1961 as the "seed time" between Cuba and the USSR. Rocca
said that following the missile crisis, the KGB and DGI began a "pre-
liminary relationship." Rocca mentioned Srotoff (phonetic) and
Alexiev (sic) as being KGB principals involved. Rocca said that when
Castro visited Moscow in June-July 1963, Alexiev and Leonoff served
as liaison between Kruschev and Castro. Rocca referred to an escalation
of Alpha-66 activity (sporadic revolutionary attacks on Cuban ports;
vessels, etc.) in July-August 1963. Rocca places Castro's "warning"
of September 7, 1963 in the context of these activities.
.'
Rocca said that Oswald's activities for the FPCC in New Orleans
were apparently self-motivated. Rocca added, however, that V. T. Lee,
national chairman of the FPCC, visited Cuba in 1964. Rocca noted that
(fnu) Hernandez handled Lee's case and that Hernandez' office was next
to Azcue's, who, according to Duran, argued with Oswald at the Cub an
Embassy in Mexico City. According to Rocca, Hernandez was mentioned
in penetration reports from Guatemala where Hernandez was running two
DGI agents. Rocca outlined these relationships briefly to demonstrate
DGI-FPCC connections. Rocca concluded that the Warren Commission should
have paid more attention to the DGI. Rocca also mentioned that the
CIA picked up a DGI defector named Mugg in April or May of 1964, who
was handled by WH Division.

These were the dramatic words spoken to me by Cuba's Prime Minister Fidel
Castro in Havana on July 15.
...
"Lee Oswald came to the Cuban embassy in Mexico City twice," Castro
went on. "The first time - I was told he wanted to work for us.
"He was asked to explain, but he
wouldn't.
"He wouldn't go into details.
"The second time he said he wanted
to 'free Cuba from American imperial-

"Then he said something like: 'Some-

'Maybe I'll try to do it.'
"This was less than 2 months before the
U.S. President was assassinated.
"The two visits occurred close together,"
Prime Minister Castro told me. "I didn't take
them seriously.".
My hard-won interview took place in the
middle of a cheering, jostling mob on the
sidewalk of La Rampa, the main "show
street" of Cuba's capital, Havana.
Although millions of words
have been written claiming
that Fidel Castro was behind
the Kennedy assassination, no
newsman has been able to se-
cure a personal interview with
the Cuban prime minister for
his views on the slaying of the
U.S. President.
To shed more light on the most
dramatic event of the 20th
Century, The ENQUIRER sent
Comer Clark to Havana for
a face-to-face meeting with
Castro.
And here, for readers of The
ENQUIRER, is the exclusive

David Murphy and Bagley, Chief and Deputy Chief of CI/SB. Rocca
said that Lee Wigren and Virginia Valpi were also involved in
Soviet R&A.

Rockefeller Commission Inquiry
Rocca served as CIA liaison to the Rockefeller Commission
in regard to Warren Commission allegations. Belin and Robert Olsen
were involved in the investigation. Belin wanted Rocca to review
documentation regarding the photo of the unidentified individual
in Mexico City. Belin told Rocca that the Warren Commission was not
clued in on Cuban emigreeissues and Operation MONGOOSE. Rocca de-
veloped the impression that the Rockefeller Commission was looking
into CIA's operations aimed at Castro. Belin asked Rocca for the
!
Castro comments of September 7, 1963. Belin was not aware of the
statements during the Warren Commission. (Slawson, however, was but
only at the conclusion of the WC.).
Rocca also said that Belin is writing another book on Oswald
and the President's assassination.

Oswald, New Orleans, Garrison Case
Rocca said that the CI/R and A stayed on top of the Garrison case
and "summarized overt developments. Rocca identified the analyst
for the Garrison material as Donald Pratt. Rocca said that by NSA
intercepts and associated relationships, the CIA believed Garrison
was operating (unwittingly) under KGB manipulation. (Rocca briefly
described Soviet technique of misinformation. He recalled an inter-
view that Drew Pearson had with Kruschev in Cairo in 1964 or 1965.
Kruschev told Pearson that his "gut feeling" was that American right-
wing extremists and capitalists were responsible for the President's
assassination. Rocca said this typified KGB disinformation.)
'
Rocca characterized Oreste Pena's allegations as "absolute
fabrication. Rocca said CIA files revealed that Clay Shaw was a
contact of the DCD until 1956..
Rocca said that he was never informed in 1962. or 1963 about
a revolutionary training camp around Lake Pontchartrain. He believes
that the GIA did not know of its existence. Rocca said there is evi-
dence that messages from the Lake Pontchartrain camp were going to a
drop in Mexico City.

GPFLOOR Period
GP FLOOR was the crypt used to describe the investigation con-
ducted by CIA following the President's assassination (11/23-1/12-15/63.)
The Mexico City aspect of GPFLOOR was controlled by WH: J. C. King,
Chief; Jack Whiten, Desk Chief, and Win Scott, COS, Mexico City.
said that Whiten would report Mexico City developments to Helms who
would then inform McCone.
9.
End of GP FLOOR: Warren Commission
Rocca
With the formation of the Warren Commission, the GPFLOOR period
ended. Rocca explained that Helms served as the major liaison between
the CIA and WC. Rocca served as chief of research for matters of in-
terest to the WC mostly concerning Oswald's defection to Russia.
Rocca's staff included: Thomas Hall, Arthur Dooley and Paul Hartman.
Hall conducted research on Soviet service in DDO. Dooley followed all
Bureau developments forwarded to CIA. Hartman was responsible for ex-
ploration of overt references and Soviet service." Additionally, Hartman
researched DeMohrenschildt's relationship to the Oswalds.
Rocca reported his research staff's findings to Angleton; Rocca
had no contact with Helms. Rocca explained that he had some liaison
with Slawson of the WC staff. Rocca said that any negotiation between
the CIA and WC was conducted by Helms, Dulles, and Rankin. Rocca said
he had no knowledge of any CIA assassination attempts against Castro.
Rocca emphasized that the FBI was the investigative arm for the
Warren Commission. Rocca said that Sam Papich, Dick O'Niell (sic) and
Jim Hunt were the Bureau personnel involved with the WC.

Anyway, we're now on November 12th, and I went to Miss
Howard's apartment where she said he had set up a phone call to
Havanna with Valao. We never could get through the bad
connections, but she had spoken to him before I arrived and
he had suggested that I come to Marianao from Key West and
talk directly with Fidel Castro, because they wanted to avoid
going through Havanna.

October 21st, I got a call again from Bundy's office asking
me what was new. I said, well the ball is now in the Cuban's
court.
On the 28th, I saw Lochuga again at the UN who said that
Havanna didn't see exactly how a talk would be useful now, but
he would be glad to maintain continuous contact with me anyway.
The 4th of November I briefed Stevenson on these develop-

On December 4th, LaChuga again looked me up at the UN,
said he now had a letter directly from Castro approving the
detailed talks and an agenda. Again, I informed Chase.
He said the decision would take some time now because all
our policies were under review.

Well, that ended my diary in 163. I then went to Kenya
as Ambassador in February of 164. However I do recall that
some time in January I again called Chase and I said, well, if
this thing is going to be continued I would suggest either
John Case or someone on that mission. He said, well, it doesn't
look as though it's going to be continued now because it's an
election year, or whatever the reason was, and anyway we'll keep
it in mind but that it was a dead issue.
The interesting thing, I think in terms of your investiga-
tion is that whatever was going on in terms of assassination
plots, certainly there seemed to be two tracks, because it seems
hard for me to believe that the Executive would be approving this
type of negotiation while other covert operations were happening,
although it could conceivably have happened.

I think your testimony is helpful. Certain inferences
can at least be drawn. But it is very helpful.

that a trip to Cuba which is what LaChuga had suggested would

But he did think the matter was

Instant memorandum also serves to confirm a conversation

and Mr. Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for

portion of which conversation was relayed by Mr. Blackhurst
to Special Agent Thomas J. McNiff. Mr. Blackhurst reported
that during the above conversation Mr. Wallach gave assurances
that should the SSC decide to use the attached memorandum or.
any portions thereof; the material used will not be identified
as having been maintained in Mr. Hoover's O & C files.
In addition to the above, referenced SSC letter of
February 12, 1976, also requested delivery of all material in

items relating to the Warren Commission and to this Bureau's

Documents from late 1960's and early 1961 indicate Maheu
did not implicate CIA initially but instead said he had
been asked by a Los Angeles attorney to arrange investi-
gative work in Las Vegas. Maheu declined to name the
attorney.
Maheu first mentioned CIA connection in an FBI interview
on April 18, 1961 [after the Bay of Pigs] (detailed in an
agent report of April 20, 1961, transmitted by a memo to
Assistant Attorney General on April 25, 1961). He said
he was working with CIA and the Las Vegas bug was ordered
to determine if Sam Giancana was leaking information.
(Maheu did not tell FBI about nature of activities he
undertook for CIA.)

MEMORANDUM
CONFIDENTIAL
COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
Washington, DC 20500
May 21, 1975
To:
File
From:
Mason Cargill
Mc
C-X1-22
Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS
On the afternoon of May 20, 1975, I briefly
examined the Justice Department files on the Kennedy assassi-
nation, ranging from February 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971.
According to Mr. Keeney and his secretary who has reviewed
these files in detail, they contain no memo from any State
Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963. Basically these
files consist of letters from citizens, some referred from
congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination.
Mr. Keeney's secretary referred me to several
entries in these files respecting allegations by people who
claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination.
One claimed to have been a CIA agent. There are also many
letters from assassination "nuts." Other documents relate
to court proceedings to force FBI agents to testify in the
Clay Shaw trial in Louisiana.
One document is an FBI report, dated February 2,
1972, stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the
FBI claiming he had information on the John F. Kennedy
assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in
the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963. Kleist was not
a State Department employee. He appeared to be a free-lance
magazine writer.

Re: Assassination of the President
that before looking at the FBI as to possible "leaks," he should carefully examine his
own house. I told him I was quite thoroughly familiar with the way Guthman and
Rosenthal dealt with the press and that as he well knew the wire service people stayed
'constantly in Guthman's private office. I told him it was quite obvious to me how the
AP had learned that the report had been sent over to the Department.
Katzenbach reiterated that he had no complaints against the FBI. He
stated again that the purpose of his call was to tell me about Senator Russell's feelings.
He added that he had another reason for calling and that was to determine
if we could give him any ideas as to how Warren Olney could be dropped as Chief
Counsel of the Presidential Commission. I told Katzenbach of our feelings concerning
Olney. He stated that he was presently working through Congressman Hale Boggs and
he thought he was going to be successful in getting Olney's name removed from
consideration. He told me that Boggs was very sympathetic.
Katzenbach mentioned that Waggoner Carr, the Texas State Attorney
General, would like very much to see the Director on Friday, 12-6-63. I asked him
what for. He stated that Carr had no particular motive in mind other than to indicate
to the press later on that he had discussed matters with the Director. I told him I could
see no percentage in the Director's seeing Carr, that we were the investigative
agency and that Carr's dealings should be with the Department and the Presidential
Commission. Katzenbach indicated that the White House might think otherwise. He
stated that the President was most anxious for Carr to be given attention in Washington
inasmuch as Carr was running for office next year. I told Katzenbach I knew this,
however, I still felt that the Director should not be injected into this matter.
Katzenbach stated he would attempt to disuade Carr from seeing the Director, however,
Carr was quite persistent.
ACTION:
I
In view of the close friendship which Carr obviously has with the
President, the Director may desire to just shake hands with Carr without sitting down
and discussing facts concerning our report.

While at the offices of the President's Commission on other
\ matters, J. Lee Rankin requested Malley to stop by his office. Mr. Rankin
advised that he desired to make it known that the Bureau had been of tremen-
dous help to the President's Commission, that an extremely large volume of
work had been produced by the Bureau and that the Bureau had been most
cooperative in handling all requests which had been made by the President's
Commission.
- He commented that recently there had been quite an increase in the
number of requests and there was a possibility that there would be many more
additional requests. Mr. Rankin stated this was not intended as a criticism
of the Bureau's work but instead was the following through of the Commis-
sion's desire to complete the Commission's record and leave no unanswered
questions.
4
In this regard, Mr. Rankin went on to say that the Bureau, in.
conducting its investigation, had an extremely difficult and enormous task
to perform and that he as well as other members of the Commission staff had
been amazed at the amount of detailed information which had been developed
by the Bureau in its investigation. He commented that the Commission in
performing its tasks was of necessity making a most minute study of the "
Bureau's work as well as that of other Government agencies with the idea of
picking the investigation to pieces to the extreme degree so that wherever
it was possible to clarify any item, this could be handled while the
Commission was in existence.
Mr. Rankin advised that in connection with the letter which had
just recently been transmitted to the Bureau requesting an explanation con-
cerning information relative to Special Agent James P. Hosty's name being
omitted from a report prepared in the Dallas Office (report of Special Agent
Robert P. Gemberling dated 12/23/63), he wanted the Bureau to know the

Memorandum A. Rosen to A. H. Belmont
Re: THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION
G
The Commission, had noted in reviewing the notebook in question
that Agent Hosty's name appeared in the book along with the office telephone
number and a license number. It had been noted that this information did
not appear in the Dallas investigative report and members of the Commission
wondered why this item did not appear. Mr. Rankin stated that prior to any
question being raised concerning this item, the Bureau in one of its letters
to the Commission (dated 1/27/64) set forth full information for the
Commission's information explaining the appearance of Agent Hosty's name
in the Oswald notebook. As a result of this information being furnished by
the Bureau. the members of the Commission were fully aware that there had
been no effort on the part of the Bureau not to make this information
available. Mr. Rankin stated that after some discussion concerning this
item, the members of the Commission directed Mr. Rankin to request the
Bureau for an explanation so that the record of the Commission would show
the exact circumstances by which this item was omitted from the Dallas
report of 12/23/63 by Special Agent Gemberling.
ACTION:
B
Attached is a letter to J. Lee Rankin setting forth the reasons
why Agent Hosty's name was omitted from the Dallas report of 12/23/63. We
are enclosing for the Commission affidavits from Special Agent Robert P.
Gemberling and John T. Kesler wherein they set forth their explanations in
handling the Mosty entry in Oswald's address book, Both affidavits are
excellent and should satisfy the Commission that our handling of the Hosty
entry was sound.

295-
Out to 11-28-47.-(1626 hrs)- IV asks SILVIA if the American
has been there. SILIVA: says yes, he is here now. IV.- According
to the letters that he showed from the Consulate in Washington he
wants to go to Russia to stay for a long time with his wife who is
Russian. But we have not received the answer from Washington con-
cerning his problem and considering the processing it will take 4
to 5 months. Without that permission of the USSR they have to request.
and better still the visa can't be given here without asking Washington.
But according to this man, he belongs to an organization in favor of
Cuba and he has said that the Cubans can't give him a visa without the
Russian visa and I don't know what to do with him. I have to wait for
the answer from Washington. SILVIA - We have to wait also because his
problem is that he knows no one in Cuba and it's dificult to obtain a
visa in these conditions. He expected to process the visa. He knew it
would take long to process the Russian visa and would wait for it in
Cuba and leave from there.for the USSR. IV. The thing is that if his
wife is now in Washington she will receive the visa for returing to
Russia. She will receive the visa in Washington and having the visa
she can sent it to any place for example here or any other place but
right now she doesn't have it. SILVIA Naturally, and we can't give
him a letter of recommendation because we don't know if his visa will
be approved. IV. - We will only give the visa according to indications
(intructions) SILVIA. Then that is what I will put in my plans.
www
IV.- We can't give him a letter of recommendation either becuase we
don't know him. Please pardon the bother. SILVIA No bother and
thank you very much.-

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press
Washington Post, Tuesday, November 19, 1963, p. A15
th
(AP) Nov. 18 The following is a text of President Kennedy's address
tonight before the Inter-American Press Association:
St
"The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-
ny and corruption of the past had the support of many whose aims and
concepts were noble.
"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.
"The goals proclaimed in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.
"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country
and from all the American countries: It is the fact that a small band
of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-
ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces
beyond the hemisphere. They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-
ism, an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-
tated by external powers to subvert the other American republics. This,
and this alone divides us. As long as this is true nothing is possible.
Without it everything is possible.
Ready and Anxious
"Once this barrier is removed we will be ready and anxious to work
with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few
short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people
throughout the entire hemisphere.
"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-
ises of foreign communism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.
For once Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of.
friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-
tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people.

An Historic Report from Two Capitals
by Jean Daniel
A recent trip to the United States, followed by a journey to Cuba, made it
possible for me to establish a "dialogue" between the late President Kennedy and
Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Since my arrival in Mexico, where this article is
being written, I have been asked whether the impressions I derived from these
interviews could shed any light on the assassination of the President and on
future relations between Lyndon B. Johnson and Castro.
Last week in these pages I answered the first question by describing the re-
actions of Fidel Castro, with whom I was visiting at the time, to John Ken-
nedy's death. Here I shall explore the second question by reconstituting the
Kennedy-Castro dialogue from the viewpoint of one who was a witness to it.
THE AUTHOR
President Kennedy received me at the White House
on Thursday, October 24. My appointment had been
scheduled for 5:30. I waited in the Cabinet Conference
Toem, and at 5:45 the President, following his usual
custom, came to look for me himself so that he could
escort me into his office. He apologized for the delay,
not so much as a courtesy or to flatter me, but to ex-
plain the scheduling of his time, which seemed to be
very strictly organized. As we passed through the small
room where his secretary was working, we caught a
glimpse of Mrs. Kennedy leaving by a French window
on her way to the private garden of the White House.
The President called her back to introduce me.
'It was still Indian summer in Washington. The
weather was very warm, and both the President and
Mrs Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus enhanc-
ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity
which was in rather surprising contrast to the solemnity
of entering these august chambers. The President
(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, speaking with
quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at
times, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al-
most, I would say, completely expressionless) invited
me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which was in
the middle of his office. He sat in a rocking chair op-
posite the sofa. The interview was to last from 20 to 25
minutes, and it was interrupted only by a brief tele-
phone call.
The President immediately asked me how the French
situation was developing. After my reply, he spoke
about General de Gaulle. He talked in a relaxed fashion,
like someone who has at last found solace in indiffer-
ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated.
John Kennedy was a man who liked to get to the heart
of a matter quickly, make decisions even more
rapidly. But this was not possible in dealing with de
Gaulle, who is more difficult to handle than Khru-
shchev. One day, impatient at not understanding the
General's reasoning and intent upon convincing him,
Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct. All in vain. Odd-
ly enough, however, since the recent visit of de Gaulle's
foreign minister, Couve de Murville, to Washington
Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply concerned
about Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had
made up his mind not to worry about them any more.
According to him, it was a waste of time.
"Mr. Couve de Murville and I both verified that we
didn't agree on anything," the President told me. "And
we agreed that such total disagreement was hardly cal-
culated to create a flourishing friendship between two
great Western nations. I came to the conclusion that
General de Gaulle's strategy, which is rather incom-
prehensible to me, requires a certain amount of tension
with the United States. It would seem that only through
this tension is it possible to restore to Europe the desire
to think for itself and renounce its torpid dependence
on American dollar aid and political guidance!”
President Kennedy went on to sum up, with con-
ciseness and vigor, the points of disagreement between
the United States and France. On the subject of Ger-
many, nuclear policy, Europe, the lea of "indepen-
ence," he told me what has since become public

I had discussed his possible testimony before the Committee
with Chief Counsel, Fritz Schwarz, and Staff Director, William
Miller. It is my recollection that we agreed that I should
attempt to contact Giancana for the purposes of interview-
ing him in order to determine whether he would have suffi-
cient information to warrant an appearance before the Commit-
tee as a whole. It is my memory that we did decide that
he was of sufficient importance to be interviewed by the
Staff, i.e., for me to interview him.
During this same period of time, I discussed with
Messrs. Schwarz and Miller whether we should consider
issuing a subpoena for Mr. Giancana while he was in the
hospital. I made this suggestion because of an impression
I had that Giancana was difficult to locate. I should add
that I see absolutely nothing prejudicial or improper or
discourteous in the issuing of a subpoena, but rather
regard a subpoena as a valid method of obtaining testimony
before a Congressional Committee. In any event, my dis-
cussion with Messrs. Schwarz and Miller resulted in a
decision to have me contact Mr. Giancana over the telephone
and offer him an opportunity to appear before the Committee
voluntarily and to have me interview him if he so agreed.
If he did not agree, we would then take it before the Com-

Committee Contact with Sam Giancana
☐☐
To my knowledge the Committee's first contact with Sam
Giancana occurred on June 9, 1974, when Patrick Shea of the
Committee staff received a telephone communication from
Robert Bennett, Assistant District Attorney, Houston, Texas.
It is my information from talking to Mr. Shea that Mr. Bennett.
called the Committee to advise that Sam Giancana was admitted
to the Methodist Hospital, which was located at 6515 Bertner
Street in Houston, Texas. Mr. Bennett's information was that
Giancana was admitted to Room 402 of the Hospital under the
care of a Dr. Debakey. Mr. Bennett also advised that Giancana
was there for a gall bladder removal operation. I believe, al-
though I am not positive, that Bennett also advised that
Giancana was then under surveillance. My recollection at this
time is not clear as to whether Bennett advised as to which
agency or organization had Giancana under surveillance, but my
impression is that it was not the F.B.I.
At about the time of this communication from Bennett, I, as
Committee Counsel, had been attempting to locate Mr. Giancana.

THE
knowledge. He added, however, that France had a
strange way of manifesting its independence, part--
ularly, for example, on the subject of Vietnam and
Cuba. It seemed ironic and irritating to him that the
French Chief Executive was apparently bent on telling
him how the United States should proceed, without
assuming any risks himself. He told me that no one was
more appreciative than he of advice, information, and
even criticism; but that these were all the more valued
if the friends proffering them were themselves com-
mitted to a program of action.
R
I then asked Mr. Kennedy what could be expected
from General de Gaulle's proposed visit to the United
States next February. He replied: "Absolutely nothing."
But he followed this up immediately and with a broad
grin, as though savoring in advance the pleasure of
the impending meeting: "It will be exciting, just the
same. General de Gaulle is an historic figure; he is de-
cidely the strangest great man of our time."
Relations with Cuba
Taking the initiative at this point, I brought up the
subject of Vietnam and Cuba, saying that the Gaullists
were not the only ones in France who deplored certain
mistaken US policies. I pointed out that the first time
I had the opportunity of meeting John Kennedy, he
was a Senator and had just made a resounding speech
on the subject of Algeria. the ideas set forth in
that speech been faithfully applied in Saigon and
Havana? Here my notes are very specific, and I shall
let the late President speak through them:
☐
"We haven't enough time to talk about Vietnam,
but I'd like to talk to you about Cuba. Incidentally, our
conversation will be much more interesting when you
return, because Ben Bradlee [of Newsweek] tells me
you are on your way to Cuba now.
"Every now and then I read articles in the European
press pointing out that we Americans were blind to
what was happening in the Cuban situation. I have just
learned that General de Gaulle himself regarded Com-
munism in Cuba as nothing but the accidental and
temporary form of a will to independence from the
United States. Of course it is very easy to understand
this 'will to independence' around President de Gaulle."
John Kennedy then mustered all his persuasive force.
He punctuated each sentence with that brief, mechan-
ical gesture which had become famous:
"I tell you this: we know perfectly what happened
in Cuba, to the misforme of all. From the beginning
în
I personally followed the development of these events
with mounting concern. There are few subjects to which
I have devoted more painstaking attention. My conclu-
sions go much further than the European analyses. Here
is what I believe.

"I believe that there is no country in the world, in-
cluding all the African regions, cluding any and all
the countries under colonial domination, where eco-
nomic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were.
worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's
policies during the Batista regime. I believe that we
created, built and manufactured the Castro movement
out of whole cloth and without realizing it. I believe
that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized
all of Latin America. The great aim of the Alliance for
Progress is to reverse this unfortunate policy. This is
one of the most, if not the most, important problems in
American foreign policy. I can assure you that I have
understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation
which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when
he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to
rid Cuba of corruption. I will go even further: to some
extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a
number of sins on the part of the United States. Now
we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the
Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban
revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear."
wwwww
After a silence during which he was able to note my
surprise and my interest, the President continued: "But
it is also clear that the problem has ceased to be a
Cuban one, and has become international - that is, it
has become a Soviet problem. I am the President of the
United States and not a sociologist; I am the President
of a free nation which has certain responsibilities in the
Free World. I know that Castro betrayed the promises
made in the Sierra Maestra, and that he has agreed to
be a Soviet agent in Latin America. I know that through
his fault - either his 'will to independence', his nad-
ness or Communism - the world was on the verge of
nuclear war in October, 1962. The Russians understood
this very well, at least after our reaction; but so far as
Fidel Castro is concerned, I must say I don't know
whether he realizes this, or even if he cares about it."
A smile, then: "You can tell me whether he does when :
you come back. In any case, the nations of Latin Amer-
ica are not going to attain justice and progress that
way, I mean through Communist subversion. They
won't get there by going from economic oppression to
a Marxist dictatorship which Castro himself denounced
a few years ago. The United States now has the pos-
sibility of doing as much good in Latin America as it
has done wrong in the past; I would even say that we
alone have this power - on the essential condition that
Communism does not take over there."

Mr. Kennedy then rose to indicate at the interview
was over. I apologized for keeping him to ask two
quick questions. The first: Could the United States.

about Sekou Touré? And Tito? I received Marshal Tito
three days ago; and our discussions were most posi-

The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General
U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530
Dear Mr. Attorney General:
As you may recall, in June of last year alleged organized
crime leader Sam Gfancana was killed. At that time, this Committee
had taken steps to contact Mr. Giancana for the purpose of obtaining.
his testimony on our assassinations inquiry then under way. However,
we had not yet succeeded in contacting Mr. Giancana or anyone on his
behalf.
Shortly after Mr. Giancana's death, Mr. Michael T. Epstein of
our staff met with Mr. William Lynch, Chief, Organized Crime Section,
Department of Justice, and members of Mr. Lynch's staff to fuform
them of the Committee's actions taken to contact Mr. Giancana, and
Its Interest with respect to determining whether there was any relation-
ship between the Committee's desire to examine Mr. Giancana: and his
murder. Mr. Lynch informed Mr. Epstein at that time that there was
no indication of any such relationship and assured him that in the
event any such indication was discovered, the Committee would be
immediately informed.
The Committee has received no further information from the
Department about this matter since last June. For the purposes of
completing our record on this subject, I would appreciate it if you
would inform the Committee whether the Department has received any
additional information about this subject since the above-described
meeting.

reached the point of bringing before the Committee the ques-
tion of whether Giancana should be subpoenaed to testify.
After the initial phone call from Bennett to Shea, I
telephoned Bennett on two different occasions. My telephone
contact with Bennett was for the purpose of our locating
Giancana and a telephone number at which I could reach him.
Bennett initially indicated to me, as described earlier
in
this memorandum, that Giancana was in the hospital. My recol-
lection is that on my second telephone call with Bennett, he
informed me that Giancana was now out of the hospital and
staying at the Warwick Hotel. Finally, I recall calling the
Methodist Hospital in Houston and asking to speak to Mr.
Giancana.
I recall that the hospital authorities indicated
that they had no such person by that name in the hospital.
I do not recall the precise date of this telephone communication
to the hospital. It is my recollection that the name used by
Giancana was Doc Brown. I am uncertain whether Bennett told me
Giancana was using "Doc Brown" at both the hospital and the
hotel, but I believe he said that the alias was used at the
hospital. Bennett advised that Giancana had been visited by
several relatives and gave me the names of a couple of persons

who he thought were Giancana's sons-in-law. The only name
I remember is that of Tisci.
3
In either the second or possibly a third conversation
with Bennett, he told me that Giancana had now. checked out
of the hotel and was either on his way back to his home in
Oak Park, Illinois, or with his daughter in California. He
provided me with the telephone number of the daughter in
California and suggested I obtain Giancana's home number from
the information directory in Illinois.
H.
The telephone conversations with Bennett occurred, to
the best of my recollection, during the week of June 16, 1975.
It is possible, however, that the first conversation occurred
later in the week of June 9. It is my recollection that my
second telephone conversation with Bennett occurred on Thurs-
day June 19. In any event, I am certain that I attempted to
contact Giancana by telephone on Thursday, June 19. I was
unable to get anyone to answer the telephone in California
and did not have an opportunity to attempt to obtain the
Illinois number. I learned Friday, June 20 that Giancana had
been shot and killed in his home in Oak Park, Illinois on
the evening of June 19.

Slain Mobster Claimed
Cuban Link to JFK Death
By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern
Washington Post Staff Writers
Long before his recent murder,
John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retali
ation, were involved in the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long.
ago as March, 1967, and also in private.
conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who participated in
meetings between Rosselli and the
CIA.
An FBI "blind memorandum" on
an interview with Morgan dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without
identification of the interviewee, in
last June's Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.
Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and "thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-
patched to the United States for the
purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken-
nedy."
Because neither. Morgan nor Ros-
selli was identified in the Senate re-
port, the significance of that portion
of the 106-page document was dis-
counted at the time it was published
1 in June, before. Rosselli's disappear-
ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post, however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
were the sources of the testimony, that
suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-
nedy murder.
Morgan's account, according to a
summary of the FBI interview, was.
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-
sion about a Cuban connection to the
Kennedy assassination: from
"feedback" furnished by sources close
to Castro who were involved in the CIA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.
$

:
"His (Morgan's) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
uals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey," the FBI in-
terview summary stated..
A long-time associate of Rosselli
who was interviewed separately by
The Washington Post, said there was
no question in the slain mobster's
mind that President Kennedy was
killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal
for the CIA schemes against the Cu-
ban leader..
"He was positive; he was sure." said
the associate, who knew Rosselli well
and was in contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
home on July 28. The associate, who
does not want to be identified pub-
licly, is scheduled to be interviewed
this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-
cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-
selli's contacts in the early 1960s with
CIA case officers overseeing the at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination-including
the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA-has been that there was no
evidence that implicated the Castro
government or any of its agents.
However, the CIA's involvement in
the schemes to assassinate Castro
was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
circle of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity. President Johnson apparently
first learned about the schemes only
after a March 7, 1967, column by the
late Drew Person, which prompted
*Johnson to order a CIA investigation
of the highly sensitive episode.
Full details of the CIA-underworld
collusion in the plots to kill Castro
did not surface publicly until the pub-
·lication last year of the Senate Intelli-
gence Committee's assassination re:
port and the ensuing report last June
on the possible role of the intelligence

FBI that Rosselli wanted to "keep
square with the bureau" but was
afraid that the mob might kill him for
talking.
;
In 1967, after he was arrested for
gambling fraud at the Friars Club in..
Beverly Hills, Rosselli approached his
former CIA case officer, William Har:
vey, who sought unsuccessfully to in-
tercede in the prosecution.
It was against this background that
Morgan went, first to Drew Pearson,
and then the FBI, with Rosselli's sen-
sational allegations of CIA plotting.
against Castro and the Cuban counter-
espionage directed against President
Kennedy.
Last April Rosselli told the Senate
Intelligence Committee he had no rec-
ollection of either receiving informa-
tion that Castro retaliated against
· President Kennedy or of having dis-
cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei-
ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic
memory loss or that Morgan's state-
ment to FBI agents nine years earlier
was a pure invention, a serious risk
for an established Washington lawyer.
.No committee source could explain
the discrepancy, and Morgan declined
to confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
allegations against the Cuban govern-
ment or his recent testimony.
The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with Morgan was sent to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: "No further investigation is
being conducted by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau.
:
The Senate intelligence committee.
in commenting on this position, said
that "had the interviewing agents.
known of the CIA-underworld plots
against Castro, they would have been
aware that the lawyer had clients who
had been active in the assassination
plots."
On March 21, FBI headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House the attor-
ney general and the Secret Service. It
did not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan's allegations.
On the evening of the following.
day, President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to the White
House. The next morning, March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen-
eral to prepare a report on the CIA
involvement in the assassination plots
-Operation Mongoose-of which
Helms had full knowledge at the time
they were executed.
By May 22, Helms briefed President
Johnson on the results. There is, how-
ever, no evidence that Helm's briefed
the President on the November, 1963,
plot one of eight major schemes on

Castro's life from 1960 to 1965-to as-
sassinate the Cuban leader through
the employment of an agent with the
cryptonymn AMLASH. His identity
was revealed as Rolando Cubela, a
1961 CIA "recruit" with close access
to Castro.
CIA operatives turned over assassi-
nation equipment to Cubela during a
Paris meeting on November 22, 1963-.
the day President Kennedy was killed.
in Dallas. There has been subsequent
speculation that the mercurial and
talkative Cubela was either a double
agent or being monitored by Cuban
intelligence.
:
During the later days of his presi
dency, Mr. Johnson spoke cryptically
of a "Caribbean Murder Incorpo
rated" targeted against Fidel Castro.
The inspiration for that statement un-
doubtedly was the CIA inspector gen
eral's report he ordered Helms to have
prepared..
Within the past year, Rosselli and

tro assassination schemes have died,

| Mrs. William Harvey, the widow of
the deceased CIA official, said she
suspected no foul play in her hus
band's death. She did, however, tell.
The Washington Post that she re-
ceived a call after Rosselli's disappear-
ance in late July warning her that Cu-
bans appeared to be attempting to
wipe out all those who participated in
the anti-Castro plots.
i
The call, she said, came from an old
friend who was acquainted with Ros-
selli's sister, whose name is Edith Dai-
gle. Mrs. Harvey said that Mrs. Daigle
told the mutual acquaintance that the
Rosselli family had received a tele-
phone threat from unidentified Cu-
bans prior to Rosselli's disappearance.
She also said that Rosselli had gone to
meet the Cubans in an effort to pro-
tect his family.
Mrs. Daigle could not be reached by
The Washington Post. But another sis-
ter of Rosselli said she had heard of.
no such threats or warnings.
Harvey, who died at age 60 and
whose exploits as a clandestine opera-
tor are both legendary and controver-
sial within the agency, testified to the
Senate Intelligence Committee.. He
had become Rosselli's case officer in
Operation Mongoose and supplied the
mobster with poison pills, explosives,
¡ detonators, rifles, handguns, radios:
and boat radar for transmission to
anti-Castro Cuban agents. Harvey and
Rosselli, a CIA superior testified to
the Senate committee, "developed a
close friendship."
r
Another CIA official who worked
: with Rosselli, James R. O'Connell, was
asked if he knew whether the agency
transmitted information to the mob-
ster on possible Cuban Involvement in
the Kennedy assassination. He replied
that he was out of the country at the
time Kennedy was killed, and had no
further comment.
Two months before the Kennedy as-
sassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, who,
was identified by the Warren Commis-
sion as Kennedy's murderer, had trav-
eled to Mexico City in an attempt to
gain entry to Cuba. According to the
Warren Commission, Oswald repre-
sented himself as the head of the New
Orleans branch of the Fair Play for
Cuba organization and a friend of the
Cuban Revolution.
Some three months before Kennedy
was killed, Castro told Associated
Press reporter Daniel Harker that
U.S. leaders aiding terrorist plans to
eliminate Cuban leaders would them-
selves not be safe..
A U.S. government committee coor-
dinating policy toward Cuba at the
time agreed there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate in some
fashion. However, it concluded Castro
would not risk a major confrontation
with the U.S. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.
On the same day Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CIA officer met with a
high-ranking Cuban official, who had
said he would kill Castro, to tell him.
the U.S. would provide him with ex-
plosives and a poison pen device.
While the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient to justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassination was part of a
conspiracy, it also said U.S. agencies
did not properly investigate the assas-
sination or tell the Warren Commis-
sion about the CIA plots on Castro's
life.
"There is no indication that the FBI :
or the CIA directed the interviewing
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community," the Sen-
ate committee said.
According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder, the
FBI never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia. .

agencies in the Kennedy assassination
and investigation.
The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters,
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum
weighted with chains but buoyed by
gases from decomposition on the
ocean's surface off the coast of Miami.
The specific cause of death was deter-
mined by an autopsy to be asphyxia-
⚫tion.
Last year, an underworld colleague
of Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited by the
.CIA in the effort to kill Castro, was
¡found shot to death in his Chicago
home in what police described as a
highly professional job by assailants
who penetrated the mobster's per-
'sonal security screen. Giancana was
due to testify before the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee shortly after his.
¡demise.

Neither murder has been solved.
The possibility that Rosselli's mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schemes
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.
The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-
cana and other underworld figures-
principally Santos Trafficante of
Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution-in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.
: The tangled chronology of suppres
sion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-
li's murder adds significance to those
events.
Here is the sequence, pieced to-
gether from the testimony given to
Senate intelligence investigators:
Columnist Drew Pearson went to
the late Chief Justice of the United'
States Earl Warren late in.: January,
1967, and told him that a Washington.
lawyer had confided to him that one
of his clients said the United States
"had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro.
had decided to retaliate."
Warren declined Pearson's sugges-
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-
tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,
1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-
over, informing him of the allegations.
-

i
♥Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an "eyes-
only" basis. There is no record of FBI
meetings or discussions of those alle-
gations. At that point the sensitive let-
ter bounced back and forth'in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
racy.
i The job of responding to Rowley's
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI's General Investigative Di-
vision who was given respons¡ility for
the overall assassination investigation
´ in March 1964.
This official's job was complicated
by the fact that he had never been in-
formed of what Hoover and his closest
circle of confidants in the FBI learned
early in 1962-that the CIA was
deeply
involved in assassination
attempts against Castro, and promi-
nent American underworld figures, in-
cluding Rosselli and Giancana, had
been recruited for the attempts..
So on Feb. 15, 1967, the FBI official
prepared a draft reply to the Rowley"
letter for his superiors saying "our in-
vestigation uncovered no evidence in-
dicating Fidel Castro officials of the
Cuban Government were involved
with Lee Harvey Oswald in the assas-
sination of President Kennedy. This
bureau is not conducting, any investi-
gation regarding this matter." The
FBI official added in later testimony.

erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro's life in 1963 "may
have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy."
Ten days later, Marvin Watson, one
of Lyndon Johnson's chief deputies,
called FBI. assistant director Cartha
DeLoach with the message that "the
President had instructed that the FBI

The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI's General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate
i
committee concluded was "puzzling"
because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had been as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foreign involvement in the
assassination.
Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA's assassina
tion plots against Castro. Both agents
testified eight years later that they
were "surprised" when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to U.S. at-

"These agents stated that
could not evaluate
(Morgan's) allegations or question him
in detail on them, since they had not
been briefed on the CIA assassination
efforts," the Senate committee ob-
served.
On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-
ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan..
In a Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-
gan was reported to have acknowl-
edged that his clients were "on the
fringe of the underworld" and that
they faced "possible prosecution in a

Morgan said his clients "were called
upon by a governmental agency to as-

have the highest governmental ap-
proval. The project had as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made, including
the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-
ment and the placing of informants
within key posts in Cuba."
Morgan also told the FBI, according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed "teams of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States.
for the purpose of assassinating Presi
dent Kennedy."
It was not "clear then-nor is it to:

MEMORANDUM
www.pa
TO:
FRITZ AND BILL
FROM:
MIKE EPSTEIN
DATE:
JUNE 20, 1975
SUBJECT: GIANCANA
f
I expect that no one will write off the alleged Giancana murder as a
"third-rate homicide," and that it will grow and grow and grow. It is clearly
the most volatile media issue of the season.
Given the barest outlines of what allegedly happened, and taking them
at face value, we have a responsibility to take action under 18 U.S. Code,
Section 1505:
Whoever
witness
being had by
by
force
endeavors to ... impede any
in connection with any inquiry or investigation
any committee of either House ... or
Whoever
by
endeavors to
force ... obstructs, or impedes or
obstruct, or impede
the due and proper
any committee of
exercise of the power of inquiry under which such inquiry
or investigation is being had by
either House
Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more
than five years, or both.
In short, if Giancana was a "witness" (which status he might have
achieved by mere location contacts made by staff) and he was killed to
prevent his appearance; or indeed even if he wasn't yet a "witness" but
this was a "message" to all witnesses to keep quiet (e.g. Roselli and Maheu),
there is a violation of law which we might have the responsibility to investigate.
Beyond what our responsibility is, it seems clear to me that most extreme
possibilities of what might actually have happened dictate that we come up
with a well-reasoned position and plan after careful, deliberate, intensive
NW 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 643

--- Image 157-10014-10242_page_641.jpeg ---
-2-
consideration of all avenues of approach, pitfalls, suspected motives, etc.
Most important of all, it seems to me, is our acceptance of the fact that
maybe we don't even have anyone on our staff with sufficient experience,
sophistication, background, and investigative maturity to deal with this
situation.
As a first step, I urge your decision to convene a planning session to
decide what the second step will be.
I can't emphasize enough the need for well-thought-out planning here.
Who knows where this will lead? And at a minimum, some months from now,
Senator Church may be asked, "What did you do the day after you learned
that Giancana had been killed?".
My stream of consciousness on kinds of things to consider would
include: What our public statement on this should or should not be,
security for other witnesses, immediate contact with other key witnesses
(to reassure them), secrecy of witness lists and immunity applications,
secrecy of place, time and even fact of interview, meetings with Justice
organized crime section, Chicago strike force, local law enforcement people
in Oak Park and Illinois, obtaining all FBI investigative reports (they're
in it per tonight's Star), getting background on all law enforcement officials
in Illinois who will be involved (whom do you trust?), is this a diversion
which we're being sucked into, how do we avoid that (hire someone just for
this), how do we show we care so other witnesses (known or unknown) won't
dry up, etc. etc. etc.
NOTE: Mike can be reached after 6:45 tonight at (802) 863-2652.

MEMORANDUM:
TO: Mike Madigan
FROM: Ed Greissing
DATE: August 13, 1976
SUBJECT: Mention of Carlos Marcello in the 4/23/76 transcript of
John Rosselli.
On April 23, 1976 during Mr. Rosselli's appearance before the
Schweiker-Hart Subcommittee, we took the opportunity to question
him about any information he might possess regarding the New Orleans
Mafia Chieftan, Carlos Marcello.
!
Our interest in Marcello developed from 1) the allegation that
Marcello was tangentially involved with both Clay Shaw and David
Ferrie; the fact that Marcello was deported by Attorney General Robert
Kennedy and that the assassination of President Kennedy was a possible
retaliation,
In my telephone conversation with Jim Johnston, 8/13/76, he could
think of no other reasons why we questioned Rosselli about Marcello.
If you would like to talk to Jim about this matter, his telephone
number is 780-6203.

O'Connell's recollection is that Orta's man would not go through
with it and that the pills were returned to O'Connell by Roselli.
O'Connell's recollection then is that the second plan was a call
from Roselli and Maheu indicating the use of a chef. The pills
were sent down and again returned when this plot failed.
O'Connell is unclear which of the aforementioned schemes took
place before the Bay of Pigs. He indicates, however, the use of

Dear Mr. Attorney General:
I am writing you today on behalf of the Select
Committee about the recent death of Samuel Giancana.
As
you are no doubt aware, his name has been raised in the
context of allegations concerning the Central Intelligence
Agency's possible involvement in so-called political
assassinations.
Based on information available to the Committee,
it was obvious that he might be knowledgeable about the
political assassination matter. Although Mr. Giancana
had not actually been subpoenaed to testify by this Com-
7 mittee, he had been approached by members of the staff
for a possible interview. Since this might involve viola-
tion of federal statutes pertaining to obstruction of a
Congressional Committee investigation, the Select Committee
is requesting that you instruct the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to keep it fully informed of all information
coming to the Bureau's attention pertaining to Mr. Giancana's
death. In making this request, the Committee is not conced-
ing its right to conduct its own investigation of this
matter. However, it is acting in the spirit of cooperation
on a question of mutual concern to the Executive and Legis-
lative Branches of government.

The Committee is also concerned about the
safety of several other possible witnesses.
Therefore,
we request 24-hour-a-day protection by the United States
Marshall Service for the following witnesses which the
Committee has subpoenaed, intends to subpoena, has inter-
viewed, or intends to interview:
(Alternative paragraph:
The Committee is also concerned about the
safety of several other possible witnesses. We would
like to discuss with members of your staff the necessity
for special arrangements by the United States Marshall
Service to ensure the safety of witnesses who have or
might have to contact with the Committee pertaining to
these matters.)

Harvey states that as soon as the missile crisis was over,
i.e., late 1962, he indicated to Roselli that he wanted the
project cut off, although gradually so as not to create hard
feelings.

520 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well. And then Sergeant de la Llana, will
you identify yourself, please, sir?
Mr. DE LA LLANA. Jack de la Llana, Tampa Police Department. I
have been with the police department for 9 years, and attached to the
homicide division for 4 years before starting the criminal intelligence
unit of the Tampa Police Department.
The CHAIRMAN. Have you had previous police service?
Mr. DE LA LLANA. My first experience was 9 years ago, when I
started first with the force.
The CHAIRMAN. Chief Brown, do you have a statement, a prepared
statement?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, I do, Senator.
The CHAIRMAN. I have a copy of it before me, and I see it has several
pages. Do you wish to read all of it?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir; I would like to read it to the committee.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well, then, you may proceed.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am
Neil G. Brown, chief of the Police Department of the city of Tampa,
Fla.
I have been a member of the Tampa Police Department for the past
16 years, and I have been chief of the department for the past 4 years.
Prior to my appointment as chief, I served as inspector of detectives.
I am a graduate of the National Police Academy of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and a member of the Tampa Bay Area Chiefs
of Police Association and of the International Association of Chiefs
of Police.
With me here today is Sgt. Jack de la Llana who, at my direction,
formed our department's first criminal intelligence unit in February
of 1962, and has been its director since that time. Sergeant de la
Llana also holds the important post of chairman of the Florida In-
telligence Unit, a statewide agency which coordinates information
amongst intelligence units in cities throughout the State of Florida.
In addition to Sergeant de la Llana, whose diligent work and knowl-
edge of criminal operations has provided much of the foundation for
my statement to you, I feel fortunate in being accompanied also by
Sgt. William Branch of the intelligence division of the Orlando Police
Department. Sergeant Branch is presently attending the National
Academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He has been a
member of the Orlando Police Department since 1951, and a detective
sergeant since 1956. He is particularly familiar with organized gam-
bling operations in the central Florida area, and I believe his presents-
tion of that situation will be of material value to this inquiry.
I feel privileged to be able to testify before you today. I believe
that the facts I can present here about organized crime operations in
Tampa will help you and the American public realize the seriousness
of this problem, and our Nation's emergent need for further Federal
legislation to combat an evil that has clearly expanded beyond the
powers of municipal law enforcement to contain, suppress and elimi
nate it.
Tampa has a large and respected Italian population, who are con
sidered in all respects to be an asset to our community. Unfor
tunately, a small percentage of this group of citizens have achieved

a notoriety greatly disproportionate to their numbers, because of their
continuous activity in criminal and racketeering enterprises. The
people of our city refer to this group as "the Sicilian underworld" or
"the Mafia."
Our growing concern with this criminal group was crystallized in
1956 when a Hillsborough County grand jury was empaneled in
Tampa to investigate and determine the truth of allegations that
the Mafia was then operating in Tampa. The pertinent part of that
grand jury's report stated:
* #
* * * there are some individuals who believe that a Mafia or Black Hand
exists and operates in this community, but they are in the minority.
The evidence presented, the volume of written material examined, and wit-
nesses interviews point to the existence in this community of an organized crime
element whose methods of operation are similar to the pattern of the Sicilian
Mafia as we understand it. ***
The CHAIRMAN. Chief, let me ask you, prior to this development
before the grand jury, before the grand jury made this finding, were
you the law enforcement officials or in the police department?
Mr. BROWN. No, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Were you suspicious that such an organization
existed in your city?
Mr. BROWN. Oh, yes; law enforcement has been aware that this has
been there.
The CHAIRMAN. There was something, you felt confident, but you
were unable to bring it out in concrete proof; is that correct?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
The CHAIRMAN. So you had been trying to combat it without being
able to get it out in the open?
Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right.
The CHAIRMAN. All right. Proceed.
Mr. BROWN (reading):
* * * our records indicate that the vast majority of our unsolved crimes stem
from underworld activity involving persons of Sicilian or Italian ancestry *
The CHAIRMAN. We had some startling information here the other
day from the Chicago chief of police with respect to some 976
murders, gangland style, that had been committed over a period of
years, and only 2 of them had been solved. That is, officially solved by
court determination or court action.
Mr. BROWN. That is typical.
The CHAIRMAN. What is the ratio in your community, if you can
give us some idea about it?
Mr. BROWN. I will bring that out in my statement, but it is just
like Chicago.
The CHAIRMAN. Something along that line?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. That struck me as one of the most frightening
developments of information that I have heard regarding crime.
just couldn't believe that 976 murders, and apparently just murder
in the first-degree fashion, could be committed in an area like Met-
ropolitan Chicago over a period of years, and only 2 of them could
be solved. It thoroughly demonstrates to me the great menace and
the danger of organized mobs committing crime.
You say: "Well, they probably killed each other pretty much.”
That may be true, but they kill each other because of the extortionate

522 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
operations that they are engaged in, to the detriment of the public
at large, and to the detriment of innocent people who can't help
themselves. It focuses and emphasizes how serious this menace is.
Very well, you may proceed.
Mr. BROWN. Notwithstanding these findings, the grand jury con-
cluded that there was no national or local Mafia in Tampa. I would
like to submit as exhibit 1 a certified copy of the report of the grand
jury dated March 30, 1956.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well, this report of the grand jury will be
received and it may be made exhibit No. 44, and exhibit 1 to this
witness' testimony.
I may later direct it be printed, but as of now we will just let it be
filed as an exhibit for reference.
(The document referred to was marked "Exhibit No. 44" for refer-
ence, and may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)
Mr. BROWN. It seems likely to me that the grand jury failed to
acknowledge without qualification the presence of the Mafia in Tampa
because it sought a pattern of Mafia operations similar to the historical
Sicilian tradition of primitive and direct extortion, rather than the
sophisticated and polished control of rackets that now characterize
that organization.
The CHAIRMAN. I take it from that last statement that you feel
that they have considerably improved their technique.
Mr. BROWN. Very much so.
The CHAIRMAN. Of crime operations.
Mr. BROWN. Very much.
Senator MUSKIE. May I ask a question, Chief, there?
As I understand what you have just testified relative to the grand
jury's report, they acknowledged that there was some evidence of the
existence of Sicilian Mafia in the community, but apparently felt
that evidence was not conclusive; is that a correct summary?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct; yes, Senator. The Tampa Police De-
partment, however, has long been aware that many criminals in our
area have local reputations as Mafiosi. My staff and I have made a
careful evaluation of those reputations, based upon personal knowl-
edge, criminal records, surveillance reports, personal histories, familial
relationships, statistical analyses, reports from confidential inform-
ants, information from Federal and local law-enforcement agencies,
and other customary police intelligence sources.
It is our considered conclusion that the Mafia exists in Tampa, that
it controls most illegal gambling in Tampa and central Florida, and
that its members have interstate and international ties to other Mafia
groups.
The organization of the Mafia in the Tampa area is best understood
from a chart we have formulated which I submit to this subcommittee"
as our exhibit No. 2.
Senator MUSKIE. Before we get to that, Chief, may I ask another
question? The grand jury to which you referred sat in 1956, am I
correct?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. That is 7 years ago. Do you think you have
accumulated additional evidence as to the existence of the Mafia in
Tampa which would justify a new reference to the grand jury?
Mr. BROWN. Yes; I believe so.

far as it can be. The title of it is "The Mafia Organization in the
Tampa, Fla., Area."
(The document referred to was marked "Exhibit No. 45" for refer-
ence and faces this page.)
The CHAIRMAN. Would you say the operations of this organized
group are not confined just to the city limits of Tampa, but they are
in the area?
Mr. BROWN. By all means; the entire area.
The CHAIRMAN. All right. This chart is now a part of the record
and, if
you wish to comment about it, we will proceed with your state-
ment.
Mr. BROWN. The chart is keyed to show only the criminal, business,
and familial interrelationships and activities of the persons named,
although other criteria figured in our categorization of these persons.
Of course, this chart cannot be considered as a definitive "table of
organization" of the Tampa Mafia, because it is but a simplified repre-
sentation of an organization that is in a constant state of flux, and about
which we know we still have many things to learn.
However, I believe it is completely accurate in showing that Santo
Traficante is the boss of this criminal group. Indeed, it is to Santo
Traficante that Tampa owes the dubious distinction of having been
represented at the notorious crime convention at Apalachin, N.Y.,
in November 1957.
The CHAIRMAN. I notice you designate or refer to this group as the
Mafia. Would you say that it is the same group that has been referred
to by the famous witness, Joe Valachi?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir; it is.
The CHAIRMAN. Whether he calls it Cosa Nostra or the Mafia makes
no difference. This is the organized crime group to which you re-
ferred?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct, Senator; this is the group.
Senator MUSKIE. May I ask a question there?
Under this group, there is another group which you describe as
nonmember associates and employees. Is that intended to suggest
that the people who are so described know nothing about the identity
of their employers and the organization of which they are a part?
Mr. BROWN. Senator, that is a part of the insulation of the group.
They have many employees, and as we go into the statement, to show
how in this gambling operation the seller is non-Sicilian in most
cases, and he reports to another member up the ladder, and so on up.
Many of these people are nonmembers of the Mafia as it is.
Senator MUSKIE. Do they know they are engaged in criminal ac-
tivities?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. They know they are a part of a criminal orga-
nization?
Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. But they are not members?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct.

in on Traficante's gambling operations in Cuba. Trafficante, using
the alias "B. IIill," stayed with Anastasia in the latter's hotel suite,
on the night of October 24, 1957, and moved out approximately 1 hour
after Anastasia's murder in a nearby barber shop.
The Department's evaluation of Traficante as the boss of the Mafia
organization in Tampa was confirmed, of course, by the positive identi-
fication of the "Louis Santos of Havana, Cuba," apprehended at the
Apalachin conference in November of 1957, as Santo Traficante, Jr.,
of Tampa, Fla.
Furthermore, we have witnessed and documented many visits of
out-of-town racketeers with Santo Trafficante and his fellow hoodlums
of the Tampa area. These visitors give further indications that Traf-
ficante is associated with Mafia members in other cities. For example,
Louis Coticchia of Chicago, also known as Lou Brady, has been fre-
quently seen visiting Traficante and on one occasion they were seen
boarding a plane together, heading for Miami.
Other known outside racketeers who have visited in Tampa with
Traficante gang members are John Joseph Vitale, Salvatore Lopic-
colo, and Anthony Giardano, all known racketeers from St. Louis, Mo.
Mr. O'DONNELL. I think at the present time, in interest of conti-
nuity, so that the record will read properly, Sergeant de la Llana has
a statement with regard to a courier operation within the Mafia. In
the interest of time, I am not going to ask him to read it, but I would
like to have it introduced in the record.
Do you have that?
Mr. DE LA LLANA. Yes, I do.
Mr. O'DONNELL. How many pages does it consist of?
Mr. DE LA LLANA. It is five pages.
The CHAIRMAN. Give a better description of it and tell us what it is.
Mr. DE LA LLANA. It is with reference to Louis Coticchia, alias Lou
Brady, and his visits to Tampa on various occasions, which first came
to our attention on April 13, 1962. This subject has a long criminal
record. I have an FBI record which I will also submit into evidence.
The CHAIRMAN. Let the FBI record be received and made exhibit
No. 46 for reference.
(Document referred to marked "Exhibit No. 46" for reference and
may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)
The CHAIRMAN. Now, your statement, is that a summary statement
you have made and prepared for the record?
that
Mr. DE LA LLANA. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well, it may be received and printed in the
record, either at this point or immediately following the prepared
statement of the witness now testifying.
(The statement referred to follows:)
STATEMENT OF SGT. JACK DE LA LLANA
One of the clear ties of the Trafficante organization with other criminal groups
is reflected by the contacts with Trafficante made by a man who appears to act
as a courier for the Mafia. Louis Coticchia, alias Lou Brady, FBI No. 1427493,
first came to the attention of our Department on April 13, 1962, when we ob-
served him, in Tampa, in the company of Augustine Primo Lazzara and Frank.
Diecidue, two of the men on our Mafia chart. Because of this and other con-
tacts made by Coticchia, our intelligent unit developed the following informa-
tion about him which I think is of interest to this committee in giving a profile

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
Senator MUSKIE. What do they need to do to become members in
the Tampa area?
Mr. BROWN. Well, I think I can clarify that later on in the state-
ment, Senator.
The CHAIRMAN. All right; you may proceed.
Mr. BROWN. Santo Traficante, Jr., was born in Tampa on November
14, 1914. He was one of five brothers. He maintains residence today
m Tampa and in Miami. He previously lived in Havana, Cuba,
where he owned and operated gambling casinos under the Battista
regime. When Fidel Castro took over, Traficante's gambling opera-
"tions"
ons were stopped. He was expelled from Cuba and returned to
the United States. He inherited the control of the numbers racket
in central Florida which his father, Santo Trafficante, Sr., who died
in 1954, and he continues to head this operation.
Testimony in the 1958 hearings of the Senate Select Committee
on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field identified
Santo Traficante, Jr., in the operation of the Sans Souci gambling
casino in Havana. That testimony stated that Trafficante took over
the Sans Souci from the Mannarino brothers in Pittsburgh, Pa.
Gabriel Mannarino was a fellow delegate with Santo Trafficante, Jr.,
to the Apalachin crime convention in 1957.
Additional testimony named Trafficante, Jr., as the key figure in
the Mafia in Tampa, stating, as the Tampa police had long known,
that he succeeded his father as the major racketeer in the city.
Other information substantiated by our files reveals that Trafficante
is an associate of such notorious criminals as Meyer Lansky, Joseph
Bonanno, Sam Giancana, Aniello Dellacroce, Joseph Stassi, Sam Man-
narino, Joseph Arcuri, and of Joseph Riccobono, also known as Staten
Island Joe, who had been closely allied with the elder Trafficante,
and was also discovered at the Apalachin meeting.
When Joseph Profaci's daughter Carmella married Anthony Tocco,
son of Detroit mobster William "Black Bill" Tocco, in Brooklyn on
June 4, 1955, one of the guests at the reception in the Hotel Com-
modore in New York was Santo Traficante, Jr. Among those who
also attended were 13 other persons who later attended the Apalachin
conference, as well as other notorious Mafia figures, such as Frank
Livorsi, Thomas and John Dioguardi, Tony and Albert Anastasia,
and Thomas "Three Finger Brown" Lucchese.
There have been at least two known attempts on the life of Santo
Traficante: On January 2, 1953, he was shotgunned in a car on the
streets of Tampa, receiving wounds in the arm. Later, in Cuba, four
American mobsters who intended to kill Trafficante were told by
Cuban police that they would have to do it on American soil.
Traficante has been arrested in Tampa several times for investiga-
tion, because of our knowledge that he was deeply involved in gam
bling, even though we have not yet been able to obtain the quantum of
proof necessary to a successful prosecution. He has also been picked
up by the police for questioning about the gangland slayings of Rene
Nunez, Angelo Giglio, and Joe Antinori.
Traficante was a suspect in the Albert Anastasia murder on Oc-
tober 25, 1957, in New York because he had appeared in New York
just before the murder. He was considered a likely suspect because
there had been reports that Anastasia was then attempting to move

using the same alias. We alerted the St. Louis police and upon Vitale's arrival
there, he was interviewed by detectives of that city. He declared that he had
traveled to Tampa to settle a debt of the Lombardo Produce Co., of St. Louis,
Mo.. to the Diecidue Bros. of Tampa.
To me it does not seem probable that Vitale would go to the expense and
trouble of flying to Tampa and returning the same day in order to settle a debt
between two produce companies with which he has no known connections. More
significantly, his use of an alias to run this errand, too, points out his own
doubts that he was engaged in a legitimate errand.
These two examples, Coticchia's and Vitale's, indicate to us the interstate
connections of the Trafficante organization, and point up the need for attacking
the Mafia group on a national-basis.
Mr. O'DONNELL. All right, we will continue.
Mr. BROWN. Some of Traficante's men shown here on our chart
gave sworn testimony before the Hillsborough County solicitor in
1953 concerning gambling in Tampa. They admitted that they had
long been engaged in illegal gambling activities. They were forced
to testify or face jail terms for contempt of court, because they had
been granted immunity from prosecution for such crimes. Among
those who testified were Frank Diecidue, Augustine Primo Lazzara,
Nick Scaglione, Henry Traficante, and James C. Longo.
Mr. O'DONNELL. Are any of these individuals on the chart that
you have introduced as exhibit 2?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, they are all on the chart.
Mr. O'DONNELL. Thank you.
Mr. BROWN. Santo Traficante has himself been caught up in a typi-
cal Mafia technique of seeking to preserve and protect its illegal enter-
prises by the corruption of law enforcement and other public officials.
This incident substantiated our intelligence that Traficante was
deeply involved in gambling operations, and it showed that he had
major interests in gambling outside the city of Tampa.
The case was initiated in 1954 by a veteran St. Petersburg police
officer, Detective Sgt. Harry Dietrich, who had obtained evidence of
the operation of the Traficante bolita ring. Bolita is a numbers
racket of considerable importance in Florida, involving weekly payoffs
based upon information taken from radio reports of the weekly Cuban
lottery.
An attempt was made to bribe Sergeant Dietrich to ignore the
operation of the ring. He was given a new car, a television set, some
suits of clothing, and cash. Sergeant Dietrich accepted the bribes
with the full knowledge and orders of his superiors, to whom he
had immediately reported the initial bribery attempt.
As a result of his work, Santo Traficante and his brother Henry
were arrested. Both were charged with bribery and were convicted.
The CHAIRMAN. When did this occur?
Mr. BROWN. This was in 1954.

real or personal. His house, automobile, and all his other possessions
are held in the names of others. However, we do not believe him to be
destitute, for his control of gambling in the central Florida area alone
must net him huge amounts of money. His operations there show,
also, a characteristic Mafia method of utilizing non-Sicilian associates
where it serves its criminal objectives.
Sergeant Branch, who has for the past 7 years been investigating
gambling and other organized criminal activities in the Orlando area,
will describe the Mafia's control, through the Harlan Blackburn
organization, of lottery operations in central Florida. We know of
no legitimate businesses that are owned.
The CHAIRMAN. Sergeant Branch is here with you?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
On the lower right-hand side of our chart we have depicted that
group of Traficante associates.
Sergeant Branch will here testify about the Blackburn group.
The CHAIRMAN. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are
about to give before this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. BRANCH. I do.
TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM BRANCH
The CHAIRMAN. Will you identify yourself for the record?
Mr. BRANCH. I am a sergeant with the Orlando Police Department
attached to the intelligence division, and I have been with them since
1951. I have been working in this type of work since 1956, with the
cooperation of the Federal and State agencies in our area.
The CHAIRMAN. Do you have a prepared statement?
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir, I do.
The CHAIRMAN. It appears to be four or five pages. Do you wish
to read it?
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
In the central Florida area the main gambling activity is known as
bolita or Cuba. Bolita is a numbers lottery where the winning num-
ber is drawn daily. Cuba is a numbers lottery where the winning
number is drawn weekly.. Bettors can place bets on any number from
1 to 100 and receive a 60-to-1 return if they win. The Cuba winning
number is the last two digits from the Cuban national lottery number
which is five digits and is broadcast over a Havana radio station each
Saturday shortly after 2 p.m.
The public is contacted by "peddlers" or "sellers," who receive a com-
mission of 15 percent of their sales. "Pickup" men, who take the bets
from the sellers to the "checkup houses," receive 20 percent of what
they collect. Employees such as checkup men, adding machine opera-
tors, and supervisors above this position usually receive salaries for
their duties.
Lottery operations in central Florida prior to 1948 were dominated
first by Charlie Wall of Tampa and then by Sam Warren, an Orlando
native. In that year Harlan Blackburn, FBI No. 1026922, a con-
victed felon, came into Orlando and began taking over bolita and
Cuba gambling.

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS -
of a hoodlum who is entrusted by the Mafla to act as a courier for them between
the various groups.
Coticchia was born on February 25, 1920, in Cincinnati, Ohio. When he was
arrested a couple of years ago, he gave as his occupation "industrial financier."
He is presently reported to be interested in the operation of a company offering
wired music in the Chicago area known as Symphonaire Sound Systems, Inc.
His criminal record shows that he was first arrested in 1936 in Ohio for
robbery. In 1937 he was arrested in Miami, Fla., for investigation of a "shake-
down." He was held for 4 days and released without charges. He was arrested
again in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1938 for investigation and released with the under-
standing that he would leave the city.
In 1938, in Cleveland, Coticchia was arrested and charged with assault with
intent to commit rape. He was convicted and received 1 to 15 years, of which
he served 4 years, being released in 1941. He was arrested in 1942 in Los Angeles,
Calif., on a warrant issued in Baltimore for grand theft. He was tried in Balti-
more for receiving stolen goods and received 5 years in prison.
Coticchia was again arrested in Dallas, Tex., in 1961, by the U.S. marshals
for violation of and for conspiring to violate the Federal Securities and Exchange
Act of 1933, which case is still pending in the Southern District Court of New
York. His last arrest known to us was on January 4, 1963. when he was ar-
rested in Tampa for investigation of grand larceny. He was released due to
insufficient evidence.
Coticchia worked as a "pit boss" in gambling casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., and
Havana, Cuba. He was involved in a scandal in 1960 in which mobsters at-
tempted to take over a nationwide bail bond business.
On
Coticchia has been in and out of Tampa since our first observation of him and
on every occasion he is in direct contact with Trafficante and Diecidue.
December 31, 1962, he purchased a new automobile in Tampa, paying the dealer
$3,625.95 in cash. He then registered the car under the name of Jane Campbell.
He remained in Tampa several days and was in constant contact with Trafficante
and Diecidue.
On January 4, 1963. Coticchia was arrested in Tampa on suspicion of grand
larceny and at the time of his arrest he had $1.775 in cash on his person. He
had papers on him that showed he had resided previously at the Aloha Motel in
Miami under the name Luiz l'aulino Bailey from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He
also had a paper with a list of gambling equipment and the name "Empress
Lines, Ltd., Nassau-via Wappen Von Hamburg-German boat loading pier
No. 3."
An investigation revealed this equipment had been shipped airfreight from
Las Vegas to Nassau and placed in a German vessel, the Wappen Von Hamburg,
which sails between Nassau and Miami. This equipment included 50 one-arm
bandits, or slot machines, and was valued in excess of $65,000. The information
received was that this vessel was to travel between Miami and Nassau as a
floating gambling casino.
After Coticchia's arrest in Tampa, the telephone calls were checked at the
motel. It showed that he had made several calls to Trafficante, Diecidue, and
other associates of Trafficante. Ile had also made a long-distance call to Sonny's
Restaurant in Miami Beach, which is owned by Thomas Altamura, FBI No.
511563, a Mafia member and another associate of Santo Trafficante, Jr.
I would like to submit for the record Coticchia's FBI record, and a photograph
of him taken by my department when he was arrested in Tampa on January
4, 1963.
Another example of the Trafficante group's connections with Mafia figures in
other parts of the Nation is: John Joseph Vitale, FBI No. 793259, of St. Louis.
Mo. Vitale is well known to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, and
is reputed to be the Mafia leader in that area. He has a record of 13 arrests
and a conviction for violating the Harrison Narcotics Act for which he received
a sentence of 7 years' imprisonment. He has been arrested as a fence and is
believed to deal in anything in which there is a large percentage of profit.
Police authorities consider him among the most dangerous of Mafia principals
in the St. Louis area, and he is known to have underworld connections through-
out the country. He appeared twice before the Senate Rackets Committee
(August 19, 1958, and February 11, 1959) and each time refused to answer any
questions, invoking the fifth amendment.
On April 17, 1963, Vitale flew from St. Louis to Tampa, using the name "Jack
Howard." He visited the Diecidues for 4 hours and then flew back to St. Louls

Blackburn was born in Sand Lake, Fla., on April 13, 1919. In 1935,
he was convicted of forging a U.S. Government check, for which he
served 42 years in prison. In 1943, he was sentenced to 2 years in
the Florida State prison for cattle theft. He was again arrested in
March 1956 for operating a lottery in Polk County, Fla., and received
a 5-year prison sentence, but was released in 1959.
Senator MUSKIE. Did you say Mr. Blackburn was on the chart?
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir. He is listed in the lower right-hand corner.
Senator MUSKIE. It is not on this chart?
Mr. BRANCH. No, sir; not on that one.
Senator MUSKIE. Blackburn is not a member of the Mafia, as such?
Mr. BRANCH. He is a subordinate that works under their direction;
yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Is he the same as Sam Warren?
Mr. BRANCH. No, sir; he is not. Sam Warren is dead.
He was then incarcerated for 60 days in Polk County for an earlier
conviction of conspiracy to violate the lottery laws of Florida. He
was most recently arrested on November 5, 1962, for failure to buy a
Federal wagering tax stamp. He is presently out on bail awaiting
trial.
Blackburn supervises the five lottery bankers who control central

Mr. BRANCHI. These five exceptions have been connected with this
operation for a number of years, however, and their names and amounts
gross and net collections appear in much of the evidence that we
have secured from checkup houses. We have also sworn testimony
from witnesses that these persons have been engaged in illegal
gambling.
Senator MUSKIE. What is the size of their take?
Mr. BRANCH. I have that further along in my statement, sir.
The lottery operation of the Blackburn group extends from Orange
County into all of central Florida and into the southern State of
Georgia.
From 1948 until the latter part of 1953, our department established
that Santo Trafficante, Jr., and his brother, Henry, personally were
siting Orlando and supervising the checkup houses that were con-
acting the lottery.

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS 531
The latest raid, in July of this year, indicated a gross revenue of
$250,000 per week.
From those figures-
The CHAIRMAN. Where was that raid?
Mr. BRANCH. That was in Sanford, Fla., just 17 miles north of
Orlando. These figures are established by the Internal Revenue agents
and auditors.
From these figures, it is easy to see why the Mafia has moved so
heavily into lottery gambling in central Florida and why gambling
revenues are universally acknowledged to be the "lifeblood" of orga-
nized crime.
Any additional legislation that this subcommittee can promote to
further restrict and inhibit gambling will, in our opinion, be a sub-
stantial blow to organized crime.
Senator MUSKIE. Did they actually pay off on those lotteries or
was it dishonest in that respect, too?
Mr. BRANCH. Usually they pay off.
They don't pay off when we pull a raid on them or arrest them.
They stop at that. But they are in operation the next week.
The CHAIRMAN. You mean they do not pay off for that day?
Mr. BRANCH. No, sir; they don't.
The CHAIRMAN. It is unfortunate for the fellow that won, who
cannot get his winnings.
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. If the law enforcement is pretty vigilant, I would
be afraid to place a bet under those circumstances.
All right, Chief, if you will, you may proceed.
Stand by, Sergeant, as we may want to ask you some questions..
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
TESTIMONY OF NEIL G. BROWN_Resumed
Mr. BROWN. To understand the crime network Trafficante operates
it is necessary to examine the modern era of crime in Tampa, which
dates from the early 1920's. Its most violent episodes were between
1937 and 1945, when the Sicilian underworld was attempting to move
in on all illegal gambling in Tampa. This period in the history of our
city was referred to as "the era of blood."
Senator MUSKIE. Who coined that phrase, the gang or the news-
papers?
Mr. BROWN. I think it was the newspapers, Senator.
During the 1920's, before the Sicilian underworld moved into the
rackets to any great extent, one of our most notorious residents, Charles
M. Wall, started his rise to become the acknowledged boss of most of
the illegal gambling in the Tampa and central area of the State of
Florida. He styled himself "dean of the underworld," and in 1953 he
admitted to a Hillsborough County solicitor that he had made his liv-
ing from illegal gambling. During 1915, Wall forfeited his leadership
by entering into a partnership with Santo Trafficante, Sr.
The elder Trafficante was born in Sicily in 1886. He came to Tampa
h 1904 and became a naturalized citizen in 1925. In 1950, he was one
of the missing witnesses in the Kefauver crime hearings held in
Tampa. He died on August 11, 1954. Police records do not show any
arrest for Santo Trafficante, Sr.
In 1952, Wall declared that he was retiring, although he did not

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
It has also been obvious to us that the Trafficante organization has
controlled the Blackburn operation for at least the last 10 years.
From our examination of seized records, and from the fact that in
all raids on the checkup houses we have arrested persons having
close family ties with the Trafficante organization who were acting
as auditors for his interests. In addition, there has been heavy tele-
phone toll traffic between the Trafficantes in Tampa and the Blackburn
gohen
group in Orlando.
When Blackburn was arrested in 1953, a memorandum was found
containing telephone numbers of Augustine Primo Lazzara, Salva-
tore J. Lorenzo, J. M. Cacciatore-uncle of Santo Trafficante, Jr.-and
Santo Traficante, Jr., and of the Nebraska and Flamingo Bars, both
owned by the Trafficante family.
In 1957 a search of a gambling house in Orange County by a State
officer, with the assistance of the Orlando Police, resulted in the
per-
arrest of several persons. One of these was Lorenzo and another
son by the name of Leto, from Tampa. They both gave sworn state-
ments at that time to the county solicitor that they were working for
Santo Trafficante, Jr.
In November 1961, another raid was conducted by agents of the
Internal Revenue Service in conjunction with the Orlando Police
Department on a house in Orange County. There were six persons
arrested, and among those were Armando Rios and Sam Cacciatore.
These two were cousins of Santo Trafficante, Jr.
In July 1963, a raid on a gambling house in Sanford, Fla., by the
IRS agents, with the assistance of the Orlando Police Department,
established that it was another operation of Harlan Blackburn's,
supervised by Clyde Lee. In the records seized there was the phone
number of Traficante's cousin, John Favata Cacciatore, and the
phone number of the printing establishment employing Stefano
Scaglione, who is also on the chart.
During the past 12 years that we know of at least three murders
that have been due to lights for control of lottery operations in the
Orlando area.
The fantastic amount of money taken in by these lottery operations
has been repeatedly established by our raids of these gambling houses.
For example, the raid in 1957 in Orange County, where Frank Ferreri
and Sam Lorenzo were arrested, disclosed that the house was doing
a gross business of $100,000 per week.
Senator MUSKIE. What were they paying out?
Mr. BRANCH. The profit on this operation runs about 50 percent.
The November 1961 raid in Orange County where Armando Rios
and Sam Cacciatore, cousins of Santo Trafficante, were arrested re-
vealed that operation was doing a conservatively estimated gross of
$160,000 per week.
The CHAIRMAN. With the same ratio of half applying there?
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. When you say "net profit," this means after
deductions of the commission which totaled 35 percent?
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. And the prizes.
Mr. BRANCH. Yes, sir.
The commission and also the prizes and what other operating ex-
penses they may have such as automobiles, rent, telephone bills.

Santo Traficante, Sr., and that he was well informed on the activities
of the organization in the United States, in Sicily, and in other coun-
tries of the world. Traficante had told him, Wall said, that the Mafia
in the United States was directed by a local board in every city having
a sizable Sicilian population. There was a national board, headed
by Joseph Profaci in New York City, which was composed of the heads
of the major local boards. Traficante is reported to have said that
Frank Costello, Vincent Mangano, and Joe Massie were influential
members of the national board, and that Frank Nitti and Lucky
Luciano were former members.
According to Wall's account, the Mafia was composed of two dis-
tinct groups, an "inner circle" and an "outer circle." The general rule
was that only natives of Sicily were admitted to the "inner circle,"
while American-born Italians were recruited into the "outer circle."
Wall was told it was possible for a member to be transferred from
"outer" to "inner" status when he performed an act of special merit,
even though he had been born in the United States. The restrictions
were not due to lack of trust by native Italians toward those of Ameri-
can birth, but because the "inner circle" usually took the major part
of the proceeds of the Mafia's illegal activities and, therefore, preferred
to keep the membership of the "inner circle" as small as possible.
Senator MUSKIE. Would you say that this chart represents the
inner circle, Chief?
Mr. BROWN. At the very top portion, Senator, would be the inner
circle.
Below that
Senator MUSKIE. By the "top portion," do you mean-
Mr. BROWN. I would include in that that the three top men would
be in the inner circle and those below that would be in the outer circle.
The CHAIRMAN. Those would only be in the inner circle so far as
the Tampa area is concerned?
Mr. BROWN. That is right.
The CHAIRMAN. Not in the inner circle overall?
Mr. BROWN. No, sir; this is just in the inner circle in the Tampa area.
The CHAIRMAN. But that gives an indication of how the overall
organization is set up.
Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
The CHAIRMAN. You may have it in here, but I may have missed
it, but who was Wall talking to when he gave all this information?
Mr. BROWN. That was a confidential informant.
The CHAIRMAN. I see. Very well.
(At this point Senator Javits entered the hearing room.)
Mr. BROWN. Wall believed the influential Mafia members in Tampa
from 1930 through 1945 were: Santo Trafficante, Sr., Salvatore Itali-
ano, James Lumia, and the Diecidue family-Alfonso, Antonio,
Thomas, and Frank. The Diecidues and their in-laws opposed the
leadership of Trafficante in the Tampa organization. Trafficante told
Wall that Vincent Mangano, of the national board, supported the
Diecidues but that he, Trafficante, was able to stay in power because he
had Joseph Profaci's friendship.
Senator MUSKIE. May I ask a question here?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
Senator MUSKIE. You refer to the national board. I do not recall
any point in this hearing where there was this kind of a direct refer-

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
state what he was retiring from. In April 1955, Wall's body was
found in his home. He had been brutally beaten and his throat had
been slashed. We have never discovered who the murderers were, nor
have we determined their motive. Perhaps Wall was murdered be-
cause the killers learned he had admitted that he was Trafficante's
partner in illegal gambling, and that he disclosed confidential facts
about the Mafia.
In 1960, Sergeant de la Llana obtained-from a confidential source
of known reliability an astounding report about the Mafia and its op-
eration in Tampa. The report had been obtained from Charles Wall
in 1945, approximately 6 months after Trafficante, Senior, had made
himself a partner in Walls' gambling enterprises.
Wall declared that from 1920 through 1945 he controlled gambling
in Tampa and in the Florida counties of Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco,
Hernando, Polk, and Orange. His rival for control of the gambling
rackets was the local Mafia organization. This was headed, he said,
by Santo Traficante, Sr., the Diecidue brothers, James Lumia, Ignacio
Antinori and Salvatore Italiano. Antinori was murdered on October
22, 1940; Lumia was murdered on June 5, 1950; and Italiano fled to
Mexico in 1951.
Wall admitted that he had good reasons for going along with Traffi-
cante, Senior, in 1945; previously the Mafia group had made three at-
tempts on his life; the first was in 1937 as Wall was leaving a bank on
the main street in Tampa; the second try occurred as Wall was leaving
the garage behind his house; the third, in 1940, happened a few blocks
from his house. In the third attempt, a truck passed the automobile in
which Wall was riding and then stopped abruptly in front of the car.
James DeSimone and Nicola Impostato, FBI No. 2716692, each armed
with a shotgun, stepped from the truck and fired at Wall and his
chauffeur. Both escaped with slight injuries. DeSimone and Impo-
stato were known Mafia killers from Kansas City, Mo. They were
staying with the Antinori family at the time.
The CHAIRMAN. Is Wall still living?
Mr. BROWN. No, sir; he was killed.
The CHAIRMAN. Later killed?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. These three attempts failed but later he was killed?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
Wall declared that the Mafia tried to make the public believe that
the organization no longer existed in this country and that Mafia mem-
bers pointed to the end of terrorism among Italian groups as evidence
Wall believed,
that the Mafia was gone from the underworld scene.
however, that the organization had merely changed its type of opera-
tion. He said that other. racketeers had once used the Mafia to
monopolize rackets in major American cities. They had educated the
Mafia so well in the process that the Sicilians had taken over the rackets
themselves. Wall stated that the Mafia learned to consider extortion
from Italian businessmen a "nickel-and-dime" business. They had
discovered that public officials could be corrupted by bribery and that
they could organize to take over the major rackets in the United States.
Wall declared that the Mafia was not dying out, but "was bigger
and better than ever.' " He said that his partner, the elder Trafficante,
had told him that there were some 10,000 active Mafia members in
the United States. Wall stated that the Mafia leader in Tampa was

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
ence to a national organization in the Mafia. Was it referred to as
such?
Mr. Brown. This is the information as Wall has reported that it
consisted of a national board.
Senator MUSKIE. Do you know who he identified as members of the
national board?
Mr. Brown. Well, Joe Profaci and Vincent Mangano were two of
the members of the national board.
The CHAIRMAN. They are shown to be leaders of families, both of
them.
Senator MUSKIE. But those same people are leaders of families in
New York as testified by Valachi.
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. So it is your impression that the heads of the New
York families made up a national board that had jurisdiction over
Tampa, among other places?
Mr. BROWN. That is correct; yes, sir.
Wall declared that there were approximately 40 members of the
Mafia living in the Tampa area and he believed that Trafficante's
share of proceeds of their gambling operation was being divided with
other members of the Mafia.
Information in our files from another confidential source confirms
Wall's statement. In addition it reveals that Antonio Diecidue made
annual trips to Miami for the purpose of renting a house for Vincent
Mangano, who came down from New York every year to spend 2 or 3
months in Miami. This source stated that many important members
of the Mafia visited Mangano in Florida, but that Traficante never
appeared.
Senator MUSKIE. May I ask another question on the national board?
Was it your impression that the national board members shared in
the proceeds of the criminal activities in Tampa?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir; they had a percentage.
Senator MUSKIE. Have you any idea what that percentage was?
Mr. BROWN. No, sir; I have no idea.
The gray shadings on our chart depict the influence of each of
these men.
To me, it appears to be no small coincidence that in
Tampa the Diecidue family lost stature from at least the early 1950's
when Vincent Mangano disappeared; nor that Traficante, Jr., the
Profaci man, was in the immediate vicinity, when Albert Anastasia
was murdered in 1957.
Sergeant de la Llana's intelligence unit has prepared summaries of
the men in Trafficante's organization, along with a commentary of
relevant facts about each of them. So that our information may be
available not only to the subcommittee, but to all police units to whom
your reports are so valuable, I wish to submit these summaries and
commentary for the record, as our exhibit 3a through t; and exhibit 4.

is it?
Mr. O'DONNELL. Will you explain the other exhibit? Go into a

The CHAIRMAN. Let the Chair get this straight first.
The summary that he referred to has been made exhibit 48.
That is what you referred to as "our exhibit 3a"?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Then you say "through t; and exhibit 4." What is

Mr. BROWN. Exhibit 4 is a brief summation on each of the subjects.
The CHAIRMAN. What is your exhibit 3?
Mr. BROWN. They are arrest records of each of the individuals.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well.
Exhibit 48 is the arrest records.
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Your exhibit 4 is a brief summary of each person
on the chart?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. It is of his records and activities?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. It may be received as exhibit No. 49 for reference.
(The document referred to marked "Exhibit. No. 49" for reference,
and may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)
The CHAIRMAN. Now the record is straight.
You may proceed.
Mr. BROWN. Our department has always found it a most difficult
task to obtain evidence sufficient for successful prosecution of Malia
members, because the witnesses who might offer such evidence have al-
ways been reluctant to do so. The paramount reason, of course, is
their fear of Mafia reprisals, since it is common knowledge in Tampa
that the Mafia does not hesitate to use murder for such reprisals and
the relative infrequency with which such professional murders are
successfully prosecuted.
We have categorized certain homicides in the Tampa area, from
1928 to the present, as "gangland slayings." An examination of the
circumstances of some of these murders emphasizes how the Mafia
uses murder to discipline its membership, to revenge itself against vio-
-lators of its code and to otherwise eliminate opposition to its criminal
activities and goals. Of the 23 homicides on the list, only 1 has been
solved. A ratio of less than 5 percent of solution-and that par-
ticular murder was cleared up because it apparently resulted from an
argument, although it is possible that the slayer deliberately provoked
the argument. It was not, therefore, a typical gangland slaying, al-
though the killer and the victim were both underworld figures.
In startling contrast to the number of unsolved gangland slayings,
an examination of all other Tampa homicides from 1958 through
1962 shows that we have had 145 murders and that only 4 are presently
unsolved, a solution ratio of better than 97 percent. From 1960
through 1962, all 83 homicides in our city were solved.

The CHAIRMAN. On those, according to your testimony, it has been
impossible-or you have been unsuccessful, at least, in solving any
of them except the one that appeared so obvious, and it would not
possibly come within the category of "gangland slayings"?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. But you have included it as being the only one
that was solved.
Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
Senator MUSKIE. What are the characteristics of the gangland slay-
ings that makes it so difficult to solve them as contrasted with your
excellent record in other homicides?
Mr. BROWN. Of course, primarily it is because of witnesses who are
reluctant to give the law enforcement any information whatsoever.
In some of our killings-I recall one where we had nine witnesses in
the room and nobody actually saw the murder or knew anything
was going on.
Senator MUSKIE. So this fact has a direct bearing upon the question
of immunity statutes, for example.
Mr. BROWN. That is right. That is correct.
The CHAIRMAN. This, in other words, emphasizes the rigid disci-
pline, the code of underworld law, that cannot be violated without
suffering the penalty of death.
Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
The CHAIRMAN. In other words, the nine who were in the room when
the murder was committed, possibly every one of them knew what
happened.
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir; I would think so.
The CHAIRMAN. I would doubt that somebody did not know it.
But, anyway, they know that the penalty for them talking would be
death.
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
The CHAIRMAN. Even if they were inclined to, and I do not mean
to say they were inclined to, even if one of them were inclined to
talk, he knows what the penalty would be. And that makes it
difficult. That is why you have the trouble in the gangland slayings,
the silence, the threat, the intimidation of a death sentence, of their
being executed by their underworld government if they talk.
Mr. BROWN. That is true.
Senator MUSKIE. Then, Chief, just to nail that point down, they
seem to be more than concerned and clearly are more concerned for
themselves and for their allies than they are about immunity against
prosecution.
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir; that is true. They are afraid for their lives.
The CHAIRMAN. Very well. You may proceed.

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS 537.
Mr. BROWN. I have had these gangland slayings listed, with a few
pertinent comments about each, and submit to the subcommittee this
list as our exhibit 5.
The CHAIRMAN. It may be received and be made exhibit No. 50.
(The document referred to was marked "Exhibit No. 50" for ref-
erence and may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)
(At this point Senator Javits withdrew from the hearing room.)
The CHAIRMAN. You may proceed.
Mr. BROWN. With few exceptions, those murders well reflect Joseph
Valachi's testimony that Mafia members do live by violence and die
by violence.
At least two of the unsolved murders on our list—that of Gus Perez
in 1936 and of Joe "Pelusa" Diaz in 1958-were, in my opinion, di-
rectly attributable to the Mafia's knowledge or belief that the victims
had given to legal authorities evidence incriminating Mafia members.
A third murder of Carl Carramusa, in 1945-taking place in Chi-
cago, involved some Tampa Mafiosi, and is of particular interest in
illustrating the Mafia zeal for vengeance against a member who vio-
lates its rules. It is of further significance, too, in demonstrating the
difliculty of protecting witnesses against the Mafia-and is under-
lining Attorney General Kennedy's request for additional funds for
that purpose, which request I strongly endorse.
The Carramusa case developed in Kansas City, Mo., with certain
aspects related to the Mafia organization in Tampa. The principal
figure in the case was Carl Carramusa, known as a minor member of
the Mafia and a front man for the Mafia's narcotics traffic operation
in Kansas City.
Carramusa was indicted in 1942 for conspiring to violate the Fed-
eral narcotic laws. His codefendants were Joseph DeLuca, Nicola
Impastato, Paul Antinori, Joe Antinori, Charles Gerrgimina, Louis
Ventola, Patsy Ventola, Charles Tiabi, Samuel Pernice, and Fellipo
Fernice. Tampa's Mafia organization was one of the sources of sup-
ply_for the Kansas City group, and at that time the narcotics trade
in Tampa was headed by Paul Antinori and Joseph Antinori, who
had inherited the narcotics leadership from their father, Ignazio An-
tinori. The elder Antinori had been murdered a few years before in
a narcotics deal. All of the defendants in the Kansas City case were
prosecuted successfully, primarily because Carramusa violated the
cardinal Mafia code of l'omerta, or silence, testifying openly against
them at their trial. After the trial, Carramusa went into hiding in
Chicago with his wife and family, changing his name and beginning
a new life under new circumstances.
Three years later, in June of 1945, while he was seated in his auto-
mobile, Carramusa's head was blown off by a shotgun blast. James
Lumia, an associate of the Antinoris, was a suspect in this killing,
but was himself murdered at Tampa in June of 1950. A prime suspect
was the same Nicola Impastato, who had some years before attempted
to kill Charles Wall.
In Tampa we have suffered also the frustration I know that many
☐ of my police colleagues in other cities have experienced-the deliberate
recanting at trial of the original statements of complaining or key
witnesses, because of their fear of Mafia reprisal. A clear instance
of this frustration of law enforcement effort involved three of the
ranking members of the Tampa Mafia.

Could Rosselli Have Linked
Castro Plot to JFK Death?
By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Staff Writer
In 1960, when the CIA was try-
ing to set up a delicate attempt on
the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to
a man once described as "the big-
gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-
try"
West Coast underworld
figure Johnny Rosselli.
Rosselli a seemingly improba-
¡ble conspirator in a government
plot got the "flag-waving" label
from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana,
then Chicago's top crime boss and
a man Rosselli brought into that
same plot..
Now both are dead, murdered in
the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro only
recently made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission
www.gcomm
are vital clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy assassination.
The deaths of Giancana, in June
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in
Washington, where on Friday the
House of Representives voted to re-
open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder.
REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.), who will be chairman of the
panel, said he is "convinced" a con-
spiracy was involved in Kennedy's
death.
Now, in the aftermath of the vi-:
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-
selli, the question arises of what
role, if any, the Kennedy White
House played in the early 1960s.
"deal" the CIA made with the two
underworld figures to have Castro
murdered.
Whether the Kennedy White
House knew about about the CIA's
plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found.
out after the contacts were ended),
the CIA's use of the underworld
seems ironic in retrospect.
Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-
forts to disable organized crime are
well documented.
IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy
wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to
the Senate Rackets Committee, he
too quoted Giancana to make a
point.
He told about Giancana's inter-
view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War II, when
he was asked what he did for a liv-
ing.
"I steal," Giancana is said to
have replied.
Makness
WWW.
So Sam Giancana didn't go to
war and years later would boast to
Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
he stayed out of the Army la-
beled unfit by telling the truth.
1 "What's wrong with the syndi-
cate?" Kennedy, quoted Giancana.
*Two or three of us get together
on a business deal and everybody
says it's a bad thing. Businessmen
do it all the time and nobody
squawks."
A Senate committee began stu-:
dying the Kennedy questions more
than a year ago as it looked at co-
vert CIA activities.
IN AN addendum to the Senate
Intelligence Committee's interim
report last November, Sen. Howard
Baker (R., Tenn.) said, "It is my
personal view that on balance the
likelihood that presidents (the re-
port dealt with Dwight Eisenhower
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)
assassination plots is greater than
the likelihood that they did not."
• Just to trace Rosselli's history
with the CIA is mind-boggling for
the investigators. Yet, it is just one
aspect of the search for his killer.
- Johnny Rosselli born on the
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and
71 when he died was not first
and foremost a CIA operative.
Gente
j
* His greater role as evidenced by
{wo convictions, his associations
and to some extent his own com-
ments, was as an influential, if
publicly lesser known, organized
crime figure.
:
HIS ASSOCIATION with other
identified underworld members
was monitored by law enforcement
agencies as recently as several
weeks before his July 28 disap-
pearance.
*By all accounts, Rosselli was a
charming man, dressing in expen-
sive clothes, married for only two
years in the early 1940s and
known most of his life as one who
easily attracted women.
He was an immigrant who told
in a short autobiography written
about 1967 that his "life of crime"
began as a teenager in Boston, at-
tempting arson for his stepfather
and stealing $50 on his own. As he
traveled west, finally to settle in.
California, his attention turned to
(bootlegging, gambling and dab-
bling in the movie business.
IT IS said that Rosselli guarded
the West Coast gambling interests
for Giancana's Chicago syndicate.
1 Why Rosselli was chosen by the
CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-
clear, although CIA officials have
since testified that they wanted the
kind of contacts in Cuba which or-
ganized crime had made during the
pre-Castro days when Havana was
a gamblers' haven.
Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-
li because he had influence with.
Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid-
ered the key underworld gambling
figure in Havana.
The unraveling of CIA and un-
derworld conspiracies, an awesome :
web spanning decades, is left to a
team of nine in the Metro Homicide
Division. It is a team now clearly
consumed by the task which has
been a full-time operation since
Rosselli's body was pulled from
Dumfoundling Bay on Aug. 7.

"Maybe Rosselli's information
was the vital nerve of the Kennedy"
assassination," a Senate source told
The Herald:

High officials in the Cuban gov- |
ernment also reportedly feel there
was a "Cuban factor" in the JFK
death, but they see it as a result of
exile politics, according to a recent
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-
low of the Council Foreign Rela-
tions in Washington.

Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Gi-
ancana and Johnny Rosselli
surely have some connection with
1 Cuban exile politics and the 'Kenne-
dy murder," Frye wrote.
*
THERE HAVE been theories re-
cently propounded to show why
both pro and anti-Castro forces
could have wanted to get JFK out
of power in 1963.
On the one hand, there is the re-
port of French journalist Jean Dan-
iel, who was the bearer to Castro
of an offer from JFK for calmer re-
lations. Castro was reportedly
agreeable. The report stated that
Daniel later was lunching with.
Castro when word came that Ken-
nedy had been shot. Daniel de-
scribed the Cuban leader as genu-
inely shocked by the news.
It has since been learned that
probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
from a CIA agent in what was a
long-running anti-Castro effort..
That Cuban agent was code-named:
AM/LASH, and he has since been
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi-
nation plotting.
WHETHER JFK had knowledge
of, or perhaps even approved, any
of the assassination plots will prob
ably never be known:
His closest advisers, who testi
fied before the Senate Committee
all said he had no knowledge of
such plots and would never have
approved of them.
The same month Rosselli was
passing poison pills to his Cuban
contact at a meeting at the 'Fon-
tainebleau, March of 1961, former
Florida Sen. George Smathers, a
friend of Kennedy, said he and
Kennedy discussed the ramifica-
tions of a Castro assassination.
Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-
cussion was more of a "brain-pick-
ing" session.
AT LEAST one high-level CIA
official did testify he believed the
White House was being briefed on
the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of “plau-
sible deniability."
That, according to the recent
Senate report, "can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-'
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed."
Another alleged link between'
the White House and the under-
world plotters, first made public by
the Senate Committee, has also
been denied by virtually everyone
involved. Judith Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have.
been friend and lover to both Gian-
cana and JFK, introduced to both
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in
the Castro plotting, those close to w
both Giancana and Kennedy have.
said.
A MAN with access to Kenne-
dy's closest advisers told The Her-
ald recently, "The Giancana-Ros-
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner
thing. I was there. Sure JFK knew
her, but he was naive about those
kinds of things.

that on March 22, 1962, Hoover.
lunched privately with Kennedy:
and presumably gave him his first
information linking Exner with the
gangsters. The final recorded..
phone call between the White
House and Exner was made only a
few hours later.
Another possible link discussed
in the Senate report shows that the
same unidentified Cuban to whom
Rosselli passed the poison pillsrta
prior to the Bay of Pigs operation
in April of 1961, was among a
group of Cuban exile leaders who
met with JFK following the inva
sion fiasco.
IT IS known that several of the
Cubans with whom Rosselli
worked have been identified, but.
investigators say that not all are
known.
As a condition to his appear--
ances before the Senate Committee;
in the past year, it was agreed that
Rosselli "would not state the
names or confirm the existence of
those agents whom he knew
àbout," Rosselli's attorney Leslie)
Scheer said.
The friends and acquaintances of
Rosselli who could be contacted by
The Herald all said they never
heard the names of the Cuban
agents.
But a committee source cau-
tioned, "they (Cuban agents) read
the committee's report, they knows
who's being referred to."

past for enemies also presents
problems, investigators say.
The decline of John Rosselli ap-
pears to begin in the late 1960s. In
1967, he was convicted in a card-
cheating scandal at the posh, celeb--
rity-filled Friar's Club in Los An-
geles where the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ac->
cording to investigators.
Deportation pressures were also
mounting at this time.
"
ROSSELLI entered prison on the
conviction in 1970 where he would;
serve three years of a five-year.
sentence..
In 1971, he was brought to a
federal grand jury in Los Angeles
which was probing whether some
indentified Detroit organized crime
leaders conspired with the Emprise
Corp. a giant firm with nation-
wide race track and sporting event
concessions to hide financial in-
terests in the Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas.

Rosselli, too, had, an interest in

concession is unclear, but Breen
said it gave Rosselli an income of
about $60,000.

a major influence in Las Vegas.

owners of the Desert Inn wanted

•
With Rosselli's death this sum-
mer, the newly appointed Senate
committee saw its list of knowl-
edgeable witnesses further trim-
med. Some of those witnesses have
died violently and some from natu-
ral causes.

June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle

known.
even
The death of Rosselli, who had
appeared before the committee
three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con-
cern on Capitol Hill.
THE SAME night Rosselli's body
was identified the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
into an oil drum Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for the FBI to
get involved in the case. (Several
days later, Attorney General Ed-
ward Levi ordered FBI involve-
ment.)
It wasn't until several weeks
later, however, that what was
known to Baker became public
knowledge.
A section of the former commit-
tee's April report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967. went.
to Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren (chairman of the
then-disbanded Warren: Commis-
sion) to say that two of his clients:
believed they knew about Cuban:
agents in the United States whil
conspired in the assassination of
John F. Kennedy,
THE INFORMATION: eventually
⠀ reached the FBI, but as the Senate
committee concluded this year, the
1967 FBI probe was slipshod and
incomplete.
One of the clients referred to in
the report has since been identified
as Rosselli. And it has since been
learned that Rosselli was con-
vinced he held a vital clue to the
JFK murder.
"There was never the slightest.
doubt in John's mind that Castro
was responsible for the assassina-
tion of Kennedy," said Edward P.
Morgan, the attorney referred to in
the report.
Morgan is an attorney of no
mean stature in Washington. He
served as chief counsel to the joint.
congressional committee which
studied the Pearl Harbor attack,
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
years was chief inspector of the
FBI.
ROSSELLI told Morgan about
the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-
partment of Justice was vigorously
attempting to deport Rosselli for
being an illegal alien.
Rosselli, Morgan said, "was cer-
tain that the people he (Rosselli)
put around Castro in the CIA plot
turned right around and killed Ken-
nedy. The people he still knew (in
1967) did it."
Rosselli, according to Morgan,
decided to talk about his CIA activ-
ity in hopes of decreasing the pres-
sure from the FBI and Department.
of Naturalization and Immigration,
both Justice Department agencies.
Several friends of Rosselli, in-
: cluding Morgan, say they are con-
vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli
to become an organized crime in-
formant by threatening to have
him deported if he didn't coopera-
te.
IN 1961, through a bungled
wiretap effort, the FBI became.
aware of Rosselli's CIA activities.
While Giancana and Rosselli .
were in Florida planning the opera-
tion, Giancana wanted to return to
Las Vegas to check on his girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he
suspected of dating comedian Dan-
Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori-
da, it was agreed that a bug would
be placed in her hotel room and her
conversations monitored.
But the private detective they
hired, with CIA money, it has since
been learned, was discovered and
arrested. Eventually the police in-
vestigation led back to the Castro
plotters.
Prosecution was avoided when
the CIA intervened and said the
"national interest" would be dam-
aged if the plot information be-
came public.
.
WHEN THE wiretap case was
again to be investigated in 1966,
this time by a Senate committee
headed by the late Sen. Edward
Long (D., Mo.), the CIA again step-
ped in to stop it.
:
9
Morgan was told about the pend-
ing investigation by Rosselli and
Robert Mahue, a former FBI
agent-turned Howard Hughes aide
who was the CIA's initial link to.
Rosselli.
Mahue told Morgan that both he
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to
appear before the committee. Mor-
gan said he called Lawrence Housi
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous-
ton went to Long and the investi-
gation was dropped.
MORGAN SAID he knew, as the
Senate committee recently empha-
sized as well; that all information!
about the CIA plots. which could
have been the incentive for pro-
Castro forces to kill Kennedy
had been kept from the Warren
Commission.
"I was an admirer of Earl War-.
ren," Morgan said. "(His) report:
said that Oswald alone killed
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after
so gruesome a detail from Rosselli
that the Chief Justice could put his
· name on a report which didn't as-
sess the most significant piece of
evidence bearing on the killing of
Kennedy."
The information Morgan had
was passed to Warren via colum-
nist
Drew Pearson, a mutual
friend. Eventually, it reached the
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-*
rect orders from President Lyndon
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-
vestigation was not vigorously pur-
sued.
THE SENATE Intelligence Com-
mittee compared that apparent. in-
action with a statement former FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover made to
the Warren Commission on May 5,.
1964. Hoover said, "well, I can as-
Isure. you so far as the FBI is con
cerned. the case will be continued;
in an open classification for all
time. That is, any information com-
ing to us or any report coming to:
us from any source will be thor-i
oughly investigated, so that we
will be able to prove or disprove
the allegation."
A Senate Committee staff memb
ber commented recently, "what is
really happening is that the investi-
gation which the FBI should have
done in 1967 and no one can
come close to explaining why it
wasn't is actually being done
now."
HART, AS have local investiga-
tors. has established three possible
scenario's for Rosselli's death: his
recent organized crime activity, re-
taliation for his Castro assassina-
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.

some "high rollers" in would be
more profitable it was Rosselli
who patched things up.
Hughes eventually bought the
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.
What Rosselli told the federal
grand jury about the Frontier in
1971 is unknown. Rosselli didn't
testify later at the trial at which
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-
izzi and the Emprise Corp., among
others, were convicted.
on
ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in
jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select Committee
Crime probed the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports and one
area they looked at was Emprise.
and the Frontier Hotel case.
At the time of the conviction, the
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately,
• because monitored, wiretapped'
conversations showed that the two
had talked about "murder, the kill-
ing of certain individuals.'
"$
An intimate associate of Rosselli,
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli's grand jury appear-
ance could have led to his death.
"They know Johnny didn't talk to
the grand jury," the associate said.
.
JOE BREEN said Rosselli hadn't
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that "he's never even seen the gift
shop."
Since his prison
his prison release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn't
trying to regain power; according
to his friends. "He had no muscle.
said an associate."I can't believe
Rosselli was getting back into mob
stuff."
But at the same time, many of
the associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized crime fig-
ures on the West Coast.
Several associates speculate that
Rosselli wanted to get involved in
casino gambling, preferably in the
Middle East, and was looking for
someone with money to back him..
"MY IMPRESSION was that he
was broke," Morgan said. "He told
me last year, 'I'm in bad financial
: straits."
9 99
Scheer said Rosselli's income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
ernment fines.
One friend said that just before
Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac--
cepted Giancana's offer of money.
The friend was to act as the inter-
mediary. “Let me figure out what
my next (attorney's) tab will be,"
the friend quoted Rosselli as say-
ing.
Rosselli is described as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-
tle offending.
A California woman who had
known Rosselli for about 40 years:

538 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS
One day in 1953, one Joe Castellano went to the Italian Club in
Tampa to play cards with a group of friends. During the course
of the evening, he talked to Salvatore Scaglione privately. Scaglione
asked Castellano if he wanted to make a profit on a "hot load" of
whisky. Castellano said he was interested, and they agreed to meet
later that night.
At the meeting, Scaglione was accompanied by Joe Mistretta and
Angelo LoScalzo. Castellano got into the front seat of a car provided
by the others, and the four men drove to a thickly wooded area outside
of Tampa city limits. Castellano was then attacked with a hammer,
being hit repeatedly on the head. He managed to get out of the car,
although he was badly hurt. He broke loose from his elderly assail-
ants and ran away. He stumbled into a nearby house and asked to
be taken to the constable's house, where he gave a statement about
the incident, naming the three as his assailants. He swore to the
county solicitor that he had no idea why he was beaten. Scaglione,
Mistretta, and LoScalzo were arrested and charged with assault with
intent to murder.
Joe Castellano disappeared for a period of time. After he was
found, the case went to trial. Castellano changed his story completely
and testified that he had injured himself while hunting on the night
of the attack. The predictable result, of course, was a verdict for the
defendants of "not guilty."
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO FIGHT
ORGANIZED CRIME
I believe firmly that it is almost impossible for the Police Depart-
ment of the City of Tampa, or any other municipality, to cope ef-
fectively with the activities of a national or international crime
syndicate such as these hearings show exists in the United States.
One of the main problems is that the most dedicated, well-trained,
and well-staffed police force is almost always limited legally and
financially to the territorial boundaries of its municipality. For
example, the Tampa Police Department is obviously interested in
and informed about the activities of Santo Trafficante. However, in
the past the department was unable to do anything about Trafficante's
operations in pre-Castro Cuba; it has no jurisdiction or control of
his illegal affairs in Miami and elsewhere in central Florida. The
department could only record that he attended the Apalachin meeting
in November of 1957, but it could do nothing about this obvious evi-
dence that he was a high-ranking member of a national crime
syndicate.
In the light of our experience with the Mafia in our own city's
underworld, I submit for this subcommittee's consideration some sug-
gestions for Federal legislation which I believe would certainly help
local law enforcement agencies to fight organized crime more
effectively.
1. More ample funds must be obtained by local agencies to recruit
high caliber police personnel and to retain superior personnel having
the experience and capabilities to understand, investigate, and prose-
cute organized criminal conspiracies. Because of the demonstrated
interstate nature of organized crime, Federal legislation similar to

C. Evidence
The "two witness rule" was not appli-
cable in showing that defendant violated
this section proscribing obstruction of
justice by influencing witness to give
false testimony and information to Sen-
ate Committee and its investigators, and
testimony of one person alone was suffi-
cient to convict. Stein v. U. S., C.A.Cal.
1964, 337 F.2d 14, certiorari denied 85 S.Ct.
SS9. 380 U.S. 907, 13 L.Ed.2d 795.
Testimony of one person alone is suffi-
cient to convict defendant for obstructing
justice in influencing witness to give
false testimony to Senate Committee and
to give false and perjurious information
to committee investigators. Id.
Evidence sustained convictions under
counts charging corruptly inducing wit-
ness to testify falsely and corruptly in-

LIEBENGOOD ROUTH NOTES FROM U. S. V. VECIANA, ET AL
DATE :
December 1, 1976
I
Veciana was represented by Barry L. Garber, 1040 City National
Bank Building, 25 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida 33130
(305-377-4963)
!!
Veciana became implicated as the result of a drug bust
of one Augustine Barres, a/k/a/ Emidigio Augustine Barres Fangul
("Gus Barres"). The bust resulted from an search warrant of
23 July 73 for Barres' attache case at the Taft Hotel in New
York. The police were acting on an informant tip to an under-
cover agent who arranged for a buy from Barres of seven kilograms
of Cocaine at the Taft. The police understood that Barres was to
be with a "female" courier. Barres advised DEA task force re-
presentative, Eugene W. Flynn, a detective sgt. with the NYPD,
that he purchased the seven kilos from Antonio Veciana in Miami
on July 21, 1973.
Barres owns a home in Puerto Rico and travels to New York
every two weeks on business.
A co-defendant of Veciana's in the case was Ariel Pomares
who is the President of Occidental Investment, a real estate
firm owned by Barres, located at 1186 J. T. Pinero Avenue,
Miami. Pomares is also involved with FRECA Imports in Puerto
Rico. This is also a Barres enterprise.
The DEA Miami regional office cables that Veciana is the
subject of INS File No. A12-490987 and that he claims to be a
public accountant.
According to the Miami Herald of July 25, 1973, Barres was
Assistant Secretary of Communications under Castro and later the
general manager of the Havana Health Department. He fled Cuba
in 1961 for asylum in Puerto Rico. He became a United States
citizen in 1970.
A cable from Ivan Wurms, the Chief Investigator of the DEA
Task Force to Durkin at DEA headquarters, Washington, states that
Veciana was arrested without incident on 7/24/73 and signed a
"consent to search" form. Miscellaneous papers and numerous

foreign passports belonging to several subjects were seized.
Swiss bank account deposit slips were seized and are to be
followed by IRS. Veciana claims to be an anti-Castro fund
raiser. FBI confirms this.
.
A July, 1973 TWIX from DEA in New York to DEA headquarters
Washington (attention: Daniel P. Casey, Acting Chief) referenced
as subject: G1-73-X093 (presumably Veciana) and states "during
debriefing of the defendant in New York on July 25, 1973, it was
learned that Antonio Carlos Veciana, 811 North Southwest 30th
Court, Miami is a member of an anti-Castro group which he has
stated intends to blow up a number of Cuban properties and/or
embassies in foreign nations, i.e., Spain, Mexico, Peru and France.
Bombings originally scheduled for July now delayed until August.'
Subpoena of August 14, 1973 exists for a telegram billed to
Veciana at 649-1226 and sent to Barcelona, Spain on 5/26/73.
Barres implicates a Paraguyan diplomat formerly assigned
to LaPaz, Bolivia and reassigned to Spain in the drug traffic.
DEA is discretely checking his identity. A follow-up cable
from DEA indicates that they have failed to identify the Paraguyan
diplomat sent to Spain but do indicate that a Pedro P. Medina,
a Paraguyan assigned to LaPaz, is believed to be involved in
Cocaine smuggling.
Barres admitted that he was responsible for bringing Pomares,
an employee of his, into illegal drug activity.
!
Veciana claimed to be without funds and destitute and was
not fined. The U. S. Attorney was concerned that he posted a
$100,000 bail immediately. However, after initial concern being
shown in the file by the U. S. Attorney, the U. S. Attorney later
writes the Judge that $80,000 of the $100,000 bond was furnished
by Veciana's cousin, Dr. Pueblo Zalduendo, a phycian from Detroit,
Michigan. The remainder of the bail money was furnished by Veciana's
uncle and other family members and friends who cashed insurance
policies, closed children's savings accounts, etc. U. S. Attorney
concluded that Veciana was possibly telling the truth when he advised
the Court that he was destitute.
Jose
One Hosea Lopez is a character reference for Barres on
appeal.

Liebengood Rough Notes on U. S. v. Veciana, et al, con't.
In Veciana's appellate brief he references transfers of
drugs through the government's "APO System". He indicates that
the first transaction he was involved in took place in April,
1972.
Also involved is someone known as "the midget".

Liebengood Rough Notes from U. S. v. Veciana, et al, con't.
Barres says he requested the government to give immunity to
Veciana in order to destroy the traffic of Cocaine from Bolivia.
Barres studied at Columbia Military Academy in Columbia,
Tennessee in 1951.
A taped transcript of Barres' debriefing by detectives
Flynn and Scamardella on July 25, 1973 reveals the following:
Barres got involved in drugs through his friend Veciana who was
an officer of the International Development Bank in the U.S.
Embassy in Bolivia. Some people think Veciana is with the CIA
but Barres does not know. Barres dealt with Veciana regarding
an attempt to kill Castro in Chile. He says Veciana did a good
job of transferring everything into Chile (1970-1971). Barres
gave Veciana $2,000 in support of this assassination effort.
About this time Veciana said that drugs could be smuggled out of
Bolivia through diplomatic pouch. Barres thought this was how
Veciana had sent weapons into Chile. Barres advised that the head
of Interpol in Bolivia gets a cut of drug money for protection on
the Bolivian end and that a Secret Service Agent and two Paraguyan
diplomats were also involved. They handled the transfer to
Veciana in Miami Beach of the drugs from Bolivia.
Barres thought that the individual he was selling the drugs
to in New York was a mafia type. It appears this is the indi-
vidual who informed the police. He is known only as Tony in the
transcript. The police were aware of his identity but did not
desire Barres to discuss it.
Pomares' counsel, Gustavo Del Toro, urged the DEA in San
Juan at the time of the arrest of Pomares to consider immunity
for Pomares because Pomares possessed valuable information re-
garding international narcotic trafficing, including the impli-
cation of diplomats in places such as Bolivia, Paraguay and
Nicaragua.
:
The file contains cancelled Veciana checks drawn on the
account of Antonio Sira Veciana at the Fidelity National Bank,
5880 Byrd Road, Miami, Florida, in May and June, 1972, for $1,000
each, payable to the Swiss Bank Corporation for account EF558230.
These checks were obtained through subpoena on Catherine Hune,
Vice President and Cashier of the Fidelity National Bank in Miami.

RE: Antonio Veciana

:
To Veciana
fele
Telephoned Veciana to ask if he recalled any attempts on
his life in late 1962 or 1963. He answered that there were
three attempts on his life, but none in 1962 or 1963. The
first attempt, he said; occurred in a stadium in Puerto
Rico in 1967 when a bomb exploded approximately 20 meters.
away. He said he believed Puerto Rican communists were
responsible for this attempt. The second attempt occurred
in Bolivia in approximately 1970 when some men with weapons
appeared at a home where he was supposed to be. He said a
woman who owned the home called him to warn him. He said
he thought this attempt was related to a revolution which
was taking place at that time. The third attempt, he said,
occurred in Caracas, Venezuela in 1971. He added that he had
received information within the past three months that Castro
wanted to kidnap him.
The only relevant incident in late 1962 or 1963 was that
an Isobel Zarate began making inquiries about him in Miami. He
said many people in the Cuban community informed the FBI she
was a Castro spy and that she subsequently escaped to Cuba via
Mexico.

2. A new analysis of all the long distance toll calls
of Jack Ruby in the days around Nov. 22. Warren Comm.
records show he made calls to Chicago 0.6. figure
Barney Baker, and Teamster heavy Dusty Miller, plus
others. Does the explanation for these calls really
wash (i.e. Ruby's union troubles in re his nightclub).
Has this whole subject been exhausted by Warren
Comm. or not. Is there more (interviews, etc.) that
should be done here?
3. Someone should literally live in Miami area for
a month, immerse in the community, get to know the
whole scorecard, (maybe hire a local Spanish-speaking
cop with good local contacts). More fully debrief
Trafficante for his version of events and people.
Follow up with contacts with all the Cubans involved.
Has Miami pulled all the significant toll records
for period of time around Rosselli's death (Cubans,
O.C. figures, garage owner, etc.) and followed up.
4. A full tracking of what happened when Church reports
were released, reactions, contacts, concerns, who
were the key figures who actually got the reports and
who did they speak to about the giяEEX contents.
Review our own mailing records, if exist, a showing who
asked for reports. Local нEяX news Eix media for leads
in re reactions of the community. Travel records of
0.C. and Cuban leaders in and around that time, as well
as in and around time of Rosselli's death.

I. Carry-over from Church report
A. Relationship between agencies and Warren Commission
1. Warren Comm. staff has never been interviewed in
depth. Many have not been interviewed at all. The
Commission had particular staff assigned to (a) Cuba
and (b) organized crime. They, especially, should be
fully debriefed about everything that happened in their
contacts with the agencies, their frustrations, unful-
filled leads, inability to get access, questionmarks,
and what they knew, heard, or suspected about contacts
at high-level between Commission members and top agency
officials. This would include leads to additional
documents, memoranda and people, and is especially
important in the time-frame just before the Commission
issued its report, i.e. as final drafts being written,
when staff learned for the first time about Castro's
threat. (Willens, staff director, said there were staff
pushing hard to re-open this subject, but pressure of
getting the report out prevailed.)
2. Look for all other memoranda of contacts between
McCone and CIA re how to structure questions, etc.
3. We now know that Ruby was contacted svereal times
by FBI to inform on Ø§¤¤İZEŃɣEXÌµ¤××§aÌÌµ¤xaxgax
("criminal element" in Dallas area. All we've seen
is the cummary memo in which warmen Commission was
so informed. Get each memorandum of contact between
FBI agents and Ruby, i.e. underlying materials which
"support" the summary memo.
B. The inter-agency committee which met to develop
continegncy plans in the wake of Castro's threat.
1. Numerous documents were sought from FBI, CIA,
Defense, State, etc., but never received by Church
Committee before our final report was issued. Must
follow-through, and then go deeper into it.
2. What else was known besides Castro's retaliation
threat? What facts went into the assessment that
Castro might retaliate against U.S. leaders in Latin
America, but not U.S. leaders in the U.S.? Precisely
what accounted for the original inclusion of
a concern about retaliation in the U.S., but the sub-
sequent deletion of that prospect? Who was responsible
for the deletion, and what impact, if any, did that
have on the later of withholding of info from the
Warren Commission and on the agencies' failure to
investigate retaliation?
3. We must find out exactly who was on this Committee
at each meeting, get all back-up materials, and interview.

SUBJECT:
MARITA LORENZ
5986
Ms. Lorenz called this afternoon to express her desire
to come to Washington and tell us "all the things held back
on" in New York. Her desire to cooperate has been engendered
by two events, i.e., Sturgis told the German press of her
FBI spying on the head of the Soviet U.N. Mission and she
had a chance encounter with the Soviet on December 26 which
frightened her. She claims to want her information in
responsible hands as soon as possible and requests we subpoena
her (i.e. pay her way) here and make one night's accommodation
for her. What do you think? I am to call her back on Monday,
January 3 at 212-534-2412. My personal opinion is that we
have little to lose if we have time to listen to her.
Howard: I have no objections to her coming down, but
would be personally hesitant to invest any more of my own time unless
she m can provide at least a specific adjenda of new information she
will discuss.
11
One possible tactic is to tell her that we are extremely
pressed for time and cannot subpena her until late February unless she
give us specific areas that would allow us to show "our superiors"
that talking to her should be given a hökm higher præ priority
other committee business.

beginning to learn about how deeply the FBI was apparently
involved in U.S. anti-Castro action. Possibility
here that this could provide another clue in re
FBI's original reluctance to investigate retaliation
more fully. For instance we now know that FBI had
learned about CIA's interest in using organized
crime to kill Castro long before RFK toldx\@@@xx
Hoover about it (Hoover had professed surprise in
1963, but there's some indication he may have already
known). One FBI witness even told us that a high FBI
official a had even proposed the plot idea "in jest".

org. crime figures to provide Cuban intelligence and
that, according to the paper record, FBI recommended
against it. Trafficante has now claimed that FBI agents
came to him seeking Cuban intelligence. This must be
followed up, agents interviewed, and FBI memo's, etc.,
examined.
D. CIA files
I always had the impression that Jim Johnston felt
there were more CIA documents which he hadn't seen.
We must go over the itmes, one by one, with Johnston,
to find out just where we stand on the question of
whether or ø not weve seen everything. Do any of us
really fully understand the entire CIA filing system
so as to know whether we've been shown everything, or
indeed whether they have even as g-ne looking for
everything.? And how about the field office files,

Subject: Review of CIA documents presented the SCI by Jack Anderson
The documents recently received by this Committee, from Jack
Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff.
The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review
by David Belin. It is my understanding, after these documents were
declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin (AP)
and Jack Anderson.
The Church Committee was permitted to review the entire Oswald
201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected Office of
Security files. The Committee primarily concerned itself with the
early period of the investigation (November 1963 - October 1964), as
it believed the information to be received from this time period
to be more relevant in evaluating the performance of the intelligence
agencies with respect to their investigation.
. | .
Dan Niescher, the Church Committee contact at the CIA, was the
individual responsible for the declassification of documents
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy. During this
declassification process, Dan Niescher consulted the Committee staff
to make sure that we were aware of certain documents. In addition,
Mr. Kaleras had given the staff unlimited access to all files we
believed necessary to conduct our investigation.
☐ ☐
Yet, the possibility still remains that the staff was not
shown everything. The CIA has maintained throughout that the Oswald
201 file was a complete compilation of the material related to the
assassination of President Kennedy. However, information relating to
who Lee Harvey Oswald was, and what he was doing are not included.in
their files. The Oswald 201 does not attempt to question Oswald's
connection with both pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups or any of
the AMLASH information. The most notable subject missing was inform-
ation relating to CIA/U.S. Government attempts to assassinate Fidel
Castro.

Four and a half years ago, I broke a story that now is belatedly rocking
Washington. I reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had recruited two
Mafia figures, John Roselli and Sam Giancana, to assassinate Cuban Premier
Fidel Castro.

I tracked down Roselli and questioned him about the story. He had nothing
He promised me, however, that he would give me his exclusive story
if he should ever be free to talk.
ORD
Yesterday, John Roselli told his story first, to the Senate Intelligence
Committee in secret session, then to me as he had promised four and a half
years ago.
Roselli
dapper, hawk-faced man with a thatch of white hair. He has
been disciplined all his life to keep his mouth shut. His Mafia partner,
Sam Giancana, was slain before Senate investigators could serve him with
a subpoena.
So it was obviously painful for Roselli to talk. I promised I would make
clear that he revealed no names, except for the CIA contacts whose identities
the Senate already knew.
So here is Roselli's own account of a real-life "Mission Impossible"

front in Washington.

According to Roselli, the murdered mobster, Sam Giancana, never became
involved in the assassination plot. He knew about it; he may even have suggested
a Cuban contact; nothing more.
1
Roselli identified the CIA project officer, in charge of the Castro
assassination, as "Big Jim" O'Connell.
Maheu put Roselli in contact with
O'Connell, as Roselli remembers it, in New York City on September 14, 1960.
Thereafter, Roselli flew to Miami and recruited the assassination squads.
At first, they plotted to poison Castro. Poison pellets were supplied by the CIA.
They were delivered to the plotters in a Miami hotel room, according to Roselli,
by Maheu. He dramatically opened his briefcase, revealing $10,000 in cash
and the fatal pellets.
The money was distributed tothe Cuban plotters. Roselli swore he never
took any money from the CIA, except for some incidental expenses. He paid the
big expenses, he said, out of his own pocket.
The poison pills were supposed to take three days to work. Supposedly,
this would give the poison time to work its way out of Castro's system before
he died, and his death would be attributed to natural causes.
Roselli never found out what happened to the plotters or the pellets. But
they tried again later with a stronger dose of poison. Not long afterward, reports
reached them that Castro was desperately ill. Roselli doesn't know whether the
illness was caused by the poison or a virus. But Castro survived, and the
plotters apparently did not.
Toselli said he also picked up intelligence, which he submitted to the CIA
both during the Bay of Pigs planning and the later Cuban missile crisis. After
the Bay of Pigs, Roselli said, Maheu was cut out of the plot. Thereafter,
Roselli reported to a CIA agent named William Harvey.

Trafficante Made Secret Appearance
At Senate Investigation, Sources Say
By RON LABRECQUE
Herald Staff Writer
Florida's reputed organized
crime boss, Santos Trafficante of
Tampa and Miami, made a secret,
four-hour October appearance be-
fore the Senate Intelligence Com:
mittee to answer questions about
his role in a CIA assassination plot,
investigation sources have dis-
closed.
Trafficante, 62, had not previ-
ously been questioned by the com-
mittee or its staff in the two-year-
old investigation of CIA activities.
Of the three Mafia figures in-
volved in the early 1960s plot to
kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
only Trafficante is still alive. Both
Sam Giancana and John Rosselli
were murdered within the last 16
months.
The murders are unsolved.
INVESTIGATORS ALSO said
that Trafficante had dinner with
Rosselli at The Landings, a Fort
Lauderdale restaurant, in mid-July,
less than two weeks before Rossel-
li disappeared. Rosselli's body,
stuffed in an oil drum. floated to
the surface of Dumfoundling Bay
the first week of August.
Trafficante reportedly has told
police that the July dinner with
Rosselli - as well as several other
meetings previously at the Cordoba
Restaurant in Miami. formerly
owned by the husband of Rosselli's
niece, according to police - were
"friendly, social events with no
business."
Investigators in recent weeks'
have centered their efforts on trac-
ing the whereabouts of Traffi-
cante's associates at the time of
Rosselli's disappearance. a source
said.

could not be reached for comment.
Trafficante was identified as the
head of a South Florida Mafia fam-
ily in testimony in 1963 before a
U.S. Senate subcommittee. •
HIS ATTORNEY, Henry Gonza-
lez of Tampa, who accompanied
Trafficante when he went to
Washington, according to sources,
would not comment on either the
Senate appearance or Trafficante's
past activities. When first asked
about the Senate appearance, he
said, "You realize you're treading
on dangerous ground,"
A committee source said that
Trafficante had not been ques-
tioned previously by the committee
because his role in the plot had
been considered “secondary."
Interest was renewed in the plot
after Rosselli's death. Investigators
sought to determine whether the
murders of the two men were con-
nected in any way, with their testi-
mony or potential testimony before,

sassination of John F. Kennedy.
Revelations of the Senate commit-
tee were a key factor in the cre-
ation of the new House of Repre
sentative investigation, which is
taking a new look at the JFK mur
der.
GIANCANA, WHO was a Mafia
boss in Chicago for many years,
was killed in June 1975. at the
same time Senate investigators Trafficante reportedly has told
were preparing to contact him. The investigators that he first met Ros-

Investigators said the gun was
part of a shipment purchased in
1965 by the Tamiami Gun Shop,
but there are no records to indicate
where it went from there, accord-
ing to investigators and gunshop
owners.
Rosselli, whose most powerful
Mafia days were reportedly in the
1950s and early 1960s in Las Vegas
and Los Angeles, did appear before
the committee at least three times
in the 12 months before his death.
In Washington, the committee
has kept a tight clamp on comment
about the investigation, and only
one member, Robert T. Stafford
(R., Vt.), acknowledged the Traffi-
cante session, saying "I was not
present when the witness you
speak of was in front of the com-
mittee."
Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii),
the committee chairman who,
along with Sen. Howard Baker (R.,
Tenn.) pressured for Justice De-
partment and FBI involvement in
the Rosselli murder case, said "I
have never met Mr. Trafficante.
That's as far as I'll go."
A PRIME interest of the commit-
tee has been possible links between

Trafficante was a major gant
where he ran a casino. In 1959, it
was estimated that $1 million or $2
million was bet nightly in all the
Mafia-run casinos in Havana. The
gambling stopped when Castro
took over in 1959.
Rosselli was.. the first of the
three Mafia figures to be recruited
by the CIA in 1960 in its plot to as-
sassinate Castro.
IN A CIA memo quoted in an in-
terim report of the committee &
year ago, it was said that Traffi-
cante's role was to "serve as a cou-
rier to Cuba and make arrange-
ments there.'
Rosselli told his CIA liaison that
"Trafficante believed

a certain
movement might be able to accom-
plish the assassination." An inter-
nal CIA investigation in 1967 “sug-
gests that this Cuban may have
been receiving funds from Traffi

ed in securing 'gambling, prostitu-
tion and dope monopolies' in Cuba
after the overthrow of Castro."

There were four more assassination attempts, the plotters were smuggled
into Cuba with high-powered rifles. The last assassination squad, Roselli heard,
made it to a Havana rooftop before they were caught.
This was around March 1, 1963. Then the project was abandoned. Roselli

Yesterday, Roselli made no apology for his CIA role. U.S. authorities
call him a mobster. He regards himself as a patriot.

ROSELLI, From LI
the enthusiasm of two football players
recalling their favorite bowl games.
The headless, handless body that
floated into a Miami canal last month
reminded Minnium of that other, simi-
larly mutilated body that turned up
last December. And who can forget
the man who got angry with his room-
mate, sliced him up and tossed the
parts along a highway? |
As it turned out, Roselli's wasn't the
first body to float into the annals of Mi-
ami crime in a drum, Minnium says.
Ten years ago a lovers' quarrel re-
sulted in a man stuffing his girl friend
into a drum, filling it with cement and

lent antics.

"We don't appreciate people com-
mitting murder and dumping a body
in our county, regardless of who the
people are, but especially if it's organ-
ized crime," Minnium says.
His department handled 168 homi-
cides last year and boasted an 85 per

1976, the percentage was even higher,
standing at about 92 per cent.

Roselli's killing is not going to dimin-'
ish those percentages. Both men are

vow with a schoolboy's sincerity tha
they won't rest until Roselli's murder
is solved. In the last four weeks, with
the help of Washington agencies, Za-
trepalek and Ojeda have reconstructed
Roselli's life in hopes of understanding
his death. For the third time in eight
years of marriage, Zatrepalek worked
out of town on his wedding anniversa-
ry; because of the "awesomeness" of
this case, Ojeda spent his Labor Day
holiday at work.
"Maybe 10 years from now," Ojeda
says, "I want someone to look at my
file and say, 'Hey, he talked to every-
body. And maybe he'll hear some-
thing and BANG! that's the arrest!"
That Johnny Roselli was destined to
walk on the dark side of life never
seemed in doubt. As a teen-ager in Bos-

Roselli was a runner for the numbers
racket. He helped his stepfather burn
down his home for the insurance mon-
ey. He was arrested at age 22 for steal-
ing about $25 from someone. Then he
changed his name and left for Chica-
go.
It would be 40 years until, in the late
1960s, Johnny Roselli would see his
mother again, though he sent money
to his family through an intermediary
in Chicago so his sisters could attend
college.
By the late 1920s Al Capone was well
established in Chicago. Newspaper-
men, politicians and cops were on the
Capone payroll and a young man with
Roselli's street savvy had little trouble
finding suitable employment; he hired
on as a rumrunner with the Capone
gang. At age 26 Roselli was arrested
for selling morphine to an undercover
agent. He was acquitted because, after
Roselli's arrest, no one could seem to
find the arresting officer or informant
in the case. They still haven't been
found.

The Calculated Rise
And Abrupt Descent
Of Johnny Roselli
By Rudy Maxa
J
Until last month, Johnny Roselli
lived comfortably with his sister and
brother-in-law in a Miami suburb. A
friend estimated he earned about $25,-
000 annually from a gift shop he
owned in the lobby of Las Vegas' Fron-
tier Hotel.

torney suggested he hire a bodyguard,

Sam Giancana, his partner in CIA plots

to kill me at my age, the 71-year-old Ro-

make? So he played golf several times

In the late 1920s Al Capone and his
friends chose Miami as the chic spot
for organized crime figures to buy a
winter home. Just across a strip of
ocean was Cuba, a gambling and vice
mecca. The mobsters from the north
were treated like visiting celebrities
by Florida press and society, while

deputies said he collected $50,000 in
bribes in nine months spent as a bag

women, friendly with men of money,
moved to Los Angeles. He wore hand-
tailored suits and, by all accounts, was
easygoing, mild-mannered. He was
married for a time to an actress, but
they had no children. He became a
close friend of Harry Cohn, the legend-
ary head of Columbia Pictures. The
two men sometimes vacationed to-
gether and Roselli always seemed to
know how to place a bet should Cohn
care to wager on a horse.
According to Bob Thomas' biogra-
phy of Cohn, "King Cohn," the movie
mogul once offered Roselli a job as a
producer. (In his book, Thomas dis-
guised Roselli's identity at Roselli's re-
quest.)

"What would you pay me?" Roselli
asked Cohn.
"Five hundred dollars a week,
Cohn said.
"I get that much from waitresses
who take bets for me," Roselli is said to
have replied.
Besides being a handy man with the
placing of bets, Roselli purchased a 26
per cent interest in a Tijuana race-
track with $25,000 Cohn loaned him.
Roselli paid him back promptly and in-

cluded a check for 6 per cent interest;
selli was sentenced to 10 years in pris-
on. When he got out he returned to
Hollywood to make pictures of prison
and gangster life. But publicity about a
secret appearance before the Kefau-
ver crime committee ruined his rela-
tionship with most studios. Even Cohn
re fused to hire him-"The stockhold-
ers would scalp me," Cohn told a bitter
Roselli.
It was during his years in the Los
Angeles and Las Vegas areas that Ro-
selli met the man who would make
him a household name later in life.
Robert Maheu, the ex-FBI agent who
parlayed a Washington private eye
business into a stormy career as How-
Cohn magnanimously tore up the in-ard Hughes' man in Las Vegas, ap-
terest check.
Roselli bought twin star rubies, had
them set in rings and gave one to
Cohn, who considered it a good luck
charm until his death. Once, when Chi-
cago mobster Willie Bioff moved to
Hollywood and began making life mi-
serable for movie studios by shaking
down executives in return for labor
peace, Roselli stepped in and saved
Cohn from a lengthy strike.
When Cohn refused to pay tribute to
Bioff and his union, Bioff tried to halt
production at Columbia by calling a
sudden strike. Desperate, Cohn called
Roselli who marched into Bioff's office
and confronted the hoodlum who sat
behind his desk wearing a hat and
coat, chomping on a cigar, a gun rest-
ing on the desk in front of him.
"Listen, Willie, I don't know what
you're trying to prove but it isn't going
to work," Roselli told him. "This is a
spite thing and you're not going to get
away with it. You meet with Cohn and
get it settled."
Bioff backed down and called off his
pickets. After he was sent to jail for ex-

in 1960.
(Another person Roselli met in that
era who would later surface to talk of
Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken-
nedy was a young party girl named Ju-
dith Campbell.)
Maheu and Roselli would later tell
Frank Church's Senate Intelligence
Committee the details of their plots to
kill Castro. Maheu told investigators he
had known Roselli since the late 1950s
and, while he didn't know of his un-
derworld connections, "it was cer-
tainly evident to me that (Roselli) was
able to accomplish things in Las Vegas
when nobody else seemed to get the
same kind of attention.

Over dinner at the Brown Derby in
Beverly Hills 16 years ago, Maheu ex-
plained to Roselli that his government
needed his services. Roselli, who was
born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not
patriotic. (Sam Giancana once said,
"Just wave a flag and Johnny'll follow
you to any canal.") Maheu recalled that
