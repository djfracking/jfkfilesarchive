Summary of Agency Employment
Mr. Boris D. Tarasoff. ONDER
1. Mr. Boris D. Tarasoff, a Translator/Transcriber
with the Agency since February 1956, will retire effective
30 November 1970. Your approval is requested for him to
use the attached employment history.
2 For your information, we have been advised by the
Mexico City Station that once Mr. Tarasoff has retired to
Guadalajara, Mexico, except for establishing new social
relationships, he will probably not be asked to go into
any detail about his past cover jobs that would require
anyone to call upon these firms for backstopping confirma-
tion. In the event he should become involved in any post-
retirement activities that might require checking into his
past, Mr. Tarasoff will contact Headquarters for instruc-
tions.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Joravili. Biris D
: Retirement Planning
1 3 JUN 1965
1. The established policy of the Agency favors early retirement of
its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when
they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement
deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know
that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,
during November, 1970.
2. Planning ahead can bring about, with each passing year, definite
progress toward your retirement goals. The Agency is anxious to assist
you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an
employee, that you begin now to plan for this occasion.
3. You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject
of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself,
your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other
employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available
on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory
service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date
of your eligibility.
4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board,
Mr. Howard G. Phillips, on extension 6872 to arrange an appropriate time
to discuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon
retirement.

There's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff just an average joe trying to make
a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicaity to make use of a saleable
article: knowledge of Russian. Physically he's sort of soft, tends to be over-
weight he's about 5'8 #tall, and about 190 in weight. His personality is on
the negative side, his manner dull.
-
-
Tarasoff was greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern-
ment. He wants that security. And he has about reached the end of the line
salary wise as a maintenance man or building supcrintendent. Tarasoff is will-
ing to work in D.C. but insists on a GS 7 because he has to support a wife and
two children. He does not mind the sedentary aspects of Project Detail I
doubt if he'd be interested in anything, that wasn't sedentary. He also liked the
the other aspects of Detail and I would think, from talking with him that he
would be quite able to handle a job on Detail. He can translate reads with
a great deal of ease. His PHS I notice indicates he's interested only in 0/8
this is not what he told me; he is interested in US also but he will go o/s is
necessary.
I recommend Tarasoff for a GS 7 on Project Detail.

This officer has continued to perform his assigned tasks in
superior fashion (Not only is he a skilled transcriber/translator,
he is also able to put his experience and knowledge into words in
preparing character analyses which have been of great value to the
Station's operational program. Although his work load is often quite
heavy, he can always be counted on to complete his assignments
promptly and he willingly puts in the extra time frequently needed.
'
His team spirit and dedication are shown by the fact that on several
occasions, in spite of advancing age and recent illness, he spent long
hours in base houses on live-monitoring assignments. He will be
greatly missed when he retires in the near future.
As previously noted, this officer does not handle operational funds
or have supervisory responsibilities. He has had no cover problems,
nor has he required any unusual administrative support, other than that
which is to be expected in connection with his forthcoming retirement.

This officer continues to perform his assigned duties in a superior.
fashion. Illness put him out of action for some time, but otherwise
the Station received the fine performance which has come to be routine
with him. This officer's experience and dedication make it possible
for him to work effectively with an absolute minimum of supervision.
He responds instinctively to items of operational significance, and his
experience and knowledge wake it possible for him to write penetrating
analyses of target personalities, and interrelationships among these
persons, based solely on what he hears.
This officer has also been called upon to transcribe material from
audio operations, in addition to the telephone material which is his
normal assignment. He has also handled this well, although his advan-
cing age and less acute hearing make this task much more difficult
for him
While not called upon to use Spanish normally, he has sufficient
fluency to handle material in Spanish when required.
This officer uses his time well and takes good care of the equip-
ment assigned to him. He does not handle operational funds nor does
he have any supervisory responsibilities.

Subject has continued to demonstrate a very high level of
interest and competence in his work. Beyond the relatively technical
aspect of producing transcriptions, which he decomplishes with time-
liness, accuracy and thoroughness, he strives to provide the Station
and Headquarters with an insight in depth on the local Soviet com-
plement. He does this capably, particularly when one understands
the limitations of his technical access. His wife, a a contract em-
ployee, assists him in the preparation of the technical product.
However, her over-all contribution goes beyond this, since Subject
and his wife work together in effort to distill the meaning of their
product in terms of personality assessment. They are uniquely well
adjusted to their deep cover circumstances, are of little burden
administratively to the Station, and are presently interested in
continuing their assignment in Mexico City indefinitely.

future personnel as Shows skill and good judgment in extracting data on a wide range of
technical subjects from Soviet documents, which he scans with great picity. His
written reports based on this material present good intelligence information ever,
they suffer slightly from small insecuracies in syntax and grammar, and there are
occasional passages where the meaning is vague or the logical connection between facts
has not been made clear. This type of passage may be further complicated by lack of
native familiarity with the precise English idiom and his tendency sometimes to use the
wrong connective. However, any such failings in the use of English are entirely offset
by his superior knowledge of Russian. His promptness in submitting reports and in
completing other assignments is exceptional. Maintains close relations with consumers and
goes out of his way to fill all their requirements to the letter. His greatest asset to
the section, branch, and division is his native Russian fluency and his knowledge of the
USSR.. He not only serves as consultant and authority on MX the Russian language for the
section and branch, but takes on extra jobs as translator or interpreter as required by
the division or the agency. His natural intelligence has enabled him to do on-the-spot
or rush jobs in fields in which he has had no background. He continues to learn and to
retain his knowledge. During a period when his well-deserved promotion was blocked
because of the lack of a slot, a situation which was unfortunate but the fault of no one
in his office, he became a bit rebellious and reluctant to take on extra duties which he
otherwise would have accepted. He feels, and rightly so, that he is capable of more
challenging and perhaps more interesting assignments which require the use of spoken
Russian. Every opportunity has been given him to find such a permanent assignment, and
he has just been on extended TDY involving such activities,

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job. Works
hard.
Reads Russian rapidly and looks out for material of interest to others as he
scans. Is adaptable and flexible and handles several different technical fields with
equal facility. Can tackle almost any subject without previous experience and turn out
a good job. His native knowledge of Russian is of considerable benefit to the whole
section. Selects the salient points from masses of useless or repetitive material with
intelligent judgment, and compiles reports which are pointed and concise. His only
deficiency of any consequence is the slight awkwardness and occasional lack of clarity in
his written English style. His English has improved considerably during the past two
years, but sometimes the failure to use the most precise term or the right connective
complicates for the reader a conception which is perfectly clear to the writer.

He is anxious to have a tour of duty overseas, and since he has not been able to

NOTE OTHER FACTORS. INCLUDING PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN

After a single tour of overseas duty, which he will not accept unless his wife

Minor difficulties with English usage do not prevent him from turning out reports
which are concise and to the point. Ideas are in general clearly formulated, although
there are occasional instances of inexactness of expression. Because of his native
facility in the Russian language, on the other hand, he is frequently consulted on
all levels throughout the branch on matters involving interpretation of the foreign
text. He is not an eager beaver, and because of his language fluency can accomplish
as much as others in less time and with less effort. Frobably works at full capacity
only under pressure, and for this reason some of his best contributions have been on
special projects with target dates, several of which have covered material outside
his field of responsibility. His disposition is generally patient, stable, and
unruffled.
