2. A new request for CSA for Bubject's use in Mond.co City was submitted to

getting same reaction, or hits, regarding the subject's vifo. There is som derogatory infor-
mation in the Office of Security on what is believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-
Les.
3. The Office of Security has not reached a final decision regarding CÉÀ end LCFLIFFE.
for Subject's vifo. They have stated, however, that unless the wife can be clearod and

FROM Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Support)
SUBJECT: C-25507
#112569
1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February
1957 wherein a covert security approval was requested to enable
the Subject's conversion from contract agent to career agent
status for use as principal agent for Project AMPHODARCH in
Cuba under non-official cover. Reference is also made to our
memorandum of 2 April 1957 in which a provisional covert
security clearance was granted for the above use.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Director's Memorandum of 14 February 1949 entitled, "Security
and Operational Clearances," a covert security clearance is.
granted for the use of the Subject, as described in your request.
as set forth in paragraph 1, above.
3. This clearance is contingent upon the following:
a. The receipt by this office of full overseas
traces and such actual overseas investigation as is
possible on Subject and on his wife and her family.
b. that Subject be afforded a polygraph inter-
rogation as soon as possible and that the verbatum
results be promptly furnished to this office. The
Office of Security will be happy to assist in
arranging this interrogation.
15F
4. Subjects of covert security clearances are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of
CIA.
5. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the
provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to change the status or use of this
individual, a request for clearance to cover any proposed change
should be submitted to this office.

Crozier, Race Faster
1. Concurrent with this memorandum a covert security
clearance is being issued to enable the Subject's conversion from
contract agent to career agent for use as principal agent for
Project AMPARCH in Cuba under non-official cover.
2. This is to advise that information has been received
from a confidential source of the Office of Security concerning
Argentina CORDERO Calderon and her sister, Counsuelo, who are
believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law respectively.
According to a December 1944 report, the above individuals were
described as Costa Rican citizens then in Panama under
suspicion and members of the Russian Ballet team of Pedro and
Lidia CHUPRINE. Argentine is known to speak and understand
German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL, reportedly
a German national and formerly on both British and U. S.
Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-
German remarks and is pro-Gerzan in her sympathies. It was
further reported that both of the above individuals have at
times attempted to secure information from members of the
American Armed Forces..
3. In view of the above information, it is requested that
current overseas traces and investigation be conducted on the
Subject as well as on his wife and sister-in-law, Counsuelo,
and other members of his wife's immediate family and that the
results thereof be furnished this office.
4. The covert security clearance which is being issued
in this case is made contingent upon the faovrable results of
the requested overseas traces and investigation.

to so
1. Reference is made to OS'a verbal request of 7 March 1957, for
additional information on Subject in connection with our request for a
Provisional Covert Security Approval dated 26 February 1957.
.
2. Subject was born in De Kalb, Illinois, on 20 June 1922. He
received his primary and high school education in De Kalb and entered
the U. S. Army in 1940, later transferring to the U. S. Air Force. He
served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China-
Burma theater and later in Panama. He was discharged from the service
in 1945 with the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge, he
worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling
(Illinois) Silica-Cel Corporation and then returned to the Panama Canal
Zone to marry a Costa Rican girl in December 1945. For about four months
he worked as a stevedore and labor foreman in the Canal Zone. In April
1946 he re-enlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone and was discharged
three years later, in 1949.
3. Late in 1948 he was recruited by the Agency, and on 1 June 1949
became a CIA contract agent. Since that date, he has served as a con-
tract agent with contiming high level performance, first in Costa Rica,
later in Quatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cuba where he
is utilized as Principal Agent of Project APHODARCH. Subject has worked
principally and successfully so, on Communist Party penetration opera-
tions since his engagement with CIA, and his current work involves the
handling of a net of agents providing coverage of Communist, leftist,
revolutionary and other political activities at the University of Habana,
and the student-youth circles in general in Cuba.
:
'
4. Subject has always proven to be loyal and trustworthy. In view
of his outstanding record and strong overall qualifications, and his
expressed desire for a career with CIA, it has been recommended he be
converted from contract to career agent status. He was promoted recently
to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating.

and Support) ..
Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February 1957,
wherein a provisional covert security approval and a covert security
approval were requested to enable the Subject's conversion to career
agent status for use as Principal Agent for Project AMPHODARCH in
Cuba, under non-official cover.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Field Regulation 10-215, a pro-
visional covert security approval is granted for the use of the
Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph #1,
above.
3. It should be noted that the provisional covert security
approval herein granted is based on limited investigative coverage
and should not be in any way construed as a final security deter
Rination relative to a full covert security approval. Upon com-
pletion of additional investigation now pending, you will be ap-
propriately advised as to our decision with regard to the issuance
of a full covert security approval.
23
4. Subjects of provisional covert security approvals are not
to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as,
employees of CIA.
''
5. Your attention is called to the fact that a provisional)
covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance
with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to charge the status or use of this individual,
a request for approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted
to this office.
6. This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this memo-
randum.

COMMENTS:
01/055
:
CI/OFS/WH does not concur with the CI/R & A recommendations as set forth for
the following reasons:
•
1. The security compromise would only stem from the two BRAC officers
identifying the VAIVADA affiliation and training on behalf of this Agency.
This appears extremely remote as the desk advised there is no indication
that the ERAC officers know VAIVADA either by name or sight.
2. While VAIVADA is being trained, his wife will be attending citizen-
ship classes in D.C. preparing for her citizenship examination before
returning to Cuba. Consequently, it would be a financial drain for VAIVADA
to stay in New York City and his wife in D.C. In addition, certain per diem
costs would be incurred by the Case Officer traveling to New York City to.
monitor some of the OTR training.
3. The desk will instruct OTR of this joint training aspect and as
a precautionary measure, request that training sites, hours, etc. do not
overlap.

SUBJECT:: Comments and Recommendations on Proposed Covert Training
of Arthur G. VAIVADA
REFIRENCE: Covert Training Request for Arthur G. VAIVADA of
4 December 1956
1. Arthur C. VAIVADA has worked principally, and successfully co,
on CP penetration operations since employment by the Agency. His cur-
rent work involves the handling of a net of CP penetration agents and
informants. IC concurs in general with the projected training scheduled
for subject but recommends that considerable mphasis specifically be
placed on anti-CP penetration operations (1.0., principles and practices
of penetration of the international Communist movement).
2. In addition, subject should also be given materials and brief-
ings on Communism in his area of operations. It is suggested that be
bo given the following materials to Buy and discuss during the phase
of training recommended above: "The Operational Pattern of International
Communism in Latin America" (a paper prepared by CI/ICD) and "The Can-
munist Movement of Cuba" (a paper prepared by Kiss Anne Kendall). These
materials may be borrowed either from CI/ICD/WH (Hein) or from WH/III/
Cuba (Poland).
3. Should OTR contemplate presenting in any form any of the CP
penetration case studies contained in FHB 52-865-4 ("The CP Penstration
Program"- Issue No. 4) to subject during the training sessions, CI/ICD ·
(Bein extension 3919) should be consulted. Some of the material in
FIB 52–865–4 directly concerns VAIVADA's previous operational work,

Re: AMPHODARCH/Arthur G. VAIVADA
CI Staff notes that training for VAIVADA is scheduled to commence on
the same date in the same city as the training scheduled for Colonel
PEREZ and Lt. CASTANO of the Cuban BRAC. This situation seems inherently
dangerous and unwarranted by the circumstances as known to CI Staff.
Pending further justification CI Staff cannot concur in the training as i
requested; but would of course concur in the training for VAIVADA if the
locale were shifted to another city such as New York.
(This is basically an operational or an operational security matter.
CI/R&A/TRB therefore urges that CI/OPS/WH and CI/OA discuss the problem
with the desk, and resolve it if possible. CI/R&A/TRB will of course
defer to CI/OPS AND CI/OA in this matter.)

'
1. It is requested that the CSA granted Harold R. NORMAYR (ps),
formerly called Arthur G. VAIVADA (ps), on 3 July 1957 for use in
Cuba under Project AMPHODARCH and later amended to cover his use in
Mexico under Project LIEDGE, be further amended to cover his PCS to
Headquarters. His activity in or around the Washington, D.C. ares
will also be covered under the LIEDG8 Project.
2. Attached is a new PRQ, Part II to cover his activity in
the United States. NOFMAYR will continue to live under cover and
will probably be reassigned overseas after a two year tour at
Headquarters.
3. CSA's are being requested under separate cover on his wife
and sister-in-law who are also living with him.

1. From information made available to this office it
appears that details concerning the exposure of the technical
surveillance of Juan Bosch and subsequent arrests were not
fully determined. It is believed probable that HUMANOID has
been compromised with the Costa Rican authorities.

2. It is understood that, with the exception of the
HUMANIST Project, HUMANOID is to continue inactive for an
undetermined period. Any further contemplated use of HEJVANGID
should be coordinated with 5TC/SPB.
3. In view of his wife's and mother-in-law's Costa Rican
background and apparent connections and associations with
politically significant personalities, it is recommended
HUMANOID discontinue using his home to reproduce material
obtained in the HUMANIST Project.
