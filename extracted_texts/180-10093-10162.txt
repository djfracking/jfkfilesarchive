MEMORANDUM
TO:
Clifford A. Fenton, Jr.
FROM:
Jack Moriarty 24M
001304
A
RE:
DATE:
Peter Carroll Glynn, Jr.
April 25, 1977
Pursuant to an earlier phone contact, I interviewed Mr.
Glynn on his job at 4301 Suitland Road, Suitland, Maryland
at 2:35 p.m. Friday, April 22, 1977. Subject is employed as
an Intelligence Analyst by NOSIC (Naval Oceanic Surveillance
Information Center) 763-2258 and resides at 107 Howard
Street, Dumfries, Virginia, 221-8748.
He was serving with the U.S. Army on 11-22-63 assigned
to Fort Walters, Mineral Wells, Texas as a radio technician
and as such regularly monitered messages between Mexico and
Cuba. As a result, he overheard comments in the sphere which
were adverse to the newly assassinated President and were
upsetting to him. Although he doesn't recall the exact
dialogue, the gist concerned the humor found by the Cubans
and Mexicans appraising this murder as being done by his own
people and yet suspecting foreigners like themselves.
Consequently, it has occurred to Glynn that we may
benefit by causing a thorough check to be made of the ASA
(Army Security Agency) who Glynn believes recorded all such
messages usually in tape form-and stored same. He also
prepared dossier of which he gave me the original and one
copy. .
He goes on to say their mission at Fort Walters was
labeled a training mission and, as such, was comprehensive
enough to encompass the recording of all such collateral
messages. Additionally, he recalls the Mexican sending
station used the name of "Chihuahua."

THE COMMANDING OFFICER AT THAT TIME WAS CHARLES R. GINN, CAPT, AIS.

FINALLY, I SUGGEST SIMILAR INVESTIGATION(S) BE CONDUCTED FOR ANY OTHER KNOWN
SITE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER SUBJECT INCIDENT.

4. I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR BEING EXTREMELY VAGUE IN REFERENCE TO MY WORK WITH THE
