tigations. The transcripts indicated that on
September 28, 1963, and October 1, 1963, the
voice of an individual identifying himself as
Lee Oswald was recorded by the other govern-
ment agency conducting intelligence type inves-
tigations. Additionally, this government agency
provided the FBI with photographs of an individ-
ual who appeared to be an American; these photo-
graphs being taken by said agency on October 1,
1963.
It is noted that the FBI never received the
actual tape recordings from which the transcripts
were derived, as the tapes were erased by the
other government agency providing the transcripts....
As a result, no FBI employee ever listened to a
tape recording purporting to contain Lee Harvey
Oswald's voice as no tape was ever provided to
this Bureau.
(JFK Classified Document # 131.) No FBI agent interviewed
by the Committee recalled listening to any tape recording
purporting to contain a cor versation involving Oswald.

by James Angleton at the time of Scott's death. 351/
This Committee requested access to any relevant
materials from this safe or July 6, 1978.352/
Access was granted on October 6, 1978. Two statements
by Mr. Scott contained in these materials lend
circumstantial support for Ms. Tarasoff's testimony.
In 1970 Mr. Scott wrote;
During my thirteen years in Mexico,
had many experiences, some of which I can
write in detail. One of these pertains to
Lee Harvey Oswald and what I know (emphasis
in original) of his activities from the moment
She arrived in Mexico, his contacts by
telephone and his visits to both the Soviet
and Cuban Embassies and his requests for
assistance from these two Embassies in trying
to get to the Crime with his wife and baby.
During his conversations he cited a promise
from the Soviet Embassy in Washington that they
· would notify their Embassy in Mexico of
Oswald's plan to ask them for assistance.353/
In his unpublished manuscript, Scott refers to a
conversation in which Oswald gave the Soviet Embassy
"his name very slowly and carefully."354/ Although
the transcripts available do not bear out Scott's
recollections, there are interesting parallels with
the testimony of Anna Tarasoff and David Phillips.355/

There are indications also that there was
one other additional call that may have been available
to the Mexico City Station prior to the assassination
of President Kennedy. In the first statement by
Silvia Duran provided to the CIA by the Mexican
government, Silvia says that the Cuban Consul called

While this Committee has not been able to find
any direct corroboration of Anna Tarasoff's claim,
the circumstantial corroboration is such that the
possibility that there was an additional transcript
concerning Oswald that was available to the Mexico
City Station in late 1963. cannot be dismissed.

concerning Oswald was probably made on telephones
not subject to CIA surveillance and, hence, would
not have been available to the CIA's Mexico City

Possibility that the CIA Photosurveillance
Obtained a Photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald
This Committee cannot state with certainty
that a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald was not
obtained by the photosurveillance operations in Mexico
City because of three reasons: (a) the photographs
from LILYRIC, the "alternate" photographic base
which covered the Soviet Embassy main gate, and the
photographs from the pulse camera, which covered the
Cuban Consulate entrance, with the exception of a

The documentation and elaboration of the

all of the photographs produced by the photosurveillance

Likelihood that the Photosurveillance

their Headquarters counterparts generally agreed that
it would have been unlikely for the photosurveillance

photographed Oswald.364/ The transcripts of

at the Soviet Embassy reveal that a man later identified
as Oswald was at the Cuban Consulate at least three
times on Friday and Saturday, September 27 and 28.
They also reveal that he was at the Soviet Embassy at
least twice on those same days.365/ The CIA technician
who serviced the Cuban photographic installations said
that it was possible that the operation missed Oswald
if: (1) Oswald's visits were after dark; (2) Oswald's
visits were on Saturday afternoons or Sundays; (3) the
case officer had given the photographic basehouse

On 6 January 1978, Phillip Agee telephonically
contacted two House Select Committee on Assassinations
staff investigators at their office in Washington,
D.C. Mr. Agee informed the investigators that he
"would give the true story on the photograph
produced by the CIA which the CIA claimed was taken
of Oswald in Mexico City in 1963. "370/ Phillip
Agee was interviewed by HSCA staff investigators on
11 and 12 January 1978.
Mr. Agee told the investigators that he had
been assigned to the Mexico Branch of the Western
Hemisphere Division of the CIA's Clandestine Services
in September of 1966.371/
Mr. Agee was assigned to
work on the Headquarters support for the Agency's
operations in Mexico City that were aimed at the

woman named Elsie Scalėti was in charge of the operational
support projects for Mexico. 3731 Agee stated:

She was the officer in Washington in charge
of all of the paperwork and other administrative
matters relating to the support in Washington
to these operations which were underway in
Mexico City.374/
Ms. Scaleti trained Mr. Agee for his new
position.
Mr. Agee characterized Ms. Scaleti as "the
key figure in the Mexico Branch in Headquarters,
because she had been there for so long. "375/
After his transfer to the Mexico Branch, Mr.
Agee heard a story about photographs of Oswald.
Mr.
Agee could not remember with certainty who it had been
that told him the story, bu thought that it may have
been Ms. Scaleti.376/ Mr. Agee's recollection of the
story he had heard was that on the day of the
assassination Ms. Scaleti was working in the Mexico
Branch in much the same position that she occupied in
1966.377/ When the news about Oswald's arrest
reached Ms. Scaleti, she recalled seeing his name and

(2) Daniel Stanley Watson Allegation
On June 4, 1978, the House Select Committee on
Assassinations interviewed Mr. Daniel Stanley Watson
in Mexico. Mr. Watson served as a CIA officer in
Mexico City from approximately 1965 to 1969. Mr.
Watson was the Chief of Covert Action (propaganda)
from 1965 to 1967. He was the Deputy Chief of the
Mexico City Station from 1967 to 1969.384/
Mr. Watson told the HSCA staff members that
sometime between 1965 and 1967 he had had occasion to
request Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City Station
personality file, 285/
and that when
when this file was delivered
to him, it contained only one or two photographs and
intercept transcripts. 386/
Mr. Watson stated that
the file was very thin and that the photo(s) was a
3/4 shot from behind
--
"basically an ear and back
· shot. "387/ Mr. Watson said that he did not think
that there was anyone else in the photograph and he
thought that it was a photograph of Oswald.388/

City.378/ Within an hour or two, Ms. Scaleti had
located the photograph of Oswald visiting the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City.379' Mr. Agee went on to
say:
I don't know, don't recall in fact, how she
had been able to reconcile or how they were
able to reconcile in Mexico City the photo-
graph with the name, unless someone had
known the face. Because the problem with
these observation posts is that you can get
a lot of photographs from them, but to find
out the exact identity of the people is not
always an easy thing to do. And it may be
that as they were listening to the telephones
of the Soviet Embassy, and also the Cuban
Embassy, that she remembered the name Oswaldx
or Lee Harvey Oswald from the telephone tap,
if in fact he had identified himself over the
telephone, and tried to make an appointment
with the consul or whoever. And then they
were able somehow to reconcile the telephone
conversation with the photograph that was
taken from the observation post the same day
or more or less whenever the appointment was
made. On the other hand it may be that this
photograph had not been identified until the
time of the assassination but that she had
heard or recalled perhaps either reading the
transcript from the telephone tapping or
getting a condensed report perhaps a weekly
report or something of the take from the
telephone tap that she remembered the name
, Lee Harvey Oswald and then went back into
the files of all the photographs and looked
through all the photographs until eventually
she found a photograph that was similar to
all the photographs of Oswald that immediately
began to come over the television and the news.

d. HSCA Investigation of the possibility that
the Mexico City Photosurveillance Operation
Produced a Photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald
(1) Introduction
This Committee has conducted a general investigation
into the CIA's photographic surveillance operations in
in addition to the.
Mexico City in 1963 as well as a specific investigation
into the allegations mentioned above. 444/
In an attempt to determine whether the CIA's Mexico
City photographic bases did, in fact, photograph Oswald,
this Committee requested the CIA to make available to
the HSCA the production of these bases. 445/ The CIA
has in part responded to this request. 446/ However,
the production from LILYRIC, the second base that covered
the Soviet Embassy entrance, and the pulse camera that
covered the Cuban Consulate entrance, has not been made
available for review. 447/ The Agency's withholding of
certain production materials from the photographic bases
has prevented the Committee from determining whether a
photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald was taken by these photo-
surveillance operations.

into the CIA's surveillance operations in Mexico City

B. Differences Between the Warren Commission
Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's
Activities in Mexico City and the House
Select Committee on Assassination's
Investigation.
The approach taken by this Committee's investigation
differs from that of the Warren Commission primarily
in terms of scope. The Warren Commission and the
investigative agencies at its disposal went to
great lengths to establish Oswald's travel to and
from Mexico, but devoted minimal effort to
evaluating Oswald's contacts with the Cuban and
Soviet Consulates. It is the conclusion of this
Committee that the Warren Commission correctly
established that Oswald had traveled to Mexico
City. Hence, this Committee has chosen not to
reinvestigate Oswald's travel to and from Mexico City.
Instead, the Committee's approach has been to focus
narrowly an Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and
Cuban diplomatic missions in Mexico City and on
evidence that was not avai able to the Warren

This Committee has made in attempt to determine when the
available information was linked to Lee Harvey Oswald. The
Committee has also made an attempt to determine whether all
the intercepted telephone calls were in fact connected with
Oswald or involved Oswald. It should be pointed out, however,
that this analysis can only be directed at that information
now known to have been available to the México City Station.

1) the caller spoke broken Spanish; 2) the caller did not
have the number of the Consulate; (3) the caller did not know
that visas were issued at the Consulate; and 4) the caller
states that he is seeking a visa, not that he is checking on
an application already made. The majority of the evidence
indicates that Lee Harvey (swald could not speak Spanish.476/
initially
In light of Delgado's assertions, it is possible that
Oswald had at least a limited knowledge of Spanish. It should
be noted that the 10/3 franscript listed above indicates that
the caller spoke in broken Spanish. 477/ The fact that this
conversation was in Spanish, should not by itself rule out the
possibility that Oswald made the phone call. This is especially
true in light of Delgado's allegations and the 9/27 10:30,
9/27 10:37 and 9/27 1:25 calls which were also in Spanish. 473/
The record reflects that Oswald had the phone numbers
of both the Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache in
his notebook. 479/ It can not be determined when Oswald
entered the numbers in the notebook. Since Oswald had previously
called the Consulate it is likely that he had the number prior
'
to 3 October. It is also clear that Oswald knew that the
Consulate was responsible for issuing visas due to his prior
dealings with the Soviet and Cuban Consulates. Thus, it is
probable that the 10/3 conversation did not pertain to Oswald.

After the assassination the CIA's Mexico City Station
passed copies of seven of the above listed conversations to
the U. S. Embassy Legal Attache. 471/ The 9/27/ 10:30 and the
9/27 1:25 calls listed above are not included in this
dissemination.472/
The cover memorandum states:
Attached are photostatic copies of transcripts
of all conversations from technical operations
of this office which are possibly pertinent in
this case.
The HSCA has not been able to determine why the 9/27
10:30 and 9/27 1:25 calls were not included in this memorandum.
While the 1:25 call could be considered unrelated, it is
unlikely that the same would apply to the 10:30 call since
the 9/27 10:37 call is included in the memorandum.
At the bottom of each attachment page to the Scott
memorandum, a summary of the conversation is provided. 474/
The Station questioned the relevancy of only one of the seven

The 10/1 10:45 call is clearly relevant because the
caller identifies himself as "Lee Oswald" The 10/1 10:31
conversation is probably relevant due to the similarity with
the 10/1 10:45 call and the marginal notations about
the quality of the Russian spoken by the caller, The 9/28 11:51
call is clearly relevant, açain due to the marginal notations
and the involvement of Silvia Duran. Duran's calls on 9/27
clearly related to Oswald due to the substantive information
discussed in those calls.
In summary, the above listed calls contain the substance
of the information available to the CIA MCS prior to the
assassination from the Soviet electronic intercept operation.
The first three calls on 9/17/63 and the one on 10/3/63,
if they were indeed Oswald, add little of substance to the

_ Reconstruction of the CIA Mexico City Station and Headquarters
Actions Prior to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
A.
Introduction--CIA Interest in and Liaison with FBI
Regarding American Citizens in Contact with Soviet
Bloc Embassies in Mexico City.
The Central Intelligence Agency has claimed that no
investigation of Oswald was made in Mexico prior to the
assassination of President Kennedy. For this reason, the
Agency claimed, the fact that Oswald was seeking a
visa and that he had also been to the Cuban Embassy was
not discovered until after the assassination:
It was not until 22 November 1963, when the
Station initiated a review of all transcripts
of telephone calls to the Soviet Embassy that
the Station learned that Oswald's call to the
Soviet Embassy on 1 (ctober 1963 was in con-
nection with his request for a visa to the USSR.
Because he wanted to travel to the USSR by way.
of Cuba, Oswald had also visited the Cuban Em-
bassy in an attempt to obtain a visa allowing
him to transit Cuba.
Inasmuch as Oswald was not an investigative
responsibility of the CIA and because the
Agency had not received an official request from
those agencies having investigative responsibili-
ty requesting the Agency to obtain further in-
formation, the Station did nothing other than
· ask Headquarters on ˚5 October for a photograph
of Oswald. 497/
Neither of the above assertions is accurate. An
analysis of the information available will show that the
first assertion of the above quote, that the Station did
not learn of Oswald's contact with the Cuban Consulate and

Later that same day, the Soviet Consulate returned
Ms. Duran's call. 502/ Unde normal procedures, these
transcripts would have been in the CIA Station by the
· first of October and Ms. Goodpasture brought these trans-
cripts into the Station on that morning and put them
on Ms. Manell's desk. 503/ Ms. Manell recognized the
transcripts as containing information of a possible coun-
terespionage or counter-intelligence interest and routed
them to Mr. Shaw, Ms. Goodpasture and Win Scott (in
reverse order.) 504/ Mr. Scott wrote, at the top of
the 9/27/4:26 call, "Is it possible to identify?" 505/.
This was the first interest in Oswald recorded by the
Mexico Station even though the caller was as yet uniden-
tified. It indicates a routine interest in an American
who is in contact with the Soviet Embassy. After the
transcripts were routed they were filed in a general
subject file. 506/
The 9/28/ call was probably received at the CIA
Station on Monday, 30 September 1963. The routing and
filing instructions indicate that it was handled in much
the same way as the 9/27 conversations. [Cite?"

A cable reporting Lee Oswald's contact with the
Soviet Embassy was written and sent to Headquarters by
Ms. Manell on 10/8/63. Various reasons have been ad-
vanced to explain the seven day delay in sending this
cable. David Phillips explained the delay by saying
that Mr. Manell was too busy to be bothered by something
Phillips stated:
of such a routine nature. 5161 Phillips.
Mr. Manell was a busy man, sometimes pro-
crastinating. His wife was working for
him, and on one or two occasions I spoke
to Mr. Manell kiddingly saying, hey, where
is the cable about this fellow, or something
like that, or maybe to his wife. I am not
sure. In any event, what happened a few
days passed and Mrs. Manel) prepared a
message--she was working for her husband,
and as I recall it, she typed it herself,
but I am not positive on that point, but
in any event, she prepared the cable ..
and took it to Mr. Manel at which time he
signed off on it. During that process, it
did come to me, also to sign off because
it spoke about Cuban matters, and then went 517
to the Chief of Station and was released. 577/

A blind CIA memorandum entitled "Delay in sending
the first cable about Oswald" was located in a soft file
on the Unidentified Man photograph. This memorandum as-
serts that Dave Phillips "didn't know what he was talking
about." The memorandum's assertion is correct. Mr. Manel
did not sign off on the cable reporting Oswald's contact

Commission that could possibly shed light on
Oswald's activities in Mexico City outside of the
Soviet and Cuban installations.
The Warren Report limited its discussion of
Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
missions to information obtained from Sylvia Duran
and the Cuban Government. 1/
At one point in the Report the Commission referred
to other information:
By far the most important confirmation
of Senora Duran's testimony, however, has been
supplied by confidential sources of extremely high
reliability available to the United States in
Mexico. The information from these sources
establishes that her testimony was truthful and
accurate in all materia respects. The identities
of these sources cannot be disclosed without
destroying their future usefulness to the
United States.2/

the twenty-six volumes of evidence to support
its statement that Silvia Duran's testimony was.

The only action I took was the action my
wife took, was to send the cable to Wash-
ington summarizing the information we had
on Oswald and his contact with the Embassy.
We also asked our headquarters for a trace
of an American. That was routine. 524/
The delay could also have been partially due to the wait
for the photo-production. Ms. Goodpasture did check the
photographs and did add a paragraph to the cable concern-
ing a photograph. 525/
Another reason that the cable was delayed was
that there was some question within the Station about who
had the responsibility to report Oswald's contact with
the Soviet Embassy.

P
porary duty assignment in Washington, D.C., and Miami,
Florida, from at least late September
to October 9,
1963. 522/
The blind memorandum referred to above regarding
the delay offers another explanation for the seven
day lapse before sending the cable. After explaining
that the photoproduction would not have arrived at the
Station until Monday, 7 October, the memorandum says:
A name trace could have been requested on
the basis of the name alone but that wasn't
the way Win Scott ran that Station. He
wanted the photographic coverage tied in
with the telephone coverage...sometimes
there was a U.S. automobile license num-
ber. It was also part of the "numbers
game" of justifying a project by the num-
ber of dispatches, cables or reports pro-
duced. 523/
:
In all likelihood the delay in sending this ini-
tial cable was due to a combination of factors. Mr. Manell
testified that, in fact, he was not too concerned with the
task and left it to his wife. He stated:

be accompanied by a memo and it took
time, or whether it was Ann's responsi-
bility. It was just a little, not
argument, but a discussion about, well,
"you do it, I don't want to do it, you
handle it," and I had to do it. 526/
The reason that the responsibility would have
lain with the Soviet Section is obviously because the
American was in contact with the Soviet Embassy. Ms.
Goodpasture also had a potential basis for responsibility
because she was responsible for liaison functions with
the Legal Attache, Army, Navy and Air Force on routine
couter-espionage cases. 527/ She also assisted the
Chief of Station and Deputy Chief of Station on these
cases as they occurred. 528,
The primary reason for the delay was most likely
a combination of the responsibility dispute and the
routine nature of the case as perceived by the CIA of-
ficers at that time.
Barbara Manell stated:
(Ann Goodpasture) probably came in--it
was really a matter of here is another one
of those things again and we were having
a little gabble abou: who would send it
up because it was pain to do these. I pro-
bably, I think I haniled it as soon as I
got it but I think there was a discussion,
as I say maybe a half a day, about who
was going to do it. It was done because
it was required but it was considered un-
important. 529/

on within a day or a day and half or two
days. Dispatches took so long that you
really could not take any kind of opera-
tional action predicated on dispatch. 530/
Mr. Manell, the Chief of the Soviet Section in
Mexico City recalled that the criterion for a cable as
opposed to a dispatch was the perishability of the informa-
tion being transmittedy:
The normal criterion would be the urgency
attached to that information, the perish-

to take a week to get to Washington, 531/
Hence, it is possible that Oswald's contact was
reported by cable because it was considered significant
by the Mexico Station%; but this interpretation is not
supported by the weight of the testimony.
Two other criteria for reporting by cable were
pointed out: information corcerning Soviets, Cubans and

The review of the photoproduction from LIMITED

tee, makes the explanation of the mistake about the iden-

Latin implausible. The record reflects that unidentified
American males were listed on the log sheet as "U A M"
after the time was given. The photograph that was linked
to Oswald was the only "U A M" that appeared on 2 October
1963. But on September 27, 1963 another "U A M" had ap-
peared. The Committee has concluded from a review of a.

This Committee cannot be certain that other "U A'M"s
did not turn up on the production from the LILYRIC base
because that production has not been made available
for review..
Ms. Goodpasture was asked about this and explained
that the man, Gutierrez, was known in the station and
that the base house agent was mistaken in identifying
him as an American. 553/
This Committee finds the above quoted explanation
hard to accept for other reasons. The October 1 transcript
does not indicate that Oswald visited the Embassy on
that day, however, it does indicate a visit on the pre-
vious Saturday. 554/ Even if he did visit the Embassy
on the first of October, the photograph referred to in
the cable was not taken until the second of October,.

Q: Despite this indication here I believe

Oswald's name had not come up in any ear-

So, Ms. Manell drafted the first paragraph of the 10/8

even though the other information was available. 544/

.Ms. Goodpasture attempted to explain this mistake.
Q: Looking at the log, can you now ex-
plain to the Committee why the cable
referred to a photograph taken on
October 1st when actually it was taken
on another day?
A: If you look at the log here you see at
the top--it was just an oversight on
the part of the person who was writing
that cable. It looks as though the date
is 1 October, but if you read it very
closely you see there are only two frames
that were shot on 1 October and 2 Octo-
ber, it starts up with fram number 3,

occur. That is the only explanation

October 1st, and did not see any reference
to the date October 2nd?

would make such an oversight mistake and not discover
it until 1976. 558/ This Committee thinks that the fact
that the mistaken date of the photograph was not dis-
covered for so long is especially suspect in light of
the fact that on the day after the assassination CIA
Headquarters sent a cable to Mexico which said:
"(FBI) says that photos of man entering
Soviet Embassy which MEXI sent to Dallas
were not of Oswald. Presume MEXI has
double-checked dates of these photos and
is also checking all pertinent other
photos for possible shots of Oswald. 559/
Headquarter's preseumption was evidently mistaken.
No
record exists that would indicate a reply to this cable
by the Mexico City Station.
The likelihood that a photograph of Oswald was
indeed obtained makes the "explanation," proferred by
Goodpasture, et al., even more implausible. 560/ At
this time the Committee can not conclude why the original
mistake was made even though it does find the explanation
offered by Goodpasture, et al., to be highly implausable.
Regardless of why the mistake was made, Oswald's
contact with the Soviet Embassy and the mistaken photo-
graphic identification of him were reported to Headquarters.

Other evidence from the CIA

The teltype which Ms.Scaleti wrote was sent to
the Department of State, the Federal Bureau of Investi-

type says:
:
1. On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an American
male, who identified himself as Lee Oswald,
contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City inquiring whether the Embassy had re-
ceived any news concerning a telegram
which had been sent to Washington. The
American was described as approximately 35
years old, with an atheletic build, about
six feet tall, with a receding hairline.
2. It is believed that Oswald may be identical
to Lee Henry Oswald, born on 18 October
1939 in New Orlears, Lousiana, a former U.S.
Marine who defected to the Soviet Union in
October 1959 and ˚ater made arrangements

would not normally even today, provide
those investigative agencies with the
physical description of Lee Henry Oswald
as we thought it to be then.
We provided them only with our intelli-
gence, not with State Department intelli-
gence which gave the stuff out about the
audio and the possible physical descrip-.
tion. The wording here in paragraph 1 on
our teletype... is worded that the American
was described. As I told your man from
your Committee earlier, it possibly would
have been better, although it did not occur
to me at the time and this is the way those
things were written in those times, to say
that an American described as this could
possibly be identifiable and qualified

The second point of interest that is illustrated
by the 10/10 cable and teletype is the inference that can

agency or it might come about because of a standard
operating procedure.
For example, we had an agreement with the
FBI that we would follow up leads on any American
citizen in Mexico City who appeared around the
Soviet Embassies, and so on, or anybody who was
down there appearing to defect, which we might
learn through our telephone intercepts.
We could just as well have sent this cable

Q: In fact, you pointed to something which I was

cable. Even though the cable was brought to Karamessines'
attention and he did sign off on it, Mr. Scelso told this
Committee that that was not necessary due to a standing
agreement with the FBI under which the CIA had agreed to
investigate Americans in Mexico in contact with the Soviet
Embassy without any specific request from another agency. 590/
This recollection is corroborated by other testimony and
documents. 591/ Elsie Scaleti also recalled that it would
not have been necessary, in 1963, to bring such a request
for operational action to the ADDP's attention. 592/

Q: Was any follow-up action contemplated by (the
10/10) cable?
A: Yes. "Please keep Headquarters advised of any
further contacts or for positive identification
of Oswald."
Q: That would be considered follow-up?
A: Yes. They were instructed to stay alert and report
any further evidence of this man's presence. There-
fore, Mr. Karamessines had to sign off on it.

follow-up action was contemplated?

Q: For purposes of clarification, I think you said
that there were two situations where Mr. Karamessines
would have to sign off. One would be where another
agency requested the dissemination?

Q: A request for operational action. What is the second
example?
A: Well--
Q: Would the Agency itself decide to take operational
action?
A: Ordinarily, operational action in an ordinary case
would not require Mr. Karamessines approval at all.
It was only because an American citizen was involved.
That interest in an American citizen might come about
because of a specific statement of interest about

The request for further investigation and dis-
semination contained in paragraph 5 of the 10/10 cable to
Mexico was the reason that the cable was sent to the
Assistant Deputy Director of Plans for release. 588/
The Chief of the Mexico Branch was questioned extensively
on this point:
A: Well, it went up to Mr. Karamessines be-
cause it involved disseminating information
on an American citizen to the U.S. government
agencies, you see. At that time--probably.

around information on American citizens un-
less it were requested to by another govern-

or by some standard operating procedure.

ing an American abroad engaging in some
skullduggery, would inform the responsible
U.S. agency here and sit and wait for instruc-

Q: This particular information was disseminated
to other agencies without a request of any
such agency. Is that correct?

Q: This fit into the other category of cases
where disseminations were made?
A: Disseminations would be made to other interested
agencies, and any information we came across

discrepancy.
When Ms. Scaleti was shown the 10/9
cable on that occasion she stated that she would not have
taken the description of the individual in paragraph two
to be a description of Oswald. 584/ The description
discrepancy was specifically pointed out to Ms. Bustos
and she was specifically questioned on that point. The
report of that interview says:
'
We next pointed out to Ms. Scaletti the
fact that the response to Mexico had a
correct description of Oswald and the dis-
semination had an incorrect one. She said
that the info in the first paragraph of the
dissemination came from MEXI 6453 and that
explained the incorrect description. We
pointed out to her the fact that she had the
correct description and that had already
told us that she did not associate the de-
scription in 6453 with Oswald, and that she
had said that the cable and teletype had been
prepared simultaneously by three knowledgable
people. She said, first, that the correct
description would not have been put in the
dissemination because it came from the file
review. I pointed out that all of the infor-

that they had not been sure that the "Lee Os-
wald' referred to in 6453 was the same as "Lee
Henry Oswald" on whom they had a file, hence
they would not have had included a description
from 6453 that she did not think was connected
to Oswald. She said that it had obviously
been a mistake that coesn't matter now, but

attention did not have to do with the request for operational
' action, but because Oswald's contact was considered impor-
tant enough to merit his attention:
Q: Why would someone as high up in the organiza-
tion as Karamessines ask to be the releasing
officer of this particular cable?
A: I can only surmise now that I might have thought
or what several of us might have thought at
the time, that since it involved somebody of
this nature who had tried to renounce his citi-
zenship, who was in the Soviet Union, married
to a Soviet, got out with a Soviet wife pre-
sumably, which is very strange, and now the con-
tact with the Soviets, we could have a security,
a major security problem. This was one way of
informing him and getting attention at the
higher level. 593/
Even though the CIA denies such an agreement (if it
was in writing) that covered the CIA's investigation of
American citizens in Mexico, this Committee is certain,
on the basis of the above detailed evidence, that such'
an agreement existed, either formally or informally. 594/
Hence, the assertion in the 1977 IG report that "Oswald
was not an investigative responsibility of the CIA" 595/
is seemingly inaccurate and misleading.
This Committee has attempted to determine what
actions, if any, were taken by the CIA's Mexico City Sta-
tion after Headquarters responded to the initial report
of Oswald's contacts with the Soviet Embassy. In this

respect, two assertions of the '77 IGR are important:
1) that it was not discovered that Oswald was seeking a
visa to Russia and that he had also been in contact with
the Cuban Embassy until November 22, 1963; and 2) that
the Station did "nothing other than ask Headquarters
on 15 October for a photograph of Oswald" because no
other government agency had mide an official request for
further information. 596/ It has already been shown
that the "official request" that the Agency claims was
not forthcoming was, in fact, not necessary and that,
as a matter of fairly routine operating procedure, the
CIA Headquarters requested a follow-up on the information
already reported about Oswali. It has also been shown
that the Oswald matter, afte the name trace was done
at Headquarters, was considered to be fairly significant
by the Headquarters officials involved. In this regard,
it should be pointed out that Headquarters communicated
its concern to Mexico by requesting in paragraph 5 of
DIR 74830 more information on Oswald. It should also
be noted that the CIA Headquarters also, by notifying
the interested government agencies that "Any further in-

Oswald's middle name was not "Henry." David Phillips
was questioned about that possibility:
Q: Do you have any reason to believe that when

not have spotlighted it that way. But I don't
have any recollection. I don't have any re-
collection that we know before this cable came
back down that it was Lee Harvey Oswald. 599/
The explanation most often advanced was that Mr.
Scott often used the symbols "Sic" and "aka" interchang-
eably and that all he was indicating here was that the
"Lee Oswald" from the taps was also to be indexed and
filed under the additional name "Lee Henry Oswald."

making an official request for further action.
Hence,
the excuse offered for the claimed lack of action by the
Mexico Station is invalid and the question becomes 1) whe-
ther or not that Station did any follow-up; 2) whether
they did discover additional information about Oswald
prior to the assassination%; 3) whether that information,
if any, was reported in an accurate and expeditious man-
ner; and 4) if it was not reported, what was the reason
for the failure to report.
The Mexico City Station received DIR 74830 on
11 October 1963. The Mexico City copy of this cable is
in Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City "P" file along with
the Station routing slip. There are several interesting
aspects to this copy of the cable and there is evidence
that provides indications of the Stations' actions and
the timing of those actions.

There are several marginal notations on this docu-
ment. Perhaps the most interesting is the notation "Sic"
with an arrow drawn to the 'Henry" in the name "Lee Harvey
Oswald." That notation was made by Win Scott when he
read the cable on the day it was received in Mexico. 598/

occurred. Ms. Goodpasture noted that "We should ask
HQ for photo. No?" Barbara Manell noted that the dis-
semination requested by Paragraph 4 of the cable was
done on 15 October 1963. Win Scott wrote, "Please set
up "P" file on Lee Henry OSWALD and put all data we
have into it. Photos?" 606/ The document was sent to
the files on 15 October 1963. 607/ Hence, we know that
Oswald's Mexico "P" file was opened on or about 15 Octo-

son to believe that most, it not all, of the information
available to the Station was incorporated into the file
at that time. 608/
The 10/11 cable greatly increased the significance
of Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy in the eyes
of the Mexico City Station just as the name trace results

A: Oh, yes, sure, it did. The fact that he had that
kind of background. Sure, he became someone of
considerable operational interest. Again, there
was nothing other than operational interest.
Q: In all liklihood tha: cable would have prompted
the people at the station to go back and look at
the earlier transcripts?
A: Yes, I would think so. 610/
This Committee believes that Station personnel did,
between October 11 and October 15, go back and recheck
the transcripts and connect the important substantive
calls to Oswald. Under normal operating procedures a
tape of Oswald's calls to the Soviet Embassy should not
have been erased until 16 October, 4 to 5 days after
the case took on added significance. 611/ The one trans-
cript of the call on 10/1/63 that had definitely been
linked to Oswald prior to receipt of the 10/11 cable bore
a reference to an earlier conversation by a man who
spoke broken Russian, the text of the 10/1 call allowed
that the prior call had probably occurred on September 28,
1963. 612/ It should have been possible at that point
to compare the tapes to see if they were in fact the same
caller. Indeed, a notation made by Ann Goodpasture on
on a
newspaper article in 1964 suggests that this was the case.

On 23 November, the CIA Headquarters asked the
Mexico City Station to send the full transcripts of Os-
wald's conversations and "original tapes if available"
to Headquarters as soon as possible by a special courier. 618/
On that same day, Ann Goodpasture sent a cable to Head-
quarters reporting the 9/28/63 conversation. That cable

said, in part, "Station unable compare voice as first

this point rather than clarifies it. This will be dealt

The other statements by Ms. Goodpasture in the cables

about this :
Q: To your knowledge, was a voice comparison
ever made between the tapes to deterimne
whether the same person was speaking in
each one?

A: I do not know. I did not make one. I do
not know whether someone else made one or
not. There is a transcript, a cable here,
in which the transcriber of the Soviet tape
says that it is the same voice, which would
lead one to believe that he made a voice
comparison, but it just may have been that
he, from his memory, came to that conclu-
sion. 624/

Oswald's "p" file there is a newspaper clipping of an
article from the 21 October 1964 Washington Post. The
article, by Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott, is entitled
"CIA Withheld Vital Intelligence from Warren Commission."
One paragraph from that article says:
-
The investigators also are trying to determine
why the CIA in its preassassination report to
the State Department on Oswald's trip to Mexico
City gave details only of the defector's visit.
to the Russian Embassy and not the Cuban Embassy.
The CIA did not report the latter visit until after
Kennedy's assassination in Dallas.
Next to that paragraph Ann Goodpasture wrote:
The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidenti-
fied until HQ sent traces on Oswald and voices
compared by (Tarasoff). 617/
That statement is very clear in saying that a voice
comparison was made. The cable traffic that went from
Mexico to CIA Headquarters after the assassination is
not so clear.

Q: That indicates that the caller--could you please

A: "The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidenti-

Now, that would have been in answer to the cable.
that was dated 8th October. I believe their cable
was 18 October, "and voices compared by Feinglass.

A: He compared the Cuban Embassy voices with the

A: I said 18 October because I thought that was the

did not do a voice comparison but connected the two con-

Whether or not Mr. Tarasoff or someone else did a
voice comparison of the tapes, it is likely that the tapes
did exist until at least the 16th of October and would
have been available for such a comparison. It is possi-

memory. In any event the record clearly indicates that
the tapes should have been available, and probably were
available, as late as 16 October 1963. 628/ This is
significant because it was after receipt of the 10/10 ca-
ble from Headquarters that the Oswald case took on a
more than routine coloring.
The increased significance that the Oswald
visit took on during the period from October 11 to Octo-

to retain the Oswald tapes. 629/

○ Q: Are you aware of the fact that, after the as-
sassination, it has been alleged that some
tapes were given to the FBI to listen to and
that it was said that these tapes contained
Oswald's voice on them?
•
A: Someone asked me about that, but I do not think
that I had those tapes. I do not remember if
I did, and I was not aware that we gave any to
the FBI. I do not know whether Mr. Manell got
tapes from Mr. Tarasoff and passed them to the
FBI, or if the Chief of Station or Deputy passed
anything to the FBI. I just do not know. 630/
On the whole most CIA off cers who testified stated
that, if a tape of Oswald's voice existed at the time of
the assassination, they did not know anything at all about
it. 631/ One CIA officer, the Chief of the Branch respon-
sible for Mexico, testified that he believed the tapes
did exist at the time of the assassination:

Saturday. Was any effort made to check
your materials from the surveillance opera-
tion, the photographic surveillance opera-
tion, or from the telephonic surveillance
operation to get additional information
on this?
A: I do not know whether I checked it immediately
or not at this stage. I do know that they were
checked thoroughly after the assassination. In
fact, I think they were checked thoroughly after
the information came back from Washington iden-
tifying a Lee Oswald. 637/
On October 15, 1963, a 'p" file was opened on
Oswald. 638/ That same day the CIA Mexico City Station
requested that Headquarters send them a photograph of
Oswald. 639/ On that date also Ms. Manell drafted a
:
local dissemination memo regarding Oswald's contact with
the Soviet Embassy. 640/ By this date at least the 10/1/
10:45 call, the 9/28/11:51 call, the 9/27/4:05 call,
and the 9/27/4:26 call had been linked to Oswald. 641/
On 16 October 1963 the nemorandum drafted by Ms.
Manell was circualted at the U. S. Embassy. It said:
1. The following information was received from
a usually reliable and extremely sensitive
source: On 1 October 1963, an American male
contacted the Soviet Embassy and identified
himself as Lee OSWALD. This officer (sic)
determined that OSWALD had been at the Soviet
Embassy on 28 September 1963 and had talked
with Valeriy Valdimirivoch KOSTIKOV, a mem-
ber of the Consular Section, in order to learn
if the Soviet Embassy had received a reply
from Washington concerning his request. We

City in a misleading manner. Hence, the fact that Os-
wald was seeking a visa and had been in contact with
the Cubans as well as the Russians was known prior to
the assassination, and the Station's actions prior to
the assassination were more comprehensive than merely
requesting a photograph; although if any action other
than a file check was taken, no record of that action
has been made available to this Committee.
It is unlikely, but possible, that this information
that was developed by the Mexico City Station after 10/11/63
was reported to Headquarters. Elsie Scaleti pointed
out that a report of this additional information on
Oswald's activities in Mexico "would have been expected.

Henry OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939, in
New Orleans, Louisiani, a former radar opera-

When Ms. Manell was asked why she had stated that it
had been "determined" that Oswald had been in contact
with the Soviet Embassy on 23 September she said that:
it must have been because she had rechecked the trans-
cripts by this time as otherwise she would not have
used such certain language. 543/ When asked why the 10/16
memo said that there was no clarifying information on
Oswald's "request" when it was known by this time that
he was seeking a visa, Ms. Manell said that "They had no
need to know all those other details" 6441

Q: It is determined that the same person was talking

With the exception of those areas that
involved sensitive sources and methods,
such as the information pertaining to the
electronic and photographic surveillance
of the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic
compounds, information developed by
the CIA in Mexico was generally relayed
to the Warren Commission in an accurate
and expeditious manner.

obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey

to send the full transcripts and original tapes to Head-
quarters by special courier. 670/ The cable also asks
if the original tapes are still available. 671/
This Committee has not been able to determine how the
CIA Headquarters knew, on 23 November 1963, that a review
of the tap material should begin with the production
from 27 September, the day Oswald first appeared at the
Soviet and Cuban Embassies. There is no recrd that
Headquarters had been informed of the 9/27 visits prior
to this cable having been sent. It is possible, as some
witnesses have suggested, that his information was provided
to CIA Headquarters by the FBI in Washington. 672/ If
that is the case then it merely shifts the question. This
may indicate that the CIA Headquarters was aware of the
9/27 visits prior to the assassination. An even stronger
inference is that they were aware of those visits at least
by the day after the assassination. The manner in which
they learned of these visits by that date has not been

Even though witnesses generally denied
that there was telephone communication between Mexico
City and Headquarters at the time of the assassination,
there is strong evidence that there was such communica-
tion on at least two instances. 673/
As will become evident, the transcripts were cabled
to headquarters that same day. It is not clear why Head-
quarters asked that the transcripts and tapes, if they
existed, be sent to Headquarters by special courier as
opposed to cabling the transcripts which would have been
faster. 674/ There is no record that indicates that
these transcripts of Oswald'; calls were sent to Head-
quarters by special courier.
On the 23rd, the Mexico City Station reported all
of the substantive Oswald conversations to Headquarters
by cable. Logically, one would expect that since the
circumstantial evidence indicates that these conversa-
tions were linked to Oswald prior to the assassination,
that they would all have been reported in one cable, es-
pecially in light of the request from Headquarters in
DIR 84886. 675/ At this point, according to the files
and records made available to the HSCA staff by the CIA,

that the tape of the 28 September conversation, which
may not have been received at the station until the
30th or the 1st of October, was destroyed before the
tape of the conversation on the 1st of October was re-
ceived in the station on tha same day. In light of
the standard operating procedures in effect in the sta-
tion at that time, that possibility is highly unlikely. 683/
In view of what is now known about the standard
operating procedures and about the Station's actions
prior to the assassination, the Station's confusing and
somewhat contradictory reporting after the assassination
is strange. 684/ It is possible that these confusions
and contradictions arose out of the crisis atmosphere
at the station and the rush to report information. This
Committee has not found any solid evidence that there
were sinister qualities in the reporting after the

Helms re: "Technical Examination of Photographs of
Lee Harvey Oswald's Application for a Cuban Visa."
(Commission exhibit 3127.)
4) The pages of Lee Harvey Oswald's notebook with the
telephone numbers of the Cuban Consulate, the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's office.
(Commission Exhibit 2121.)
5) A letter dated 11/9/63 from Lee Harvey Oswald to the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.. (Commission Ex-
hibit 15.)
6) A letter from J. Edgar Hoover to the Warren Commission

10) The CIA telephore surveillance on the Sov-
not in
iet Embassy taped several calls of a man
using the name 'Lee Oswald." These tapes
were retained for a routine two week period
and were most likely erased shortly after
16 October 1963. These tapes were probably
existence at the time of the assassination.
11) The Committee is aware of the allegations
that Silvia Tirado de Duran may have been
an intelligence agent for either the Cubans,
Mexicans or Americans. Ms. Duran was pro-
bably never employed by Cuban intelligence.
While there is no direct evidence on the.
question other than Ms. Duran's denial, the
Committee believes that the circumstantial
evidence that tends to indicate that Ms.
Duran had a relationship of some type with
either Mexican or American intelligence is
of such a nature that the possibility can
not be dismissed.

used in the collection and distri-
bution of the reels and transcripts. (Ibid.) In this
discussion of the operation other sources will be relied
upon in these areas.
In addition to the telephone surveillance main-
tained by the CIA Station in cooperation with the Mexi-
can Government, the Station also maintained some unilateral
surveillance on the Soviets w..thout the knowledge or
cooperation of the Mexican officials. The unilateral
surveillance was not directed at the Soviet diplomatic
compound but rather at the private apartments of Soviet
officials in Mexico City. (Goodpasture Testimony,
4/13/78, p. 56; Manell Interview, 3/20/78, p. 7; HSCA
Deposition of H. Manell, 4/28/78, p. 7; HSCA Deposition
of B. Manell, 4/28/78, pp. 16-17.) There was also uni-
lateral coverage of some Cuban targets. (Goodpasture
Testimony, 4/13/78, pp. 51-52.) Ann Goodpasture testi-
fied that she believed that some of these targets were
located in the Cuban diplomatic compound. (Ibid.) Ms.
Goodpasture's memory is not borne out by the project
file for the unilateral intercept. The only Cuban tar-
get of this project was the home of the Cuban Commer-
cial Attache. (HMMA-22536, 11/9/63, para. F.2.)

245/ After the assassination Headquarters asked Mexico City
not to destroy any of the Soviet tapes from this opera-
tion. (DIR 87770, 12/9/63) A note written by Ann Good-
pasture in 1963 seems to confirm Arehart's assumption
that the tapes were retained at the station.
(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring-
ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them are not
labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones
return.) The storage problem is one for us and as
the reels come in with transcriptions, I store them.
When we can erase them, I'll take off the labels
and send them back out.
(Note by Ann Goodpasture, 12/10/63, attached to DIR 87770,
12/9/63. Second parenthetical in original.)
246/ Zambernardi Interview, 6/3/78, p. 5.
247/ Emphasis added. Mr. Arehart was absolutely positive that
Cuban tapes were retained for thirty days because he
maintained them in the special rack. (Arehart Interview,
6/2/78, p. 3.) Hence, the two week "usual practice" is
probably not correct insofar as the Cuban tapes are con-
cerned.

The reader should be advised at the outset
that the first section following is technical in
nature and may not appear cirectly relevant at
"
first blush. But the report is cumulative in nature.
The specific, detailed analyses of the standard
operating procedures in the first section are
necessary to, and form a partial basis for, the
reconstruction of the Mexico City Station's
handling of the Oswald case. There are many gaps.
left by the documentary and testimonial evidence
concerning the manner in which the CIA's Mexico
City Station and Headquarters reacted to Oswald's
presence in Mexico City. A knowledge of the
way in which the Mexico City Station operated and
the procedures involved in those surveillance
operations which detected Oswald is valuable in
filling the gaps of the specific case which is the
subject of this report.

the following call occured. A woman named Silvia
named Guillermo Ruiz. Ruiz tells her that he has not
yet been able to reach the consul and because of that:
he has not called her. Silvia tells him that "we"
have no time for that and asks him for the Consul's
phone number. Ruiz respords by asking her not to get
annoyed and he wants to know if Silvia wishes to speak
to the Consul personally. Silvia responds that she
does. Ruiz says that the number is 11-28-47. Silvia
says that is fine and the conversation ends. (CIA
transcript from Cuban Embassy, 9/27/63.) It cannot be
determined whether this caller was indeed Silvia Duran or
if she subsequently called the Consul since Duran's of-
fice phone was not tapped. The tap was on the telephone
used by Ruiz.

the circumstances surrounding it will be dealt with in
a subsequent section. Ms. Arne Goodpasture of the
Mexico City Station found this photograph.
(See below.)
In the absence of any evidence otherwise--Note: The
Watson allegation says there was a photo in Mexico City in the
mid-60's; not that it was found there--it is most
likely that the grapevine stories about a photo being
found in Mexico arise from M:;. Goodpasture's report-
ing the photo of the man who has since become known as
the Mexico mystery man in the same cable that reported
Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy. (See below.)
The findings of this Committee regarding the general
Mexico City surveillance operations are presented in
Section II, A and B above. In summary, this Committee
found that there were three photographic surveillance
bases (four cameras) that may have photographed Lee
Harvey Oswald in September and October of 1963. This
was determined from analysis of project files for these

wald's photo may have been sent to Headquarters. This
'examination also revealed no evidence that a photograph
of Oswald was sent to CIA. Headquarters. This Committee
did find that there were several types of communications
between Headquarters and field stations that were treated
as non-record material. Because of the non-record nature
of these communications, it was not possible to review
that material.

478/ If one assumes that Oswald could not speak any Spanish
then only two conclusions about the first three calls
of 9/27/63 are possible: 1) either these calls do not
pertain to Oswald, or 2) they do pertain to Oswald
but were made by someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald.
This second possible conclusion will be addressed in
a more detailed fashion in subsequent sections due to
its ramifications vis a vis Oswald's activities and pos-
sible associates as opposed to the substance of the in-
formation available to the CIA Station prior to the
assassination.

or any liaison agreement with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that may have been in existence in 1963.
(Letter to Breckinridge, 1/20/78.) The CIA responded
"that there are not now, nor were there any, agreements
between the CIA and FBI or other U.S. government agen-
cies concerning CIA responsibility to report on contacts
of U.S. cutizens with Communist Embassies or officials...
The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelli-.
gence responsibility for counterintelligence cases
but it is notamatter of agreement with other agencies nor
does it concern simple contacts of Americans abroad with
Communist Embassies or officials." (Memorandum to

bassy has created more confusion and controversy than
perhaps any other CIA related issue stemming from as-

mistaken linkage of this photograph to Oswald as well

this Committee that it is his belief that the tapes were
probably still in existence at the time of the assas-
sination. (HSCA Deposition of John Scelso, 5/16/78,
p. 76-77.) But the tesitmony of the persons at the
Mexico City Station is consistent in saying that the
tapes did not exist at the time of the assassination.

679/ HSCA staff have wondered whether or not the Mexico City
Station was entirely forthcoming of their own will
with Headquarters. This speculation was based on three
pieces of information. The first is the report in
MEXI 7024 that Headquarters had all the available in-
formation. The second is a note from Win Scott on the
Routing and Record Sheet for MEXI 7033 which says:
'
I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at
1620 hours on 23/XI. I told John Scelso at
1630 hours (our time) on 23/XI that this would
be on route to him.
The third is a cable reporting that on the 23rd Win
Scott had an urgent call to see the President of
Mexico. The cable reports that Scott expected the
President to express his condolences over the assas-
sination but "developed that (Mexican agent) had
located call to Soviet Embassy of Lee Oswald
made on 28 September. Believe fact that (President
of Mexico) aware of this contact (from our joint
operation) and passed data to COS is important.
(MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, paras. 2 and 3)
The Committee declines to speculate that the Mexico City
Station was possibly considering not reporting all
the information available to them. It was considered
that this may have been contemplated in order to pro-
tect themselves from a charge about their failure to
report the information prior to the assassination.

TOP SECRET
When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated
on November 22, 1963, the United States investigative
agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret Service, etc.--were asked to
investigate the assassination. When the Central Intelli-
gence Agency's Mexico City Station remembered that Lee
Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City during late Septem-
ber and early October, it reviewed the electronic surveil-
lance files and found eviderce of phone calls to the So-
viet Embassy made September 27th, September 28th, and
October 1st, that could have been made by Oswald. 685/
Review of the electroic surveillance files also produced
telephone calls on September 27, 1963 between the Russian
Consul and Silvia Duran, a secretary at the Cuban Consu-
late, where Oswald was discussed. 686/ In addition,
'
the Mexico City Station found a September 28, 1963 phone
call from Silvia Duran to the Soviet Consulate where Silvia
Duran stated that there was an American citizen at the
Cuban Consulate who had previously visited the Soviet Con-
uban

So, Scott is just remarking that it is
interesting that the President of Mexico is
aware of our telephone operation.
Q: He should have been since it was a liaison
operation.
A: Yes. But you do not always know whether he
was informed. I think we always knew he was
informed. I think we always knew he was in-
formed. It is jus significant that the per-
son calls you in and says, here is some intel-
ligence about the Kennedy thing.
(HSCA Deposition of John Scelso, 5/16/78, pp. 83-84.)
Win Scott indicated that he was going to write a memoran-
dum concerning his meeting with the President of Mexi-
co. (Routing and Record Shhet for MEXI 7028, 11/23/63.)
If Mr. Scott wrote such a memo, it has not been made
available to the HSCA.
!
David Phillips, who after serv-
ing in Mexico, went on to accumulate quite an impres-
sive record as a Chief of Station in several countries
himself, told Committee investigators that a memoran-
dum of this sort, along with other "sensitive" informa-
tion would be the type of thing that Win Scott probably
kept in his private safe. (David A. Phillips Interview,
8/24/78, p. 10.) Mr. Phillips added that he did not
know what happened to Mr. Scott's safe after he died
but he had heard vague stories about someone finding
a lot of documents that Scott had kept. (Ibid.)

The discovery that the Mexicans were also aware of
the conversations would have made holding back the
transcripts perilous in that the Mexicans could have
revealed their existence to the detriment of the
Station. Hence, the full report followed very shortly
after the meeting between the Mexican President and
Win Scott, and immediately after Scott discussed the
situation with his nominal superior in Washington
by telephone. Scott's superior was asked about this.
He said that he did not remember the substance of
his telephone call to Win Scott on the 23rd. (HSCA
Deposition of John Scelsc, 5/16/78, p. 88) "I do
not have any idea why (I called). I may have been
ordered to call him on any number of things." (Ibid.,
p. 87.)
He was also asked about Scott's meeting
with the Mexican President.
You get a psychological question. The Chief.
of Station is called in to speak to the Presi-
dent of Mexico. There had been a big fight
when the new Ambassador got there--no, it wasn't
that. It was a very peculiar situation in Mexi-
co whereby the Mexicar. President's primary con-
tact with the U.S. government was through our
Chief of Station rather than through the Ambas-
sadors. This caused no great problem with the
then-Ambassador whose name I have forgotten. .
Q: Thomas Mann?
A: Yes. He was a very fine guy and recognized
the usefulness of this arrangement. The next
Ambassador, Mr. Freeman, tried to cut Win
Scott out of contact with the President of
Mexico, whereupon the President of Mexico
called in Win Scott and said, "I want you to
send a cable to the White House telling them
I am not going to deal with this jackass, I
want to deal only with you."
So, the result was eventually, Winston
Scott and Ambassador Freeman went to the
-
White House and talked to President Johnson.
-
and straightened the whole thing out in favor
of Winston Scott..

with whom it had a good relationship--to arrest Silvia
Duran (as Silvia Duran was 1 Mexican citizen, she did not
have diplomatic immunity) because she might shed some light
on the circumstances surrounding the assassination. 688a/
The Mexico City Station sent a note to the Gober-

her mother's address, her brother's address, her license
plate number, her home phone number, her place of work and
a request that she be arrested immediately. 689/ The Mexi-

On November 27, 1963, the Mexican government for- .

2000943
"Upon learning about the assassination
she and her husband speculated that Presi-
dent Kennedy might have been assassinated
for racial reasons. When she became aware
that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she
ascertained that it was the same man who ap-
proximately two months prior had been to the
Cuban Consulate to solicit an intransit visa
to Russia. Having taken his name from the
special documentation he presented she knew
that he was married to a Russian woman and
belonged to the "Fair. Play for Cuba Committee."
She checked the data in the Consulate archives
and became certain that it was the same indi-
vidual who was blonde, short, dressed unelegant-
ly and whose face turned red when angry. The
Consul had denied the visa because to obtain
an intransit visa from the Cuban government,
it was imperative that he previously obtain a
visa from the Soviet Consulate. Since obtain-
ing a visa from the Soviets took four months
and Oswald's Mexican visa expired. soon Oswald
was advised that he see the Soviet Consul, and
calling the person in charge of that office.
The Soviet official told her that they would
have to consult Moscow which would take four
morths. That afternoon, Oswald returned to the

Cuban Consulate and Silvia Duran confirmed
that he could get a Cuban visa only after he
received a Russian visa. She gave Oswald her name
and business phone number but never gave him her
address because she had no reason to give it to
him. The only aid she could give Oswald was advising
that he see the Soviet Consul and calling the person
in charge of that office. She knew that phoning the
Soviet Consulate was not one of her duties and that
if she did so she did it only to help Oswald. She
gave Oswald her business phone number only because he
would have to call subsequently to check whether he
had obtained a visa. He never called back."
Silvia Duran, released on November 24, 1963, was rearrested
November 27, 1963, when the Mexican government alleged that she
was attempting to leave Mexico for travel to Havana. 698/
According to the Mexican officials who detained Duran a second
time, there was no addition to her story. 699/
The Mexico City Station forwarded Duran's ten-page signed
statement to Headquarters or November 27, 1963. 700/ The
following day, Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the
Mexico City Station seeking to insure that neither Silvia.
Duran nor the Cubans would have any basis for believing that
the Americans were behind her rearrest. The cable stated,
"We want the Mexican authorities to take the responsibility
for the whole affair." 701/

her that there would be a delay of about
four months in processing the case, which

Select Committee on Assassinations the following:
Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three
times on September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Com-
mission previously reported. 712/ Oswald first visited
the Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m., requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-
tion. 713/ He showed her some documents, then left to
obtain photographs needed for his application. 714/
Oswald returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. with
four photographs. 715/ Ms. Tirado typed the application
in duplicate, stapled a picture on top of each and had Os-
Wald sign each in her presence. 716/ As identification,
Oswald showed her documents he had brought: his Russian
labor card, marriage certificate with the name of his
Russian wife, his American Communist Party membership card
and his "Fair Play for Cuba' membership card. 717/
Ms. Tirado found Lee Harvey Oswald's behavior suspi-
cious because normally a Communist traveled only with his
passport as belonging to the Communist Party was illegal
in Mexico in 1963. 718/

which he shared with his upcoming replacement, Alfredo
Mirabal. 732/ Azcue politely explained the requisites
for an intransit visa to Oswald. 733/ When he noticed
that Oswald was a stubborn man he told Oswald that he
was obviously not a friend of the Cuban revolution be-

extremely careful with the people it allowed in the coun-
try. 734/ Azcue and Oswald yelled at each other. 735/

The source, LIRING/3, stated that he had recently re-

called LIRING. 741/ LIRING: '3 reported that he had visited
Silvia to renew acquiaintancees. 742/ During the visit,
Duran told LIRING/3 that she had met Lee Harvey Oswald
at the Cuban Consulate when he applied for a visa and
had dated him on several occasions. 743/ Duran admitted.
that she had had intimate relations with Oswald, but in-

until she admitted that she had had an affair with Lee
Harvey Oswald. 745/ Rowton 746/ counseled LIRING/3

report of such a relationship between Oswald and Duran.
Elena Garro had reported the same information to Charles

That the Mexican government did not disclose all
the information in its possession to American authorities

:
1) the Mexican government did not want to disclose
that one of its citizens had had intimate rela-

Mr. Phillips added that he doubted that Duran would
have been pitched because the Station could not identify
any of her weaknesses. The Committee staff members then
told Mr. Phillips about the reporting on file concerning
Ms. Duran from one of the Station's penetration agents,
LITAMIL/9, at the Cuban Embassy. At one point LITAMIL/9
had reported to his case officer that all that would
have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde,
blue-eyed American in bed with her. 761/ With this, Mr.
Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the Station
had targeted Ms. Duran for recruitment, that the Station's
interest had been substantial, and that the weaknesses
and means had been identified. 762/ Mr. Phillips
pointed out, however, that because Duran had been targeted
did not necessarily mean that she had been pitched. 763/
In addition, he stated that he had never heard that Duran
had been pitched. 764/
Mr. Phillips did state that he would expect that
Ms. Duran's file at the CIA would be "very thick" because
of all the telephone intercepts that concerned her and

he had first heard Duran's name from the telephone

that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because "she
wasn't friendly with anyone." 756/ Mr. Phillips had
previously mentioned the CIA Mexico City Station's in-
terest in recruiting a former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
named Lechuga. 757/ Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum
written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff
regarding a trip to Mexico by Warren Commission staff
members which said:
Mr. Scott's (Chief of the CIA Station in Mexi-
co City) narrative disclosed that the CIA'S
action immediately after the assassination con-
sisted basically of alerting all its confiden-
tial sources of information throughout Mexico
to immediately channel all information into
their headquarters, and of compiling as.com-
plete dossiers as possible on Oswald and every-
one else throughout Mexico who at that time
the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...
This meant especially Silvia Duran, who because
she had previously been having an affair with
Lechuga, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
and presently the Cuban representative at the
United Nations, had previously been of substan-
tial interest to the CIA...7587

that. "No one let me in on this operation." 759/ But

b. The possibility that Silvia Duran was an
agent for either American, Mexican or Cuban
Intelligence
Since the publication of the Warren Commission
Report in September 1964, critics have written about the
possibility that Silvia Duran was an intelligence agent
for either the Americans, Mexicans or Cubans.
1) Was Silvia Duran an agent, asset or source
for Mexican or American intelligence?
In an effort to resolve this question, the House
Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the United
States investigative agencies' files on Silvia Duran. 752/
The Committee found no evidence in this file review that
Silvia Duran was either an American or Mexican intelli-
gence agent.
In addition, the Committee has interviewed most
of the Mexico City Station employees about the possibility.
Only David Phillips, Chief of Covert Action and the Cuban
Section in the Mexico City Station in 1963, a position
which made him very knowledgeable, considered that Duran
was possibly an agent or source. Mr. Phillips stated that

Mr. Neiscuir's hazy recollections, the Committee cannot
definitely resolve whether Silvia Duran was a Mexican or
American intelligence agent or source.
(2) was Silvia Duran a Cuban intelligence agent?
In an effort to resolve this question, the HSCA
reviewed the United States investigative agencies' files
on Silvia Duran. 774/ The Committee found no evidence in
the files that would indicate that Ms. Duran was associated
with Cuban intelligence.
In addition, the HSCA interviewed most of the Mexi-
co City Station employees about the possibility that Duran
worked for Cuban intelligence. Only Barney Hidalgo, a
CIA officer who travelled to Mexico City in 1963, considered
the possibility to be likely. 775/ Mr. Hidalgo, professing
not to remember all the details, stated that he thought
that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent. 776/ Hidalgo

Consulate, Eusebio Azcue Lopez, a Cuban citizen, was the

fort to investigate Oswald's contact with representatives
of the Cuban government, asked the Cuban government to
make Eusebio Azcue available for Committee and staff inter-
views. 781/ The Cuban government complied with the Commit-
tee's request on April 1, 1978. 782/

he would be very surprised if Ms. Duran's 201 file was

Ms. Duran's Mexican "p" 769/ (personality) file available
for review. The CIA informed the Committee that there
was no "P" file available on Ms. Duran. 770/
Another CIA employee, Dan Neiscuir, who worked on
an "Oswald Task Force" in late September or early October
of 1975 dealing with Freedom of Information Act law suits
brought against the Agency concerning the files on Lee
Harvey Oswald, stated that he believed that Ms. Duran may.
have been a source of information for either the CIA or
the Mexicans. 771/ Mr. Neiscuir could not recall why he
specifically had this recollection, but thought that it
was due to something he had seen in Oswald's file. 772/
He said that it may have been the Agency's attempts to
protect Ms. Duran after the assassination and the heavy
cable traffic that those attempts generated that led him
to his inference that she was a source of information
for either the Agency or the Mexicans. 773/

One of Elena's cousins told her at
the time that (he or she) did not know who the Americans
were except that Silvia Duran (an employee of the Cuban
Embassy and the wife of Horatio Duran), had brought
them to the party. 809/
The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the
three Americans on the Insurgentes, a main avenue in
Mexico City. 810/ The Garros claimed that they had recog-

the assassination. 811/ Silvia Duran's arrest "under-
lined the Garros' certainty' that the man had been Lee
Harvey Oswald. 812/
The source of the menio was a witting 813/ Central
Intelligence Agency asset krown by the cryptonym LICOOKIE/1
whom the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while

Cobb was sent to her house shortly after the assassination

The Committee has no been able to determine if
Elena Garro told Ms. Odio the story personally or if
Ms. Cobb related the story to Ms. Odio who relayed it to
"Tichborn." 825/
The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 ver-
sion. There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan.
The story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs
from the previous story in two areas: It states that
the party was at the Cuban Embassy, as opposed to Ruben
Duran's; and that Elena talked to a Cuban Embassy offi-
cial instead of her cousins about the three Americans.
Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to
the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. 826/ The file

Elena admitted that she had spoken to two men at
the Embassy, "presumably from the Legal Attache's Of-

the complete story because "the Embassy officers did not

home. 888/ She was unclear about the date of the
party. 889/ She thought it had been a few days before
the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin, visited Mexico; she thought
that this would put the party around September 2 or 3,
1963. 890/ She believed that the party was on a Monday
or Tuesday because it was an odd night for a party. 391/
Elena could not check her calendar to refresh her memory
at the time of this interview because the calendar was

9. Legal Attache 2/23/66 Memo to the United States
Ambassador Regarding Elena Garro's Allegations
On 2/23/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
Ambassador reporting that "extensive investigation"
failed to disclose that Oswald had traveled to Mexico
prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information had
developed that would show that he had not been in New
Orleans in the early part of that month. 955/ The memo
reiterated that no further action was being taken by
the FBI because Elena's allegations had not been substan-
tiated by it. 956/ The Legal Attache forwarded a copy
of this memo to the Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico
City Station. 957/ A marginal comment made by Raymond
Rocca next to this entry in Wx-7241 says, "How can it
be ascertained that Cswald did not travel to Mexico
prior to early September 1963? There must be some basis
for Elena's reporting." 958/

the Cuban Embassy were queried about Elena's allegation: 952/ That
there are no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed

Allegation that She Had Stayed at the Hotel
Vermont from the Day After the Assassination
Until November 30, 1963
On 10/13/66, the Legal Attache wrote a memo to
Win Scott reporting that a reliable confidential infor-
mant had reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont
disclosed that one "Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis
Potosi," had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November
23, 1963. 959/ She left on November 30, 1963. 960/
The memo said, "The above individual may or may not be
identical with Elena Garro de Paz." 961/ The House Se-

mine why the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal
Bureau of Investigations waited until 1966 to investigate
this aspect of Elena's story.
Charles Thomas' 12/25/65 memo stating "She and
her daughter did not personally register at the hotel.
She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or
friends of his from San Luis Potosi," corroborates

Headquarters considered Ruyle's report. "the first piece

three questions overlap somewhat in detail; e.g., if Os-
wald was not traveling alone, did one of his companions
impersonate him at the Cuban Consulate?
Nonetheless,
each of the three questions will be dealt with in separate
sections below.
In an attempt to answer these questions the House
Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) interviewed
Mexican 1065/ and Cuban citizens 1066/ who could have
knowledge of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate%3B
(2) interviewed Mexican citizens 1067/ who could have know-
ledge of Oswald's activities and associations in Mexico.
City; 3) conducted an extensive review of the files of
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation that pertain to Oswald's sojourn in
Mexico City. 1068/
B. Did Lee Harvey Oswald or an Imposter Contact
the Cuban and Soviet Consulates in Mexico City?
Lee Harvey Oswald himself probably visited the Cuban
Consulate at least once since his application for a Cuban
instransit visa bears his signature. 1069/ Though the
Cuban Consulate allowed visa applicants to take blank

applications out of the Consulate to be returned when
completed, 1070/ Silvia Duran stated she was certain that
Oswald signed the application in her presence. 1071/ Os-
wald's signature on the Cuban visa application, however,
does not by itself rule out the possibility that someone
impersonated Oswald in contacts with the Cuban and Soviet
Embassies.
An analysis of the telephone.conversations which
the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by tapping the
Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's tele-
phone reveals that someone, later identified by the CIA as Oswald,
visited the Cuban Consulate at least two times and the
Soviet Consulate at least three times. 1072/ On Septem-
ber 27, 1963, at 4:05 p.m. Silvia Duran called the Soviet
Consulate. In this conversation she referred to an Ameri-
can seeking an intransit via to Cuba. 1073/ The substan-
tive information given indicates that she was discussing
Oswald. 1074/ At this time the individual using Oswald's
name already had been at the Soviet Embassy at least once,
since Silvia requested the name of the Soviet Embassy offi-

Azcue also stated that the individual later identified
as Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate about 1:00 p.m.
with the photographs probably on "the date that appears.
on the application, that is to say on the 27th." 1087/
The Committee believes that there is a possibility that
the argument between Azcue and the individual occurred
during this visit. 1088/
Ms. Duran stated that Oswald's third and last
visit occurred in the late afternoon after working hours
on the 27th. 1089/ This visit is confirmed by the CIA's
tap on the Soviet Consulate. 1090/
In addition to the alleged Oswald visits to the
Consulates, there were other telephonic contacts that may
have been between Oswald, or an imposter, and the Consu-
lates. 1091/ Several details about Oswald's visits to
the Cuban Consulate, and telephonic contacts with both
Consulates suggest that the individual involved may not
have been Oswald..
Silvia Duran's description of Oswald did not re-
semble Oswald's true physical appearance. 1092/ This
description, which appeared early in the reporting of in-
formation obtained from Ms. Duran was deleted from subse-
quent reports and was not at all mentioned in the Warren

Azcue's description of Oswald was similar to Silvia
Duran's, but more detailed. 1094/ Perhaps the most re-

Another possible incication that an imposter may

Consulate "a day or so ago" and had spoken in broken

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in
Mexico City?
When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey
Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:
2000363
The Commission undertook an intensive investi-
gation to determine Oswald's purpose and acti-
vities on this journey, with specific reference
to reports that Oswald was an agent of the Cuban
or Soviet Governments. As a result of its investi-
gation, the Commission believes that it has been
able to reconstruct and explain most of Oswald's
actions during this time.
By Saturday, September 23, 1963, Lee Harvey
Oswald had failed to obtain visas at both
the Cuban and Soviet Embassies. From Sunday,
September 29, through Wednesday morning, Octo-
ber 2, when he left Mexico City on a bus bound
for the United States, Oswald spent considerable
time making his travel arrangements, sightseeing
and checking again with the Soviet Embassy to

Subsequent to the Warren Commission's Report,
the allegations of Elena Garro 1132/ and Oscar Contreras
Lartigue 1133/ came to the attention of the United
States investigative agencies. The main allegation of
both these people, that they met Lee Harvey Oswald
in Mexico City, remains to this day without direct corro-
boration. Yet the Committee feels that it cannot dis-
miss these allegations without giving them any considera-
tion.
The testimony of Silvia Duran and the Cuban Consu-
late Officials Azcue and Mirabal place Oswald's last
contact with the Cuban Embassy on Friday evening, Septem-
ber 27, 1963. 1134/ The transcripts from the CIA's wire-
taps on the Soviet Consulate place Oswald's last visits
to the Soviet and Cuban Consulates on Saturday morning,
September 28, 1963. 1135/ Oswald's last telephonic
contact with the Soviet Corsulate came on Tuesday, Octo-
ber 1, 1963. 1136/ Cswald's activities on the days be-
tween September 28 and October 1 are not clearly recorded..

Three calls that also occurred early on September
27, 1963 may have been by an imposter. At approximately
10:30 a.m. a man called the Soviet Military Attache
looking for a visa to Odessa and was referred to the So-
viet Consulate. 1108/ At 10:37 a.m. a man called the
Soviet Consulate and asked for a visa to Odessa. 1109/
He was told to call back at 11:00. 1110/ At 1:25 p.m.
a man called the Soviet Embassy and was told the Consul
would return between 4:00 p m. and 5:00 p.m. that day.
While only the callers' requests for a visa to
Russia 1112/ (Odessa) connect these calls to Oswald,
the HSCA believes that they do fit logically into a time
sequence created by what is known from testimony and the
electronic intercepts about his actions on that day.
For example, the following is a reasonable possible
chronology of Oswald's actions on 9/27/63 based on analy-
sis of the available evidence. Oswald probably arrived
in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on September 27. 1113/ By
10:30 Oswald had time to arrive at the Hotel del Comercio
and to place a call to the Soviet Military Attache who
referred him to the Consul. 1114/. The military attache
also gave the caller directions to the Consulate. 1115/

whether or not guards were posted outside of Elena's
home in 1963 as she claims.
But other details of Elena's story are very credi-
ble. Perhaps the most striking is the suggestion that
Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more exten-
sive than just the business contacts in the Cuban Consu-
late. 1146/ Another detail is the manner in which Elena's
allegations were handled, and the manner in which this
Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations
have been frustatred. 1147/.
In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran
had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City. 1148/
In 1967 this report was confirmed by a CIA agent who
talked to Silvia Duran. 1143/ The CIA Station did not
consider the information significant and told the agent
to end his contact with Ms. Duran. 1150/ If that informa-

worked for the Mexican Ministry of Government. 1159/ .
In 1963, Mr. Calvillo was an unwitting asset of the Central
Intelligence Agency. 1160/ Ms. Garro claimed that she
told Mr. Calvillo her story on November 23, 1963. 1161/
Yet the CIA Mexico City Station did not receive a report
from Calvillo on this matter until November 24, 1964, the
same day that Elena first told her story to American of-
ficials. 1162/ For these reasons it was felt that
Manuel Calvillo could well be a key to determining the
veracity of Ms. Garro's story. The Committee's attempt
to interview Mr. Calvillo were also frustrated.
There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms.
Garro's allegations regarding June Cobb Sharp. For exam-

Reviewing the manner in which the CIA Mexico City
Station and the Legal Attache's office in Mexico City
handled Ms. Garro's allegations reveals that, at best,
her allegations were handled in an irresponsible manner
because they were dismissed after a superficial investi-

filed and forgotten. 1168/ The Legat, after talking to
Elena, dismissed her story after interviewing one person

It would appear that whereas the FBI has

The Committee attempted to locate Elena Garro.
Although the Committee established telephonic contact
with Ms. Garro, the Committee was totally frustrated
in this aspect of its investigation, but yet believes.
that there is a possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald did
attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran.
The Committee also considers it possible that
Lee Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro students at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, hereinafter UNAM) as claimed
by Oscar Contreras Lartigue. 11721 Silvia Duran admitted
that she had told Oswald of two ways in which he could
get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intransit visa by
first obtaining a visa to another Communist country such
as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban visa by
knowing someone in Cuba who would vouch for him. 1173/

It is possible that after Oswald's attempts to obtain
a visa by the first method were frustrated on Saturday,
September 28, that he made one final effort to locate
someone trusted by the Cuban Consulate to vouch for

There is no direct evidence about how Oswald
could have learned of the pro-Castro group at UNAM.
There is a possibility that Ernesto Leffeld Miller,
a friend of the Durans who borrowed Horacio's car often
took Lee Harvey Oswald to the campus of the National
Autonomous University. On the days when Lee Harvey Os-

It is possible that Silvia Duran asked him to escort

strange that Silvia had told Oswald he could not travel
while in Cuba. They wondered what Duran was trying to
tell Oswald and whether she thought that Oswald had
some objective in going to Cuba other than that ascribed
by the popular version. They also considered the manner
in which Silvia obtained employment at the Cuban Consu-

her brothers seemed to have almost programmed responses
and a defensive demeanor. They pointed out, however,
that all the Durans had been very interested in talking

First, while admittedly there are contra-

these records nevertheless suggest that an

In addition, it has been determined by this

These visits and conversations are
not heresay; for persons watching these

entered and left each one; and clocked the
time he spent on each visit. The

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

University of Mexico and later did graduate work at Berkley

to India, the couple separated by mutual consent. Elena's
daughter, also named Elena, has always resided with her
mother.
Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life
in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about her
native land and had a reputation for being one of its more
articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was considered
emotionally committed to many aspects of Mexican life and
made an important contribution to its artistic development

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.
Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura
Allende, Andaise por las Rumas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje
are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.
Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called
La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London
-
Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porenir, "a"
splendid success." Critic¦ have said of her: "For Elena
Garro, there is no frontier between reality and fantasy;
in any case, the latter is a second reality--perhaps more
intense--to which one may penetrate without passport or
forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of a literature
fired with passion, flavor and life." Many people who
knew Elena have asserted that the frontier between reality
and fantasy is also difficult for her to distinguish in
real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena Garra de Paza

put into action the day of, or the day following, the

Photographic Surveillance Operations Aimed at
the Soviet Diplomatic Compound
1. Introduction
The Mexico City CIA Station maintained
photographic surveillance on the Soviet, diplomatic
compound in Mexico City in 1963. Three photographic
sites, or bases, were used in this operation. 105/
The primary objective of the operation was to photograph
people who visited the Soviet Embassy. 106/
The
operation, generally, covered the main gate of
the Soviet.compound between 900 and 1800 (or dark)
on weekdays and from 900 to 1400 on Saturdays. 107/

problems in the manual operation during these three
months.99/
4. Disposition of Production from the Operaton
The photographs from the manual camera were
maintained in a chronological file at the CIA
station in Mexico City. 100, These photographs were
routinely shown to a penetration agent in the Cuban
Embassy for identification purposes. 101/ After this
agent left the employment of the Cuban Embassy in
1965, the photographs were sent to the JMWAVE
Station in Miami, Florida For review by Cuban
defectors such as AMMUG/1.102/
The disposition of the pulse camera photographs
in general, beyond the fact that as of 1965, and
possibly earlier, the production was routinely sent
to Headquarters, is unknown.103/ The CIA denies
that the pulse camera was functioning during the time
Oswald was in Mexico.104/ If the Committee's belief
that the pulse camera was functioning on the days that
Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate is correct, then
the ultimate disposition of the photographs produced
: on
on those days remains a mystery.

This was done in an attempt to identify possible
Soviet espionage agents.
My understanding of that was that it was to
be used to identify those people who might
be working for the Soviets as espionage
agents who were U.S. citizens who went down
there driving a car with a U.S. license
plate on it, or people we did not know

also used for trying to identify people

person who would know, is the case officer who
was handling the project at that time.123/
Ms. Goodpasture explained the discrepancy between the
time of coverage as stated in her notes and testimony
and that in the 11/27/63 menorandum by saying that the
memorandum referred to the coverage instituted after
the assassination of John Kennedy. 124/ An examination
of the photographic production from the LIMITED
base shows that the coverage from that base prior
to the assassination was fairly uneven. 125/ The log
sheets for this operation show that, if anything,
coverage decreased after the assassination. 126/
The House Select Committee on Assassinations
reviewed production and log materials from one base,
LIMITED, which covered the gate of the Soviet diplomatic
compound. 127/ The LIMITED ase was referred to as
the "primary" base because it began operation before

There are some indications that the photographic
coverage was more extensive than just office hours.
Even though the Embassy was not open past 6:00 p.m.,
visitors could still gain entrance by ringing the gate
bell.
"Russian speakers can get in any time."120/
One CIA officer who was in Mexico City remembers'
"that the photo surveillance was constant except for
instances where it would be down for security reasons
or equipment malfunction." 21/ A blind memorandum,
dated 11/27/63, entitled "Memo passed, to Mr. Papich
1
of FBI with info on photo coverage of embassies and
info on Kostikov," says, in part,
:
We have photographi: coverage during daylight
hours on the USSR, Cuban, Czechoslovak and
Polish Embassies. Their consulates are
located in the embassies and therefore the
coverage of the embassies would include
coverage of the consulates. The photographic
coverage is of a continuous nature during
daylight hours. However, weather conditions
and other factors affecting any photographic
efforts require that the coverage not be
considered as total or complete. 122/
Ann Goodpasture was questioned about the scope
of the photographic coverage on the Soviet compound.
She said:

There were three bases which provided photo-

in 1963.109/ One of the bases overlooked the enclosed
garden or "backyard". area of the Soviet Embassy.110/
The other two bases, of primary concern to this
Committee, covered the entrance to the Soviet
compound. 111/ The primary base, LIMITED, was.

3. Objectives of Operation and Scope of
Coverage Provided
The purpose of this operation has also been
described as being to obtain photographs of Soviet

Given the somewhat uneven nature of the coverage
maintained by LIMITED, 131/ the House Select Committee
on Assassinations staff asked whether the two bases
were run in conjunction so as to provide more
comprehensive coverage. Thomas Keenan, the project's
case officer, did not remember that this was the case.
He did remember that both tases operated at the same
time so as to get the most complete coverage possible. 132/
Mr. Keenan was not sure whether there was routine
coverage of the Soviet Embassy on weekends. 133/ He
said that it was possible that there was routine
coverage on Saturday mornings.134/
An examination of the project file maintained
by the CIA on the photographic coverage of the Soviet
Embassy does not bear out Mr. Keenan's assertion
that the two bases duplicated efforts. In fact, the
project file confirmed that the bases complemented each
other rather than duplicated efforts. This was the
case in 1960 when a project review stated:

The Station. feels that it would be helpful
to summarize at this time information
previously reported to Headquarters (see
paragraph 3, reference B) concerning the photo
basehouses under this project and thereby
give Headquarters an updated frame of
reference in which to view the roles of the
various basehouses.
•
The LIMITED and LILYRIC basehouses
provide coverage of front of the LIMERICK
installation. Although on the surface it may
appear that these two basehouses provide
duplicate take, this is not the case. It has
been the Station's experience in running the
unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900 to
evening workday, which would be required of
a single basehouse in order to cover the
LIMERICK target effectively, is just too long
for any pair of agerts to remain effective.
This is especially true when it is considered
that these basehouse operators are essentially
unsupervised during their workday. It would
also be impossible for a single base-house to
provide the kind of coverage this station needs
on the target instalation, especially during
the peak hours of activity, namely late
morning and early afternoon. For these
reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse generally
operates from 0900 to 14.00 or 1500 weekdays.
LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark
(as the daily situation dictates) on weekdays,
and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdays. (These hours
are subject to change to fit Station needs.).
Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a
need basis; however, past experience has shown
regular coverage of Saturday afternoons and
Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule
provides for both basehouses to be in action

Regardless of the scope and effectiveness of

due to the conflicting evidence and missing production,
the surveillance was considered adequate:
Q: How thorough was the coverage?

They covered the categories that we asked
them for on a routine basis, which was to
identify any people who appeared to be
non-Latin and any Soviets.

completely airtight, anything less than this
would present unacceptable gaps in the coverage.
It must also be considered that without
two basehouses covering the front of the
target installation, any illness, personal
problem or vacation for operators of one
basehouse would terminate Station coverage..
It is the Station's opinion that as long as
the LIMERICK installation is a prime target of

the present three basehouses. To eliminate
any one of the three would create a gap in the

Coordination of Photographic and Electronic
Surveillance Operations
The Mexico City Station employed an operating
procedure whereby the functioning of the photographic
base and the electronic intercept base could be
coordinated. If the listering post monitor heard
something that would lead him to believe that there
was someone at one of the Embassies that should be
photographed, he would alert the CIA technician in
the listening post who would then alert Ann Good-

pasture. 181/ Ms. Goodpasture could then alert
Thomas Keenan who would then notify the photographic
base. 182/ The reporting to Headquarters of information
generated by the photographic surveillance operation
and the electronic operation was also coordinated. 183/
The Station was able to go back to the photographic
chronological file to check for photographs of
people that were picked up on the tap operation when
the transcripts were reviewed. 184/ It was a matter
of routine to check the photographic production when

The Corsulate
One CIA employee who was involved in Cuban
operations in Mexico City remembered that there were
taps on the telephone of the Cuban Consulate. 213/ It is
possible that the employee, Mr. Phillips, who 'wa's stationed
in Mexico City from 1961 to 1966, was incorrect, after
a fifteen-year hiatus, in placing this tap in 1963.214/
As the above notes, an examination of the project
files fails to support Mr. Phillips' memory,
although those files do show that the Consulate
telephone was tapped in 1964.

The intercept listering post operated from
approximately 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. every day. 215/

Thirty recording machines that were impulse activated
every time a tapped telephone was used taped the sur-

intercepted conversations were monitored by personnel
in the listening post. 217/
a. Types
The production from this listening post was
broken down into three categories for the purposes
of handling the tapes and transcripts: (1) intercepts
of interest to the Mexican officials (these included
such groups as the Movimento de Liberacion Nacional,
individual Communists, the Mexican Directorate of
•
Federal Security); (2) Cuban intercepts; and (3) Soviet
and bloc country intercepts.218/
b. Handling Procedures.

A summary of the conversations deemed of
sufficient interest by the listening post monitors was
prepared as they were monitored. 219/ These summaries
were called "resuma."220/ The resuma were given to

contradict the above-quoted statement in regard to
the Soviet tapes.

be held for longer than two weeks if someone thought
that the tape should be preserved as well as the
transcript.248/ The interested officer could make
a note on the transcript or he could notify Ann

(c) English Language Conversations
There are some indications that English
language conversations were transcribed at the
listening post. The Tab F Draft says:
Reels which contained Russian or a language
other than Spanish or English were taken to
another location (other than the listening
post) for translation and typing.251/
Goodpasture's notes say:
Those transcripts which had Russian or another language
besides Spanish or English went out of the
listening post the cay after the transcript
(of the conversations on the reel) was typed.
These reels were taken to another location where
they were translated and typed.252/
But, in her testimony before the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in executive session on 4/13/78, Ms.
Goodpasture said:
The transcribers, or the transcription that
I picked up, the transcribers were working

to be transcribed. The material that was
picked up the day after the date on which it
occurred was in the Spanish language, normally.253/
It is clear that the reels of tape with
conversations in the Russian language were delivered
to Mr. Boris Tarasoff for translation and transcription.254/

ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE # 614 OF "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE CIA
AND MEXICO CITY.
Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question
of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass-
ination due to a memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover to the
head of the Secret Service which said:
The Central Intelligence Agency advised that
on October 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an individual iden-
tified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to
any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau,
who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,
Texas, have observed photographs of the indi-
vidual referred to above and have listened to
a recording of his voice. These Special Agents
are of the opinion that the above-referred-to
individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.
(Memorandum from Hoover to James J. Rowley, 11/23/63,
The HSCA has determined that this statement
pp. 4-5.)
was probably based on another FBI memorandum which said:
Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who listened to the
tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald
from the Cuban Embassy to the Russian Embassy in
Mexico and examined the photographs of the visitor
to the Embassy in Mexico and were of the opinion
that neither the tape nor the photograph pertained
to Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediately
send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.
(Memorandum from Belmont to Tolson, 11/23/63, p. 1. Mr.
Belmont was reporting the results of a conversation with
the Special Agent in Charge in Dallas, Gordon Shanklin,
that occured at 11:50 A.M.)

or Russian could be expedited. 273/ He explained
that there would not have been such a process for
a Russian conversation, sirce the importance of the
conversation could not be judged due to the fact
that no one in the listening post could understand
that language. 274/ Arehart. did say that there was
such a procedure for English language conversations.275/
When one of the Mexican monitors encountered a
conversation in English, he would ask Arehart to
listen to that conversation.276/ After listening
to the conversation, Arehart would decide whether or
not it warranted special attention.277/ If he deemed.
that it was important enough, he would mark the tape
"Urgent," put it in a box, and deliver it to Ms.
Goodpasture.278/
Mr. Arehart's recollection was confirmed by an
examination of the project files for this operation.

procedure and its purpose:

Headquarters (is) not well informed on the
way the Mexico Station exploits operational
leads from (this operation). The outside
staff agent, Arnold Arehart has instructions
to alert the Station immediately if à U.S.
citizen or English speaking person tries
to contact any of the target installations.
This is done by a telephone call from outside
the tap center at a pay phone to (Ann Good-
pasture) inside the Station. Emergency
meetings are arranged in double talk... (Good-
pasture) meets Arehart within fifteen minutes
at a pre-arranged downtown location and
receives the reel with an extract of the
pertinent conversation. The reel is then
taken to the Station and given to the case
officer responsible for the target the person
was trying to contact. Headquarters is

(g) Format of Transcripts
The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff
produced was much the same as those of the Spanish
language transcripts described above. 294/
Mr.
Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English. 295/
Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation
196
"(previously transcribed)" after the meter number
referring to the reel footage location of a
conversation.297/
Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this
notation meant that the conversation had already been
transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:
"Previously transcriped" means, for instance,
I went to the embassy first and the embassy
number was 605055. Now this number 501264
belonged to the film's office. So consequently
if that particular call went out of the main
building to the films office and it had been
transcribed before, that is exactly what I
would do, put down "previously transcribed".
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/

Embassy, stating that his acquiring a Cuban visa
was contingent on his previously acquiring a Soviet
visa. Silvia explained to the Soviet official that
the American had stated that he was assured that
there would be no problem. At that point, the
Soviet official put another official on the phone,
causing Silvia to repeat the story. The official then

American citizen had been to the Cuban consulate
office. Silvia responded affirmatively, stating the
American was at the office at that time. The Soviet

the Soviet Consulate office he had displayed papers
from the Soviet Consulate in Washington.
He also had
a letter stating that he was a member of an organization
that favored Cuba. The American wanted to go to the

in English until the Russian discontinued it and put

Later that same day SAC Shanklin informed the Director
that the tape of Oswald's voice had been erased: "It
should be noted that the actual tape from which this
transcript was made has been erased." (Teletype from

The confusion about whether or not there was a tape
apparently continued for several days after the SAC in
Dallas informed the Director that such a tape did not
exist. On 11/25/63 the FBI Legat in Mexico City sent a
Cablegram to the director which said:
There appears to be some confusion in that no
tapes were taken to Dallas but only typewritten
transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not being
available because they had been erased.

The paragraph appearing on pages 4 and 5 of the

Information Available to the Mexico City
CIA Station from CIA Headquarters
On October 11, 1963, three days after the Mexico
City Station made the initial report to Headquarters
of Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy, the Mexico
City Station received some information about Lee
Oswald from CIA Headquarters. Headquarters informed
Mexico that the Lee Oswald who visited the Soviet
Embassy may be identical to Lee Henry (sic) Oswald.315/
Mexico City received this cable on 11 October 1963.316/
This cable described Oswald as:
born 18 Oct. 1939, New Orleans, Louisiana,
former radar operator in United States Marines
who defected to USSR in Oct. 1959. Oswald is
five feet ten inches, one hundred sixty five
pounds, light brown wavy hair, blue eyes. 317/
The cable reported Oswald's defection in 1959; his
desire to return to the United States in 1962; his
employment in Minsk; his marriage to a Russian citizen;
the return of his passport; and the State Department's
issuance of visas for Oswald and his family. 318/

This statement in the original Mexican report given
to the CIA in Mexico after the assassination would
tend to add credence to Ms. Tarasoff's
recollection that Oswald mentioned to the Soviets
that he had also tried to elicit aid from the Cubans.347/
At least one other CIA official who was in Mexico
also remembers that Oswald indicated in his
discussions with the Soviet Embassy that he hoped
to receive assistance with the expenses of his trip. 348/
Daniel Stanley Watson, a retired CIA employee
