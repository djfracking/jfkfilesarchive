that when Trujillo went, however he went, whether violently or
peacefully or died a natural death that the succession would

the potential successor groups, and it was very hard to

about it, in order to assist one or more of the dissident

everything from

15
pressure, to maintain our network of contacts with exile

of course was one of the principals, his principal instruction
was to try to keep all channels of communication open, he was
zealous in this because he disliked Trujillo intensely himself
and felt that he ought to be allied with these other groups.
And I read through the sort of overall planning papers, and I
think they fairly reflect that range of operations.
None of them were terribly effective.

in order to carry out an assassination, they thought
they needed transfer of additional weapons, of submachine guns.
I don't remember any indication that anyone thought that a
carbine or a 38 was adequate to mount an effort of that kind
against Trujillo. But they, of course, were interested in
assassinating Trujillo, involved as they were in a very life
and death struggle, their families were being slaughtered
Mr. Schwarz. The record demonstrates that the Agency was
informed in April, prior to the memorandum that went to you
which we marked as Exhibit 1, that the dissidents intended to
undertake the assassination effort and to do so within the

Would you read into the record the second paragraph?
Mr. Goodwin. "At one point during the meeting, the Vice
President asked about the three carbines which the Agency had
turned over to the dissidents, specifically asked about the
date of delivery. Mr. Goodwin made a statement to the effect
that this was done under the previous Administration, i.e.,

Mr. Schwarz. Was it your impression that Dearborn was
in charge of the Dominican Republic, or the Agency personnel
was in charge of the Dominican Republic?
Mr. Goodwin. My impression at the time was that the
instructions given to Dearborn ware carried out, and all
instructions from the President went to Dearborn.
Mr. Schwarz. Apart from instructions from the President,
was it your impression that the Agency was in charge of the
Dominican Republic or that Dearborn was in charge of the
Dominican Republic.

from Washington.

between these weapons which were to be used for purposes of

Our response to this briefing paper was immediately to

try to review our entire policy toward the Dominican Republic
and prepare, which we did over the next couple of weeks,
instructions to the Consul about the nature of future relations
with dissidents, because the President felt that things
10 might be getting out of hand, with what
was happening in the
11
Dominican Republic.
So we did prepare that paper.
The President had, as I
12

said, two great concerns.
He didn't want anybody trying to
14
15
push Trujillo over unless he knew what was going to happen
next, because he would much rather have Trujillo in there than
16
a Communist leader. And secondly, that the United States

not be associated with any kind of violent overthrow.

Kennedy's policy?

I haven't
seen any indication of the date of that transfer. I do know

since the ultimate would still be disclosed if you gave this.
So what interpretation? I mean, this is rift here with

ultimately would be disclosed if you went ahead with this

of disclosure, the problem was we did not want to be associated

Senator Schweiker.
You changed the language, but the first
part of it remained exactly the same. In fact, we feel the
transfer of arms would serve very little purpose and expose

Mr. Goodwin. Because the implication of the other language
was that, well, we were worried about being found out, when in

from this is that we don't want to be involved, but go ahead
and have the other guys on, because their position would be to
assassinate Trujillo, so what you are in effect doing is saying
let's don't be involved in it but let's indicate our support
for what they are doing.
Mr. Goodwin. We were indicating our support for what they.
were doing on the basis of the estimate in the contingency
paper that Trujillo's days were numbered and whoever took office
we wanted to be our man, that is correct. And so we were going |
to support and try to retain relations and say we would support

that you had been advised in May that certain weapons had been

expressed an interest in assassinating Trujillo.

Correct.

being that the American government, through the CIA, furnished
weapons to a group that had communicated its interest, if not
its intention, to assassinate Trujillo.

this earlier agreement, I would feel encouraged to believe that

It is true that they didn't get the machine guns, and it
is true, apparently that what you understood was that they
wanted the machine guns for assassination and they wanted the
other weapons for personal defense, but there was still, it
would seem to me, reason for them to believe that they had our
support.
Why didn't we say or communicate to them we want you to
stop and we don't want this man assassinated, and we want you
to know that we will have nothing to do with it?

assassinate Trujillo had our blessing?

10 we were in full agreement with it.
There are papers here which talk about the event of a coup
of how you're going to get Trujillo some money to get him out
Assassination was always a possibility, but
a coup d'etat, a revolution or a civil war of some kind, a whole
15
range of possibilities. And we did, in fact, believe that

telegram designed to cover our tracks should assassination occur
and you arque, and I think persuasively, that you intended much
more than that, you intended to make it clear that we were not
supporting the assassination, that machine guns were not going
to be used.
If that was our intent, and I take it that it was, why
we didn't we go one step further and say please communicate to
these dissidents who have every reason to believe from past
history that we may be supporting the overthrow, including

Mr. Goodwin. Well, may I tell you, I don't know that there
ever was any statement that those quns that were authorized on
January 12th, either in the authorization or subsequent, for
the purposes of assassination or otherwise.
Mr. Schwarz. Well, there were :scores of those;
and whether they reached you or not is a separate and important
question, but there are four or five examples of communication
to the Agency, and I think passed on to the State Department,
and that those guns were to be used for an assassination effort
whether or not the machine guns were obtained.

Now I would read those words as meaning that Mr. Dearborn
anticipated at least the real possibility of assassination
attempts in the immediate future and that he was recommending
that those CIA officers that had been connected with having
supplied weapons should be taken out of the Dominican Republic
right away.
Mr. Goodwin. Well, I would agree with a good part of that,
Senator, although I think that there were assassination plots
simmering in the Dominican Republic and now, and of course this

assassination would be unsuccessful, that Trujillo would pick
up the Americans and find out not simply about the transfer of
guns but the whole range of covert activities
that they had

been engaged in, torture them and perhaps kill them.

And he thought the safest thing to do, with this thing in

There was nothing.

20
I think, in the telegram that was sent to him that denies the
possibility that Trujillo might be assassinated or that there
might be an attempted assassination, which is the purport of
Dearborn's, because if the assassination was successful,
there

was no need to get the CIA out.

B wouldn't you, that in his opinion, Dearborn's opinion, he had

I would like to say, if I might go back, that in terms of
the telegram, is that I sat in the office with President
Kennedy who instructed me to draft a telegram to say that ha
wanted nothing to do with political assassinations, which I
did, so it's not a matter of interpretation, because he cannot

is candid, in light of the
fact that the Agency had been told that other weapons were
going to be used for the basic job, that is the assassination.
Mr. Goodwin. Well, there are several communications
regarding the weapon details of the plan and they are obviously i
inconsistent.
Mr. Schwarz, They are.
Mr. Goodwin. The telegrams say it, but on the other hand,
a carbine or pistol is hardly a quiet weapon. I mean, I would
regard that as saying I am going to strangle him. And if
you're going to have a fire fight with machine guns, I mean

And that is what the President
at that point had in mind on May 13th, around May 13th, about
the original transfer, which was not pursuant to any policy that:

said, you know, make it clear to Dearborn that we're not getting
involved in assassinations.

As a matter of fact, we took much greater efforts to
get rid of Ramfes Trujillo in the six months that followed the
assassination than anything that preceeded it, including bringing
the American fleet practically into the harbor at Cuidad
Trujillo at the direction of the Secretary of Defense. Instead

Mr. Goodwin. That's right. We had, of course, a series
of emergencies. We had an emergency meeting, and cabled the
President who was in Paris, and the first matter on our mind
was how to keep Ramfes Trujillo, who was the son of Trujillo,
from taking over, and we didn't know where he was, at first,
it took us awhile to find out that he was in Paris, which at
indicated, Senator, that if they were planning it, it
wasn't done in a very comprehensive fashion, and we found he
was in Paris and we wanted to stop him from returning, to
detain him, but it was too late. By the time we found out, he
had already chartered an Air France jet and was on his way to
Cuidad Trujillo, and I believe there was some effort made to
bluff him off by sending messages to the plane in flight,
diverting it to some American airport, but he didn't do that.
and he landed and took over. And I think the principal aim of
our policy from that point on was how to get him and his uncle,

material, would you racount for the Committee your understanding
of what the United States government policy toward the Dominic
3 Republic was in the winter and spring of '61 and what actions
were taken to implement that policy.
Mr. Goodwin. Well, that policy was a continuation of the
6 policy established by President Eisenhower when he, in
accordance with the vote of the OAS, voted to sever -- decided
to sever diplomatic and commercial relations with the Dominican;
Republic and the situation which you know arose was precipitated
by the attempted assassination of President Betancourt by the
President of the Dominican Republic.

So that from that point on when we came in, the feeling

at odds with the philosophy of the Alliance for Progress than
had been and beyond that, having cut off diplomatic and other
relations, that Trujillo's time: dh office was probably.
numbered. The principal support of the regime in that decade
which was often in great domestic difficulty had been the
concept of American support, it strengthened Trujillo against
his opposition.
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
At that point our policy became one of trying to anticipat

was very much in everybody's mind and the principal concern of
the President, the one thing he didn't want was for Trujillo
25
to go and a Communist leader to come in. So I think the policy
