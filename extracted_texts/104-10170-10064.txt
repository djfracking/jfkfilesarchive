ABSTRACT

1. SUMMARY. The Reference A. AMSPELL exhibit toured six
Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June
1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz where excel-
lent results were achieved the tour was only moderately success-
ful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and
Montevideo. According to AMSPELL, the total number of persons who
viewed the exhibit was 6,720. Another 2,792 persons reportedly
attended conferences at which the AMSPELL team gave talks on the
Reference A. exhibit and the dangers and weaknesses of Castro-
Communism Publicity was given the exhibit by 34 newspapers (47
AMSPELL
items), 30 radio stations, and six television stations.
estimated the TV audience at 1,300,000. Sample clippings are
enclosed under separate cover. Reports from WH stations and the
WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team lead us to conclude that the
tour was a moderate success that could have been much better if
if had been better organized and if the ANSPELL team had had more
experience. (On balance) we believe the tour was well worth the
approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however,
believe it should be repeated in the foreseeable future in view
of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to
organize the exhibit in the various cities.

ambassador. The exhibit received excellent coverage in all four of the
leading La Paz newspapers and the three largest radio stations carried
AMSPELL conferences. Despite the excellent publicity, a total of only
600 persons visited the exhibit in La Paz. According to AMSPELL, this
was due to Bolivian preoccupation with such things as a national day to
demand a passage to the sea for Bolivia which stopped all traffic and-
communication.

a. Buenos Aires. The AMSPELL team arrived in Buenos Aires on
27 March during Holy Week. In addition to the delay caused by Holy Week
celebrations, the team had difficulty finding space for the exhibit.

early arrival caught their local contacts unprepared and it was not
until 16 May that the exhibit opened. Excellent support was provided
by station assets and widespread publicity was given to the event.
However, the exhibit was located in a relatively remote spot and only
300. persons attended the exhibit, according to AMSPELL. (The Station
estimate was 400-500). Another 140 persons attonded ANSPELL con-
forences. The station report (HVCA-11393) which has been corroborated
by the WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL toam, describes the typical

approximately 485 persons. HLBA-6911reported GISNEAKER-9's observations
on the local reaction to the tour, which he judged to be indifferent.

should also be noted that the AMSPELL team was not on the best of terms
with some of the local Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal
to do with the poor showing.
b. Medellin. The showing in Medellin was better than in
Bogota. The press was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio
station gave them considerable publicity, and they were able to hold

ferences given by the team.
C. Cali. The team received good advance press play in Cali,
which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist party
was also well prepared for their arrival. On the very first morning
of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter the exhibit
with the obvious intention of starting trouble, and when they were
locked out began to throw rocks and "stinkbombs" into the exhibit hall.
The incident provided considerable publicity for AMSPELL, as reported

3. ECUADOR.
a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.
QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality clashes with the
local AMBARBS and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,
who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities
for the exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th.

team generally corroborated the above story in their debriefing by WAVE.
After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to
recommend any future tours.
b. Guayaquil. The AMSPELL team considered Guayaquil their
most successful operation, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base who
termed it a "resounding success. (See QUIT 5867 and HEGA 2900). The
exhibit received front page coverage in "El Universo" and "El Telegrafo",

The ANSPELL team arrived in Santiago on 3 March to coincide

Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilean customs authori-
ties would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL
team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences due to
competition from the congress for space. (See SAGO 6577). The AMSPELL
team had been counting on a contact in the Catholic University, Fernando 04
