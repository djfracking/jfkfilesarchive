David A. Phillips
Section D., Continued:
The most dramatic challenge to the capabilities of the
WH Division in the past year flowed from the overthrow of
the Allende government in Chile. Overall, the intelligence
reporting was timely and accurate, the adjustments to our
political action prograns skillfully made, and the responses
to Congressional inquiry well handled.
It is as a senior operations officer that Mr. Phillips
has had the greatest experience, and it is not surprising
that he has made an excellent input into the improvement of
operational matters throughout the many areas of this
hemisphere for which he is responsible. He has also consistently
handled the many and important senior liaison contacts which he
has made during this year, both at Headquarters and during field
visits, with great effectiveness.

This report covers Mr. Phillips' initial period as a Division
Chief. It coincided with a period of unusually high stress and
strain in the Western Hemisphere Division, particularly in relation-
ships with the State Department and in the problems left over from
our drastic measures designed to protect ourselves against a
potential counterintelligence disaster. The most important fact to
be recorded about Mr. Phillips' direction of his Division during
this period is that he kept operations at the top of his priority
list, and that as a result our operational achievements in the area
during the past year have been on the whole better than in the year
before.
.
.
Mr. Phillips is developing into a very competent manager, and
has handled well the problems involved in adjusting to decreasing
manpower ceilings. He is prudent in the use of official funds. He
is a good supervisor and is providing excellent leadership to his
subordinates, who have responded with a clear improvement in morale
during the period since Mr. Phillips assumed charge.

SECTION D
NARRATIVE COMMENTS
1. In the period covered by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of
Station Brazilia during the time frame February to August 1972. After that
Mr. Phillips became the Chief of Station, Caracas and served in Venezuela
during the period August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mr.
Phillips was responsible for managing an average of 44 Agency employees.
Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of
* 1. 8 million which was spent on FI, CA, CI, anti-narcotics and protected
economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in Brazil and
Venezuela are high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin
America. This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts
during a fifteen month time span.
2.
As a manager Mr. Phillips is operations oriented. In view of this he
places his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de-
signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently
produced results in terms of FI and CA operations which are targeted against
the host country.
1
3. Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations manager
- who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in-
telligence and the anti-narcotics effort. Unfortunately, as these programs
moved into gear Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had
just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one
can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial
duties against these priority targets. The brevity of his program imple-
mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid basis, however, for
measuring tangible success. In short Mr. Phillips deserves high marks for
initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were receiving increased
attention at Headquarters.
4.
The myriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location.
from one city to another were still challenging Mr. Phillips when he left
Brasilia. In overview terms, however, the move from Rio de Janerio to
Brasilia was well done. This does not mean that Mr. Phillips' successor at
Brasilia did not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini-
strative field. The scope of these actions, however, was in the realm of the
reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.
5. In representational terms Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning
and maintaining the respect of the American Ambassadors in Brazil and
Venezuela. This is due in large measure to Mr. Phillips' native charm,
area knowledge, and language skills in Spanish and Portuguese. In addition,
Mr. Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell
himself and CIA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.
6. In personal terms Mr. Phillips is a hard-working, dedicated officer
who is a good team player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire
to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed in CA
skills and is politically oriented. As a result he likes the challenge of election
operations and is well qualified in this area.
7.
Mr. Phillips' total performance during the period covered by this
report merits an evaluation of Strong.
8. In terms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likely to be at his pro-
fessional best in field activities. This officer is highly specialized in Latin
American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most
Agency posts in Europe or Asia.
9. Mr. Phillips' activities come to the attention of the Rating Officer
on a daily basis.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.
SUBJECT: David A. Phillips
1 July 31 December 1971
-
1
This memorandum is in lieu of a fitness report to
cover Mr. Phillips' performance during the period 1 July
to 31 December 1971. This rating is being prepared in
view of the rater's imminent departure from the Division.
Last month Mr. Phillips was promoted from GS-16
to GS-17. There is no better evidence of the high esteem
in which he is held by his superiors in the Agency.
During this rating period Mr. Phillips transferred
the station from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia. This move,
however, divorces the Chief of Station from the main area
of operations, Rio de Janeiro. In spite of this Mr. Phillips,
through much extra effort and time on his part, has been
able to maintain a high operational tempo in the station.
Station relations with key people in the Brazilian
government, especially the security agencies, have been
highly productive but through recent efforts, these relations
have been placed on a much higher plane with the decision
of General Fontoura, chief of the SNI, to give the station
copies of the briefings especially prepared for President
Medici.

$
I
This memorandum is in lieu of the fitness report on Mr.
Phillips as Chief of Station, Rio de Janeiro, during the period
1 April 1970 to 30 June 1971.
Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative
Operations Officer and manager who makes a substantial contri-
bution to the Clandestine Service.
The above statement is borne out by the fact that faced with
a highly difficult, sensitive operational problem of the utmost
priority in the fall of 1970, the Rater immediately thought of
Mr. Phillips as the man to head the Task Force and received
immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director
for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He
was recalled from Brazil, took over the Task Force, and handled
it in an outstanding manner.
My first statement is further borne out by the fact that
Ambassador Rountree, on a recent visit to Washington, made
a special effort to express to the Rater his appreciation for
Mr. Phillips' support to him and the Embassy and to express
further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him a man
of Mr. Phillips' caliber.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. David A. Phillips
1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970
:
This memorandum is in lieu of the fitness report on
Mr. David A. Phillips as Chief of Station, Rio de Janeiro,
during the period 1 April 1969 to 31 March 1970.
During this period Mr. Phillips took over command of
the Rio Station. It is typical of Mr. Phillips that he made
excellent preparation for this assignment, including a full-
time course in the Portuguese language.
Mr. Phillips has brought to his new position the opera-
tional zeal and enthusiasm that has characterized all of his
previous positions. Brazil, by the very nature of its size but,
more importantly, the type of "strait jacket" government in
power, is à difficult place to operate on a broad plain. Mr.
Phillips has the station moving and real effort and progress is
seen on the more difficult targets, such as the Soviets.
He has excellent relations within the embassy and is
recognized for his contribution to the Country Team. He, of
course, handles his liaison contacts with mature style and is
very actively developing a number of contacts in the local
community.

:
however, his having achieved a corresponding tested level because of the
remining influence of Spanish.
"
Di the case of this student, I judge his command of the language to be
already adequate for all situations he may encounter in the field. So that
while he may not test quite elementary, in reality, and as far as ability to
communicate effectively is concerned, he would have to be rated intermediate.

The general aim of this course of study was to provide the student with a command of
a foreign language in a skill and at the level set by the sponsoring office.
aural comprehension and reading comprehension, as required, were emphasized.
and accuracy were given equal importance in training and in evaluation of the student.
Cultural matters were covered only incidentally.
This student evaluation is based on (1) Instructor and Linguist observations;
(2) regularly administered oral and written achievement tests; (3) a final comprehen-
sive achievement examination. The achievement rating reflects only performance and
achievement in the course and is conditioned by the length of time the student spent
in training, achievement potential based upon his or her aptitude for language study
and upon motivation. This rating should not be confused with the Proficiency Rating
which is submitted separately on Form 1273, Certification of Language Proficiency.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
F.A.
In six weeks the student covered the entire DII course of 75 lessons which
usually takes 4 to 6 months to complete. His study habits and approach to language
learning were excellent and he made maximum use of the time available.
The joint decision by instructor and student to rush through 75 lessons was
based on:
(1) the student's determination to make as much of a conversion from
Spanish to Portuguese as possible and
(2) on the instructor's faith and confidence in the student's ability to
do so.
In cases where the principal objective is to convert a student's command of
Spanish to an equivalent level in Portuguese, the point is often reached where the
student is able to understand and make himself understood most adequately without,

SUBJECT:
Mr. David A. Phillips
1 April 1968 to 31 March 1969
-
Mr. Phillips continues to head the Division's program
against the high-priority Cuban target, although he has also been
selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the
coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which
he is held by his superiors in the Agency. Mr. Phillips has had
the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back,
in terms of money and people, and in which task he has played a
♬ major role. At the same time as doing a pruning job, he has had
to try to maintain a vigorous program and to keep up enthusiasm.
His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have
done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has
a positive attitude toward operations and is determined; his day-
to-day concern is for developing new operations, and he has put
all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions.
Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America
well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is
never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc-
ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and
outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with
other government elements. He also writes notably well.
His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal
with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the
new Miami station which he is responsible for supporting and
guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy
in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often
conflicting views. He has shown a good head for costs in all of
this.

The CAS Station Chief has been at the post only since August 13, 1977.
Although this period may seem unusually short for the preparation of a
performance evaluation, I would like to say that I have been enormously
and favorably impressed by his performance during this initial period.
The CAS Station Chief comes to Venezuela from a series of highly
responsible positions in which, I understand, he performed outstandingl
He has taken hold of his new position in a commanding manner and gives
every indication of being thoroughly on top of his job. He is under-
standing of the Embassy's needs. professionally competent in his
approach to his work, and highly articulate in explaining those facts
and factors which are of importance to me and to other officers or
the Embassy.
I am very favorably impressed by the initial performance of the CAS
Station Chief and I consider myself fortunate to have him with me at
this post.

The previous incumbent completed his assignment at this post and
departed on June 29, 1972. During the period under review he continued
to perform in a highly creditable manner, working well with other
members of the Embassy staff and handling the affairs of his agency
in a most professional, efficient and effective manner.
In my last evaluation I stated that both the Agency and the Embassy
were fortunate to have a man of the rated officer's abilities and
qualities as CAS Chief at this important post. I am happy to say
that his performance throughout his assignment here reinforced that
view.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
Mr. Phillips is an able officer and a highly cooperative member
of the Country Team. I have been impressed and pleased with the
degree of cooperation which exists between him and other members of
the Embassy staff. He has, to the extent that is possible considering
the nature of his work, cooperated in our efforts to bring about
maximum coordination of reporting. With rare exceptions he has, I
believe, kept me appropriately advised on all matters relating to his
functions, and the material which he provides on a regular basis has
been extremely useful in the discharge of my mission.
Mr. Phillips works quietly and discreetly and is alert to any
situation which might create problems for the Embassy and the United
States. I fully share the view of the DCM, expressed in a previous
evaluation, that both Mr. Phillips and his wife conduct themselves in
a quiet, friendly and wholly creditable manner.
I feel that both the Agency and the Embassy are fortunate in
having a man of Mr. Phillips' abilities and qualities as CAS Chief
at this important post.

Mr. Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially
with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration
and emulation. Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic person
and he has some of the faults that often go with this virtue: he is
impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that if
someone else does not do it for him, his work is sometimes
marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.
Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips
_has had a very trying year personally and it is a proof of his
strength of character that he has not only come through it but has
hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being
any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.
His performance has been very Strong.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
Mr. Phillips' performance during the four months covered by this
evaluation has been highly satisfactory. For some years previous to
my arrival here, in June 1970, I had been acquainted with him, and
from this I already had a favorable impression of his qualities. This
impression has continued and has improved further. He has worked
quietly and discreetly, has kept me informed of all important deve-
lopments, and has coordinated as necessary with other offices in the
Embassy. His interest in his work, and his dedication to the job,
have been outstanding. His relations with others are very good.
Because of wide previous experience in this hemisphere, he frequently
is helpful to Embassy officers in areas outside his own specialization.
He appears to manage his personnel well. In functions outside the
Embassy, both he and his wife conduct themselves in a quiet, friendly,
and wholly creditable manner.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
Phillips has been here too short a time and there has been too little
opportunity for us to work together for me to be able to discuss his
performance in detail. I am able to say, however, that he has
impressed me and other Embassy officers with whom he works, including
Ambassador Elbrick, very favorably, indeed. He is a cool-headed,
straightforward, intelligent man who seems professionally very
capable. He has a clear understanding of the appropriate role for
himself and his organization within the Embassy and is working to
achieve a genuinely low profile. He has already demonstrated his
interest in the best possible relations with the rest of the U.S.
Government organization and he knows how to act in order to achieve
such a relationship. He has come to me a number of times to volunteer
detailed information which he did not feel important enough to bother
the Ambassador about, but he has kept the Ambassador fully informed
about all those subjects which were of sufficient interest to him.
I see every reason to assume that he will be a positive, constructive
and very dependable and reliable factor in the Embassy.
Mrs. Phillips is an attractive and personable young lady who has
particularly impressed my wife and me with her attitude and intellect.

I wish to make special mention of, first, the scrupulous-
ness with which the Rated Officer has consulted me and kept me
informed about his activities, and, second, his strict adherence
to the guidance I have given him. At no time have I had any
doubts concerning the care and fidelity with which he has
followed my instructions.
I have developed the highest personal and professional
regard for the Rated Officer. I have valued greatly his advice
and his support not only upon matters within his own special
field of competence, but also over a considerably broader
spectrum of U.S. Mission activities. I could not have asked
for a better Chief of Station than the one whom I have had at
this post. I very much regret his departure but am comforted
by the knowledge that his successor, as his deputy, has been
trained by him.

I earnestly hope that these comments of mine based on

The Rating Officer's last fitness
Hon Mr. Phillips dealt
with his terminating an outstandingly successful and very complicated
assignment as Chief of Station, Dominican Republic. This report deals
with a completely different situation, i. e. coming into Headquarters as
Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic reduction had
just become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and
zeal which has characterized Mr. Phillips over the years has
characterized his performance in this difficult task since his
assumption of the new responsibility. He has been a prime mover in
reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and
managable proportions. By the same token he has been a prime mover,
guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to JMWAVE management
in its massive job of bringing JMWAVE down from its ponderous
proportions to a viable Clandestine Services "instrument" compatible
and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban operations. In this
endeavor Mr. Phillips' accomplishments have been of the first order.

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. I
believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views. Mr. Phillips'
career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not
believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely
expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)
I have been associated with the CAS Station Chief since my arrival
at this post on January 11, 1966, Inasmuch as I have kept in very close
daily touch with him, I believe that I am in position to evaluate his
performance.
-
Let me say at the outset that the Rated Officer has had to work
under the most varied and difficult circumstances. His service at
this post began, for example, in a revolutionary situation marked by
great and continuing violence. The attention of a good part of the
world was focused upon this situation, and some of the highest national
interests of the United States were involved. The presence of the
Inter-American Peace Force, of its major U.S. component, and of
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker in his unusual and unprecedented role
added greatly to the dimensions of the work done by the Rated Officer.
In the aftermath of revolution, he had unusual, delicate and complicated
tasks to perform in connection with the establishment and maintenance
in power of a most fragile Provisional Government. As the latter
carried the nation toward the all-important election scheduled for
June 1, 1966, the CAS Station Chief faced a changing and constantly
challenging set of requirements. Finally, his tour of duty at this
post has encompassed the transition from the Provisional Government
to a constitutional government emerging from those elections and the
gradual firming up of the position and institutions of the present
democratically elected administration.
To this intricate complex of circumstances, the CAS Station Chief
has brought a background knowledge of the Latin American area and its

people as well as a proficiency in Spanish which has enabled him
to deal readily and effectively with a heterogeneous range of
contacts.
.
His performance can only be described as outstanding. He
has provided a completely professional response to a most diffi-
cult and varied challenge. He has mounted an organization and
provided a mechanism fully up to the tasks confronting it and
the high-level requirements levied upon it. With the advantages
afforded by hindsight, I suggest that the success which has been
achieved speaks for itself.
It is pertinent to mention that the Rated Officer invariably
places business ahead of pleasure and personal interests. He
works long and irregular hours and is continuously available in
time of need. He has evidenced the highest degree of cooperation
with representatives of State, DOD, Legal Attaché, AID (in the
Public Safety sector) and all other members of the Country Team.
His quiet and professional approach inspires their confidence,
and on innumerable occasions he has proven that he is an excellent
team player who genuinely wants to be of assistance to all members
of the official community. The harmonious, close relations among
all the intelligence components of the Country Team are due in
great part to the tactful, skillful and thoughtful leadership of
the Station Chief.
There is probably little need for me to comment upon the
Rated Officer's technical achievements at this post. Under his
guidance, specialized security agencies of the Dominican
Government have been brought to a state of high readiness.
Penetration of subversive groups has reached impressive propor-
tions. Subversive document seizures have been abundant. Counter-
espionage work has been impressively successful.
no
The CAS Station Chief is in/sense a narrow technician or
specialist. He keeps his eye on the broad picture, understands
what he sees there and intelligently relates it to his own work.
He is imaginative in his approach and does not hesitate to
suggest innovations of various kinds. To mention only one of
these, it was as a result of his initiative that "electoral
police" appeared upon the scene during the Presidential election
campaign in mid-1966 with a salutary calming effect upon the
potential for political violence at the moment.

Fitness Report
"David A. Phillips
SECTION C (Continued)
Most important however, and this is one of Mr. Phillips
unique qualities, he has been able to bring about this drastic
reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his staff for
new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target. His own
infectious enthusiasm and his fine manner with co-workers and
subordinates has made this possible. In short the Rating Officer
believes he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in.
Mr. Phillips' relations with the Department of State and
other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He
has in his short time back re-established his fine relationship with
the manager of the Voice of America. This relationship will
undoubtedly be of inestimable value in getting WH Division's new
radio effort through the 303 Committee and into operation.
It is probably obvious to one reading this fitness report that
the Rating Officer is well disposed towards Mr. Phillips. This is
quite true. It in no way, however, affects the Rating Officer's
opinion that Mr. Phillips is a man of considerable talent who for
one reason or another has fallen at least one grade behind in the
promotion timetable. The Rating Officer, therefore, trusts that
this will be corrected in the near future. Mr. Phillips is a gentleman
of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication. The Rating Officer
considers Mr. Phillips to be one of the very best of the many fine
officers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services.
some ways he is unique in that he knows the business from the ground
up, having started in unofficial cover (several assignments) and now
having moved into the managerial area were he can speak with
authority based on valid experience.

management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of
the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large,
at home and abroad,
The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods
conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, pro-

Mr. Phillips is nearing completion of his tour of duty as Chief
of Station, Santo Domingo.. During the past several months he has haď
the difficult task of reorganizing his Station and redirecting its manpower
following a major election operation. His task has been made more
difficult by a series of almost weekly political or security crises which
· not only required intensive intelligence coverage but also frequently
involved Station assets.
* Mr. Phillips has done remarkably well in this difficult regearing
process. It has in no way affected the volume or quality of Station
reporting which remains very high. His critical analysis and in-depth
interpretation of the rapidly changing political scene have been timely
and useful.
•
The Station under his direction has aggressively undertaken the
development of new FI and CI assets without losing momentum in existing
operations. Also in a relatively short period of time effective security
and countersubversion units within the host government internal security
apparatus have been established,

Mr. Phillips brings to this assignment (his first as Chief of Station)
a wealth of CA experience gained through many years of operating in the
Western Hemisphere and other areas. As a propagandist and general CA
operator he must rank high among all Agency personne. Consequently,
it was indeed fortunate that his assignment to the Dominican Republic came
at a time when a person of his talent was badly needed. Arriving shortly
after the American intervention he has had the difficult task of ferreting
out information in great detail about an entirely new government,
diplomatically handling the delicate coordinations with other U.S.
Government agencies in a crisis and highly emotional situation, while
administering a rapidly expanding station composed in large degree of
young men long on initiative and intelligence but somewhat lacking in depth
of experience. At present he is engaged in a fairly large and vastly
important election operation which is of concern to the highest authorities
of our government.

COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METHODS
The COS Seminar aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of
Station, Chiefs of Base, and senior Chiefs of Support for field assignments.
Emphasis was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or medium-sized
installations, since they must handle a peculiarly wide range of problems.
Included were case studies serving to remind outgoing chiefs of various opera-
tional approaches and techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordi-
nation, management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of the Chief
of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large, at home and abroad.
Special attention was given to counterinsurgency.
The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods conducted
by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services
discussed, most of them being from within the Agency but several also from out-
side. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies of
suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those
who want thêm.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance.
Mr. Phillips attended the first half of the seminar being
withdrawn at that point due to an operational emergency.

Continued:
Perhaps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demon-
'strated is his ability to "fire up" his people to produce at their
maximum capacity. Another outstanding characteristic is his diplo-
matic manner of dealing with other officials. Of particular note is
the fact that Subject's relationship with Ambassador Bunker of the OAS
(who, in effect, has been the President's principal representative in
the Dominican Republic) are closer and more fruitful than the relation-
ship of the Embassy with Ainbassador Bunker. This has in no way
damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other
government officials.
Subject had little managerial experience of the scope required
by his present position prior to his arrival in the DR, nor had he had
much experience in FI matters. He has adapted readily however, and
hề continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time.
Cost consciousness is, of course, a relative thing. Mr. Phillips
as a CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs
heavily costs against anticipated results and expects to get a dollar
return for each one spent. Overall Subject can be described as a very
able person. His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while
producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself
an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended
for an Agency Award.

Dear Dave,
You have just finished an important albeit
grueling GS-16 Evaluation Exercise at my direction.
The recommendations for promotion and executive
development. you gave me were a major factor in my
recommendations to the Director for the upward
movement of officers who will be the top management
cadre of the Directorate in the near future.
I believe you will find that the last several
weeks will have sharpened your focus on one of our
most important management responsibilities, our
personnel. Many thanks for a job well done.

Mr. David A. Phillips is retiring after a
distinguished career with the Agency. He has been
an employee of the Agency since 1951 when he initially
joined as a Contract employee. He served with dis-
tinction in Santiago, Guatamala City, Havana, Beirut,
Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, and Caracas.
His excellent command of both Spanish and Portuguese
has enhanced each of his assignments in Latin América.
A true DDOer, fifteen years of this glorious and
active career were spent overseas. His outstanding
dedication and devotion to the cause of freedom won
for him in 1956, the Intelligence Medal of Merit.
His file is replete with letters of commendation
and appreciation from the DCI, DDCI, the former
President of the Dominican Republic, Ambassadors,
and military commanders, all of whom recognized the
uniqueness of his outstanding service. Mr. Phillips
has been highly effective as a senior member of the
Latin American Division which has been under his
immediate command since 1973. An excerpt from a
late fitness report nicely characterizes the caliber
of his work. "It is as a senior operations officer
that Mr. Phillips has had the greatest experience,
and it is not surprising that he has made an excel-
lent input into the improvement of operational
matters throughout the many areas of this hemisphere
for which he is responsible." Mr. Phillips will be
remembered for his initiative, drive and imagination,
and for the excellence of his representational
responsibilities which in large part is attributable
to his native charm, area knowledgeability and
superb language skills. He will be remembered for
his intent capability and desire to fulfill the
neods of the Organization. It is fitting and proper
that upon his retirement, Mr. Phillips be recognized
with the award of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

Intelligence Medal in recognition of his outstanding service to
the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 22 years. Through-

tribution to the mission of the Agency, reflecting great credit

can probably be assumed that this was to be expected.
what clearly was not predictable was their willingness to
accept any type of assignment regardless of grade or circum-
stances, their quick adaptability and initiative in an
unfamiliar and cọnfused situation, and their stamina under
the stress of long and irregular work days seven days a week.
Furthermore, in spite of the close working quarters. constant
association, and strain inherent in this type of situation,
"personality clashes" or other signs of incompatability were
very few indeed.
2. Undoubtedly, Headquarters has sensed the foregoing
from returnees. The purpose of sending this dispatch is to
make it a matter of record and to suggest to Headquarters
that their standard of performance under these conditions
may merit-consideration of some special recognition in the
personnel files of the personnel concerned.

altered situation which would be confronting the Station in
the post-crisis era. In addition to supervising the 2.A
program, he handled a number of existing agents, developed
some new assets, and conducted numerous special QA
operations, including some quite effective black activities.
On this assignment, samby worked some fourteen to sixteen
hours a day throughout the entire period.
2.
The undersigned is aware that CIA
21A would expect
a quite professional and dedicated performance from an
officer of 's seniority, experience, and caliber;

in every respect was exceptional, and should merit special
recognition.

THRU:
The Honorable W. Tapley Bennett
American Ambassador
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic
TO:
I
American Embassy
DAVID A PHILLIPS
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic
1. I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding contributions
you and your staff have made in the accomplishment of USFORDOMRÉP Intelligence
missions from 1 May 1965 through 17 January 1966. The first intelligence contact
upon our arrival at San Isidro Air Base on 1 May was a representative from your
office. From that day on a mutual respect, cordial relationship and a unity of
effort prevailed throughout the many trying days in the Dominican Republic crisis,
Without your assistance we would have realized a serious gap in the intelligence
picture, a gap which would have made intelligence evaluations and the development
of tactical estimates most difficult.
2. My J2 has frequently mentioned the close association and coordination he
has had with you and the members of your organization and repeatedly expressed
the high esteem and respect he has for the professionalism and competence
displayed by you and your subordinates.
3. The intelligence unity of effort in the Dominican Republic has been exemplary
and a prototype for future operations. This cohesive atmosphere is directly
attributable to your efforts.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services
SUBJECT
Career Service Board
Recommendation for Promotion to
GS-16: David A. Phillips
1. Mr. David A. Phillips is strongly recommended for
promotion to GS-16 and is ranked Number 2 in WH Division's
preference for promotion in that grade.
2. Mr. Phillips stands out among his peers as a true
Clandestine Services operator. He has had a range of opera--
tional assignments enjoyed by few Clandestine Services officers.
He served in Cuba, Guatemala, Beirut, Chile, Mexico and the
Dominican Republic. His functional assignments have included
Contract Agent, Operations Officer under both unofficial and
official cover, Chief of Station, and he is currently assigned
as Chief, Cuban Operations Group. In regard to his tour as
Chief of Station, Santo Domingo, I cite the following quote
made by Dr. Hector Garcia-Godoy, Provisional President of
the Dominican Republic, concerning the turbulent events in his
country during his tenure:
1
"You know," he said, "looking back over those
months when things seemed pretty bleak, two
names come immediately to mind as able and
effective representatives of the United States.
They are Ellsworth Bunker and David Phillips."

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: David A. Phillips
29 June 1961
:
:
On 14 June 1961 the undersigned reviewed with Mr. David
A. Phillips his career development prospects for the next five year
period. We agreed that the following represented a destrable and
íairly firm goal in this respect;
a. In general his future training and held experience
should place sufficient stress on the CI and FI fields to avoid the
career confinement of strict CA specialization,
b. His next assignment would be a normal held tour in
Mexico City, Upon return from that assignment, he would receive
up to six months training to be followed by an assignment to the CA
Staff (or the organizational successor thereof). One of his primary
undertakings in the CA Staff would be to develop what might best be
termed "ideological warfare" (e.g., a search for basic ideas and
concepts with wide appeal) as opposed to the normai propagandá
approach (e.g., a running debate on current everas).

STAFF AGENT LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
Hoid Philly
Dear Mr. Phillipe
1. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5.2 of the
Confidential Fund Regulations, you are hereby appointed a Staff Agent of the
Government at an initial salary of $10, 320, grade GS-14, effective as of
FEB
1956
2. As a Staff Agent of the Government, you are an appointed employee
of the Government and as such are entitled to all the emoluments of, and
subject to the restrictions of, that status. As a Staff Agent, you will under-
takè certain cover employment or activities as directed by the Government.
· Your Federal income taxes will be reported and paid in conformance with
AFN 20-660-4, dated 26 November 1954, and/or any subsequent Government
issuances promulgated on this matter.
3. As an appointed employee of the Government, you are required to
make certain contributions to the Civil Service Retirement Fund. "In the event
that you are paid through a cover facility, you will be required to return to
the Government at such times and in such manner as it shall direct the
required contributions (presently six per cent (6%) of your gross salary). If
the conditions of your cover require that you make contributions to the Social
Security Fund, such contributions will be at your expense.
4. (a) In addition to your basic salary, you will be entitled to any
post differential, living-quarters allowances, cost-of-living allowances
(except post allowance), or other allowances that are granted Government
employees stationed at the same permaneat post of duty abroad. You will
account for such allowances in compliance with applicable Government
regulations.
(b) In addition to the above payments, effective upon the arrival
of you and your dependents at your initial permanent post of duty overseas
you will be entitled to an equalization allowance calculated at the rate of
$3, 670 per annum. This allowance is in lieu of any present or future
standardized post allowance established for your initial permanent post of
duty overseas, but is subject to the entitlement provisions applicable to
standardised post allowances. It is understood and agreed that this allowance
is predicated upon the comparative cost of living between Washington, D. C.,
and your overseas post, your unofficial cover, family status and basic
compensation. Consequently, this allowance may be unilaterally adjusted
or discontinued by the Government whenever warranted by a change in any of
these factors. No accounting will be required for this allowance.

You will utilise your established cover as a newspaper publisher
and lecturer on Latin American affairs resident in Santiago, Chile.
You have chosen to live temporarily in Cuba because of unfulfilled
lecture contracts in the United States. You have not returned to your
business in Santiago because of the great expense of traveling between
Chile and the United States. You will, in fact, roturn to the United
States on two occasions to deliver lectures contracted before your
employment as a Staff Employee of this Agency. (February 14 and 15
in Sioux Falls, South Dakata, and Wichita, Kansas; and March 13 in
Palm Beach, Florida). You are strictly enjoined against using any
material relating to intelligence or other covert activities. You are
advised that the income received from the three scheduled lectures
shall not be subject to the offeet provisions of tágakka
(this letter of instruction). It is understood that the lectures will
be made while on annual leave and that all expenses incidental thereto
will be met by you. At some future date, should it be decided that you
should renew your lecture activities, the decision as to whether or not
the income will be subject to offset provisions will be made at
Headquarters.
are
You also informed that should the manuscript entitled "Popcorn
nov
in the Andes”, max in the hands of your literary agent, be published
during your tour of duty the income therefrom will not be subject to
the offect provisions of this contract.

5. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary expenses
including travel and operational expenses which are authorized by the Govern-
ment or your cover. Accountings for such expenses will be in compliance
with applicable Government regulations unless such accounting is inconsistent
with the practices of your cover facility. If the policies of your cover facility
relating to payment of travel and transportation expenses differ from those of
the Government, and if you are paid through your cover facility, you will
receive and retain the amount paid by your cover without regard to Govern-
ment regulations.
6. (a) It is specifically understood and agreed that as an appointed
employee of the Government you are entitled to receive and retain only the
salary, allowances, and other benefits which are commensurate with your
appointed position and salary grade except as provided in paragraph five (5)
above and paragraphs six (6), (b) and (c), below. Any compensation that you
may receive from your cover facility will be offset against your salary from
the Government, and you will return to the Government any salary, allowances
and other pecuniary benefits which in the aggregate exceed your Government
salary, allowances and other pecuniary benefits. You will report to the
Government not less than semi-annually any sums received from your cover
facility.
(b) It is understood and agreed that any fees derived from the
remaining three (3) lectures on your current lecture tour will not be subject
to the offset provisions of this agreement. It is further understood and agreed,
however, that said lectures will be made by you while on annual leave and that
you will be solely responsible for all expenses incidental thereto. Subsequent
to the completion of said three (3) lectures, the income derived from any
additional lectures will be presumed to be income derived from cover
activities and will, therefore, be subject to offaet unless specifically excluded
by an amendment hereto.
(c) It is understood and agreed that should a specific manuscript,
the title to which is set forth in your operational letter of instructions, be
published during your tour of duty hereunder, the income derived therefrom
will not be subject to offset as said manuscript was completed in its entirety
prior to your appointment as a Staff Agent.
7. It is understood and agreed that your overseas assignment is to be
for a minimum of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas
post of duty unless such assignment shall be sconer terminated by the Govern-
ment for its convenience. If, in violation of this letter, you terminate your
overseas assignment for your convenience at any time prior to the expiration
of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty,
you shall not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your
dependents from such post of duty to the United States; and, further, if, in
violation of this letter. you terminate your overseas assignment for your
converience prior to the expiration of one (1) year from the date of your arrival
at your overseas post of duty. you shall reimburse the Government for all its
expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from
the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.
8. It is expressly understood and agreed that any and all documents which
you may execute in the course of such cover employment are subordinate to
this letter and any contradiction in terms which .nay in any way appear to
amplify, extend or restrict your rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be
resolved by this letter which shall always be dominant.

Dear Dave:
I thought you would be pleased about a reference to you which
came up in the course of a longish conversation last night with
Dr. Hector Garcia-Godoy, former President of the Dominican
Republic and now Ambassador here, about the turbulent events
in his country three years ago.
}
"You know," he said, "looking back over those months when
things seemed pretty bleak, two names come immediately to mind
as able and effective representatives of the United States. They
are Ellsworth Bunker and David Phillips."
I thought such a pleasant echo of a rough period would help
heal your ulcers.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
THROUGH
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
DAVID A. Phillips
: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization
Retirement and Disability System
: Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965
18 You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 23 October 1966.
F
2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.
3. We believe that the benents of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your
designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

24 October 1966

•
1. The Dominican Republic Station has distinguished itself by
especially meritorious service during the past year and has made
a major contribution toward the advancement of the objectives of
the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago
the people of the Dominican Republic were facing a dismal future.
Today, while the future remains uncertain, the prospects for even-
tual stability have been immeasurably increased. Several Depart-
ments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an
effort to bring this about. I believe that the role of the CIA in thẻ
Dominican Republic during the past year was a crucial one. The
highly effective performance of the Santo Domingo Station and the
Base at Santiago was the result of the combined efforts of each offi-
cer and employee stationed there. These men and women gave un-
sparingly of their time, energy and brain power. Their efforts
were sustained over a long period under stressful circumstances,
Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile-
stone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to
grant this special recognition for a job well done to all members
of the CIA team in the Dominican Republic during the year ending
June 30, 1966.
2. I should like to commend each member of the Station who
contributed to this noteworthy performance and request that a copy
of this commendation be placed in individual personnel files as ap-
propriate.

1950 until departure for PBSUCCESS on 4 March 1954. I was always avail-
able and when I finally did leave it was for Agency business rather than
my own.. Thus I request that all or part of this time be approved as
creditable toward retirement. "

Po

T
pro-
C
1. A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825,
dated 4 February. 1954.
2. I was running an English-language newspaper in Santiago, Chile
when asked to work with our Station there. My first pay was $50.00 per
month. The file contains a project approval dated 31 May 1950; TCS-A-
1064 asks that the first payment be made to the U.S. bank on 1 August
1950.
3. During this period I recall a number of activities undertaken
for the Station, and I travelled to New York for clandestine training.
The file indicates "He was originally approved operationally to handle
the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct of this
case was considered excellent...." Also, "It will be recalled that
Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done."
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be-
hind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing
leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handled agents and did a number of
spotting and assessing jobs for the Station.
4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month
which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953. (Actually this
was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The
advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)"
5. After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in Chile
until 4 March 1954. During this period I recruited a CP agent who still
works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 Febru-
ary 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assignment.
The Station pointed out that I was working on the recruitment, and that I
and my family were planning on a European vacation. Headquarters again
requested my assignment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in
early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for
by advertising in my paper) and leaving my family behind to pack up. I
accepted this assignment without knowing where it was, or for how long it
would last. Indeed I did not even have a contract.

Request for Review of Retirement Status---Michael C. CHOADEN
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Action Required: See Paragraph 9 et all
1.
During his RVROCK career Michael C. CHOADEN has served
as Contract Agent, Covert Associate, Staff Agent and Contract
Employee. On one occasion CHOADEN resigned from RVROCK, became
a Contract Agent, then returned as a Staff Employee. The purpose
of this dispatch is to request a review of exactly what CHOADEN's
status has been over the years, what must be done to repay retire-
`ment funds for any periods of creditable service not now covered,
and to study the possibility that some periods of tenure might be
converted from uncreditable to creditable status.
2.
CHOADEN served in the Air Force from February 1943
through October 1945, with total service of two years, eight
months and 19 days...
-
3. The dates of CHOADEN's first RVROCK service in Santiago,
Chile, are very hazy to CHOADEN. He does recall that he was first
recruited by the COS, but cannot recall if this was on a formal,
salaried basis. At some time during 1950 or 1951, probably the
latter, CHOADEN signed an RVROCK contract, for at least two years,
possibly longer. The salary is remembered as US$500 per month,
and on one occasion this salary was paid in advance to allow
CHOADEN to purchase printing equipment. Please check the contract
covering this period and advise Rio (a) the duration of the con-
tract and (b) if any provision for deductions (or future payment
of) was made. If, as CHOADEN suspects, there were no deductions,
even for Social Security, CHOADEN would appreciate Headquarters
comment on the possibility that this period might be retroactively
converted to creditable service status (after payments into
retirement system, of course). In this connection it is suggested

that a discussion might be held with James G. COLLETT, who was Cos
in Santiago during most of that time. CHOADEN believes that
"
COLLETT will confirm that CROADEN demonstrated his intense interest
in his RVROCK work by performing not only the work called for in
his contract (mostly clandestine printing) but other chores as
well. Example: during this period, or perhaps just after the
expiration of CHOADEN's contract, CHOADEN, under Station guidance
and instruction, approached and recruited a Communist Party agent.
(It is understood that the agent is still reporting.) Another
example: in March 1954, COS COLLETT approached CHOADEN and asked
him if he would accept the Headquarters! request that he leave
Chile, board an airplane for the U.S. and assist in an unidentified
operation which would last "some months." That was the extent of
the offer. CHOADEN accepted.
CHOADEN accepted. This was despite the fact that he
had no contract, and that he had to leave his family behind and to

believed that this indicates that CHOADEN was pretty much "under
RVROCK control" during this period. (Perhaps training records
can assist in finding information on this Chilean period, as
CHOADEN went to New York on one occasion for a six-week training
course).

operation in which CHOADEN was asked to participate turned out to
be PBSUCCESS. Some sort of contract was drawn up, but CHOADEN
does not recall if any deduction for retirement was made, nor of
the terms of the contract. It is requested that this contract be
reviewed and, should there have been no retirement credit, that
it too be reviewed for possible conversion to creditable service.
There is no question of CHOADEN "responding to RVROCK control"
during this period. It was full time work, and most of it per-

during this period.
5. As the result of his participation in PBSUCCESS, CHOADEN
was contracted as a Covert Associate from (about%; this is a guess)
October, 1954 until April of 1955. CHOADEN distinctly recalls
that this contract called for retirement credit if chosen as a
future option. (It is not impossible that this contract was made
retroactive to cover CHOADEN's departure from Chile in March, 1954.)
It would be appreciated if Rio would be advised of the exact dura-
tion and terms of this contract.
6. CHOADEN was-a-Staff Employee from 1 April 1955 until
13 July of 1958, when he resigned. Retirement payments for this
period were returned to CHOADEN, and he understands that they must
be repaid sometime before retirement to make the period creditable.
7. After resigning in 1953 CHOADEN went to Cuba and within a
week signed a contract---as an independent operator and, to the
best of CHOADEN's recollection, without any retirement benefits.
Again, it is requested that this contract be reviewed with the
view of possible conversion to creditable status.
8. On March 14, 1960 CHOADEN again became a Staff Employee,
and has remained in that status.
9.
Despite a rather long tenure with RVROCK CHOADEN now finds
that mich of his service is either not creditable, or is creditable
and not paid. CHOADEN would like to set this house in order, and
to begin having regular deductions from his salary begin building'

Most of you who went down to the Dominican Republic
departed with so much speed and so little ceremony that
there was no time to explain the importance and urgency
of your assignments. Now that you have served there
during the crisis, the importance of the task needs no
embellishment from us, but you should know that the con-
tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping
the policies and actions of the government and in avoiding
several major mistakes. For weeks after the April revolu-
tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source
of information that the United States had on the role of
Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside
the capital.
Many fine things were done in the Station and in the
hinterland by all of you. Manning the check-points under
fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons
of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications
line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our
country's only commo link all these things were common-
place. The dedication, discipline, and routine of our
personnel placed them in a class apart.

already feel, I want to add the gratitude and admiration

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kermit Roosevelt
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
: Mr. John Baker
: Mr. Paul D. Langevin; Employment as CIA
Staff Officer
1. To those of us at Headquarters who have followed closely the
work of Mr. Langevin in connection with PBSUCCESS, it is completely
evident that he made one of the major and most outstanding contributions
to this Operation and that he has demonstrated himself to be exceptionally
qualified in the field of political and psychological operations (covert).
I have just been informad by Messrs. Barnes and Langevin that the latter
who has heretofore been employed in the capacity of a Contract Agent,
desires to become more closely associated with the Agency and would
like to be employed as a regular staff officer. I am very much in favor of
following up on this opportunity, and I have good reason to believe that
the Director likewise is specifically interested.
--
--
2. There are certain aspects of this case which appear to require
special handling and tailoring none of which presents any difficulties as
I see it but, on the contrary, would tie in very neatly with both the
near term and longer range aspects of the employment of Mr. Langevin.
These aspects are as follows:
(a) Mr. Langevin desires to begin his term of employment by
the Agency with a period of service at Headquarters. (He has spent
many years in Latin America, principally in Chile where he has
owned and still owns a newspaper, and, in my judgment, it would be mutually
advantageous to the Agency and to Mr. Langevin for him to spend
not less than a year as a member of the Headquarters organization.)
(b) Mr. Langevin has for some years in the past been giving an annual
series of lectures in various Latin American capitals. These lectures
have been arranged by an agent of his in New York and his audiences
have consisted of business and professional groups and women's organ-
izations. The general subject matter of his lectures has included talks
on the threat of international Communism to Latin America. Mr. Langevin
would desire, if it can be worked out, to be permitted to continue to
deliver lectures of this kind in the future and is at the present time
SECRET

--- Image 104-10194-10026_page_349.jpeg ---
14-00000
contemplating a series of lectures on Latin America to be given in various
cities within the United States.
(c) Mr. Langevin would be ready and able to accept a field assignment
in South America following the conclusion of the period of Headquarters'
duty referred to.
3. As already indicated, it seems to me that there are no sérious
problems involved in any of the foregoing and that the material can be
readily cut to fit the pattern. It is the recommendation of Mr. Barnes in
which I concur, that Mr. Langevin be assigned to the PP Staff during his
tour of duty here. He could in this capacity work very closely with WH
"Division, but it seems to Tracy and myself that he can contribute importantly
to the work of the PP Staff and in the process broaden himself. As regards
the matter of the lectures, I would recommend that arrangements be made
to permit and even encourage him to continue these since it seems to me
that they would fit in very well with his general PP assignment assuming, of
course, that his Headquarters, and field cover are properly designed and main-
tained. The Headquarters cover problem is not a substantial one and as far
as the field is concerned if Mr. Langevin were to go under non-official cover
of the right kind this also should present no problem. There is a ready-
made cover in the field and in a critically important country by virtue of
his ownership for some six years of a newspaper in Santiago. It
would not be incompatible with his resumption of his position as owner and
editor of the Santiago newspapaer to work in an annual series of lectures
either in Latin America or in the United States. There is only one further
point involved in connection with the lectures: Because of Mr. Langevin's
intimate association with many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in
light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to
submit at laast in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent
feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures. He is anxious to do this
in connection with the forthcoming lectures for his own piece of mind
since he would like to be double-checked on the things which he should say-
and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan development.
He could and in the material to Mr. Holcomb or myself -- or to you and
after it has been checked over by one of us, we could arrange to submit it
to the Office of Security for such further checking as may be desirable.
--
--
--
-->>
4. Mr. Langevin proposes to take a leave of absence of a month or
six weeks, starting within the next few days. I believe it would be
desirable for Mr. Baker, to start the necessary personnel and other admin-
istrative actions, including any additional security clearances which may

leave.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: David A. Phillips
!
18443
29 Juno 1961
On 14. June 1961 the undersigned reviewed with Mr. David
A. Phillips his career development prospects for the next five year
period. We agreed that the following represented a desirable and
fairly firm goal in this respect;
a. In general his future training and field experiance
should place sufficient stress on the CI and FI fields to avoid the
career confinement of strict CA specialization.
b. His next assignment would be a normal field tour in
Mexico City. Upon return from that assignment, he would receive
up to six months training to be followed hỷ an assignment to the CA
Staff (or the organizational successor thereof). One of his primary
undertakings in the CA Staff would be to develop what might best be
termed "ideological warfare" (e.g., a search for basic ideas and
concepts with wide appeal) as opposed to the normal propagamila
approach (e.g., a running debate on current evente).

Mr. David A. Phillips

Bethesda, Maryland 20034
Dear Dave:
The ordinary retirement letter is in no way
appropriate for you. In the first place, your
retirement is no stepping out of the active world
into a world of pleasure. Instead, you are launch-
ing off on even a tougher challenge because of your
sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not
be the termination of your interest in intelligence
and in this Agency. Instead, you are going to be
doing what you can to help it survive the current
set of attacks upon it. But most of all, your
retirement is the departure of one of our most
exceptional officers, to whom I had the great
pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal
and whose work I have admired these many years. The
only thing ordinary about your retirement is the
sincere and special personal and official good wishes
we in the Agency send to you and your family for
success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This
we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you
with special spirit.
Sincerely,
WEC:jlp (10 June 75)

ATTENTION
FROM
SUBJECT
: Deputy Director of Security (Investigations
and Support)
Droid Phillyes
1. Reference is made to the memorandum dated 18 June 1957
in which a covert security clearance was requested to permit the
Subject's conversion from an Ops Officer (FP), GS-14, DUP/NH, Branch
III, Havana, Cuba, to an Ops Officer (PP), GS-14, DOP/NEA, Egypt and
Arab States Branch, Project PECTATE, Beirut, Lebanon.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in the Director's
Memorandum of 14 February 1949 entitled, "Security and Operational
Clearances," a covert security clearance is granted for the use of the
Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph 1,
above. For administrative purposes only, this clearance is effective
as of 15 June 1957.
3. Subjects of covert security clearances are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.
4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for
clearance to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this
office.
5. Tais clearance becomes invalid in the event the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this memorandum.

the Director's Memorandum of 14 February 1949 entitled,
"Security and Operational learances, a covert security
clearance is granted for the covert use of the subject, as
described in your request as set forth in paracrach 71,

"
3. Subjects of covert security clearances are not
to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented,

security clearance does not constitute corrlete compliance

Therefore,
if you should desire at a later date to change the status
or use of this individual, a request for clearance to cover
any procosed change should be submitted to this office.
