It is neither feasible nor desirable to attempt an evaluation
of Mr. Fox's performance as an operations officer based on the
relatively short period (5 months) he has been assigned to the
Korean Desk. Throughout this time he has been faced by a series
of medical and personal problems which have understandably pre-
occupied him. His medical problem which causes him almost
constant pain, has led him to apply for disability retirement;
a decision on his application is pending.

undergo a series of family problems which required a great deal
of time and attention. Under the circumstances no specific
duties and letter grades are being listed in Section B above.

that diverted him from the work at hand.
Subject has spent almost seven consecutive years on Philippine
affairs, at Hqs and in the field. In Subject's case I believe this
has worked to his disadvantage. He is "burned out" on the
Philippines.
The rating officer has been fair and objective in his assessment
of Subject's performance for the period covered by this fitness
report. Subject's performance came to my attention daily

The penchant for detailed analysis that earlier made him an authority on

the Station canon of knowledge on narcotics matters. He has successfully
recruited the head of a private organization concerned with addict
rehabilitation and drug abuse prevention. Because of his proximity to

In keeping with our growing national concern for worldwide narcotics
production and traffic, the Station reallocated personnel, resources and
priorities in order to learn the nature of the Philippine role in this
illicit activity. Subject was assigned, halfway through this reporting
period, as Station referent with as his primary responsibility the
coordination of all of our efforts in the narcotics field. One other
officer has been assigned full time to assist him.

Subject is an intelligent, experienced officer with a wide
knowledge of the entire Philippine scene, its participants and their
pecking order. He is a quick and ready source of the details of the
history of recent years and he has extensive knowledge of where many
of the more important bodies are buried. He maintains a wide variety
of disparate contacts that enable him to maintain a detached
perspective.
It may be, however, that a degree of staleness is
affecting his performance and four years has been too long a tour.
A recurring problem, an attempt to do too much at one time, continues
to mar his performance; over time, this has been the subject of
discussions with him. Because of his inability to establish correct
priorities for himself, he often expends his extensive energies on
incidentals at the expense of the important

failing for under the pressure of inexorable deadlines, clarity and
detail suffer in his operational correspondence and, in general, he

Subject, at the same time, surveyed the host government intelligence
and enforcement agencies to learn how they had structured their
responsibilities in combating the narcotics trade. By seeking out current
and former liaison contacts, the picture that he received of the
estimated size of the problem and the Philippine control effort gave
us some idea of the parameters of what it was we
Through a formerly dormant liaison contact, one of the country's
experts on narcotics, he has developed both a window on what is being
done officially and a means of access capable of affecting the
Philippine policy on the subject. During a recent regional Asean
meeting on narcotics held in Manila, Subject was able to insure that
our objectives for the conference were met through this influential
asset
Subject has made a fine beginning in getting our narcotics
effort underway He has done the basic research, begun building the
necessary data base and has culled from other activities three or
four Station assets whose natural access is being utilized to
develop leads into the murky Philippine underworld. His flair for
organizing disparate data is being put to excellent use.
In the earlier period covered in this fitness report, Subject was
plagued by a nasty, debilitating fever that eluded diagnosis for
some time. A period of hospitalization followed by the necessary
recuperative period kept him out of action for a lengthy period..
Close on its heels, this was compounded by a freak bone break in
his hand that required surgery and once again kept him off the
active list.
'
Subject is a good agent handler; he is both FI and CI
FI and CI minded and
he has the ability to ask the right questions to extract the maximum
information from his sources. He has a great deal of energy and he
liberally expends it in his work. This strength, curiously, is also
a weakness since he has the tendency to ride off in all directions
at once. In this flurry of activity, by attempting to do everything
at the same time, his writing tends to become a shor
shorthand of sorts
and clarity inevitably suffers. He is aware of theso problems and
has consciously made the effort -- particulary since he has become
the narcotics referent to give proper order to his priorities.
As has been mentioned previously, his knowledge of the Communist
Party activities and personnel is impressive and until he relinquished
his role as the Communist Party referent, he was a helpful focal
point for other Station officers with party assets. In the months.
ahead his concentrated efforts against the narcotics target should
bear fruit.

The Fitness Report of prel 28 Jeriod continues generally to
apply during this rating period of seven months. Subject was on home
leave for about one month during this period.
Subject continued to handle until his home leave in May 1971 two
agent penetrations in the decision making level of the Moscow oriented
communist movement. They have since been turned over to another officer
for handling. Also, Subject continued to handle the Muslim agent
recruited during the previous period but the Agent's performance
has been marginal. In July 1971, Subject recruited a former Philippine
intelligence officer who was connected with the two agent penetrations
cited above. The primary purpose of this recruitment was to increase
the Station's control and equity over the two agents and, as a by-
During
product, to obtain intelligence on the communist movements.
July four developmental cases, all intelligence producers (including
documentary), were turned over to Subject for continued development
towards recruitment. One has unique access in the student movement
mainly in the Greater Manila area but also in the main provincial
cities; another is an experienced officer of a civilian law enforce
ment agency who collaborated unilaterally with the Station; the other
two are senior intelligence officers who have unofficially passed
intelligence information. Subject continued to handle his duty as

Capable of an even better performance than that reflected in this fitness
report, if he could only organize himself. He knows his subject,
communism in the Philippines, better perhaps than the majority of the
Filipino communists. This is a mixed blessing, however, because he is

NARRATIVE (Continued)
In my opinion, Subject's basic weakness, which was pointed out
in the previous Fitness Report, continues to be his inability to
budget his time to handle the priorities as established by COS/DCOS
as well as by himself. Subject spends considerable time on a given
matter of the moment and has great power of concentration on a single
problem. These are attributes many wish they possess, but at the same
time they impede the efficiency of an operations officer with numerous
high priority duties. Unless he can budget his time by discriminating
against the low priority or non-priority matters and focus on
maintaining a balanced portfolio of contact and staff responsibilitics
I believe his further
further development into the well-rounded senior officer
would be impaired. Subject has made a determined effort to correct
the above weakness including the submission of paper work by the
deadline. By the end of the rating period, there has been favorable
progress I am confident he can overcome completely this area of
weakness by exercising the same discipline he uses in executing duties,
#1 and #3.
Above all, Subject tries to excell and he works extremely hard.
I believe that Subject has the potential capability to progress to
more responsible positions in the operations and management fields:
he has sound operational judgment, he is cooperative and responsive,
he works well with and has the confidence of people he deals with,
and he has a good feel for the Station's total aims and capabilities.
Subject was given an overall Strong in view of his vigorous and
successful prosecution of the two important duties, his determined
effort to overcome the weakness cited above, and his potential capability
for continued growth in the management and operational fields.
Subject has responsibility for the Station's communist
penetration project. He has budgeted his funds realistically and has
spent it on operations which have brought good results.

Subject has handled his on-going cases very professionally.
Two agents, who operate as a team were acquired from a friendly
service earlier in the year and they represent our deepest
penetration in

Between them we are provided with key information as to the
Movement's policy, plans, and organization. During this period
Subject has formally recruitod a Muslim who was spotted and

however, the factors suggesting termination were overriding.

comments on the communist penetration operations of other officers
advising them on vulnerabilities and suggesting approaches for greater
exploitation of these assets. His briefings are well prepared and

Subject was the most aggressive and effective of the three "Referents'

He has directed them to collect difficult intelligence information
which has been of high value in planning and assessing future opera
tions. Headquarters grades to Subject's intelligence disseminations
from the two communist penetration agents above attest to Subject
competence in extracting and preparing intelligence disseminations.
While Subject has performed well as a Referent and agent handler,
he has not done as well in the priority area of acquiring fresh assets
in the unilateral and liaison penetration fields. This requirement
has been spelled out in his Letter of Instructions (LOI), discussed
by COS in the weekly operations staff meetings and daily Referent
meetings, and in separate consultations with COS and DCOS. It is not-
that Subject dislikes contacting new people or contacting Filipinos;
to the contrary, Subject has a warm, natural, and sincere approach
in meeting Filipinos. Initial contacts are made with potential assets
but there is a lack of planned and systematic follow through that all
developmental cases require. Subject keeps himself busy throughout.

operational reports are thoughtful and thorough His total work load
described above is no heavier than any other officer at this Station.

responsibilities, Since there appears to be no relaxation of the
latter and the trend is further personnel reduction, not increase of
personnel, operations officers will have to trim excess corners.

were no hitches, either in terms of personality conflicts or operational

Concur generally with ratings and narrative comments. Subject is a
dedicated, responsive and methodical officer whose previous duty station
was leadquarters Philippine Desk. In a relatively brief period of time
Subject has obtained a good knowledge of the MPWATCH situation and
operational information. Probably because of the presence of knowledgeable
senior ops officors at the Station, Subject has been somewhat reserved
in executing his assigned responsibility as MPWATCH functional officer.
I believe Subject could have been more vigorous in this primary area of
responsibility. This may change when these officers are rotated this
spring and summer. This matter has been discussed with Subject by
COS/DCOS and encouraged him to assume a more aggressive and substantive

not necessarily conducive to easier relationships with local
counterpart's Subject handles himself with professionalism, tact
and understanding, well designed to absorb increasing sensitivities
and still get the job done Operational and performance
consultations are held constantly daily on specifics and at
least weekly on detailed performance and operational objectives
These sessions are frank and Subject is as much contributor as
receiver, but he is distinctly receptive to realistic supervision
and guidance for operational continuity. Subject is markedly
security conscious, maintains his covor status as appropriate and
is perhaps overly cost conscious His work in analysis and research
in the complex MPWATCH field, bringing together and collating
viably positive intolligence (which otherwise bo lost) in draft
form is exemplary; his finished written work requires and is
getting continuing attention. In fairness to Subject on latter
point he does very well in this area when adequate time is
available to "finish" the product; on balance we profer him active
and mobile and can live with this marginal fault while evident
efforts to improve continue. Overall, Subject is a well-rounded
operations officer, a a credit to the Agency and capable of larger
responsibilities.

The comments noted in Mr. Fox's previous Fitness Report to the effect that a
little more experience with the Indonesian Desk (to which he was assigned in
mid-October 1903) should make him a strong member have been more than amply
justified during this period. With minimum supervlaton or direction, Mr. Fox
undertook the task of åbsorbing and systemitizing the complexities of Djakarta
Station operations against communists and other left-wing elements. The result
has been increased comprehension on the part of Headquarters regarding these
efforts.
Mr. Fox also contributed materially in the way of preliminary operational
research, support, recommendations and follow-through on two operational ploys
conducted by Headquarters: one, an attempted recruitment of a communist

Ing a given situation. A diligent worker, he retains a good sense of humor and
gets along well with his colleagues. He is inclined to become a bit impatient
with the bureaucratic procedures at Headquarters, but has the maturity to
subdue such feelings in the interests of expediency.
As for weak points, Mr. Fox has tended to be somewhat lax about answering
correspondence, particularly when he felt them to be of marginal value
This has been pointed out to him, however, and he is effectively overcoming
this defect.
During this period, Mr. Fox had no supervisory duties as such, although he
assisted on an ad hoc basis in the supervision of a career trainee temporarily

During the very brief interval Subject has been with the

noting. Assigned the Communist Party operations sector, he
applied himself to background reading, files research and
organizing his materials
nis materials with commendable energy He has
accepted a variety of spot assignments requiring timely res

or observation. He shows every evidence of absorption in his

COURSE OBJECTIVES CONTENT AND METHODS
The COS Seminar is aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and
Deputy Chiefad Station and Chiefs of Base for field assignments.
Emphasie was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or
medium-sized installations, since they must handle a peculiarly
wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to
remind outgoing chiefs of various operational approaches and
techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordination
management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of
the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large,
at home and abroad,
The bulk of the course is given in loctures and question periods
conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, pro-
grams, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested read-
ing are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to
the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance. No further assessment of
individual capacity or performance is made in this course.

April 1963. Mr. Fox has made this transition very well, and has adjusted himself to
the operating tempo and atmosphere of a busy desk. He now competent and

past month, he has served very capably as acting chief of the North Vietnam element

Mr. Fox was quick to recognize the difference between his present assignment
and those previous to it. This difference has required some changes on his part,
in terms of emphasis and flexibility. Mr. Fox has graciously accepted guidance
given him during this period, and has developed into an efficient DD/P officer.
Mr. Fox's assignment involves partial supervision of two junior officers.

considerable supervisory capability which future assignments can develop.
He
Following some additional time on the desk, during which time it is expected
that Mr. Fox will assume more responsibility for the North Vietnam program, it is
planned to send him to the field, as his performance on the desk would indicate that
he is fully capable of an operational field assignment.
*Mr. Fox's supervisory cuties have not been directly related to fiscal matters,
However, he has revealed a normal degree of cost consciousness in those budgetary
matters with which he has come in contact

Subject during his tour of duty at this station demonstrated a thorough
knowledge of the Factory Markings program and was sincere and competent in
performing his duties. The establishment of the joint center (Comet) was a
creditable achievement which should make an important-contribution to the program
in the years to come. He was cooperative and willing to undertake additional duties
when requested. He has done an outstanding job in the training of both ODYOKE and
and foreign personnel.
G
The reporting officer feels that Subject has a tendency to procrastinate and
that on a few occasions he did not follow through on his commitments as aggressively
as he might have. This, however, was the only weakness noticed in an otherwise
competent performance.

here. True, we have no person performing comparable duties in the station, but we have
few, if any, officers here who consistently perform at this level. In my dealings
with Subject, I have been struck by his high motivation and devotion to duty. On the

Mr. Fox is a steady, conscientious worker, and has consistently displayed initiative
and thoroughness in his research assignments. His main weakness is in organizing
and presenting the results of his work. This weakness is also apparent in his oral
presentation of argumentation. Mr. Fox frequently "talks around a point" instead of
"hitting the point" This weakness has influenced the rating given under Section D
"thinks clearly", and limits his effectiveness as a supervisor. It is hoped that
Mr. Fox will overcome this weakness in his forthcoming assig nt overseas:

Two officers of this Division have incurred their

The officera concerned, Messru. Jorono Fox and Harry G

the best of my knowledge, evidenced contempt for our security
procedures nor displayed such gross negligence as to requiro
strong remedial action. In noither caso woro any of tho viola-
tions such as to indicate a compromise 03 information was probable,
all wore oither open-safe or "exposed-classified-matorial"
violations such as one-tize typewriter ribbons, and nono involved
loss of documenta, indiscrcot talk or other moro sorious matters.
Further, the majority of the violations occurred on occasions
when the individuals concerned worked past the cormal close of
business and, while this is no excugo for carelessness, frequent
overtime work does increase the possibility of a violation dinco
It seems to
