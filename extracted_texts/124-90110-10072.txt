1. Reference is made to our memoranda CSCI-3/775,509, dated
29 March 1963, CSCI-3/775,572, dated 2 April 1963, and CSCI-3/775,622,
dated 4 April 1963, all with the subject as above.
2. Another office of this Agency has provided the following
additional information from Joseph MEROLA concerning Subject.
a. Subject arrived in Miami, Florida, on 4 April and resided
with Joseph MEROLA until 6 April 1963 when he was scheduled to return
to New York. Subject planned to return to Miami for the period of
12-19 April following which he would go to Vienna for a short visit,
returning to the United States about the end of April. Subject's
family will remain in the United States.
b. According to MEROLA, Subject met Assistant Attorney General
William Kenny in Miami, but MEROLA had no further details on their con-
versation except that PECAR appeared most eager to make arrangements to
stay in the United States. Subject showed MEROLA and Kenny voluminous`
documentation.
3. This office is considering contacting Subject during his
visit to Vienne for the purpose of attempting recruitment to return
to Yugoslavia. An early reply regarding information available to your
Bureau concerning PECAR's activities in the United States would be
appreciated.
