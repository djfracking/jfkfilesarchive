desires and the Ecuadorean Goverment will do its best to cooperate
with PBPRIME.
C. Identity use also teld that the Goverment of Ecuador has con-
menced negotiations with an electronics firm in Dallas, Texas, believed
by Identity to be the Continental Electronics Company, for the construction
of a 50,000 kilowatt radio station in Guayaquil. This station will be
used to combat antigovernment propaganda bersed into Ecuador from Cuba.
Nebot felt that FERIME could make use of this radio station. Identity
told Nebot that he believed this could be arranged.
D. It is the opinion of Identity that this is a golden opportunity
for PRPRIME to commence cooperation with a new government in a pro-PBPRIME
country. He stated that the Ecuadorean Goverment would be most willing
for HUBARK to utilize the above radio station; however, it would necessi❤
tate KUBARI's paying half of the expenses for its construction. Identity
was advised that the information he had given ODEVY would be furnishod
to KUBARK pursuant to his request. Ha desired to be contacted within a
period of ten days if KUBARK is interested in the information he had to
offer. Bo further action concerning this matter will be undertaken by
ODENVY.
2. ODENVY has previously reported at length on the Identity, a public
relations counsel. Identity registered as a purchasing agent for various
burasus of the Republic of Nicaragua on 15 April 1955; on 22 July 1958, he
registered as an agent of the Israeli Military Industries, which was controlled
by the goverment of Israel.
3. The Identity appears to be an international businessman with special
interest in Latin American Countries. He has previously frequently contacted
FBPRIME &gencies on subjects he thought appropriate to bring to their atten-
tion. A cursory check of his 201 file revealed no derogatory information.
Further information can be supplied if the field so requests.
