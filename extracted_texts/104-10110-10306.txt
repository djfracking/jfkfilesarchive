PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:
I knew Phil during the entire time he was in
Branch I at Headquarters, and during his tour in
Mexico. We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.
This means I knew him from 1965 until he resigned.
In Headquarters our relationship was limited to
business in the office, and that was not very
frequent. We sat in different rooms. He handled SB
matters. 1 did the routing of all Branch
correspondence which meant I decided what he was to
see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/
Chinese matters. My main areas of responsibility.
were in the support field. Even though we were both
processing out at the same time, we did not exchange
stories much. However, since I traveled as a
"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring
anything into Mexico, Phil offered to have some of
my things packed with his household effects since
he said he owned hardly anything. One day my husband
and I took some boxes of things over to his apartment
before work. I do not remember the name of the
apartment development in Virginia, but it was the
garden type. His apartment was nice--fairly new
but sparsely furnished. He helped us unload the things
and take them upstairs. Then we parted. I seem to recal
he had some trouble with his car that morning and we
dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the
office.
At this time, in Washington, Phil was very
pleasant, was nice to work with. He did not appear
to be pushy, even though he did everything he could
to get the Mexican assignment. At this time, despite
his family problems, he did not appear to let these
affect his work. At least from my position he seemed
to get his work done, not to procrastinate, not to
take a lot of time off. From the gossip I heard,
he was separated, and was anxious to get any assignme.it
overseas. When the possibility of this Olympic job
opened up in Mexico he grabbed it. As 1 recall, C/WH/1
was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be
able to help Phil at this particular time.

In Mexico when Phil's houseirold effects arrived
he let me know%; and as I recall, ne brought them over
to my house and we unloaded them into our apartment.
We did not go and pick them up. In thanks, we
invited him over to supper one evening. (Willard C.
CURTIS had given permission for individual officers
to have Phil over to dinner if no outsiders were
present and prior permission was obtained.) I think
I got permission from the DCOS at that time. There
were only the three of us (Phil, my husband, and
myself--no maid, no other invited guests) There was
no discussion of office. My husband knew Phil was with
BKT RUST and was working on the Olympics in Mexico.
Conversation was light. During dinner, as I recall,
we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned
his father was in the dry cleaning business, and
he thought he might be interested in bringing into
Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which is worth
nothing in the United States, and set up some dry
cleaning establishments in Mexico. The discussion
was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to
timetable or even if Phil were serious about this.
About a week later Phil brought his car over and
my husband helped him work on his car--adjusting it
to the altitude. This must have been around September
1967.
Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was
in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/1 and also knew Phil
at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me, and UTSTINE
over to his apartment (on Insurgentes Sur just off the
Viaducto) for dinner. It was a huge apartment, sparsely
furnished. We had an enjoyable evening, very light
conversation. Talked mostly about Mexico. At this time
he showed us he had several bedrooms (forget how many)
and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him.
During his tour in Mexico I only saw Phil in the
Station occasionally--and then just in passing in the
halls. Once after I heard about Phil's having kidnaped
his boys, I thought I saw them (can't remember why I
thought they were his) in front of the Embassy with a
maid. I never saw Phil in the Embassy proper nor at
any Embassy functions (I was tourist and did not
circulate in the Embassy).

Ex-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not.
I am quite certain their work paths never crossed.
LIADLIB is still in Mexico. He has had a difficult
time since his "resignation" getting a job,
keeping a job, and making ends meet. It probably
would be to BKTRUST's disadvantage now for
the two to meet. For this reason, and to assess
ex-LIADLIB-s present state of mind, Headquarters
sent someone to talk with LIADLIB-1 in the spring
of 1972. At that time he still seemed bitter
against BKTRUST.
Other than wishing to make special mention of
EX-LIADLIB-1, I know of no Agency personnel
other than those in WH/1 and the Mexico City Statio
whom he knew.
5. OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL
I know of none except the Olympic Attache in Mexico
under whom Agee worked from July 1967 until the
end of the Olympics.

We just greeted each other. he said he heard PROBERT
was coming to Mexico and asked if he were here. He
wanted to call and say hello. I said yes. 1
immediately informed PROBERT, and suggested the
latter, read Phil's file at the Station as it was
my understanding there was some problem about his
resignation, but did not know all the details.
(This was true as personnel matters in the Station
were kept very close by the front office.) I do
not know if, when, or how many times PROBERT might
have met with Phil. At this time Phil looked neat
and well kept, as I recall.

OPERATIONS IN WHICH SCALETTI PARTICIPATED
a). Phil could definitely identify me as a long-
time BKT RUST employee
b).
Phil probably knew that Mexico was my first overseas
assignment, and possibly that I had a medical
hold before. He knew I had spent "many years"
in Branch 1, and was privy to almost everything
going on at the Mexico City Station.
He
knew I was assigned to Mexico under tourist
cover but worked inside the Embassy.

He knew
my husband was here as a professor at the Universit
of the Americas, and that he did not work for BKTRUS
c). In Headquarters Phil knew

support projects plus such extras as LILINK and

just as Phil came to the Branch, or just before.
However, Gary REYMANDER, formerly with LILINK

Phil about Mexico, and possibly about LI (LINK) "1

In Mexico City Phil knew I was in the Cuban section,
and privy to all operations being run against the
Cuban target. He did not know of operations in
particular except possibly LIARM-1 (now terminated)
who we hoped to use against the Cuban olympic
target. The Cuban Section tried to talk with Phil
many times about the Cuban delegations to the
Olympics, but as I recall, C/Cuba only succeeded in

a couple of times. I was not in on the
discussions between C/Cuba (Raymond F. FRADYER)
and Phil, but I believe they were mainly held
to see who Phil had met who might be useful

the time Phil was spending almost full time on his
overt activities and the SB target, and he gave
the Cuban target little attention./
