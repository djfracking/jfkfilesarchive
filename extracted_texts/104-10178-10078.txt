*AMICE-31 invited to be delegate at ninth CLASC Consejo planned for
May 13-17 in Santo Domingo. A-31 could be useful as reporter
and/or action agent since he is opposed to CLASC alliance with
Marxist groups and in opposition to Emilio Maspero.
**Based on recollection of A-31's previous performance at Bogota
CLASC meeting, in which AMICE-31 seemed inclined to Maspero,
Caracas sees little point in WOFIRM subsidizing A-31's trip this
time, but defers action to Hqs and Santo Domingo.

To process the Operational Approval, full information (ecepleted PRQ
