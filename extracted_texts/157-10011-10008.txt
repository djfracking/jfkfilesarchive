OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
PresidentumCould be well informed of any steps taken in this context such as the
instance involving CTA payment to. Col Tung last week.

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply
proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire
situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the
Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-
tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired
about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt
against him." Lansdale replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities
by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of
July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-
ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed." Looking into proposal to_subsidize/
Japanese purchases of Dominican sugars so that the Japanese could divert these purchases
from Cuba McCone_said that his experts-had-informed him that from a legal point of view,
CIA could use unvouchered funds to support an operation of this kind. He cautioned,

In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam on October 29, 1963 with MCCONE, HELMS, AND COLBY
in attendance. The following record by HELMS and COLBY shows that: it was suggested
that in the Ambassador's absence, HARKINS, TRUEHART, and DAVID SMITH act as a
committee to direct a coup operation. MCCONE countered with the view that MTR should
not be involved in such a policy-making function, although he would be in a position-to-
provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHART as well as carry out their instructions
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy evidence. The DCI stated his view
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might
only be solved by a second or third coup.

OCCURRENCE:
Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE's
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to
the U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper.
He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by the introduction
of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals etc. unless they could.

that U.S. would not condone the planned actions. Plans included: Cuban exile approach

Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the
rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations, in…
“Latin America, generated by CIA and a psychological campaign assisted by USIA." The major
task of the diplomatic capability was to encourage Latin American leaders to develop
independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the
Cuban people against the Communist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on
Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake
the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which
Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane
fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted. →

(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187 included-establishing intelligence-agents
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and negotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. The British want to

"CIA has initiated action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results
(stopage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing
lubzola corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil through commercial
suppliers in Beligium. A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.
Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least
create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve
CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which-will-permit provocative
actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate
to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks
are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum
notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through
the appropriate organizations and departments of the government. In this regard the memo
