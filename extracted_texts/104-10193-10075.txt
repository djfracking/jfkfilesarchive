1. Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-15

Your memorandum dated 8 October 1958
1. The SR Division and the Chief of Station, Tokys (FJTT-1950,
attached) recommend the promotion of
to GS-15.
2. Mr.
was last promoted 16 January 1955. On 17
February 1955 he arrived in Tokyo to serve as the senior SR officer
in the FE field area, his present assignment. In this position he
has continued to display qualities of leadership, initiative,
imagination and thoroughness which resulted in his rapid rise in
- the Agency.

3. The very facts of Mr. no
his responsibilities and the fact that promotion to his present
level has been rapid, caused the Division and the Chief Station,
Tokyo to hold until this time a recommendation for his promotion
which was submitted in June 1957. Most careful consideration has
convinced us that not only is Mr. serving of the
recommended promotion, but his elevation to the higher gradə will
be in the best interest of the Career Service and meet definite
Division requirements for a senior officer at the GS-15 level.

in terms of reports, operational data, and joint enterprise; while, overall,
he has established enduring professional relationships from which the
organization as a whole should benefit for some time to come. In addition,
owing in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise,

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.
Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in
terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes. Additionally, he brings a
great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assignment.
During the period covered by this report he has displayed great industry and
devotion to duty in a variety of circumstances and achieved notable results
in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his
unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat, too businesslike in
many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless. This, however.
is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the necessities of his
operational work although it often shows in office relationships.

intelligent, has a thorough background in operations in his area and the ability
to grow in his job. His operational planning and execution is usually impeccable.

visors. He is particularly effective in dealing in the liaison field where his
good sense and disinterest in "fighting the problem" produces a maximum of
cooperation and good will. If he has any minor fault as a supervisor, it is not
in impatience with his subordinates, as reflected in previous evaluations, but
in an occasional unwillingness to say no to them.
