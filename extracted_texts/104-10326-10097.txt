FURTHER TO REF, AS ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING FIRMED UP
FOR VISIT OF JYVAPOROUS/1 (V/1)-TO-HOS_CIRCA 22 JULY, WE WOULD
LIKE TO OFFER THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS REGARDING TOPICS
OF DISCUSSION TO BE RAISED BY EITHER C/PNINFINITE OR CHIEF/CE
DURING THEIR UPCOMING MEETINGS WITH V/1:
<--LEE HARVEY OSWALD>FILES. DURING PREVIOUS MEETINGS WITH
V/1. HE HAD OFFERED TO PROVIDE SUMMARIES OF JYVAPOROUS FILES ON
*<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>AND ALSO ALLOW "EXPERTS" TO EXAMINE DOCUMENTS.
WITHIN THESE FILES IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THEIR AUTHENTICITY. WHILE
WE REALIZE THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE FILES HAS BEEN TURNED
OVER TO NVTAG FOR ACTION, WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR
THIS TOPIC TO BE RAISED AT THIS JUNCTURE, GIVEN THE LACK OF
ACTIVITY WE HAVE SEEN ON THIS SCORE-.-
SCORE-
-
PRESENCE OF IRAQI AND POSSIBLY IRANIAN MILITARY OFFICERS
IN BELARUS. DURING A 16 OCTOBER 1992 MEETING WITH DC/CETF/W, V/1
PROPOSED OPERATIONAL COOPERATION TARGETING THE CIRCA 100 FOREIGN
MILITARY OFFICERS PRESENT IN BELARUS. OF THIS PRESENCE, V/1
MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY IRAQI AND ETHIOPIAN OFFICERS AND LEFT SOME
QUESTIONS REGARDING A POSSIBLE IRANIAN PRESENCE. V/1 INVITED
PNINFINITE TO CONSIDER RECRUITMENT OPERATIONS, OFFERING
JYVAPOROUS FILES AND OTHER SUPPORT RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE A
POTENTIAL JYVAPOROUS/PNINFINITE-JOINT-OPERATION-TARGETING IRAQI-
OR IRANIAN MILITARY OFFICERS IN BELARUS POSES SOME EXCITING
POSSIBILITIES_FOR_THIS_Ä»IAISON RELATIONSHIP.
