The Chairman. I think the way it has been modified that
is not a problem. This says "by statute the CIA should be
prohibited from subsidizing writings," or production.
Senator Tower. That is what I mean, you are not precluded
from showing it, but it should not be done under CIA auspices
or government auspices.
The Chairman.
And it should not be written for the

may be some small element:

sponsored an individual coming under 44, which receives

immunize him during that period from being recruited by the

Senator Schweiker. Well, if he is here for military
purposes, then we know it is a military relationship, I would
think that is suspect.

Would you want him subject to recruitment?

that particular purpose and the funds are voted for that

of you can, but I'm not going to.
I will write a vigorous dissent on that.
Senator Morgan. May I make a comment on that?
I'm inclined to agree, and I'm also inclined to agree
that we are going so far in our foreign intelligence that

we are endangering the whole report, so you make that kind of

three other things. I'm not picking at any of them. I am

money and then he, when he gets over there and wants to complete

of the idea that academics be off limits, period, and students
in order to protect the integrity of our entire academic
community, and it is the realization that if we continued to
close the possibilities for recruitment, and the adverse
effect that that would have, maybe, on our ability to gather
intelligence, that some of us backed off of this, what would
be the optimum, we think, position to take. So this already
represents somewhat of a retreat from the principle that some
would like to see established, and in this case I think we
are again faced with the question of whether or not we want
a government-sponsored program to enjoy a high level of integrity
so that the people who are participating in it and the American
taxpayer who is supporting it can have some confidence that it
is doing what it was set out to do and what the publicly
announced purposes of it are.

that prohibition on Fulbright grantees to all of those under
the Fulbright-Hayes legislation. Under the specifics of the
Agency's interpretation, it makes a distinction between those
students, or graduate students, or professors selected by the
Board of Foreign Scholarships, and the rest and the rest
includes cultural leader grants and the like.
Now, perhaps it might be the sensible thing in the
language like this to confine it to the Fulbright-Hayes Act,
which is the basic legislation which deals with this.
Senator Schweiker. How many others would you have outside
of that? Would you have a lot of other programs?
Mr. Bader. Other programs?
Senator Schweiker.
the Fulbright-Hayes Act?
What percent of the total picture is
Mr. Bader. I really wouldn't know, Senator. I think it
is the major part of it, actually. You could have a National
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in which a person would
go overseas, and this, under the language we now have before
you, that would include those individuals.
The Chairman. Well, I can see how vulnerable a grantee
might be when approached, and if we have already written
into law a prohibition that relates to the Fulbright scholars,

I should think it ought to apply to any others that are

And thus he is in a very vulnerable position when he is

Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, I might say in partial response
to Senator Tower's remarks that the Agency's basic instruction
for the operational use of individuals, 50-10, specifically.
prohibits the operational use of Fulbright grantees. They have
already made that decision in 1967, and reconfirmed in 1973.
I assume part of that came from agitation at the time in '67
and Senator Fulbright's own determination that that program not
be used for operational purposes.
It was the original intent of this language to extend

It is really a one way street.

like to watch Russian ballet dancers, especially females, but
the fact of the matter is cultural change does more to soften

That is an argument as to the merits of

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, do we have anything from

the Agency on this?
Senator Huddleston.

I think you've got to weigh, to some
18
extent, the value of the two programs, of our cultural exchange
19
programs' importance. I think the public knowledge of any one

23
individual becomes known as a spy who is associated with a
program, it has a devastating effect, in my judgment, on the
program and on all students who are participating in it. I
just think the risk is too great.
Senator Tower.
24
25
Well, my question at that point would be
to what extent does our cultural exchange program impact on

Operational use does not, by the Agency's definition,

think would be of value to the Agency, the kind of information

Senator Tower. Well, I think in many instances American
operations abroad that have been completely innocent have been
labeled as spy operations for propaganda purposes by the other
side, and they will do that if they choose to. They will not
do it if they choose not to do it.

not inside Russia or in a Communist country. We have educational

Well, I oppose it either by statute or

concept determine whether they want to do it by either statute
or regulation.
I am opposed to doing it by either.
Senator Schweiker. I would like to see it by statute if
we are going to do it.
Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, does this make any distinction
on the media located physically

The Chairman. No, it does not. It simply attempts to
prevent the CIA from involving itself with personnel who are
part of the U.S. media, whether here or abroad, as I read it.
Senator Tower. Okay, now, let me ask you a question..
What is there is a Reuters reporter in Moscow who is
cooperating with us, and Reuters contributes regularly to U.S.
media?
Senator Schweiker. We spent an hour on that. They are
19 excluded. We argued that for an hour and I lost the point, so
20
21
they would be excluded.
Senator Huddleston. This basically just extends to
22
CIA's own prohibition that they had initiated against what we
23
would normally think of as working journalists, and includes
24
into it the executives and editors and those who may be
25
freelancing.

CIA prohibition" and you see the words "proposed" and
"statutory" are in brackets, reflecting uncertainty on our part
as to whether it was the intention of the Committee that this
prohibition simply be a CIA regulation or embodied in the
statute, which is recommended in the recommendation of procedures.
The Chairman. Senator Huddleston, do you have any comment
on this?
Senator Huddleston. I have a personal feeling that when
we go too far statutorily in dealing with the press, that we.
sometimes get on thin ice. I don't know whether it would be
appropriate to make some suggestion here that the press itself
initiate certain standards and methods. Many of them in the
press believe they ought to have anyhow.
I think the recommendation for the CIA is probably.

Mr. Aaron. Under the Agency's current regulations and
own prohibitions, a foreign journalist working for Time Magazine
oversees would be prohibited from being used by them for
operational purposes. That is their own position today. This
would extend that prohibition to someone who is, what in the
trade jargon is a stringer, or

Mr. Bader. The present restriction, Senator Tower,

already assumed by the Agency is that this moves further
accreditation to include those who regularly contribute to
U.S. media organizations or are a part of their structure.

to extend that to stringers as well, then I think it ought.

the Committee that the CIA do it, because the CIA regulations
may or may not issue, and they can be changed at any time
without notice.
Senator Tower. Well, Mr. Chairman, aren't we talking about
two different things?
I don't mean foreign, you know, our foreign correspondents
abroad writing CIA propaganda for American publications. We
are talking about operations here, operational use, not use
to write some article that the CIA wants planted in an American
publication. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking
about using him to gather intelligence, and it goes back
directly to the CIA which doesn't serve as a publication.
The Chairman. But operational use can include many things
including writing propaganda and usually would if it involved
journalists.
Senator Tower. Well, I think we have already got a
prohibition on that.
Mr. Bader. The prohibition that the Central Intelligence
Agency has self-imposed extends across the line from cover
to placement to all operational use of individuals, accredited
individuals to American media organizations. As I say, the
difference between what the Agency has already taken upon
21
22
itself and what this recommendation involves is this recommen-
23
dation extends it to individuals who are not accredited.

that there are
some 60 Americans who are affiliated or are part of American
media organizations around the world, part of a larger network
of some 400 journalists and the like who are part of the Agency's
overall media asset program, and of those 60 under the Agency's
present prohibitions, the ones recently imposed, it would go
to just one third of those individuals.
This prohibition would extend it from the one third to
i
all because the other two thirds include people that are
under cover, who are in management, and who are not under
the technical term accredited to U.S. media organizations.
Mr. Chairman, I might say if the Committee would look
at the Recommendation 46 that goes before 47, perhaps it might
bear in mind that the recommendation in 46, which takes the
present Agency prohibitions and says that they should be
established in law, if in 47, if the Committee should so
decide to do it by recommendation, that they change their
internal prohibitions, there will be a contrast between 46

Well, let's have a vote. Let's go back

Senator Huddleston.
Mr. Chairman, I think I am probably
the only one that has suggested that it should not be statutory
and I would just point out that that might be a result of the
fact that I am in the media, so I would withdraw that unless
somebody else wants to make that recommendation.

media.

would recommend that Congress enact a statute conforming to

the question of any changes or waivers of Agency directives

yesterday.
The agreement was
and if that proposal is
one of the general recommendations goes through any waiver
of an existing regulation or any amendment of an existing
regulation, that affected the significant policies or programs
of the Agency, would have to go immediately to NSC and to the
oversight committee so that they would know.
So what I am saying is that if you had a directive and
there was a change in something like this which would be
significant, there would have to be notice to the oversight
committee and to the NSC

PROCEEDINGS
The Chairman. We will soon have a quorum. Why don't
we begin with the Recommendation No. 43 on page 77, having
to do with academics.
My understanding is that this recommendation has been
redrafted along the lines of the Committee's recommendations, and
as it now stands it calls for the CIA academics and the
'
institution to be informed, and for any student being recruited
to be so informed..
if
There is a choice in the latter case in informing him
before he is paid or informing him before he leaves the U.S.
Will you explain that to me, please?
Mr. Aaron. In the course of our discussion about the
11
12
13
14
recruitment of students off campuses, there
were two cate-
15
gories of concern. One was for the integrity of the institu-
16
tions themselves, and the second was, in turn, for the
17
students that might be involved.
18
19
To take the second one first, the Committee received
testimony that some foreign students recruited as agents for

the CIA were brought into kind of a holding status at a certain
point in which they were working for, if you will, CIA
proprietaries or CIA front organizations where they might
conduct some operational activity, provide some information,
under the impression that they were not working for the CIA
but for a company or, I think as one put it, I think, a group

All right.
Without objection, then, that will be the
decision of the Committee.
What else do you have?
Mr. Aaron. We have two other recommendations.

Senator Mathias. I would, I think Senator Goldwater had
a very strong proxy that I read into the record on this subject
at the last meeting.
Mr. Kirbow. Against restricting any use of academics.
Senator Mathias. I don't have a proxy with him today, but
I feel his position ought to be noted.
The Chairman. Very well, then, with those particular
reservations made part of the record, the Committee will
approve the amended Recommendation No. 43.
We move then to Recommendation 45 on page 78.
Mr. Aaron. We attempted to redraft this along the lines
as we were instructed, I believe.
As it came out, it would prohibit the subsidy of any

Mr. Aaron.
Actually, one could use both of these. I think
the point is that the danger to the student, if there is any,
comes when he leaves the United States, either to return to
his own country or perhaps someplace else, but the commitment
or involvement which ought to be witting really needs to come
when he starts being paid, when he becomes in fact, or has
You could really establish
both standards, because it might well be that he could leave
13
the country but not have yet been paid, and not really have
14
15
a relationship that was anything more than kind of an asso-
ciation or an option, something of that character.
16
17
18
The Chairman. Well, what is the will of the Committee
as to these two options?
Senator Huddleston. Well, this represents a distillation
of what we have been proposing as Senator Mondale develops
19
for us, I believe, and I would move that we adopt this report,
20
and use both of these, an either/or.
21
The Chairman.
Whichever comes first, huh, either before
22
he is given payment of any kind or leaves the United States,
23
whichever may occur first.
24
Would that be satisfactory to the Committee?

writing, publication, distribution within the United States
or its territories, of any book, magazine, article and so forth.
It has been pointed out that this formulation would prevent
the writing of a book, even in a foreign language, within the
United States, to be published abroad and distributed abroad,
or any such materials from being published within the United
States, even if they were distributed abroad.
Now, that may be too restrictive and go beyond what the
Committee intended, and so therefore we wanted to raise this
here, to get a better understanding of what we were attempting
to accomplish.
11
As I understand it, what we were
it was not clear, but
12
13
14
it is possible that what the Committee had in mind was that
any writing, publication for distribution in the United States
would have been the appropriate formulation for this, and if
15
16
17
18
that is correct, we can make a very easy fix.
Senator Morgan. Why wouldn't it?
The Chairman. Why wouldn't it accomplish it if we say
that by statute the CIA should be prohibited from subsidizing
19
the writing or production or distribution within the United

States or its territories of any book, magazine, article,

Wouldn't that take care of it?
Mr. Aaron. If that is what the Committee intends, that

Concern was expressed by the Committee in considering
this testimony that this might be rather severe for the student
once he discovered the fact he had been working for the CIA,
or should his government find that out, so that it was an
element of coercion to hire somebody under, if you will, false
pretenses.
That second proviso, then, in effect says that we may
9 pitch and recruit a student as an agent, but you must, when you
do that, when you really bring him into an operational relation-
ship with the Agency, he should be so informed and not brought
into this sort of

by the CIA be informed of his relationship with the CIA

Senator Huddleston. Well, I was going to say there are
many, many initial contacts that do not advance maybe much
23
further than that, and for the CIA to have to be exposed maybe
24
on each of those might not be reasonable.
What we have tried
25
to do is to make the wittingness be known about the time that
