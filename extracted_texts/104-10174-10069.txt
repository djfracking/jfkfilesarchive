In the following jeher id nist of the largest business

ar
ntrol them. Whenever
le I have noted the indizado
for each company, bearing in wind that Spanish business-
men are not always totally candid in their financial state-
ments. But aside from the seepracy or inaccuracy of these
reports, one soon realizes that certain individuals and/or
families control two or more of these contarles and perhaps
others of lesser mugitude. And in my conversations with
several Madrileños (Echegaray, sin, Alonso-Castrillo, Cer-
Gémati, Carrigues, at al) some of these same nases kept popping
up time and again, thus leading me to conclude
tentatively that the following individuals or families are
the leading industrialists and financiers of Spains

MEMORANDUM FOR: DO/CO/C
ATTENTION:
SUBJECT:
REFERENCS:
SECRET
Gale W. Allen
14 October 1968
Howard T. FAZZARE
Your Memorandum dated. 26 September 1968
In the reference you stated that DO will send FAZZARE
a sterile check for his expenses incurred in his efforts to
bersuade TICHBORN B wife to agree to an assignment in Spain.
You also forwarded a bill which FAZZARE sent for additional
air freight expenses from Madrid for which he has not been
reimbursed
2 EUR does not wish to reimburse FAZZARE for this
claim. When he resigned from the Agency he submitted his
final accounting and signed a Quit-Claim for all expenses.
In his note to you, a copy of which you forwarded with rof-
erence, he asked that you forward his bill "to the Spanish
Section for reimbursement if not too late
We would
T
appreciate it if you could send FAZZARE a note when you for-
ward his sterile check and state that we are sorry but this
final accounting has been completed, that the books have
been cleared, and that it is indeed too late to authorize
additional funds.

WUBRINY/11 did not have ready a list of expenses incurred
by TICHBORN in 1968 for checking by the undersigned and
certification by TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/11
telephoned to say that his accountant was unable to
locate some of TICHBORN's accountings. The undersigned
then requested WUBRINY/11 to join him and TICHBORN.
undersigned had a partial list of TICHBORN's expenses
The undersigned
previously submitted by WUBRINY/11.
enjoined TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to prepare a complete
list of expenses for 1968. TICHBORN was asked to record
the purpose of each expense. The undersigned emphasized
in WUBRINY/11's presence that TICHBORN should ensure that
no expenses chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm were
charged to WUSALINE. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were
reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were
chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm as well as one-half
of the expenses on the Mexican Border project. TICHBORN
said that he would get all of the accountings from WUBRINY/11's
comptroller to determine which, if any, accountings were
missing and, as requested, to note the purpose of the
expenses. It was agreed to meet the following morning
of September 13, 1968 on this matter.

4. On the morning of September 13, 1968, TICHBORN
telephoned the undersigned to say that he was able from
his records to supply the missing data. He also sald
that notations on the records obtained from the comptroller
showed that he had, in fact, submitted the accountings that
were missing. TICHBORN concluded from this that WUBRINY/1's
private firm had lost the missing accountings. TICHBORN
also said that a few of the charges on the partial list
of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review
The

undersigned then requested TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to meer
with him at noon so that the undersigned could review the
accountings and obtain certifications from TICHBORN and
WUBRINY/11. Both agreed to the meeting. Subsequently,
TICHBORN telephoned to say that he and WUBRINY/11 were
all set to come to the undersigned's hotel when the
unwitting comptroller took all the financial statements
to review them again. TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were in
no position to retain the statements and thus could not
meet as scheduled. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 agreed
that the accountings were now in order.

again informed TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 by phone that each

Termination Settlement
with Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to
New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G
TICH5ORN (P). A hotel room at the Shoreham Hotel, 33 West
55th Street, was obtained for a meeting place.
There were
two principal aspects to the settlement:
secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amend-
ment to his contract providing for a one-time lump
sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the
S. Government from any further claim and,
b. insure that TICHBORN had, as. of 31 August 1968,
administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE,
particularly that his accountings for expenses in-
curred in 1968 were submitted, recorded by WUSALINE,
and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN
and WUBRINY/11.

The first part of the settlement went smoothly.
TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amend-
ment to his basic contract. He brought along for the Covert
Tax Unit a copy of his 1966 income tax return which the
undersigned had stipulated as a requirement for settlement.
He was given his one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311
In two checks ($2833.62 and $477.38) drawn on a DO pro-
prietary company (WUTACTIC) which wil issue TICHBORN
a Form 1099 for income tax filing. He readily endorsed
and gave to the undersigned the check for $477.38 in
settlement of the amount he owed WH Division from his
tour in Mexico City
3. Through no fault of TICHBURN, the administrative
Severance from WUSALINE did not go as smoothly. In spite
of several requests by b TICHBORN and the undersigned,

5. Certain other administrative matters were
taken in with TICHBORN and WUBRINY 11 during the after-
noon of 12 September 1963. The undersigned secured
agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 that TICHBORN's
services on WUBRINY/1's Venezuela project were as great
as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore,
WUSALINE should receive for TICHBORN's services on this
project compensation at least equal to that given any
officer in WUBRINY/1's private firm.
obtained from TICHBORN the two credit cards (American
The undersigned
Express and Pan American air travel card) issued to
him under WUSALINE sponsorship. The undersigned asked
TICHBORN if he had charged any expenses under these cards
since 31 August 1968. TICHBORN said that he had enter-
tained a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth
of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunct to
his cover. For this reason, TICHBORN opined that the
Agency should pay for the expense. The undersigned said
that TICHBORN was not authorized to incur any further
expenses after 31 August 1968. TICHBORN then readily
agreed to pay the expense.
6. There is a possibility that WH Division may
want TICHBORN to take an operational TDY in Chile..
TICHBORN was alerted to this possibility. He expressed
interest in the assignment, but pointed out that he now
has to get a job and that, consequently, his availability
will depend upon his job situation.
7. TICHBORN was extremely friendly and cooperative
and the settlement was amicably effected.

On Monday afternoon, the undersigned was requested
by Mr. Gale Allen, DO/CO, to provide a mechanism for funding

lea
had arranged for the funds to be paid by sterile check, Howev
Mr. Randall, DO/BF, suggested that he consult DO/C for
funding mechanism in order to insure proper tax rapo
ICHBORN..
2. Mr. Allen explained to the undersigned that TICHSORY
had been employed, until his termination, by one of the Project
WUBRINY entities. Apparently, there is an unwitting Comptroller
in the WUBRINY entity and there was no reasonable story tha
could be offered to explain the $3,311.00 termination boaus,
Therefore, it is necessary to use another entit
“entity that, can pro
vide a Form 1099 for tax purposes.
3. Since NUGANP has sufficient funds in its bank
account to manage a $3,311.00 disbursement, it was decided
Allen was advised to stop the
to utilize this company. Mr. Allen was advised
sterile check process and to have the $3,311.00 voucher
approved and forwarded to DO/C for payment instructions.
At that time, the undersigned will prepare a Request for Advance
of Funds (WUTACTIC) in the amount of $689.00 and Paym
Instructions for $4,000.00 ($3,311.00 plus $689.00):
procedure is being followed in order that WUGAMP can show
slight profit as well as to prevent the exact same amoun
money being received and disbursed.

: Meetings with MT re Spain
on 18 July 60
FAZZARE
I had several long conversations with MT regarding various
aspects of potential assignment in Spain:
a) long confab over two drinks after our joint
session Wednesday afternoon,
shorter talk on plane ride to New
New York
c) extended conversation on Thursday evening
when we had dinner with our respective
spouses - 6:30 PM to 2:00 AM.
Our many hours together (with and without our wives) produced
two principal conclusions:
1. Reinforced my wife's objections to moving
to Spain, also convincing me that it would
be prejudicial for my children.
2
Convinced me that even if there were no fami
objections to moving, it would be unwise to
establish permanent residence in Spain because
of the security risks involved therein. Both
L
MT and I feel that several in-and-out
trips
would accomplish our purposes without running
the risk of appearing luplausible in that
traditionally-suspicious country.

foreign banks. He himself was frequently told to his
face that he was a bank employee, and he told us that
at our two meetings last Tuesday and Wednesday. Hd
says that government officials and the kind of
higher-up business tycoon's we're shooting for (he
saw our list) are almost pathological in their sus

MT: "You're going to have to live like a rich

no rich man would move to Spain with his
family unless he had already established

the best and least-expensive chance for penetration.

-
1. At the request of Chief, DO/COG, the WOFIRM medical
staff arranged for TICHBORN to be examined by a specialist
in back disorders to check the nature of TICHBORN's back
problem.
TICHBORN had earlier injured his back when a
bench on which he was sitting in the laundry room of
his apartment collapsed. Since his Injury, TICHBORN
has, of course, been under the care of a doctor in
New York. back brace and physical therapy exercises
have led to considerable improvement. However, in view
of plans for TICHBORN's PCS assignment to Spain, a check
by an independent specialist was deemed advisable.
2. TICHBORN's appointment was with Dr.
appointment was with Dr. Henry L. Feffer,
2520. L St. N.W., Washington, D.C. at 1115 hours on 19 June
1968. TICHBORN used the alias of Enrique Cortez with
New York post-office address supplied by the Office of
Security, to wit:
P. O. Box 432
Church Street Station.
New York, N. Y. 10008

He paid the bill of $38.50 upon leaving.
asked the name of TICHBORN's doctor and where the report
should be sent TICHBORN gave a fictitious name and address
of a doctor in New York and said that Dr. Feffer knew where
to send the report. (The report will be sent to Dr. Borscher
ding of the WOFIRM Medical Staff who will call C/DO/COG.)
At a luncheon meeting at Fort Myer after the
examination, TICHBORN informed Chief, DO/COG and the
undersigned that Dr. Feffer had been more positive than
TICHBORN's doctor in New York that TICHBORN does not have
a ruptured disc. Dr. Feffer recommended physical thera

exercises varying somewhat from those prescribed by
TIGHBORN's New York docter. TICHBORN said that his
back pains him toward the end of the day. Dr. Feffer
opined that this condition should be cleared up within
three months.
4. TICHEORN appeared to be in excellent spirits
at the luncheon. He was very enthusiastic about movie
deals as a substantial part of his cover arrangements.
He obviously is at home in this field and bellevés it
will give excellent access to operation targets in Spain.
TICHBORN has contacts in the U. S. movie industry, one
of whom is a friend interested in making a movie in Spain.
TICHBORN plans to meet this friend and other contacts in
Los Angeles the first week of July.
5. At the request of EUR/IB/Spain, the undersigned
asked TICHBORN to be available in Washington, D. C. during
the period 8-10 July 1968 to meet the contract agent whom
TICHBORN will be replacing in Spain. TICHBORN agreed to
'do so and also to stay loose later in July for conversa-
tion with the Deputy Chief of Station, Madrid.
6.
The undersigned informed TICHBORN that from the
cover point of view, it would be desirable for TICHBORN,
enroute to Spain, to view the operation of WUBRINY/E. in
Greece. While there, we would like TICHBORN to assess
a Greek whom WUERINY/1 considers to have good operational
potential.
TICHBORN said that he has not received a reply.
from the IRS to his request for a copy of his 1966 income
tax return (requested by C/DO/Pers). TICHBORN said that
he is, therefore, writing another letter.

Project WUBRI-NY
Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
1. Forwarded herewith is the revised proposal from
WUBRINY/1 to Edward G. TICHBORN (P) covering the latter's
assment to Spain. It differs from the original in that
the journalistic feature is dropped in favor of strictly
commercial endeavors. Added is the possibility of develop-
ing a movie deal for submission to investors.
2. TICHBORN had two meetings with QUSALT/1, both of
which went well from the cover point of view. The first
meeting involved TICHBORN and QUSALT/1, while TICHBORN
brought his wife for the second in which QUSALT/1 was
wined and dined. TICHBORN said that QUSALT/1 is all
in favor of TICHBORN's proposed assignment. However,
in view of past WUSALINE/Iberia inactivity, QUSALT/1
has an attitude of "I will believe it when I see it.".
QUSALT/1 was particularly intrigued with the possibility
of a movie deal and said that Spain is by far the cheapest
place to make movies.
3. The one disquieting feature of the meetings with
QUSALT/1 concerned TICHBORN's wife. She took the occasion
to query QUSALT/1 on all aspects of living in Spain. All
went well until the subject of health came up. QUSALT/1
commented that everyone should expect to get hepatitis
and said that he had a severe case. This comment shook
TICHBORN's wife whose best friend in Mexico caught hepatitis
and whose children subsequently got it.
4. The undersigned specifically asked TICHBORN LE
his wife's concern with hepatitis posed the possibility
of a refusal to accompany him. TICHBORN said that he
thought not, but that he was going to drop the matter
for a week. The undersigned stressed to TICHBORN that
the Agency views his assignment as very important as

Should TICHBORN not be able to go to Spain, it would be

3. The undersigned-noted that TIGHBORN, by virtue
of his association with WUSALINE and WUSALIFY and his
1967 trip to Spain, is in an excellent cover position
for this assignment. He has also had the opportunity
to meet the Agency representative in Madrie with whom
he will be dealing. The undersigned g TICHBORN a
copy of WUBRINY/1's letter outlining IC BORN's cover
assignment (unamended copy attached) The undersigned
noted that the senior officer of the firm participating
with WUSALINE in WUSALINE/Iberia in late 1966 had sug
gested that a developer of new business be obtained.
This overture was followed by TICHBORN's exploratory
trip in June 1967. Subsequently, a WUSALIFY company.
for which TICHBORN is a Légal consultant, followed
up on TICHORN's trip by sending a geologist to assess
several abandoned silver properties. In this way, the
stage should be well set for TICHBORN as outlined in
the cover letter prepared by WUBRINY/1.
At 1800 hours, WUBRINY/1 and WUBRINY/11 joined
the meeting to discuss cover arrangements The under-
signed emphasized that the arrangement would not only
have to be plausible, but, in due course.
in due course, there would
have to be commercial results. TICHBORN was also em-
phatic on this point He suggested that the cover
letter also include the possibility of putting together
a movie deal. TICHBORN said that he is thoroughly at
home in the movie field and finds it a good access to
targets of operational interest. WUBRINY/1 seized eagerly
upon TICHBORN'g suggestion, stating that he had always.

1. The undersigned met with TICHBORN at 1630 hours
on 19 May 1968 at the undersigned's room in the Shorcham
Hotel, 33 West 5th Street, New York City. TICHBORN was
still suffering from an injured disc and either stood or
lay down on the bed during the course of the meeting. He
sald that he had been fitted for a back harness which he
would get the following day. If his back did not improve
with the harness, going into traction would be necessary
TICHBORN said that his back injury occurred when a bench.
on which he was sitting in the laundry room of his apart-
ment collapsed. He said that he is meeting with a represen-
tative of the insurance company with which his apartment
owner is insured to seek compensation. He had previously.
asked for and was mailed a list of benefits under his Ac
hospitalization policy. TICHBORN can sit down, but
sitting, it is very painful for him to get up.
2. Per agreement with Chief, EUR/I/Sporn, the under-
signed offered TICHBORN a fee of $25,000 out of which
TICHBORN will have to pay his own housing and educational
expenses. Inasmuch as the norm housing allowance for
Spain is $3,680.00 a year and the educational allowance.
for two children $1,120.00 or higher, the offer to TICHBORN
amounts to a $20,000 base salary. TICHBORN was informed
that additional benefits outside his basic ree would include:
.
a. Round-trip transportation less than first-class
for him and his family to Spain and return to New York,
Cost of shipping and storage of household
effects
74
Temporary lodging allowance of $9 per day.
per adult and children over 11 up to 90 days with
an additional $5 per day per child if the lodging
has no kitchen facilities (TICHBORN has two children,
a boy age 13 and a girl age 11).

this prospection owing to budgetary limitations and a lack of
spare time.
Also, the other ICAP offices abroad have been
too busy with their own affails to think too much, about get-
ting business for each other.
As you may know, part of the original idea was
that George Train would carry out this representative fuiction
with the America business community, but in the evat, he
developed a close relation with a Spanish bank, uddevoted
most of his available time to their concerns.
I has become restive as a result, and in fact
vesterday I received a letter from then which ranes the
issue: of winding up the arrangement.
feel you
The first activity, therefore, which
could most advantageously carry out on our behal: in Spain
would be that of seeking ew business for ICAP Imaria. After
an initial familiarization with the work of the office, I
would suggest that you might call on the U.S. fims operating
in Madrid and offer the services of ICA? Iberia.
You can get
a list of such firms through the Department of Commerce.
There is also an American Club in Madrid (of which George
Train was a founder) whose members would certainly be appro
priate for such prospection.
After you have prospected the American business
community, you could go on to the European firms operating in
Spain, in the same way.
I doubt if ICAP Iberia has the time or such exten-
sive prospection, so your work here would be valuable to them,
I would think.
Another related area in which your service; could be
of help would be in helping in client relationships with U.S.
clients that have begun working with ICAP Iberia or B. NIF or
are on the point of doing so
To the extent that your existing Latin American or
U.S. clients would need your services in Spain, you would
naturally want to have prime resconsibility for their affairs

would want to cetexine which of their seeds
could best be served by ICP Iceria using BANIF S.A. and

would amerid the cover letter to include this possibility.
Both the undersigned and WUBRINY/1 stressed the importance
of TICHBORN's obtaining U. S. clients to represent in
Spain. Some further training for TICHBORN was recommended
by WUBRINY/1, including visits to certain WUSALINE affili-
ates. The undersigned concurred, stating that a visit
to WUSALINE's affiliate in Greece would be particularly
useful because TICHBORN might also do an assessment there
on a Greek associated with WUSALINE's affiliate.
5. WUBRINY/1 said that QUSALT/1 is coming to the
U. S. the third or fourth week in May 1968. It was
agreed that WUBRINY/1 and TICHBORN would gear up
get QUSALT/1's endorsement of TICHBORN developing
business for WUSALINE/Iberia.
6. Both TICHBORN and the undersigned informed
WUBRINY/1 that employment terms have been agreed upon
and opined that these terms might be more liberal than
WUBRINY/I would privately extend. The undersigned sald
that the Agency would embody TICHBORN's employment terms
in a contract from which commercial terms could be drawn..
The undersigned added that all of the funding of TICHBORN
would not necessarily have to be accomplished through
WUERINY/1.
7. TICHBORN owes the Agency $199.99 on an old loan.
TICHBORN promised faithfully to send the undersigned a
check in this amount prior to 31 May 1968.
8. The Covert Tax Unit desires a certified copy of
TICHBORN's income tax filing for 1966. TICHBORN said
that he had been unable to locate one and had asked
the IRS for a copy.
9.
TICHBORN's wife is concerned about schools in
Spain. The undersigned gave ICHBORN information on
schools in Spain as obtained from EUR/I/Spain and from
friend who spent three years in Spain.
10. TICHBORN said that he would like to go alone to
Spain in August
to be able to make arrangements
in advance for his family.

Judging from his performance there it appears that be would be a
valuable addition to the Station effort against the unilaterial
target, if he were to be assigned to Spain. His utility here, or on
a brief TDY assignment from here is, we feel, far less and can only":
be taken advantage of by a realistic selection of any tasks we may
ask him to perform. Thero is little doubt that he can meet Spaniards
of interest, the problem lies in how to follow up at long range, 08
how to transfer a relationship established by TICHBORN to somǝona
else who could take operational advantage of it. Otherwise, we will
end up with a long list of cases and little elso. On this basic
point, a summation of the specific items dealt with above, we would
volcɔme an exchange of views with the Station.

Becessary investment in time, money and effort. Included in the
latter would be Chief/LONACE approval. Such approval always requires
Bulid operational justification and such justification would bo
especially necessary in this case, due to the probable publication'
outlet involved, Lifo International. Te are inclined to think that
such a trip would not be worth it, uniess, and this is a possibility
discussed below in paragraph 2, TICHORN vere to be assigned PCS to
Spain for a period of a year or more.
C. Also discussed with TICORN during his recent visit was the
subject of his contacts with Spaniards in his home city and of his
use in assessing and developing visiting Spanish contacts of the
Station who might be ɛtecred to bin. In the former category, vo
determined that TICTEDORN Liss not yet been active in making now
contacts but would to willing to do so, on a celected basis. The
question bore is, when would so wish hip to meet and develop?
(YICTEORN's immediate reaction was to suggest he meet the Spanish
aabassador to Washington.) Unless the Station has some specific
candidates in mind, we believe the most profit to be bad from this
exercise initially, would be to give TICHOR the task of assembling
a spotting report on Spaniards in his home city engaged in commercial
activities to when, presumably, TICHOZI would be able to logically
develop, acceBS wo feel that to give him a broad assignment of
reporting on any and all Spaniards he roots cald to self-dofcating.
On the latter category of targota, those selected Spaniards visiting
TICMORN'a city who might be steered to hin by the Station, we feel
that cover considerations will have to be carefully handled in order
to protect TICHIOMA'G BOW solid cover. TICHERN currently in covered
as a business consultant and attorney under Identity A. He is
specifically identified with Identity B and, when required, an on
his trip to Spain, with UUSALINE. Wo would to parfectly willing to
consider using TICORN in this way provided the targets vere care-
fully selected and could be steered to TIBOR without endangering
his cover.
d. In answer to paragrapà 2d of the Reference, we are forwarding
under separage cover copies of the reports which TIGHBOR submitted
to Headquarters after hin return. We can find no indication this
these were sent to you at the time, although that was our intention
In any event, they appear to constitute additional detail to verbal
reports provided to the Station by TICESORN while he was therə last
year.
3. As the Station notes, the question of a PCS assignment to
adrid for TICHBORN was helved last year due to a variety of reasons
both personal and professional. Recent discussions with 5OPLAY,
Lowever, indicate that such an assignment should not be ruled out.
It is possible that TICənd would bo available for PCS assignment
be
to Spain in 1959, assuming that suitable cover arrangments can be
worked out. In this regard, his assigment to Padrid a FUSALIAB
an
gan in WUSALINE Iboria might be a logical extension of his past
present activities. In view of the Station's comments in paragraph
Sc of Reference, we would appreciate your thoughts on this and on
se
any other cover possibilities which come to mind. Granted that such
an assignment is presently no more than a long range poss
possibilit
is nevertheless an attractive one, worth an exchange af lows!

3. Developments cited in paragraphs 3a and 3d of the Reference
are volcome as both appear to constitute potential access or value.

To sum up, Headquarters is also impressed with TICHFORN's
potential as indicated by his all-to-brief visit to Spain last year.

connection, it is of interest that following TICHBORN's trip to
Spain, WUBRINY/1 sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look
into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com-
mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN'

TICHBORN thinks he can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U.§.

TICHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning
leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for pabliching in a pro-
minent publication, such as "Life International." TICHBORN
believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because
he previously published in "Life International" a four-page spread
on Mrth control in Latin America. This article was favorably
reviewed. TICHBORN suggested a related article on the popula-
don explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible
topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen

suggested change reads "Barring extraordinary circumstances, these

c Operational/Edward G. TICHBORN Trip to Madrid
ACTION REGUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference:
1.
OSHA 22,778
MICROFILM
Madrid has awaited a report of TICHBORN's trip to Spain
and some response to the various proposals made in Reference Dispatch.
SHERIDAN carried back the message that TICHBORN would not be assigned
PCS to Madrid as suggested he might be in DIR 32794. We have a high:
opinion of TICHBORN's talents, so this was a disappointment.
Regarding the proposals we made about how TICHEORN might
continue to be useful in his target "Study on Dynamics of Spain As an
Economic Entity" (see DIR 13385), there are several that we would like
Headquarters to review:
mechanism?
b.
Can WUSALINE Iberis be used as an information collection
gsges
Has further thought been given to TICHBORN's writing.
an article (possibly for "Life International") on leading Spanish
industrialists and bankers?
where be how
C. Can TICHBORN develop Spaniards in his home city for
Madrid Station? Can the Station ask selected Spanish contacts, who
will be travelling to TICHBORN's city, to look up TICHBORN as a means
of assessing and developing them?
yes
d. Is TICHBORN preparing a report or contemplating any.
follow-up action to Reference trip?
3. Reference provides sufficient details to make all these
questions clear. If Headquarters can give us a status report on the
above questions and where we now stand with TICHBORN and WUSALINE,
we can in turn make suggestions on how we believe TICEBORN's talents
can be used in the future. As mentioned above, we have a high opinion
of his ability and we hope we can benefit from it. In the meantime,

Agreement with WUBRINY/1 to Defray.
a Portion of Edward G. TICHBORN's (P)
$17,000 Annual Contract Fee:
1. Chief, DOCO, DC/DOCO, Mr. Ed Welch, and the
undersigned met on 3 January 1968 with WUBRINY/1" and
WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/1 had previously agreed in prin-
ciple to buying a portion of TICHBORN's time
He was
asked at the 3 January meeting to make a specific
poposal on this matter. It was pointed out to
WUBRINY/1 that the Agency does not have at this
time any operational requirements for TICHBORN
and that, ideally, TICHBORN's $17,000 annual contract
fee would be offset completely by commercial fee
income..
9
i
2. WUBRINY/1 said that he is forming a develop-
ment company in Venezuela for a land development project
in which TICHBORN could be very useful the next six
months. He proposed that the development company
retain TICHBORN for six months at $5,000. If the
project is continued, TICHBORN will be retained for
à higher figure for the next six months plus a bonus
if the project is successful. The company will, of
course, also defray TICHBORN's expenses incurred on
the land development project. For the Agency and
Project WUBRINY, the agreement with WUBRINY/1 means
that WUSALINE will expend $3,500 to retain TICHBORN
for the next six months.

3. The Venezuelan Desk was advised that
TICHBORN will be going to Venezuela on 10 January
1968 and will be spending considerable time there
during the next six months. The Venezuelan Desk
was very receptive to exploiting TICHBORN operationally
and prepared a detailed cable for COS/Caracas. However
this proposed cable was modified by WH Division upper

Dear Friend,
Merry Christmas!
I regret that it has taken this long to settle the
matter of your letter of September 22, 1968, but better
late than never, I guess.
I guess. Although your efforts in our
behalf with Hank were not successful, we do appreciate
the fact that you and your wife went out of your way to
try to help us.
I referred the matter of your late moving bill to
the appropriate individual. Unfortunately, this bilt
was received too late, as all your accounts had been
settled. He has asked me to extend his regrets on
this matter.
26.5.
Please accept my best wishes for a Joyous Christmas
and the hope that 1959 will indeed be a good year for
you and yours.
Enclosure: $267.00 Check
Sincerely,
Gale

premiums to:
Mr. William Rodgers

Woodridge Station
Washington, D.C. 20018
3. It was noted that on his last check, TICHBORN had of course
