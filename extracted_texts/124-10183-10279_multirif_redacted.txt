Office of the Attorney General
Washington, D.C.
December 5, 1947.
MEMORANDUM FOR MR. HOOVER:
DIRECTOR, FEDURAL. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
This will refer to your memorandum of November 22 with
reference to the Marquis Childs column appearing in The Washington
Post on November 18, 1947 and to your letters of November 21, the
one addressed to Mr. Childs and the other addressed to Mr. Paul A.
A Walker, Acting Chairman, Federal Communications Commission.
that of
It is my view that the Bureau's practice of passing along
to the various Government departments and agencies information
which comes to its attention in connection with the conduct of
investigations normally and regularly within the Bureau's juris-
diction is entirely appropriate and correct. Indeed, it would
appear that the Bureau would be remiss in its duty if it falled
to pass along information coming to it which might prove to be
in the interest of the general welfare. It is not the Bureau's
responsibility to determine whether the information is or is not
of importance to the particular agency in the carrying out of its
current activities and responsibilities and whether or not any
action is taken by the department or agency is not, of course, a
principal concern of the Bureau.
I believe, therefore, that the Bureau should continue its
practice of passing along information which it is believed might
be of interest to the various departments and agencies. At the
same time I believe that it would be appropriate either (a) to
prepare a circular to the various departments and agencies explain-
ing the Bureau's purpose in furnishing information from time to
time, or (b) to make a particular effort for a time when trans-
mitting individual items of information to explain in the trans-
mittal memorandum the Bureau's purpose in. making such transmittal.

Mr. Paul A. Walker
Acting Chairman ·
Federal Communications Commission
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Walker:
Under date of November 18, 1947, there appeared in the column of
Mr. Marquis Childs in the Washington Post the following statement attributed
to Mr. Clifford J. Durr of the Federal Communications Commission: "Already
the FBI is furnishing to the commission unsolicited reports on individuals
connected with radio, and I can assure you that if you should be told the
kind of things contained in many of these reports you would dismiss the infor-
mation as baseless gossip.'
-
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has referred to the Federal
Communications Commission from time to time information which it has received
in the course of its regular investigations which appeared pertinent or material
to matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. It is the policy and
practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid any attempts to eval-
uate the significance of information relating to matters without its juris-
*diction or the effect of such information upon the contemporary policies and
programs of other agencies. As a result, the Bureau furnishes to the various
Government departments such information as it receives which appears pertinent
to the operations of those Government departments. In so far as is practicable,
the Bureau attempts to evaluate the reliability of the source of this infor-
mation. without attempting to make any suggestions as to the use which should.
or should not be made of the information itself.
Mr. Childs, in his column quoting Mr. Durr's statement, adds the
following observation upon Mr. Durr's statement: "Note the word 'unsolicited'.
It indicates that the FBI initiated investigations and sought to influence
FCC decisions by sending reports on certain individuals to the commission.
If this is happening, it is something Congress should know about."
I desire to advise you that this Bureau has not at any time attempted
in any manner or degree to influence FCC decisions. The material which has
been transmitted to the Commission was sent solely for the purpose of affording.
the Commission information which came to the Bureau from various sources; which
information, it was believed, might be of interest to the official activities.
of the Commission.

(PURSUANT TO S. RES. 21, 94TH CONGRESS)
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 2/6/01 BY SALMKP
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding the work of the
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. I am sorry to learn that
you are unable to endorse the Committee's investigation and the efforts
which have been undertaken to strengthen the Nation's intelligence agen-
cies through closer definitions of their legal authority and areas of
legitimate operation.
One of the possible abuses under investigation is the violation of the
First and Fourth Amendment rights of Americans under the Constitution
and Bill of Rights. The American system of govenment is unique in that
it not only permits, but encourages, its citizens to voice their views
on important issues. One of the rights we are trying to protect is your
right to express your thoughts to me, either over the telephone or through
the mails, without having your message intercepted or recorded by inauthor-
ized persons. Highly sophisticated equipment now makes it possible to tum
our surveillance techniques, which were originally designed to intercept
foreign transmissions, inward against ourselves. It is important that pro-
vision be made for the lawful use of this capability, and that protection
be assured our own, citizens who could become the unwitting victims of this
unconstitutional but nevertheless powerful surveillance technology.
I want to take this opportunity to assure you that the Committee's purpose
is not, as some have suggested, to destroy, degrade, or even disrupt the
legitimate functions of the intelligence gathering and law enforcement agen-
cies of the United States. On the contrary, its purpose is to fortify these
valid and vital areas of operation. However, we do intend to identify abuses
or patterns of abuses which are clearly unlawful and take action to prevent
their recurrence, whether they involve individuals or nations. We as indi-
viduals must live within the law; so must our Government and its agencies.

I appreciate your taking the time to write to me, and trust that the
ultimate outcome of this investigation will strengthen the faith of our

Reference is made to SSC letter dated February 5,
1976, as modified during a meeting on February 12, 1976,
between John T. Elliff, SSC Staff Member, and Steven K.
Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination, Department of Justice.
In accordance with the agreement between Messrs.
Elliff and Blackhurst, the SSC request of February 5, 1976,
has been limited only to documents pertaining to Attorney
General authorization for electronic surveillance directed
toward organizations engaged in preparations for the fall
of 1969 "March on Washington."
A review of Bureau files indicated three organiza-
tions were targeted for such coverage. These organizations
were the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam
(NMC), the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam (SMC), and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC).
Attached are unexcised copies of the Attorney
General authorizations, with the exception of the authoriza-
tion dated November 7, 1969, for these electronic
surveillances. Page two of the November 7, 1969, communication
contains a deletion pertaining to the identity of targets of
electronic surveillance not concerned with this
subject matter. This deletion was approved during the
meeting February 12, 1976, mentioned above.

FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM

INTERNAL SECURITY MISCELLANEOUS
The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam (NMC) is coordinating efforts for a massive antiwar
manifestation to take place in Washington, D. C.,
November 12-16, 1969. This group maintains a Washington, D. C.,
office at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, where the planning
takes place.
This demonstration could possibly attract the
largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in
Washington, D. C. The large number is cause for major
concern should violence of any type break out. It is
necessary for this Bureau to keep abreast of events as
they occur, and we feel that in this instance advance
knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation
would be most advantageous to our coverage and to the
safety of individuals and property. Accordingly, we are
requesting authorization to install a telephone surveillance
on the Washington office of the NMC.
Interception will be made without trespass and
maximum security will be guaranteed. Because of extensive
contacts of the organization involved, it cannot be¨.
anticipated whether individuals who are or may be placed
under an active investigation for possible criminal
violations will be overheard by this coverage.

MISCELLANEOUS
The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam (NMC) is sponsoring a massive antiwar manifestation
to take place in Washington, D. C., on November 12-16, 1969.
The Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam
(SMC) and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC) are closely
coordinating their efforts with NMC in organizing the
demonstration. NMC, SMC and VMC occupy adjoining office
space at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C.
SMC is completely dominated and controlled by the
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and its youth affiliate,
the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The VMC has recently
endorsed fully the activities of NMC concerning the upcoming
antiwar demonstration.
This demonstration could possibly attract the
largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in
Washington, D. C., which is cause for major concern should
violence of any type break out. It is necessary for this
Bureau to keep abreast of events as they occur, and we feel
advance knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation
during the demonstration would be most advantageous to our
coverage and to the safety of individuals and property.
We have separately requested authorization to install
a telephone surveillance on the office of NMC. To further
implement our coverage, we are requesting authorization to
install telephone surveillances on the offices of SMC and VMC.
This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

GASSINUTA 25,
TO THE ASAL CEPARTMENTS ANAD
INDI FERDENT APESCIES OF THE EARCUTIVE BAARCHS.
In mozorandum of October 7, 1347, I called attentica to the fact
that the reasral surau of inventization has primary investigative juris«
Eatch hot. It is alsa
distic or Section 4 (ú)-1, Titlo lo, 100) of the
pointed out that under the provisions of a presidential interpretation dates
30 October 1947 the Federal Bureau of Investiration hec the responsibility
of investiratine all charges of disloyalty on the part of Federal employees
within the soutive branch of the Government.
The Federal uureau of Investigation has sufficient investirative
personnel under its direct supervision to carry out t is responsibility in
the continental imited states, Aineka, Hawaii, ut hico, and the Vir-in
Islanda. Dowever, it aces not have personnel stationed in other areas or
the world. Therefore, it has Dows necessary, in order that the furenu may
be enabled. to carry out its responsibility, to arrure by a recent with
the berartconta nad A-enoies priteirally concerned for the deletion of
the cotual iavosti, tive wrk to certain other wepartments of the recutive
Branch in those areas where it has no lavestigative personnel.
It is recognised that there are two major classes of loyalty
investi-ation. The first is the routine loyalty check of aplicants for
classified cositions or of incumbents of such positions initiated in accord
with Baeoutive Order vub. The scoond type is that in which doubt of loyalty

Hon. Frank Church
U.S. Senate
Washington, D.C.
Dear Sen. Church:
By way of background, I served honorably with both the Federal Bureau of Inve
igation and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 33
years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities
were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I am a graduate of George
Washington University Law School and a member of the bar. I am now retired.
As an interested and intellectually curious citizen, I have been reading
accounts in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which
you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Rep. Otis Pike happens to
chair, both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence programs.Brief-
ly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both of you
demand highly sensitive and classified data which seems to be publicized soon
after you get it. It is my opinion and that of many friends that your committees
are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos-
sible their effective performance in the future.
Before going further, let me state that I do not condone irregularities, im-
proprieties or illegalities by either agency in their normal, routine activities.
but I do see the justification, in serious security or Mafia like criminal acti-
vities, for certain "extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I
think that the Congress should quietly recognize such, with reasonable controls.
You should be proud and complimentary, for instance in my opinion, about the
highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you
stop to realize that it was confined to mail to and from Russia and, insofar as
I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards.
I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these
agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to
having appropriate administrative action taken against offending employees and
officials, if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the
pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries
on sensitive matters are regularly reported, sometimes incompletely and for
apparent political reasons. It just seems to me that someone connected with your
committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels
them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence
programs and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.
I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some
mistakes.But have you ever seen the British, the French, the Russians, the
Germans, the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring
circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?
I am sure also that we are the laughing stock of all the above enumerated
nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential data to
U.S. intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soon
see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? I very
sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criminal action should be taken
in any cases where either or both of your committees and/or their personnel have
been the vehicle for embarrassing or damaging the U.S. by actions which resulted
in confidential data being reported.
In order that there be no misunderstanding, this letter represents nothing
more than my very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and disgust with
the way in which you and your committees have done a great disservice to the
United States by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies and
to our nation.
Sincerely,
cc: Rep. Otis G. Pike

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
OF "KISSINGER-17"
NOTE:
The
The above agreement referred to in referenced
Department letter states that material in FBI files
relating to the "Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made
available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These
personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which
notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during
the time the SSC study was in progress. When the study
was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the
information considered appropriate for Committee use.
summary would be checked to ensure the protection of
national security matters, protection of confidential
sources of information and observation of privacy consider-
ations, Thereafter, the approved summary would be
furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed.
Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material
relating to the "Kissinger-17" and left his notes in
possession of Bureau personnel. On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick
requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the
above notes and prepare his summary which he did on
2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed
into two categories: (a) Political or personal information
obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to
individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the
targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for
each target comprising the "Kissinger-17." Review of
this summary indicates that no confidential sources of
this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no
jeopardy to national security matters. Regarding the
latter, however, it is felt that the White House would be
in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter.
It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coverage
of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in
litigation.

of the so-called "Kissinger-17," and Department letter
to the SSC dated July 15, 1975, captioned "Access/Delivery

on an expedite basis.
Attached is the original of the above summary
prepared by Mr. Dick in his handwriting. In accordance

she had impersonated an officer of the U. S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service. There is no record that
Riha was discussed during this contact. A letter from
the Denver Office of the FBI dated February 12, 1970,
reported that on January 28, 1970, she was interviewed
by Special Agents of the FBI at Boulder City Jail, Boulder,
Colorado, at which time she offered the opinion that Riba
had decided to leave Boulder dục to marital difficultics
and personal clashes with other members of the faculty at
the University of Colorado. She listed a number of
telephonic and personal contacts she had had with him
subsequent to March, 1069.
The communication reporting the May 14, 1969,
contact does not list the names of the Special Agents who
contacted hor, however, the communication was prepared by
Special Agent Merrill R. Smith. At that time Special Agent
Smith and Special Agent J. Hale McMenamin were the only
Agents assigned at Boulder, Colorado. As the SSC was
previously advised on November 21, 1975, the January 22,
1970, communication from Denver FBI to FBIHQ could not be
located and therefore it cannot be determined who at FBIIQ
received it or if the information was passed to CIA.
The letter from the Denver Office to FBI on
February 12, 1970, was initialed by a case supervisor in
the General Investigative Division and a case supervisor
in the Intelligence Division. Other than the information
following in response to question number 5, there is no
indication that the information was passed to CIA.
5. Question: Was this or other information passed
on by the FBI to the CIA or to other agencies and the
Denver and Boulder police? What was the information
conveyed? When was this done?

Answer: The report of the interview of
Tannenbaum on January 28, 1970, was included in a
memorandum which was furnished to FBIHQ by communication
from Denver dated February 12, 1970, captioned
"Galya Tannenbaum, aka, Impersonation." The memorandum
was disseminated at FBIHQ to CIA, Secret Service, State
Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and
Defense Intelligence Agency. The memorandum was
furnished to the U. S. Attorney, Denver, Colorado, by
the Denver FBI Office. There is no indication that the
information was passed to the Denver or Boulder police.
6. Question: Why did FBI say in 1969 and 1970--
and continues to say now--that it conducted no
investigation of Riha's disappearance when it is known
that FBI agents talked in 1969 and 1970 with friends of
Riha about his disappearance?
Answer: The FBI said in 1969 and 1970 and
continues to say now that it conducted no investigation
of Riha's disappearance because from the outset of his
disappearance to now, the FBI has never conducted any
investigation into the disappearance of Thomas Riha.
Reference is made to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
paragraphs of Denver FBI letter to the Director dated
February 12, 1970, supra, previously furnished to the
SSC on November 21, 1975, which read as follows: "All
persons interviewed in this investigation were specifically
advised by interviewing Agents that the purpose of this
investigation was to ascertain whether Galya Tannenbaum
had in any way violated Federal statutes concerning
impersonation.
Interviewees were specifically advised

home for personal reasons on March 15, 1060? If so, who
in the FBI received this information and to whom was this
information passed on in the FBI and the CIA? When was
this done?
Answer: Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum did
not contact the FBI in March or April, 1969, for any
reason. On May 14, 1969, she was contacted by Special
Agents of the FBI at her residence in Denver, Colorado, in
connection with an investigation involving charges that

Answer:
(a) The FBI does not have files on any of

any of them were ever employed by the FBI directly or
indirectly or contacted by the FBI: Mrs. Jan (Kenneth)
Sorensen, Boulder, Colorado; Mrs. Carol Word, Littleton,
Colorado; George Stein, Lyons, Colorado; Henry Madrid,
Pueblo, Colorado; Harvey Bevier, Denver, Colorado; and
Jaroslav Riha, San Antonio, Texas.
(b) The FBI does not have files on any of
the following persons nor is there any indication that
any of them were ever employed by the FBI, however, they
were contacted by the FBI as indicated on separate reports
of interview which are being furnished to the SSC:
Zdenek Cerveny, Boulder, Colorado; Francesca Stein, Lyons,
Colorado; and Professor Joyce Lebra, Boulder, Colorado.
(c) The FBI does have files on Professor
Donald Fanger, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Professor
Stephen Fischer-Galati, Boulder, Colorado; and Professor
Oldrich Leska, Prague, Czechoslovakia. These files are
not related to the disappearance of Thomas Riha.
Professors Fanger and Leska were never employed by the FBI
directly or indirectly nor is there any indication they
have ever been contacted by the FBI. Professor
Fischer-Galati has never been employed by the FBI directly

investigation was not in any way connected with the
dissapearance of Thomas Riha, a currently missing
Assistant Professor of History at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.
"This statement was made to interviewees
because the Denver Office has received inquiries by
news media concerning Riba's disappearance and they
have been specifically advised there is no evidence
relating to his disappearance showing any violation of
Federal law over which this Bureau has jurisdiction.
The circumstances of his disappearance suggest a missing
person situation and that investigation is being bandled
by the Boulder Police Department.
"Because of the close personal relationship
between Tannenbaum and Riha, it would be possible,
without the above statement by interviewing Agents, that
interviewees could gain the impression the FBI is
investigating the disappearance instead of the
impersonation of a Federal officer by Tannenbaum.
"Pursuant to current Bureau instructions, this
office is not and has not conducted any investigation
concerning Riha."
7. Question: Why, in January or February 1070,
did an FBI agent at the Denver office refuse to accompany
CIA Agent Michael Todorovich from Boulder to see then
Denver District Attorney Mike McKevitt? Was it made known
by the CIA agent that the purpose of the visit was to caso
the pressure on issuance of a subpoena to Dr. Joseph Smiley,
former president of the University of Colorado? (Under
such a subpoena, Smiley night have been required to reveal
the agency that had given him the April 1900 report that
Riha was alive and well at that time.)

NOTE:
Zdenek Cerveny and Francesca Stein were
interviewed at Lyons, Colorado, 1/21/70, by Special
Agents Merrill R. Smith and J. Hale McMenamin.
Joyce Lebra was interviewed by the same Agents on
1/21/70 at Boulder, Colorado.
Professor Donald Fanger is the subject of
Security Matter C, Bureau file 100-408465, opened
in January, 1954, when there was indication he supported
Communist Party policies and closed 1964 when investigation
indicated he did not qualify under Bureau's criteria for
inclusion on the Security Index and his activities did not
appear to warrant investigation. The only known connection
between Fanger and Riha is that they were both included in
a group of American graduate students selected to attend
Moscow or Lenigrad University in 1952-1959 in exchange for
twenty Soviet graduate students.

Leska, born 6/16/27 Czechoslovakia, was in the U. S. from
7/17/68 to 9/5/68 and again from 10/15/68 until 6/8/70
when he returned to Czechoslovakia. He was in the U. S.

was at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, and
from the Summer of 1969 until June, 1970, he was at the

was interviewed at this establishment and advised he was born
December 5, 1938, in Jihlava, Czechoslovakia, and holds a Master's
degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Czechoslovakia Technical
University, Prague, Czechoslovakia. He stated he is the nephew of.
THOMAS RIHA, a Professor of Russian History at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. He is currently employed as a plant
engineer with the Martin-Marietta Cement Company in Lyons, Colorado.
According to CERVENY, he came to the United States on
November 8, 1968, from Vienna, Austria, destined for the residence
of his uncle in Boulder, Colorado. He stated that upon arrival in
New York City, he spent several days at the residence of Mr. and
Mrs. R. V. GROSSMAN in Brooklyn, New York, who are the aunt and
uncle of HANA RIHA, the former wife of THOMAS RIHA.
CERVENY continued that he arrived in Denver, Colorado,
via Greyhound Bus on November 16, 1968, and immediately called
THOMAS RIHA at his residence in Boulder. He was advised by RIHA
that he would be unable to come to Denver to drive him back to
Boulder, but that he would have a friend meet him at the bus
station. He stated that approximately one hour later a woman
who introduced herself as CALYA TANNENBAUM approached him at the
bus station and thereafter drove him to the residence of THOMAS
RIRA at 1655 - 6th Street, Boulder, Colorado. He advised that
after TANNENBAUM departed the RIMA residence, his uncle told him
that she was a very important person, and the one who had been
influential in getting him into the United States.
CERVENY stated he resided with RIMA from November 16,
1968, until January 8, 1969, when he moved to 918 South Logan
Street, Denver, Colorado, in order to be closer to the Samsonite
Company where he had secured employment in the Research and
Development Laboratory. During the period he resided with his
uncle, TANNENBAUM visited this residence on several occasions,
and on almost every instance reminded him that she was an officer
in Military Intelligence; very influential with authorities of the
United States Immigration and Naturalization Service; and that
if he did not behave himself in the United States, she would have
him sent back to Czechoslovakia. CERVENY stated he never was certain

. When he informed. TANNENBAUM of this, she told him that she had more)
authority than the Immigration officials; and advised him to go to:
: Canada regardless, as she outranked the officials in Denver.

CERVENY then made the trip to Canada without incident, and learned
later that he was actually just fortunate that he was not required"
to produce citizenship papers at any time

In addition, CERVENY stated that in May, 1969, he met
a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL
BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadmoor Hotel, and whom he
eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM. He stated that TANNENBAUM
immediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and
Immigration connections, and advised her that she could arrange
to get her a passport to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia.
stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that TANNENBAUM
had recently approached her with a letter written in English
purportedly from THOMAS RIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was
asked by TANNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakian, and
that he eventually received this letter postmarked from somewhere
in Canada. He felt at the time he received the letter that it had
not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BDLIKOVA
that the letter was a hoax, he began to feel that TANNENBAUM was
a fraud and that his uncle's disappearance could have been for
reasons other than marital discord. He stated that immeidately
after being told of the letter by BDLIKOVA in October, 1969, he
filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, Colorado Police
Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw
TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the
: Boulder Police Department.
"
With regard to CERVENY's association with GA LYA
TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she told him
that she would like to recruit him into Military Intelligence, as
his engineering background and language ability would be "extremely
useful to us. She also told him that if he were in the United
States "working for the other side," she would shoot him. TANNEN-
BAUM also told CERVENY that she had originally met THOMAS RIHA in
Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he followed her for the
purpose of marrying her%; however, the marriage did not take place
as RIHA was unable to get along with her children. He stated that
upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that
TANNENBAUM was connected in some official capacity with the United
States Government, and that there was something in their relation-
ship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM some type of influence over the
actions of his uncle%;B however, in conversation with both his uncle

that this feeling is probably a result or antuition more then

being admitted to the United States, as the matter, to his knowledge.

CERVENY went on to state that after he moved to Denver
he did not see TANNENBAUM again until March 13, 1969, when she
called him on the telephone and suggested he come to her residence
at 248 Logan Street, where his uncle was also visiting her.
stated when he arrived at her house, his uncle seemed depressed
and upset over the fact that he was having marital difficulties
with HANA, and that the marriage would probably terminate in
divorce. He stated the purpose of his being invited to
TANNENBAUM's residence appeared to emanate from a desire of his
uncle to see him, but that nothing of importance occurred during
the visit.
"
Following the disappearance of his uncle on March 15,
1969, he stated TANNENBAUM commenced asking him over to her house
on the pretense of checking up on his immigrant status%3B however,
it became immediately apparent that the principal purpose of these
invitations was an attempt on the part of TANNENBAUM to have sexual
relations with him. He pointed out there were times when he
entered her residence when she would be partially unclothed, would
attempt to sit on his lap, sit close to him while watching tele-
vision, or would openly suggest that they go to her bedroom for
the purpose of having sexual intercourse. CERVENY stated TANNENBAUM
was physically repulsive to him, and that he would find an immediate
excuse to leave when she commenced making sexual advances to him.
During the period when he was visiting the TANNENBAUM
residence, CERVENY advised she suggested that she adopt him, and
actually started adoption proceedings through an attorney in
Denver, STEPHEN L. R. MC NICHOLS, JR.%; however, he stated he had
no desire whatsoever to go through with this, and told TANNENBAUM
He stated it was about this time that he began to suspect that
TANNENBAUM had no connection with Military Intelligence or had any
influence over his immigration status.
60.
He stated that in May, 1969, he desired to go to Toronto,
Canada, to attent a wedding of some Czechoslovakian friends, and
he inquired of TANNENBAUM if such would be legal for him to do.
He stated she told him there was nothing for him to worry about;
however, she suggested he consult with Immigration authorities
in Denver regarding this trip. According to CERVENY, TANNENBAUM
accompanied him to the Federal Buildar
oner, but refused to

CERVENY also recalled. that in December, 1968; his
father visited him, and during the visit, showed him a diamond
* brace let which he had smuggled into the United States for the
✓ purpose of selling for a relative in Czechoslovakia. He stated
his father had previously corresponded with another individual
by the name of RIHA in San Antonio, Texas, who was no relation
to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia.
According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antonio to
leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for him to
attempt to sell%; however, the bracelet was eventually returned
to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could
locate no buyer. Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN-
BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler
in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350.
TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and
actually paid him $400 in cash with a promise to pay him an
additional $100 later, which he never received.
:
CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered
6 his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he
witnessed at her insistence. By way of background, he explained
that in the spring of 1969, TANNENBAUM introduced him to an
elderly man by the name of GUSTAV FREDERICH INGWERSEN, a plastics
engineer and a native of Germany, who owned some type of plastics
plant in Denver, Colorado. He stated he had formerly done some
work in plastics, and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSEN might
help him get established in this field. As a result of this
meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the
company of TANNENBAUM and her two children, made two vacation
trips to New Mexico with him. He stated these trips were in
either April or May, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised
him that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNENBAUM
had him visit her residence where she told him that INGWERSEN
had drawn up a will and signed it prior to his death, but had
neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with
Colorado law. She said that INGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had
intended to ask him to witness the will, but had died before this
could be accomplished. She then coaxed him for over an hour to
witness this document, and still believing she was a bona fide
official in some Governmental capacity, he affixed his signature
to the will.
CERVENY concluded by stating that TANNENBAUM had never
obtained anything of value from him as a result of her represen-
tations as an officer in taxy Intelligence, and the longer

Mrs. FRANCESCA STEIN, nee Friedel, owner of the Black
Bear Inn, Lyons, Colorado, advised she is a citizen of Czechoslo-
vakia, and has been in the United States for approximately four
years, She stated that in about October, 1967, a Mr. STABEN, a
visiting Professor from France at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, Colorado; and a frequent customer at the Black Bear inn,
introduced her to a Professor of History at the University of
Colorado by the name of THOMAS RIHA, also a native of Czechoslo-
vakia, and that thereafter she and her husband became friendly
with RIHA.
Mrs. STEIN advised that in April, 1968, RIHA visited
the restaurant in the company of a Czechoslovakian citizen by the
name of JIRI CERVENY, who advised her that he had a son, ZDENEK
CERVENY, who had recently escaped from Czechoslovakia into Vienna,
Austria. She stated JIRI CERVENY was from Prague and that ZDENEK
CERVENY is a nephew of RIHA. They inquired if Mrs. STEIN would be
able to assist his son in coming to the United States, particularly.
with regard to obtaining employment for him. Mrs. STEIN advised
both RIHA and CERVENY that she would attempt to assist in this
endeavor through her attorney, PAUL MORRIS, in Boulder, Colorado.
Mrs. STEIN recalled that in September 1968, MORRIS
and RIHA visited her residence in Lyons concerr.ng ZDENEK CERVENY,
at which time MORRIS told her that he knew a woman from Denver,
Colorado, by the name of GALYA TANNENBAUM who had a great deal of
influence in the Government, and who was referred to by RIHA as
"Colcnel." She stated that MORRIS and RIHA rised her that
TANNENBAUM would be able to assist them in setting ZDENEK CERVENY
into the United States.
According to Mrs. STEIN, shortly after this meeting with
MORRIS and RIHA, TANNENBAUM visited the restaurant in Lyons to
discuss the bringing of ZDENEK CERVENY to the United States. She
told Mrs. STEIN it would be necessary to first check out Mrs. STEIN
and RIHA for security purposes before bringing CERVENY into this
country. She told her that she was a "Colonel in the Immigration,
and showed her a small hand gun which she had in her purse. During
this conversation, TANNENBAUM told Mrs. STEIN that she belonged to
an extermination group which killed people after the second World
War. Mrs. STEIN stated she considered TANNENBAUM to be a "nut and
did not pursue the matter any further with her, pointing

as far as she was concerned, the immigration matter concerning
CERVENY would be handled by her attorney, PAUL MORRIS.
Mrs. STEIN continued that in October, 1968, RIHA
married a young Czechoslovakian girl by the name of HANA
HRUSKOVA, and that subsequent to the marriage, a reception was
held at the Black Bear Inn. She stated that while the reception
was in progress, TANNENBAUM appeared, uninvited, and immediately
sought out RIHA, took him to the bar section of the restaurant,
and commenced a long, serious conversation with him which lasted
for approximately one hour. She stated that RIHA's bride became
extremely upset over this, as TANNENBAUM would not allow anyone
to interrupt their conversation. Mrs. STEIN advised that on one
occasion she went into the bar to tell RIHA that his bride was
becoming very upset, and was answered in an angry manner by
TANNENBAUM to "leave them alone." Following this conversation,
the content of which is unknown to Mrs. STEIN, she stated RIHA
appeared to be extremely upset, and although TANNENBAUM left
immediately, RIHA seemed to have lost all interest in the
reception.
Following the incident during the wedding reception,
Mrs. STEIN advised that TANNENBAUM again visited her at the
Black Bear Inn concerning the immigration case of ZDENEK CERVENY,
during which she mentioned to TANNENBAUM that she owned some
property in Lyons on which she desired to build an apartment
house. At this time TANNENBAUM told her that she was a Colonel
in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the
rank of General. She told Mrs. STEIN that she could utilize
some influence in securing an FHA loan for her%3B that she had the
authority to deport her at any time%3B and intimated to Mrs. STEIN
that for a percentage of the loan obtained, she would obtain
same; and if Mrs. STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she would
have her deported. Mrs. STEIN again pointed out that she considered
TANNENBAUM a "nut," and told her that all of immigration and
business dealings were handled through her attorney.
Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection,
the above was the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February,
1969, she made a trip to Columbia, South America, where she had
resided for approximately ten years before coming to the United
States, and did not again return to Lyons until March 18, 1969,
following the disappearance of RIHA from Boulder, Colorado, on
March 15, 1969.

Miss JOYCE LEBRA, Associate Professor of History
University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 1590 Hillside Drive
Boulder, advised she is a colleague of THOMAS RIHA in the
Department of History and considers herself a close personal
friend.
At the outset of the interview, it was explained to
LEBRA that the purpose of the interview was to ascertain any
available information from her concerning Mrs. GALYA TANNENBAUM
on whom this Bureau is conducting an investigation under the
Federal Impersonation Statute.
Miss LEBRA advised that to the best of her recollection
RIHA never did mention anyone to her by the name of TANNENBAUM or
any individual connected with Military Intelligence or the United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service. She stated that
if TANNENBAUM had been a close friend of RIHA's, this fact would
probably have been known to her, as she and RIHA generally asso-
ciated with the same circle of friends in the University community.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI explained that, in the absence
of a complete denial by Mr. FRITZ that the CIA had any dealings
with RIHA at any time, he, therefore, concluded and was convinced
the information furnished by Mr: FRITZ did not represent a
personal opinion but must have come from within the CIA. "He
added that inasmuch as it then appeared to him that RIHA had left
voluntarily, he also concluded he had no reason to fear for the
safety of RIHA. Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had
been subsequently quoted in the "Colorado Daily" or any other
newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe,
such quotation would have been correct.
Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not
feel, however, that the explanation about RIHA was adequate and
for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of
the Foreign Agents Registration section within the Justice Depart-
ment, whom he knew well. He thereafter received a reply that the
Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased.
He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to
the same section mentioned above within the Justice Department in
mid-December, 1969, again inquiring about RIHA, but as yet has
received no reply.
He stated he did not know of anything of value ever
received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.

are paid, and she also wanted to see the receipt for the deposit
of his salary per University records. He advised he had determined.
a discrepancy existed between what the University claimed to put...
into the account and what they actually put into RIHA's account...
He advised at this meeting TANNENBAUM did not discuss RIHA's
whereabouts:
He recalled his third meeting with TANNENBAUM occured
about five days later at the same location, although this time
TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three
years of age. He advised her of the amount the University had
deposited to RIHA's account. At this time TANNENBAUM told him
her real name was not GALY: TANNENBAUM, but something else which
she did not disclose, and added that she was about ready to leave
town. He advised of no contact with TANNENBAUM since their last
meeting.
.
STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the
document mentioned above of January 5, 1968, and its historical
significance disturbs him. He stated if RIHA was not "bumped
off" by TANNENBAUM, then he assumes that RIHA's disappearance
may have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter,
which is pure conjecture on his part. FISCHER-GALATI also recalled
that in September, 1968, Professor RIHA requested that an advertise-
ment for a travel bureau be run in the "Eastern European Quarterly,"
which GALATI described as an international journal to promote cul-
tural contact with Eastern European Countries. He advised RIHA
did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if
RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Treasure
Tours, 1010 St. Catherine Way, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. FISCHER-
GALATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometimes
believes that RIHA could be in Canada.
Professor FISCHER-GALATI advised that in April, 1969,
he contacted a Mr. FRITZ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
Denver, Colorado, regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS
RIHA of the University of Colorado. Mr. FRITZ advised him that he
had no knowledge of the matter but would check into same. Professor
FISCHER-GALATI stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who stated
the disappearance had nothing to do with the CIA and that RIHA's
leaving was a personal matter connected with personal problems.

:
STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI; Professor, Department of.
History, University of Colorado, advised that he had just returned
from a European trip. He recalled first meeting Professor THOMAS
RIHA sometime. in 1966 at a meeting of the American Historical
Society in San Francisco He advised he also had heard of RIHA
prior to their meeting. He advised that after RIHA came to the
University of Colorado he knew him as a fellow faculty member of
the Department of History and had dinner with him on two or three
occasions. He advised their relationship was casual and could not
have been considered a profound relationship.
FISCHER-GALATI advised he first met GALYA TANNI’NBAUM
sometime in May, 1969, after the disappearance of Professor RIMA.
He advised his object in meeting TANNENBAUM was to determine if she
were a "colonel" as described in hearsay. He advised he was con-
vinced she was not connected with any kind of intelligence work
and knew nothing of Eastern European history. He recalled that
TANNENBAUM stated she had known RIHA for many years and indicated
she had helped RIHA come to the United States but gave no further
explanation. He also recalled that TANNENBAUM displayed a "Power
of Attorney" document which was contained in a letter allegedly
signed by TOM RIHA. He advised the most significant part of the
document to him was the date of same, which he easily recalled as
January 5. 1968. FISCHER-GALATI pointed out that January 5, 1968,
is the date of the overthrow of the Czechoslovakian Government, at
which time NOVOTONY was replaced by DUBCEK, and at this same time
the official who was in control of passports disappeared and sub-
sequently showed up in Montreal, Canada. He recalled that TANNENBAUM
indicated she carried a gun in her purse and that her car had some
special equipment, but TANNENBAUM did not elaborate further. Fe
advised that TANNENBAUM was extremely careful in her conversations
with him and made no allegations.
FISCHER-GALATI advised his second meeting with TANNENBAUM
occured on October 1, 1969, at 2:15 p.m., same obtained from his
notebook. He recalled that TANNENBAUM called him on the telephone
and arranged to meet him in front of the Colorado Book Store in
Boulder. He recalled that her car was parked legally at the
aforementioned location. He recalled that she was anxious to
determine why a check had "bounced" in RIHA's bank account. He
recalled she wanted to know if the University was continuing to
deposit RIHA's salary to his bank account, as all University faculty

Coordination, to John A. Mintz, Assistant Director, Legal
Counsel Division, FBI, dated February 20, 1976, enclosing
SSC letter dated February 18, 1976.
Referenced letter requests interviews with FBI
Agents of the Chicago Office who prepared memoranda con-
cerning the Black Panther Party.
In view of current civil litigation involving
members of the Black Panther Party, and Agents of the FBI,
it is felt that it would not be proper to make these Agents
available for interview by the SSC at this time.
The FBI is in agreement with the Department's view
that a proper response would be to allow the SSC to review
transcripts of the Agents' testimony at the trial, concerning
these memoranda.

FEB 20 1976
Attached is a letter from the Senate Select
Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests
interviews with FBI agents who wrote various mem-
.oranda concerning the Black Panther Party in Chicago.
Because such interviews might impair the Department's
ability to conduct a defense in the Hampton trial, in
Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand-
ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate
response to Senator Church's letter. One possible re-
sponse would be to provide the SSC with the transcripts
of the FBI agents testimony at the trial concerning
these memoranda, instead of allowing the SSC to inter-
view these agents. We would appreciate it if the FBI
would also consider what response would be appropriate
to this letter.

Pursuant to your requests, memoranda dated February 4,
1953, February 26, 1958, April 6, 1958, and April 10, 1953, have
been submitted to you containing observations regarding proposed
drupts of the above Executive Order. Pursuant to the request of
Mr. Edward S. Lazowska of the Department, who delivered a copy of
a new draft of this proposed Order on the evening of April 13,
1958, the following observations are set forth for your informa
ition and consideration:
In connection with the provision in paragraph 3 (a) which
allows the Civil Service Commission, in certain cases, to authorize
'less than the minimum amount of investigation stated in this paragraph
but which meets the requirements of the national security, it is felt
the Civil bruice Commission must erercice ertre e core to insure that
investigation authorized, purticularly with respect to individuals
who all have access to confidential information coes; in fact, e
the requirements of the national security.
"In connection with Section 4 of the draft, your attention
is invited to my previous observation that this Pureau fools it should
conduct the additional investization that may be appropriate only in
those cases in which the purpose of the additional investigation is
to develop information of a 1.yalty or subversive nature. In this
connection it is observed that the provisions or Section 8 (b) and
18 (6) may be intenced to accolish is roses every item
agnested that you by desire to have the rder state more clearly

additional investigation requested in ection 4.

In connection with Section 5 of the draft, he thought
occurs that its provisions as to what agency is required to conduct
"ouch investigation as may be copropriate" ay not as entirely clocr.
It is believed that the intent of this section to proving that

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
At the SSC Executive Session held February 13,
1976, concerning "Domestic Intelligence Investigations,"
a discussion ensued between Bureau representatives and
SSC Staff Members as to what effect the enactment of the
Privacy Act of 1974 had on investigations conducted by
the FBI relative to domestic subversive groups. On this
occasion, one of the Staff Members present requested that
this Bureau furnish the SSC with a copy of all instructions
sent to Bureau field divisions by FBI Headquarters, which
instructions would have a bearing on the conduct of this
Bureau's "Domestic Intelligence Investigations."
Attached, in response to the above request, are
copies of three Headquarters communications sent to Bureau
field divisions containing instructions responsive to the
above request. Also attached is one copy of a communication
from our Richmond Division which prompted one of the above
Headquarters communications.

Dear Mike:
On March 4, 1976, Mr. James Johnson of the FBI re-
viewed the Select Committee's draft titled "CIA and FBI
Mail Opening." James Dick and Thomas Dawson of the Com-
mittee staff revised the draft to meet all security
problems previously raised by Mr. James Lee of the Bureau,
and discussed the revisions with Mr. Johnson to make cer-
tain that their concerns were met.
This letter is to confirm the fact that, unless I
receive word to the contrary from you, the Department of
Justice has no objection to the publication of this report.
Thanks again for your help throughout the inquiry
into this subject.

The Attorney General
NOTE:
This is the first instance wherein the SSC has
made available for review a proposed rough draft of a seg-
ment of the upcoming SSC report. It is expected that other
segments will be made available by the Committee Staff
Members. It was necessary to review this proposed draft
in the offices of the SSC since they do not contemplate
permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises. The
approval for the use of information from the 2 classified
documents has been coordinated with the IS-2 Section of
the Intelligence Division and with the Budget and Accounting
Section of the Administrative Division. The handling of
the budget figure as set forth has been approved by Asst.
Director E.W. Walsh.

by the Civil Service Commission or the employing agency, such informa-
tion. should be forwarded. to the Civil Service Commission or the employ-
ing agency; that upon the receipt of information necessitating investi-
gation by this Jureau, such information should be forwarded to this:
Bureau for a full field investigation. You may wish to give considera-
tion to possible further clarification of this section.
Regarding the phrase "following such investigation and review
as he deems necessary" set forth in Section 6, it is believed that
"as he deems necessary" refers to the word "review." If, however,
it might also refer to the word "investigation," the thought occurs
that it might be in conflict with other provisions in the draft which
prescribe that in certain instances full field investigations must be
conducted.
In connection with Section 8 (5) it is noted that this section
Coes not specifically provide for syspathetic association with individe
members of the organizations referred to in this section. In this con-
nection, you will recall that the attachment to my nemorandum of April 14
1955, set forth observations of the Interdepartmental Intelligence
Conference renarding the draft, one of which concerned a suggestion
along this line.
It is observed that Section 14 (a) authorizes the National
Security Council to designate representatives of other departments and
agencies to furnish advice and to collaborate with the Civil service
Conmission in connection with the Connission's study of the nanner in
which the order is i plenenied. We would appreciate any inforation
- regèrcing the extent genregentatives of this reau muhý be capcojed..

requested in my nemorandur of february 26, 1053, regarding your desires
as to this Burecu Following the policy of channeling its investigative
reports through the Civil Pervice Commission to the departments and

personnel, support costs and overhead.
(2) The Committee's draft under "Case No. 5"
sets forth information regarding "Fublic Meeting Oppos-
ing U. S. Involvement in Vietnam War (1966)." This
information was taken from a classified document cap-
tioned "Universities Committee on Problems of War and
Peace" dated March 2, 1966.
The FBI cannot declassify this document since
it contains information warranting its continued class-
ification; however, the information as set forth in the
Committee's draft would be unclassifiable as it appears.
Therefore, the FBI does not interpose any objection to
the use of this material.

It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel
Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning
COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are
below the level of Section Chief. The prior procedure and policy
of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below
a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or
above.
☑
F. A. O. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was
contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he
wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent
personnel included in the report under the title of Section Chief.
He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utili-
zation of the identity of Agent personnel will be consistent with
the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report. This
report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the
identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan.
No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact,
Dick did not identify SACS involved in this operation.

appropriated for the implementation of Executive Order 10422 and
this Bureau is proceeding with investigations under this Order and
submitting reports to the Civil Service Commission for appropriate
adjudication.
Regarding what agencies will have investigative responsibiliti
abroad under this Order, as mentioned in my previous memorandas you
may wish to give consideration to, if possible, continuing the arrange-
ments which have been perfected under Executive Order 9835.
Ny memorandum of April 6, 1953, commented regarding paragraph,
8 (b) (4) of the draft received April 2, 1953, It was stated that it
was felt investigations regarding individuals who might be subjected to
coercion, influence or pressure because of the presence of a close
relative in a nation whose interests may be inimical to the interests
of the United States which develop a subversive aspect should be done
by this Bureau rather than the Civil Service Commission or the employ-
ing agency] • It is observed that Section 8 (d) of the draft received
April 13, 1953, recuires this Pureau to conduct all investigations
which develop information indicating that an individual may have been
subjected to coercion, influence, or pressure to act contrary to the
interests of the national security. It is suggested you might desire
to clarify this provision further to specifically provide that
investigations under this category will be conducted by this ureau
only where there is information indicating a question of loyalty or
subversive activity.
•
As previously mentioned, it will be necessary that the rules
and regulations to be issued in connection with the implementation of
this order, such as those governing the establishing and operation of
hearing boards, be as complete as possible in order to maintain
uniformity。
It will, of course, be necessary for this Bureau to receive
sufficient funds in order to discharge its responsibilities under this
Ordero

Case No. 5--Public Meeting Opposing U.S. Involvemen in Vietnam War
(1966)
„Informers were used extensively in FBI investigations of
possible Communist links to the antiwar movement.
An example is
the FBI's coverage of various antiwar teach-ins and conferences
sponsored by the Universities Committee on Problems of War and
Peace. A forty-one page report from the Philadelphia office--based
on coverage by thirteen informants and confidential sources--described
in complete detail a "public hearing on Vietnam." A Communist Party
official had "urged all CP members" in the area to attend, and one
of the organizers was alleged to have been a Communist in the early
1950's. Upon receipt from an informant of a list of the speakers,
the FBI culled its files for data on their backgrounds.
One was
described by a source as a Young Socialist Alliance "sympathizer.

This informative memorandum to advise of status
of Departmental review of FBI files concerning Martin Luther
King, Jr., and related matters.
1
You will recall that, commencing 12/6/75,
personnel of the Civil Rights Division reviewed portions
of our files concerning King and related matters. The
last date such review was conducted in 1975 was on 12/19/75.
On 2/9/76, Criminal Section Chief Robert A. Murphy resumed
review of the King file. He worked on this for less than
four hours on that day and was to return the morning of
2/10/76 but had not returned as of the dictation of this
memorandum at 3:00 p.m., 2/10/76.
Murphy had been reviewing the King file to the
exclusion of other files of interest. The King file is
94 sections in size and, as of 2/9/76, only about 25 sections
had been reviewed. On that date, Murphy told Supervisor
J. T. Aldhizer that, when he resumed the review the next
day, he wanted to start with the portion of the file
commencing 1/1/68. This would be Section 77, and thus
Murphy would be skipping approximately 50 sections or a
little over half of the file.
Murphy has given no indication, and neither has
there been an indication from any other Departmental source,
a's to the true status of the Department's overall review

in confidence and no access given thereto, except, with the
consent of the investigative agency concerned, to other
departments and agencies conducting security programs under
the authority of the act of August 26, 1959.

It is strongly urged that you amend the provisions
in Section 9(k) of the Sample Security Regulations, because,
unless such is done, some departments und agencies may furnish
to the employee a copy of the complete record of the case,
which would include this Bureau's investigative reports.
Your attention is called to Section 4(b) of the
regulations setting forth provisions covering the scope of
the investigation to be conducted. The provisions, as set
forth, do not include a check of the fingerprint files of
this Bureau. As Section 3(a) of the Order, itself, calls for
a check of such files, it is suggested you may wish to include
this also in the regulations.

advised, this Buredy feels it should conduct such investigations,

information to this effect is included in the regulations,
can be anticipated that this Bureau will receive a large number
of requests for investigations solely for the purpose of bringing
the investigation up to date, or to develop some information of
a nonsubversive nature.
- Under Executive Order 9835, this Burecu, through
agreement with the Civil Service Commission, followed the
policy of sending all its reports to the Civil Service
Commission for dissemination to the appropriate departments
and agencies. As you know, the current Order requires that
the Civil Service Commission maintain a security-investigations
index, which is to include the inder maintained by the Civil
Service Commission in conjunction with Executive Order 9835,
This Bureau believes the policy previously followed of sending
these reports to the Civil Service Commission should,be

Apart from the above suggestions regarding, the

worthy, of good conduct and character, and of
complete and unswerving loyalty to the United
States; and
WHEREAS the American tradition that all
persons should receive fair, impartial, and

United States (5 U. S. C. 631); the Civil Service
Act of 1883 (22. Stat: 403; 5. U. S. C. 632, et

and deeming such action necessary in the best
interests of the national security, it is hereby
ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. In addition to the departments
and agencies specified in the said act. of August
26, 1950, and Executive Order No. 10237 of
April 26, 1951, the provisions of that act shall
apply to all other departments and agencies of

requirements of the national security with

Your attention is invited to my memorandum of Hay 1, 1953,
wherein I urged that the provisions in Section 9 (k) of the "Cample
Security nogulations" be amended to preclude the possibility of any
department or agency furnishing a copy of this Bureau's reports to
the individuals investigated under sae Order. It is believed this
should be done prior to the effective date of Executive order 10450,
and I would appreciate being auvised or what action is contemplated
in this record. It is observed that in connection with Executive
Order 9535 the Attorney General under date of Leccaber 11, 1947,
directed a conridential memorandum to all department and agency
hoads of the Executive Brunch of the Government whoroin he included
information ro jarang tao dec of this areau's reports under

contains information regarding the manner in which hearings are to be
conducted by the security houring Boards under Executive Order 10450.
Those regulations, however, do not state whether these hearing aro
to be opened or closed to the public. For your information, the
Loyalty Review Board in connection with the matter of hearings held
under Executive Order 9035, issued a directive to all departments
and crencies advising that such hearings should be in private and
attendance limited to representatives of the agency who are directly
connected with the adjudication of the case, representatives of tho

SANUARO FORM NO. 64
Office Memoondum
TO
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
Director, FBI
FROM William P. Rogers,
Deputy Attorney General
SUBJECT Executive Order 10450
UNITED STATES: GOVERNMENT
DATE: June 25, 1953__
Security Requirements for Government Employment.
This is with reference to your memoranda of May 1 and
May 14, 1953, relating to the administration of Executive Order
10450.
1. Your opinion that there should be no abuse of the
privilege granted by section 3(b) of the order in filling sensitive
positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of full field..
pre-appointment investigations is well taken. So, also, is(your
suggestion that the Civil Service Commission, in respect to sec-
tion 3(a), should utilizė extreme care in permitting less than
the minimum investigation with respect to per diem, intermittent,
temporary, or seasonable employees and aliens employed outside
the United States.
$
i
2. I agree with your assumption that the coverage of
the order is limited to the Executive Branch of the Government.
However, I do not believe it will be necessary to make specific
provision in the regulations to that effect. Inasmuch as they
are to be issued separately by and in the name of each executive
branch, department or agency, it will be made clear that they relate
only to the administration of the particular department or agency
concerned.
……… You also make reference to the fact that certain of the
non-executive branch agencies, such as the General Accounting Office.
and the Government Printing Office, participated in the procedures
prescribed by Executive Order 9835. I understand this resulted,
not because that order was necessarily applicable to those agencies,
but because they voluntarily adopted procedures similar to those
prescribed by the order. Executive Order 10450 does not prevent
them from adopting a similar policy in relation to it. The main
question is whether the appropriations of the FBI are sufficient
to pay for the investigations required by such agencies. I under-
stand that the appropriations are sufficient with respect to some
of the agencies whose employees are part of the classified civil
service, such as the General Accounting Office, but not for others,
such as the Library of Congress. In the past a system of reimburse.
****. -ment was worked out with respect to investigations for agencies, not
covered by existing appropriations. I would suggest that the Bureau

--- Image 124-10183-10279_multirif_redacted_page_35.jpeg ---

13. You point out that section 3(a) of the order requires
"a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation", but that section 4(b) of the sample security regulations
dealing with the same subject matter omits the quoted language.
In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to the regula-
tions along the lines you suggest has been transmitted to all executive
departments and agencies.
14. You note that the abolition of Regional Loyalty
Boards and the Loyalty Review Board will affect procedures pursuant
to Executive Order 10422 relating to United States citizens who
are United Nations employees. As you suggested, amendments to
cover this situation have been promulgated to all executive depart-
ments and agencies.

"
work out similar procedures with the Civil Service Commission and
other interested agencies with respect to Executive Order 10450,
•
¨.3. In reference to the problem of the responsibility of
conducting investigations abroad; the Departments of State and Army
were requested by letter dated June 5, 1953, to continue the same
arrangement under Executive Order No. 10450 for investigations
abroad as existed under Executive Order No. 9835. The letter stated
that in the absence of any indication of disagreement with this plan,
it would be assumed that the existing arrangement would remain in
effect. To date no expressions of disagreement have come from
either Department.
4. In respect to the re-adjudication question arising
under section 4, I agree that the Bureau should conduct additional
investigations only when their purpose is to develop information
of the type described in section 8(d). However, I believe the
Civil Service Commission, rather than this Department, should
issue direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to proper
procedures in connection with requests for investigation. I would
accordingly recommend that you work out a plan with the Civil Service
Commission to so advise the interested departments and agencies.
5. As you point out, the last sentence of section 9(k)
of the sample security regulations is subject to possible interpre-
tation requiring the employee to be given a copy of the investigative
reports in connection with his case. In order to preclude this
possibility, an appropriate amendment has been transmitted to
all departments and agencies... Many of them have also been
informally advised of the matter. In addition, since they are
supposed to submit their regulations to this Department before
issuance, proper precautions will be taken at that time.
·
6. I agree that your existing policy of sending all Bureau
reports to the Commission for dissemination to the appropriate depart-
ments and agencies should be continued.
7. You note that the sample security regulations do not
state whether the hearings are to be open or closed and that under
Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued a directive to
all departments and agencies requiring hearings under that order to
be private. In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to
that effect has been transmitted to all executive departments and
agencies.
.
.8. You point out that the sample security regulations
provide in section 9(c) (4): that each employee shall have the right
"to cross-examine any witness, offered in support of the charges",
whereas under Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued..

Your attention is invited to the letter from
Mr. Peter Campbell Brown, then the Acting Assistant to the
Attorney General, to the Honorable Seth W. Richardson, then
the Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board, dated May 5, 1949,
Therein Hr. Brown requested Mr. Richardson to clarify Review
Board instructions to the various departments and agencies
to the effect that "Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation will testify before Hearing Boards where they
are in a position to furnish competent evidence. They will not,
however, participate otherwise in the proceedings or will they
be made available merely to interpret information appearing in
their investigative reports." This policy will continue to be
the policy of this Bureau under Executive Order 10450 and it has
been concurred in by the Department of Justice, The Department
has further suggested that the Commission so advise the various.
departments and agencies that this policy will be continued.
These points are being called to your attention in order
that you may furnish this Bureau the information requested above,
as well. as give consideration to the necessity for furnishing
instructions as outlined above to the various agencies for their
information and guidance in the operations of Executive Order 10450

From: John Fdgar Hoover - Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
Subject:
EXECUTIVE ORTER 10450
SICURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT
with the inception of the cantioned Executive Order it
became evident to this Bureau that certain problems would arise
which have been encountered in the past in this Dureau's
onerations under the provisions of "recutive Order 0335. Coveral
of these have been posed to the Department of Justice and the
latter has now furnished this ureau its advice regarding then.
One consideration is just what agencies in the Fedoral
Government are to be included in the operations of trecutive
Order 10150. As your files will reflect, by letter dated
11
August 21, 1947, the Honorable Arthur Flemming, then the
Moting President of the Vonnission, furnished this Jurecu a list
of cll such asencice to be included within the provisions of.
2) Executive Order 9395 Tumbered anong these mere, the. General
Accounting face and the Government Printing Office, neither of
ich were agencies of the cecutive Pranch. "he thought occurred.
ce to whether these agencies are to be included under the noo
program and if so whether your cotizatea of cases to be handled
for these onencies in the current and succeeding fiscal years
which you have furnished this bureau include the Ceneral Accounting
Office and the Sovernment Printing Office.
It is understood that the Commission considers loyees
of these agencies within the provisions of feecutive or so93354,
since they are
competitive employees as are the bulk o

a directive permitting Loyalty Hearing Boards to hear witnesses in
the absence of the employee and his counsel, if the witness so
requested.
I understand the provision of section 9(¢) (4) to be a
deliberate policy judgment that witnesses, other than confidential
informants, shall be subject to cross-examination. Accordingly,
persons giving testimony will not have the choices set forth in
your memorandum. I therefore suggest that you advise prospective
witnesses that their testimony will have to be in the presence of
the employee and his counsel and will be subject to cross-examina-
tion.
9. I consider the Bureau's policy of permitting Special
Agents to testify at the hearings only "where they are in a position
to furnish competent evidence," to be sound and suggest that you
undertake through the Civil Service Commission to advise the agencies
concerned that this policy will be continued.
10. Serious consideration has been given to your suggestion
that dismissals without prejudice to applicants in cases before the
Regional Loyalty Boards may effect the Civil Service Commission's
register of eligibles. The Commission has already advised that it
believes that, under the basic Civil Service Act, it can establish
criteria with respect to the register of eligibles similar to those
set out in the order. The Department has advised the Commission
that the order does not preclude it from so acting under the authority
of the Civil Service Act if it is satsified as to the existence of
such authority.
11. I also go along with your view that it will be
necessary that agencies use a standard form containing sufficient
identifying data in checking individuals! names through the Bureau's
files and in connection with investigations conducted under the
Executive Order, and suggest that you work out a procedure for.
jestablishing such a form with the Civil Service Commission.
12. With relation to section 5 of the order you state that
the Bureau, on receipt of information of a nature necessitating
investigation by it, intends to follow the policy of immediately
initiating the investigation rather than awaiting a request from
the department or agency concerned, but notifying the head of the
department or agency that information of a nature requiring investi-
gation by the Dureau has been received and an investigation is being
conducted. You also mention that upon request the interested agency
will be furnished with the basis for the investigation. I do not
believe this policy to be in conflict with any provision of the order
and
e no reason why you should not follow the policy you suggest. *---

· employees of several executive agencies. It would be appreciated...
if you would furnish this Bureau a list of the agencies to be
included within the provisions of Executive Order 10450 at your
earliest convenience. In addition, would you advise whether the
General Accounting Office and the Government Printing Office, and
their employees will be considered as subject to the provisions
of the captioned order. If such is the case we would appreciate
your advice as to whether your estimate of the volume of work
to be handled for these agencies was included in the budgetary
estimates furnished this Bureau.
As you are aware, employees of the Library of Congress
have been processed under Executive Order 9835 through agreement
with officials of the Library and the results of name checks and
investigations handled for the Library were compensated for on c
reimbursable basis. Would you advise whether the agreement had
with the Library of Congress for processing its employees under
the old Loyalty Order has been renewed for Executive Order 10450.
If such is the case is the Library of Congress agreeable to
continue the procedure of reimbursement for each matter handled?
::
With regard to the question as to what agencies have
investigative responsibilities in connection with the additional
investigation that may be necessary in the readjudication of
full field investigations conducted under Executive Order 9335 as
called for in Section 4 of the cuptioned order, this bureau feels
it should conduct such investigations only when the burpose is to
develop information of a nature described in “ection 8(a) of this
order. The department of Justice advised that it concurs in this
opinion and stated that it feels the Civil Service Commission.
Should tscue direct instructions to all acpartments and agencies
as to the oroper procedures to be followed in connection with
requests for further investigation. It is felt that if such
instructions are issued it will preclude the receipt of a large
number of requests by the FBI for investigation solely to bring
the previous investigation up to date or to develop some allegations
of a nonsubversive nature, For your further information, the
Department of Justice has advised that it agrees this Bureau
should continue the procedure established under the Loyalty Order
of channeling its investigative reports through the Civil service.

Dear Mr. Hoover:
You will recall that several agencies of the Legislative Branch of
the Government participated in the loyalty program prescribed in Execu-
tive Order 9835. These same agencies have made requests of the Commis-
Ision that they be permitted to participate in a similar manner under
the program prescribed in Executive Order 10450. By letter dated June 29,
1953, the Deputy Attorney General advised the Commission that if these
agencies are of the view that they can adopt procedures which would make
it possible for them to participate in the program by virtue of authority
conferred under the acts under which they operate, it would be entirely
appropriate for them to participate in the program on a voluntary basis.
It was suggested in this letter that the Commission work out with your
Bureau the question relating to treimbursement by the agencies involved..
Because of the above opinion I have attached for your consideration
proposed undated drafts of lettors to the Librarian of Congress, The
Public Printer, and the Director of Personnel of the General Accounting
Office advising that subject to their meeting the above conditions they
*** may participate in this program. The budget. estimates of the Commission.
for some time have included work items which would result from making
national agency checlis and inquiries and limited personal investigations;..
when necessary, for the Government Printing Office and the General Account-
ing Office. It is our understanding that this is true with respect to
the budget estimates of your Bureau insofar as they pertain to searching
fingerprint records and Standard Forms 87 for employees of these agencies
and making full field investigations when necessary under Section 8(a) of
Executive Order 10450. For this reason no feature of reimbursement has
been mentioned in our proposed letters to these agencies.
'
The Commission is willing to conduct for the Library of Congress, en
a reimbursable. basis activities which it would perform for an agency inj
the Executive Branch, under Executive Order 10450. I have taken the liberty
of including in the draft to the Librarian of Congress. the basis for re-
imbursing your Bureau for its part in this program. This was done for

The President has directed the Civil Service Commission, after consult-
ing with the major users of personnel investigations, to formulate and
issue minimum standards of acceptable investigative coverage for Federal
civilian employment.
I should appreciate your comments and suggestions relative to the follow-
ing proposed minimum standards for acceptable full field coveragei
Scope of Full Field Investigations
Full field investigations on Federal employees and applicants are por-
sonally conducted investigations which cover the life of the individual¸.
with special emphasis on the person's background and activities during
the most recont fifteen years, on since his eighteenth birthday, which
over is the shorter period. In addition, a thorough personal investiga-
tion is made of any materially derogatory matters developed, requiring
investigation before the fifteen-year period.
W
The basic elements of investigation are:
‚– a national agency chuckt, as described on page 736-3 or
the Federal Personnel Manual
personal interviews with proscht and former employers,
supervisors, fellow wreferences, neighbors;
school authorities
checks of police,

In view of the above, this Duronu has no comments

in the investigativo period. Favicular care is taken also to verify
the fact of unemployment or self-employment claimed by the subject of
investigation.

the subject is young and has had no subsequent schooling. Personal
interviews are conducted with witnesses such as professors and former
students who were associated with the subject during recent schooling.
Neighborhood investigation is regularly conducted to cover residence
during the most recent three years. Testimony of neighbors before that
period may be sought to verify periods of unemployment or self-employment,
or to resolve questionable matters which have been raised from other
sources.
The number of witnesses interviewed cannot be reduced to a formula but
in each caso depends upon the diversity of the subject's experience
and places of residence, as well as upon the depth of knowledge showm

SUBJECT: Executive Orders 9835, 10450, and 11605
This is in reference to your memorandum dated
March 20, 1973 in which you requested to be advised
regarding the Department's position relating to the
above executive orders.
In the event the Subversive Activities Control
Board ceases to function after July 1, 1973, the
designation program as authorized by Ė. O. 10450, as
amended, will continue to remain in effect. The
Board's demise will, however, eliminate it as the
body which at this time has the exclusive authority
to conduct, upon petition of the Attorney General,
the evidentiary hearings and make the determinations
as to whether an organization should be designated
within the criteria and standards specified by
E. O. 10450, as amended by E. o. 11605.
The question of revising E. O. 10450 to overcome
any deficiency which arises as a result of the demise
of the Board is currently under study in the Depart-
ment. There is also legislation pending to afford
Congressional approval to E. O. 11605. Until such
time as these matters are resolved, it is requested
that the Bureau continue to conduct the investi-
gations which it has carried out under E. o. 10450
which is, of course, still in effect.

To date, Congress has refused to appropriate funds for the
operation of the Subversive Activities Control board (SACB).
During a current study of FEI jurisdiction by this Bureau, the
questions have arisen: has the authority to designate organizations been
taken from the Attorney General and given to the SACB by Executive
Order 11605, or is this authority concurrent; and at this time, what are
the responsibilities and authority of the FBI under Executive Order 10450,
as amended, and Executive Order 115057
Would you please provide me with a statement of the Department's

"
Executive Order (EO) 10450 is currently being amended
by the Department and representatives of this Bureau have participated
in a task force headed by Mr. Oran Waterman, Director, Department
Security Staff; which is recommending certain changes be made in
EQ 10450.
{ During the course of discussions within the task force, it was
pointed out to Mr. Waterman the Bureau's authority to conduct investigations
in the domestic subversion field has come under considerable scrutiny.
This. Bureau is now conducting investigations of domestic cubversion
on the basis of existing Federal statutes. This investigative policy may
not adequately meet the needs of an effective security of Covernment-
employees program under EO 10450.
The Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel,
previously solicited our views on abolition of the Attorney (eneral's List.
In our response captioned Abolition of the Attorney General's List,"
dated April 11, 1974, our comments included advice that under our
current statutory basis for domestic subversion investigations may not
adequately meet the needs of O 10450 and the observation the FBI
has never received specific instructions from the Attorney General to·
conduct intelligence-type investigations to identify and determine the
activities of organizations-described in Section 8 (a) (5) of EO 10450.
We also requested to be advised as to the instructions of the Attorney
Ceneral relating to the FBI conducting intelligence-type investigations
under EQ10450, as well as the scope and parameters within which such
investigations should be conducted.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Criminal I'lvision
Our current practice of conducting subversive-type.
investigations based on Federal statutes may tend to restrict our
intelligence gathering concerning organizations, associations, movements,
groups and combinations of persons as defined in Section 8 (2) (5) of
EO 10450. In responding to our above-referred-to memorandum of
April 11, 1974, it is recommended the Attorney General consider
isr ce of some form of Departmental instructions or order
establishing firm guidelines for intelligence-type investigations
which would define our authority in this regard. It is believed this
would put the FBI on a firm foundation to conduct intelligence-type
investigations involving groups defined in Section 8 (a) (5) to adequately
support EO 10450. We have previously recommended that the Department
seek a comprehensive Executive Order, and furnished suggested language,
which would provide a firm basis for FBI intelligence-type investigations
in the gecurity field. This recommendation is still under study by the
Department.
We would be glad to meet with representatives of the
Department to discuss this matter in more detail.

Since the issuance of Executive Order 11785 on June 4,

organizations, one of the standards used by the FBI in initiating
investigations of individuals pursuant to Executive Order 100
has been eliminated. This is true with regard to investigations.
under captioned matter of individuals which may be initiated by
the FBI based on information contained in our files as well as
in evaluating requests Ior. Investigations of individuals received
from other agencies and departments pursuant to Section 6(d) of
Executive Order 10450.
In this connection it is noted that the Criminal
Division of the Department in a letter of July 11, 1974, advised
that continuɩd investigation by the 75I of the Nation of Islam is
Warranted because, among other things, "its reported activities
appear to come within the criteria of Executive Order 10450.

In view of the issuance of Executive Order 11735, it
will be appreciated if you will furnish guidelines to be used by

to be utilized in determining whether available information is

This is in response to your memoranda, entitled as above,
dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy
Attorney General, Criminal Division, and referring to pro-
blems which have arisen as a result of the promulgation of
Executive Order Ì1785 which amends Executive Order 10450.
view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will
undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the
Criminal Division.
In
As you know this matter has been under continuing’review
both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this
office, of working level representatives of various agencies
in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree
in Project %2310 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy",
You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-
tions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations
to identify and determine the activities of organizations now
described in the amended Section 8 (a) (5) of Executive Order
10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-
tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter
pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to
be utilized in determining whether available information is a
sufficient basis for investigation.
Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order
10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those
which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts...
of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their
rights under the constitution or laws of the United States or

organizations described above should be investigated when
information is received indicating their involvement. The
same yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-
mining whether the investigation should continue, should apply
concerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably
be made that the individuals activities, either within the
organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-
lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

any State, (2) or which seek to overthrow the Government of
the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by
unlawful means. (Emphasis added).
Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate
that the investigation should be initially based on a possible
violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute
prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful
act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to
detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it
is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of in-
formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature
mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the
investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation
of the available information suggests that the activities of the
organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The
most recent example of the type of organization, that you have
advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated
to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations of
this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be
investigated as soon as information is available indicating their
potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to
the fulfillment of their purposes.
*
It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior
communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations
and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the
investigations of such organizations if their programs call for
acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com-
mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these
programs.
It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the
initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling
within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

FEDERAL EMPLOYEE SECURITY PROGRAM
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10450
December 11, 1974
Reference is made to your memorandum dated
November 1, 1974, in answer to our previous inquiries
requesting advice concerning the effect of Executive.
Order (EO) 11735 on our investigations of organizations
and individuals engaged in subversive activities.
+
While referenced memorandum advises we should
use the same yardstick for investigation of subversive
organizations and subversive individuals, the comments
following that advice, concerning individuals, are
believed subject to intergratation as being more
restrictive in scope. Specifically, concerning organ~
izations, you essentially advised that when investigation
dctermines the activities are local in nature, than
the investigation should cease, out if the activities
are illegal or potentially illeral, the investigation
should continue. Concerning individuals, the
Menorandum advises essentially that the same yardstick
be used but adds when the activities do not annear to
be in violation of any law, then the investigation should
cease.
Further, the tenor of your memorandum,
particularly comments contained in page two, paragraph
one, follow the concept of investigative scope consistent
with the advice as to investigation of subversive
organizations but does appear to conflict with the
latter comments concerning investigation of individuals
where the phrase "not in violation of any law" is used.
We would appreciate clarification concerning this matter.

Your memorandum of November 1, 1974, in part,
responded to this Bureau's memorandum of August 19, 1974,
which asked for guidelines to be used by the FBI in
initiating investigations of applicants and employees in .
the Executive Branch of the Government pursuant to Section
8(d) of EO 10450. This Section specifically instructs
other agencies to promptly refer to the FBI for investi-
gation those cases which develop information indicating
that an individual may have been subjected to coercion,
influence or pressure to act contrary to the interests of
the national security, or information relating to any of
the other matters described therein.
Since the guidelines furnished by you are
concerned primarily with possible violation of law, a
decision to be made by the Department, it will be
appreciated if you will furnish additional guidelines
to cover' "sympathetic association" and other standards
· mentioned in Section 8(a) (2) through (8) when the
investigation concerns an applicant or employee in the
Executive Branch of the Government.
In considering the foregoing, it should be noted
the FBI has another responsibility under EO 10450 which is
set forth in Section 5. This Section provides that
whenever there is developed or received by any department
or agency information indicating that the retention in
employment of any officer or employee of the Government
may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the
national security, such information shall be forwarded to
the head of the employing department or agency or his
representative.
Your attention is also invited to Chapter 736. of
the Federal Personnel Manual, which instructs agencies to
promptly refer to the FBI for investigation cases which
develop information indicating that a person may have been
subject to coercion, influence or pressure to act contrary
to the interests of the national security, or information on
possible disloyalty to the United States."

DATE 2/6/01 BY SPZALMKP
Reference is made to SSC letter dated February 9,
1976, requesting appropriate FBI materials describing tho
policy and procedures of the Bureau for investigations carried
out pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 10450, (enclosed), as
amended, including, but not limited to, the standards for
checking the names for Federal employees or prospective
employces in FBI files (a National Agency Check) the standards
for determining whether or not there is "derogatory information"
in the FBI files, the policies for dissemination of such infor-
mation, and the circumstances under which the FBI will conduct
its own investigation of a prospective Federal employec. Set
forth below is this Bureau's response to the requests mentioned
in referenced letter. Also enclosed are materials responsive
to the requests mentioned in referenced letter.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE FBI FOR
INVESTIGATIONS PURSUANT TO EO 10450, AS AMENDED
Executive Order (IO) 10450, as amended, came into
existence on April 27, 1953, and serves as the basic authority
under which most personnel investigations are conducted at the
present time involving applicants and employees in the
Executive Branch.
EO 10450, in its preamble, states that the interests
of the national security require all persons privileged to
be employed by the Government shall be reliable, trustworthy,

STANDARDS FOR CHECKING FBI FILES
FOR A NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK
Section 3 (a) provides that the appointment of
each civilian employee shall be made subject to investigation
but in no event shall the investigation include less than
a national agency check including a check of the fingerprint
files of the FBI.
Although the scope of a national agency check is
not defined in EO 10450, Chapter 736 of the Federal Personnel
Manual defines a national agency check as including a check
of the fingerprint files, Identification Division, FBI, and of
the investigative files of the FBI,
STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT
THERE IS "DEROGATORY INFORMATION" IN THE FBI FILES
The standards for determining what is derogatory
information is such information that shall relate, but shall
not be limited to, those facts described in subdivisions (1-2)
of Section 8 (a).
POLICIES FOR DISSEMINATION OF SUCH DEROGATORY INFORMATION
Section 5 of EO 10450 provides:
Whenever there is developed by any department or
agency information indicating that the retention
in employment of any officer or employee of the
Government may not be clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security, such informa-
tion shall be forwarded to the head of the
employing. department or agency or his represen-
tatives...
If the FBI receives information coming within the
provisions of this section, the FBI has the responsibility to
disseminate it whether it be of a suitability or loyalty
nature. Chapter 735 of the Federal Personnel Manual contains
language similar to that in Section 5. The conditions for
the types of derogatory information involved are set forth
in Section 8 (a) of the Order.

Section 8 lists the conditions for developing infor-
mation which is of investigative and, by inference, adjudicative
interest.
Section 13 states:
"The Attorney General is requested
to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice
as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain
an appropriate employee security program.

Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual instructs
that before an agency issues a letter of charges under EO 10450,
the Department of Justice shall be consulted to assure that the
rights of the employees are fully considered.
The Government Printing Office, General Accounting
Office, and Library of Congress, all in the Legislative
Branch, voluntarily participated in the loyalty program.
prescribed by EO 9835. The same agencies desired to participate
_ in the program set up by EO 10450. These agencies again,
with the approval of the Department of Justice, worked out
with the Department and with the Civil Service Commission
procedures for their participation in EQ 10450. The results
of FBI investigations under EO 10450 concerning applicants
and employees of these agencies in the Legislative Branch are
furnished to the Civil Service Commission, which in turn
furnishes the results to the designated officials in the
specific agency.
Available information indicates that difficulties.
of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security
cases are considered almost insurmountable and as a result
no removal or other adverse actions have been taken on
these grounds for several years and the adjudicative
basis has shifted from loyalty and security to suitability.
Thus, favorable determinations are said to be based on
EO 10450 while unfavorable decisions almost always rely on
the suitability provisions of Civil Service Regulations.

for Administration
Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual
instructs that before an agency issues a letter of charges
under 50 10450, the Department of Justice shall be
consulted to assure that the rights of the employees are
fully considered. Section 13 of CO 10450 requests the
Attorney General to render to the heads of departments and
agencies such advice as may be requisite to enable them to
establish and maintain an appropriate employee security
program.
Available information indicates that difficulties
of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security cases
have proved almost insurmountable and as a result no removals
or other adverse actions have been taken on these grounds for
several years and the adjudicative basis has apparently
shifted from loyalty and security to suitability.
An early response in this matter will be
appreciated.
NOTE:
We have corresponded with the Department concerning
amendments to EO 10450 by EO 11785 and requested guidelines
as to our investigations of subversive matters defined in
EO 10450 as amended by EO 11785 as none have been previously
furnished by the Department. This is necessary because the
Federal Employee Security Program depends on subversive
information originating with our subversive investigations.
The foregoing requests clarification in conflicting language
in the Department's response as to subversive investigations
and response to questions concerning the FBI's investigative
role in the above Program.
Although our original inquiry was directed to
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Department
memorandum notes Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Division, answered with concurrence of the Criminal Division.
We are, therefore, directing our request for clarification to
Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

Volume II, which contains instructions to be followed for
investigations carried out pursuant to EO 10450, as amended.
This should be referred to for an understanding of the FBI's
policy and procedures.
Section 8 (d) reads as follows :
There shall be referred promptly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation all investigations
being conducted by any other agencies which
develop information indicating that an indivi-
dual may have been subjected to coercion,
influence, or pressure to act contrary to
the interests of the national security, or
information relating to any of the matters
described in subdivisions (2) through (8)
of subsection (a) of this section. In cases
so referred to it, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation shall make a full field investigation.
Chapter 736 of the Federal Personnel Manual
instructs agencies to promptly refer to the FBI for
investigation cases "which develop information indicating
that a person may have been subject to coercion, influence,
or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national
security, or information on possible disloyalty to the
United States." This Chapter also requires that "information
as to subversive activity on the part of employees in the
Executive Branch....is referred by the employing agency.
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation" so that necessary
investigation is conducted by the FBI.
In a memorandum dated August 19, 1974, (enclosed),
to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
with a copy for the Director, Department Security Staff,
Department of Justice, reference was made to EO 11785 dated
June 4, 1974, (enclosed), which abolished the Attorney
General's list of designated organizations, one of the
standards used by the FBI in initiating investigations of
individuals pursuant to EO 10450. It was pointed out this
standard was eliminated with regard to investigations of
applicants and employees in the Executive Branch which may
be initiated by the FBI based on information in our files

as well as in evaluating requests for investigations of
individuals received from other agencies and departments
pursuant to Section 8 (d) of EO 10450. Guidelines were
requested for the use of the FBI in initiating investigations
of individuals pursuant to EO 10450 and specifically criteria
to be utilized in determining whether available information
is sufficient basis for investigation under EO 10450.
A response to these inquiries was made by the
Assistant Attorney General for Administration on November 1,
1974, (enclosed), advising that the FBI should continue to
conduct investigations to identify organizations coming
within the purview of Section B (a) (5) of EO 10450, i.e.,
organizations which: (1) unlawfully advocate or practice
the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent
others from exercising their rights under the Constitution
or laws of the United States or any State; or (2) which seek
to overthrow the Government of the United States or any
State or subdivision thereof by unlawful means. The Depart-
ment advised that if the investigation of an organization
"suggests a determination that the organization is engaged
in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities, it
should continue.
Regarding the investigation of individuals, the
Department advised that members or affiliates of organizations
described above should be investigated and the same yardstick
should be utilized as was indicated for organizations in
determining whether the investigation should continue. The
Department added, however, that "when a determination can
reasonably be made that the individual's activities, either
within the organization or as an individual, do not appear to
be in violation of any law, then the investigation should cease.
-
In a memorandum dated December 11, 1974, (enclosed)
to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration, clarifi-
cation was requested of the guidelines for investigations by
the FBI of applicants and employees in the Executive Branch
under EO 10450 since the Department's statement that the same
yardstick should be utilized in the case of organizations and
individuals appears to be at variance with that used concerning
organizations.

In reply the Deputy Attorney General on June 25,
1953, (enclosed), advised he did not believe the policy
outlined in the memorandum dated May 1, 1953, to be in
conflict with any provision of EO 10450 and saw no reason
why the FBI should not continue this policy.
The FBI has continued the practice approved in
the Department's memorandum of June 25, 1953, and by memorandum
dated January 23, 1976, to the Deputy Attorney General, the
Department was advised that this policy still continues

The memorandum pointed out that, as in the past,
these reports are furnished to the Department in order that
consideration may be given as to whether any Federal laws
have been violated and for information concerning possible
subversive infiltration into the Executive Branch of the
Government.
With regard to a determination as to whether any
Federal laws have been violated, it was noted the violations
generally involve Title 18, U.S. Code 1001, and a response is
received from the Criminal Division.
Information concerning subversive infiltration
into the Executive Branch is furnished for the Department's
assistance in discharging its responsibilities under
Section 13 of EO 10450.
The Assistant Attorney General for Administration,
by memorandum dated August 26, 1974, (enclosed), advised that
the practice as outlined in the memorandum of August 14, 1974,
satisfies the needs of the Department.
As the result of reorganization in the Department,
these reports are now sent to the Director, Security and
Administrative Services Staff.
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE FBI WILL CONDUCT ITS
OWN INVESTIGATION OF A PROSPECTIVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE
With regard to Sections 5 and 8 (a), supra, the FBI
sent a memorandum dated May 1, 1953, (enclosed), to the
Deputy Attorney General pointing out that the FBI contemplated
following the policy in existence under EO 9835 (Federal
Employee Loyalty Program) of initiating an investigation based
on available information rather than awaiting a request for
such an investigation under EO 10450 from the interested
department or agency. It was stated that if this practice
was in conflict with the provisions of EO 10450, consideration
could be given to clarification in subsequent regulations.

Supplement Number 4 (revised) of Departmental
Order 3464, signed by the Attorney General on January 13,
1953, provides that all files, documents, records and reports
in the Department of Justice shall be regarded as of a
confidential nature.
The Attorney General by memorandum dated December 5,
1947, advised the Bureau that the practice in passing along
to the various government departments and agencies information
which comes to its attention in connection with the conducting
of investigations, normally and regularly within the Bureau's
jurisdiction, is entirely appropriate and correct. The Attorney
General added that it would appear that the Bureau would be
remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information
coming to it which might prove in the interest of the general
welfare. He added that it is not the Bureau's responsibility
to determine whether the information is or is not of importance
to the particular agency in the carrying out of its current
activities and responsibility, and whether or not any action
is taken by the department or agency is not, of course, a
principal concern of the Bureau. The Attorney General advised,
therefore, that in his opinion the Bureau should continue to
pass along information, which it is believed might be of
interest to the various departments and agencies.
It should be noted that our FBI reports distributed
to outside agencies are stamped as the property of the FBI with
this additional notation," This document contains neither
recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI and is loaned to your
agency: it and its contents are not to be distributed outside
your agency."

results of investigations of individuals pursuant to EO 10450.
