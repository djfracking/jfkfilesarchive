We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement
that they have identified these people by nationality before

14
they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens
15

The

Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had
more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

Watergate' trial. Some of these allegations that came out
and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we
made file checks and this type of thing. One particular
activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller
Center in New York and it turns out it was taken out of

context. It was a training mission and

training exercise.
These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York
and they were simply asked to go into a branch of the Manhattal
Chase Manhattan and to come back out and then they were
supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some
of them meant casing the bank when in fact it was just a

12

who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths,

16
type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
17

he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double him,
19

we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever.

So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens in this
country, as
as access agents.

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a
boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations
and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,
sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in
any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever
do it on any of our boats, planes, or anything that belongs
to the Agency.
Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain
a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting
together his own crew?

Well, as I say, a lot of propaganda, press placement,
media placement.
It has been so long ago I really don't
remember. I know we had a number of things going against him.
We used suasion, moral suasion, otherwise. We did some
extra-legal things. We tried to get to his sources of supply,
particularly when they were countries that we had treaties
with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.
Q
Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said
you used moral suasion. What kind of activities are you
referring to?
A . Well, in the moral suasion field we

were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal
activities, the legal well, I don't know how you would
phrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control
regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the
Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of
Commerce, the Export Control people.
I. guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally
U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this
type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So
we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer for

sold in Africa.

were made within the United States?

No.

replacement parts manufactured that were substandard.

We had the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our
own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We
contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped
it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking
down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have
everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive
equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going to
extend the credit.
The railroad system was in total disaster. The
Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

were directly under his control. Though the organization as it
was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,
but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment,
that is why we took the smaller establishment to preserve some
SO
cover.
14.
Okay. What activities was the larger group engaged
15
in?
16.
A. Well, the larger group was engaged in the collection
of intelligence. They compiled dossiers on the principals
they kept card files on every
refugee that came through the reception center. They provided
they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a

We may assist if we are asked but the idea of the whole
airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when
you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the
Government, and normally when these refugees came in, they were
processed through the Center and then they had a place down on
Biscayne Boulevard they called. Freedom House and this was, of
course, all run by HEW, and they if need be and they had to
stay overnight or stay several days, HEW would put them up and
care for them in Freedom House.

a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those

What ere they intercepting?
A. Well, originally they were set up to assist with the
commo. for the infiltration.
As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made
available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA tasks them with
the frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications
nets they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another
important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,
sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior
network they covered too. But all electronic intercept coverage
is dictated by NSA.

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require
ments on them if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently
because the common interests,
we have a common interest in
what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular
operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubans
were doing, then we would task our people with that.
For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into
Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then
there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.
But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the
boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when
came back on the air. And this is the type of thing. As
a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200
Cuban troops.

Now, with particular reference to the last half of

sponsored by the Agency?
A.
Wellm you mean Agency sponsored fronts?
Yes.
The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to
have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-Castro
factions.
Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the
CIA was subsidizing.
Supposedly the people that joined these

And did they get funded by the Agency, then, through

These well-to-do people ostensibly would call a friendi

and say, you know, we are trying to assist these Cubans in this:
type of thing. Could your organization give us any money, and

Q. I think we covered this already just a few minutes ago
but let me make sure that we have got it on the record.
I understood you to say that it was your impression in 1963
that large numbers of Cuban exiles, Cuban people in the southern
15
United States, talked about and believed that they were involved
in the CIA sponsored activities. Is that true?

the southern United States about plans or prospects for the
assassination of Fidel Castro?
I would say no. I don't think there was
got to remember that these people were embittered. They lost
their homeland, their possessions, they lost everything and they
blamed it all on one man.
