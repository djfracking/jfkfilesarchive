b) (Jaime. DURAN Hernando]- Operational Lead only (see separate

to the APCJ's extremist "circle". He has been used with extremely
good results for information on other Cuban targets of interest.

However,
the Station is currently conducting an investigation of HELLA
in an effort to determine his vulnerability for recruitment/defection.
b) with the present ruling Dominican Triumvirate, Subject could be
arrested if no came to security notice, not only in his position
with the CIS but also if he became involved in any subversive
Communist activities. In the event he is arrested be undoubtedly

Target Analysis Summary Report
AMMUG/1 Operation
SUBJECT: Roque DALTON Garcia
I.
Significance of Target
DALTON is a recruited agent of the Cuban DGI. He has been
trained in guerrilla warfare, B/w, radio transmission,
and radio reception. AMMUG/1 claims that Subject is a
member of the Central Committee of the PCES. AMMUG/1
characterized Subject as having excellent contacts within
the DGI in Cuba. Subject is in contact with Mauricio
de la Selva Venegas, the Salvadoran intermediary, in
Mexico City. In view of the above, Subject could be
expected to furnish considerable information on both the
PCES in El Salvador and his activities for the DGI.
II. Current Location
Subject was deported from El Salvador to Mexico in late
January 1964. On 16 June 1964 Subject was spotted by the
Salvadoran National Police in San Salvador, and is now
under surveillance. Exact address will be obtained by
the San Salvadoran Station.
III. Vulnerabilities
:
AMMUG/1 lists Subject as his leading candidate for recruit-
ment by us. His reasoning on this is that Subject is not

some of his personal characteristics which have made him
a handling problem for the DGI would presumably make him
a handling problem for us. His failure to perform for
the DGI since October 1963 might mitigate against our
use of him which would include, presumably, resumption of
his s/w channel. Nonetheless, AMMUG-1's claim that Subject
is a maber of the Central Committee of the PCES (news to
us) makes him an operational target for that reason alone.

a) Connection with Cuban Intelligence Service
At this time Subject is not an agent of the Cuban Intelligence

for an eventual thrust against faiti to oust President
Francois WUVALIER.

Secretary-General of the Haitian Liberation Front, a newly formed

of Haiti. Eensitive information available at the Dear indicates
that this party is Moscow influenced.7

1. Subject could provide valuable information on the Haitian
Liberation Front, 1.e., its members, plans, status with the

Vulnerabilities (for recruitment or defection)
Mone nom. he is strongly anti-DUVALIEK.
In that many Haitian
exile circles sonenat down on the United States as a result
of the unsuccessful September 17:3 invasion of raiti, it is possible
that Subject merely turned to the "left" for assistance in overthrowing
