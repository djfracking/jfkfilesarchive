a
1953 to 1962 Intelligence with U. S. Government, Central Intelligence Agency,
CS-13, $11,415. As Chief of a small branch of highly specialized analysts, I
exercised a wide variety of talents and was responsible for the following:
the direction and administration of the branch operations; determined the course
of action for further research effort within the branch; monitored and super-
vised a program of special personnel assessment; evaluated technical analyses
and their relationship to specific cases; advised and consulted with members of
Senior Staff components of CIA; delivered numerous technical briefings to both
U. S. and foreign police and intelligence services; initiated and maintained
projects carried out by private organizations such as universities, private
consultants, and private research corporations. During the above period, I
trained and briefed numerous others engaged in police and intelligence work.
I also initiated and developed four technical systems currently in operation
on a world-wide basis within CIA and wrote numerous articles for an intelli-
gence periodical. In January 1962, CIA presentedme with one of the largest
individual Monetary Suggestion Awards ever given by that Agency.

Questioned Document Analyst (Continued)
I
December 11, 1916
b. Participated in establishing document analysis facilities in foreign governments
and present plans call for continuation of this TDY consulting and advisory
work.
Per request from Training, periodically briefs Foreign Intelligence Services and
Agency personnel. These briefings cover general capabilities of the Section and
are intended to inform the student of the question document problem.
II SUPERVISION RECEIVED:
III
The Section Chief receives technical requests directly from the customers
and advises them and the Branch Chief on the technical problems, personnel, and
other requirements for making determinations. Staff and Branch Chiefs establish
guides on administrative matters. Review of accomplishments can only be made in
the light of the customers application of evaluation results. Decisions required
as a result of Section work are usually "Eyes Only" for customers application in
offices of Senior Staffs of the major components in the Agency. The recommen-
dations for participation in setting technical standards for mechanical and per-
sonnel identification methods or in financing such activity would be evaluated on
the basis of the incumbent's evaluation of potential benefits to Agency technical
services to intelligence efforts.
QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED:
Qualifications for this position will be written in the preliminary Quali-
fication Standatds developed for the GS-1397.01, Document Analyst title, up-
graded by Civil Service Commission Hearing, to GS-14, 1958.

Subject continues to perform his duties as Supervisor of
complex A&R activities in a competent mannor. His knowledge of the chnical
aspects of his Sections' many functions help to insure a continuation of work flow
and his ability to absorb and retain technical data related to his field of endeavor
serves as an aid in the presentations of his numerous oral briefings.
One apparent weakness, which he continues to retain, is in his work
relations with technical personnel; he has a tendency to drift from main topic
under discussion to unrelated subjects, which, while they may be informative,
decreases not only the Subject's productive capability, but, also that of the
technical personnel.

-
1953 to 1962 Intelligence with U. S. Government, Central Intelligence Agency,
GS-13, $11,415. As Chief of a small branch of highly specialized analysts, I
exercised a wide variety of talents and was responsible for the following:
the direction and administration of the branch operations; determined the course
of action for further research effort within the branch; monitored and super-
vised a program of special personnel assessment; evaluated technical analyses
and their relationship to specific cases; advised and consulted with members of
Senior Staff components of CIA; delivered numerous technical briefings to both
U. S. and foreign police and intelligence services; initiated and maintained

I also initiated and developed four technical systems currently in operation
on a world-wide basis within CIA and wrote numerous articles for an intelli-
gence periodical. In January 1962, CIA presented me with one of the largest
individual Monetary Suggestion Awards ever given by that Agency.

Mr. Kimsey pоsвевses a wealth of knowledge in his technical field which, wher
skillfully and tactfully utilized, helps to increase the productive capability of his
Section's activities.
This thorough knowledge of A&R activities enables him to present his oral
briefings in an informative and interesting manner.
Subject has been downgraded in Specific Duty #1 from a "4" to a "3", The
basis for the lower rating in this category warrants the following explanation. There
have been numerous and reoccuring complaints from personnel under his supervision
that he does not display a complete respect for their professional capabilities. This
weakness has definitely decreased the morale of the personnel under his supervision.
Mr. Marzen, Chief, TSD/CARB, has discussed all areas of weaknesses with the
Ratec and pointed out how they affect the overall work aspects of this section of
TSD/GARB.

of

Subject continues to perform his duties as Supervi
complex A&R activities in a competent manner. His knowledge of the fuchnical
aspects of his Sections' many functions help to insure a continuation of work flow
and his ability to absorb and retain technical data related to his field of endeavor
serves as an aid in the presentations of his numerous oral briefings.
One apparent weakness, which he continues to retain, is in his work
relations with technical personnel; he has a tendency to drift from main topic
under discussion to unrelated subjects, which, while they may be informative,
decreases not only the Subject's productive capability, but, also that of the
technical personnel.

Fitness Report Dec 1957 Jan 1959 "...is a very competent sacerdoor from a
technical standpoint in that he has a thorough applicable knowlmire of the complex
A&R activities. In many respects this tends to contribute to his main weakness in
that he measures the potential of his personnel by his own level of proficiency rather
than a team level. This creates a situation whereby he has tendency to perform many
functions which he could delegate to his personnel." Rater, P. J. Bzozo. Reviewer,
J. F. Marzen.

Fitness Report Jan 1950 Jan 1960 "...thorough technical moledze of AÅR
activities qualifies him as a competent Supervisor. Since the last reporting period,
he has delegated more responsibilition to personnel under his supervision. This, in
effect, has increased the productive capability of his Branch." Rater, P. J. Szego.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE
1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding
employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate/
data on all personnel. The new system will aid in implementing Agency
policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel
with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It
is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics
for planning and management purposes.
2.
The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those
factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in
a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it
is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize
those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves
to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.
Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as
thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative
Officer within the time allotted.
