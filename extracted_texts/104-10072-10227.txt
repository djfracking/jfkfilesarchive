1. AMCLOCK/1 arrived in New York on 19 September 1967. He
had been given instructions to call a JMWAVE operational number
(Iden A) next time he was out in a friendly country in order to receive
contact instructions. When he failed to call soon after his arrival
it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at HTBASTE,(
same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact
instructions. For that purpose DI GERVENO was taken to HTBASTE on
21 September carrying a match folder from (Iden Bwith his alias,
and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized
DI GERVENO, who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folder
to AMⱭOCK/1 only if this could be done securely. DI GERVENO was
able to make definite visual contact on four different occasions:
once at Iden D twice at Iden E and a fourth time on the corridor
AMCLOCK/1 quickly recognized DI GERVENO
and tried to keep himself)available for a possible contact.
this was not possible and the contacts on 21 September were limited
to visual recognition only. OF TINE UNITED NATIONS

During this time the operational number of the Beekman site
(Iden G) was also manned in case AMCLOCK/1 had retained this number
and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of JMWAVE, but he
failed to call either place for contact instructions. It was then
decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at
HTBASTE. While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1 the
case officer surveilled the building where AMCLOCK/1 is staying (Iden H))
and saw him go in by himself at 1310 hours to leave his briefcase.
At 1330 hours, AMCLOCK/1 left the building alone to go for lunch and
DI GERVENO followed him. AMCLOCK/1 recognized the case officer and
after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder
to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for
the red light to change, at which time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO
that he had no way to contact him and would see him after lunch.

He hopes that in 1968 he will be assigned to another permanent post

6. In reference to his wife AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After
their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,

Regarding the trip to New York, AMCLOCK/1/ reported that with ✓
them came Iden K) a known intelligence type, and four other individuale
not known to him but believed to be intelligence/types. Later AMCLOCK/1
identified these individuals as Iden :: ::D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:N and In answer to

only a vase for (Iden P. AMCLOCK/1 is not aware if any weapons or special
instructions have been sent to (Iden in connection with racial dis-
turbances in WOLADY. The routine instructions given to Iden :) were to m
oppose LNHARP actions in HTBASTE whenever possible and to try to bring
all debatable matters to HTBASTE, where they have better support. (RAY MISS,

8. AMCLOCK/1 was not seen going in or out of the room and the
meeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-
tions. DI GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/1 and
their relations remained most cordial throughout the meeting. Only
DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present.
Finances
9. DI GERVENO was careful not to mention salary payments to
AMCLOCK/1 who is not aware of his salary increase to $1,000 a month
effective 1 January 1966. However, he requested $500 to buy books
and baby items for his daughter. DI GERVENO told him that he would
bring him the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1
will be T/A'd to JMWAVE together with the agent's signed receipts.
Intelligence Production
10. Although most of the meeting was used to discuss operational
matters, AMCLOCK/1 reported disseminable information on the following
requirements given in DIRECTOR 37960.
a. Present actitude of the PBRUMEN government towards the
United States: expectation of a military attack on
PBRUMEN supported by the United States; formal military
training being given to all PBRUMEN army officials

3. On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
at (Iden B AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had
nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for
his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press
the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman
site and of the Base in New York (Iden 1)) and told he could always call
there if he could not locate DI GERVENO at Iden B. He was also given
JMWAVE for emergency contact. AMCLOCK/1 said he tried to
make contact by calling Iden J to inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name,
but after much probing he was told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and
was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning
to call Washington at a later day if he had not been contacted.

5. AMCLOCK/1 réported that he has had no security problems and
has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by
the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats.
diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer
allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs
and he had to arrange for the maintenance of his house, which was given
to him and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes
that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through
a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing
to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again is strong

Operational Chronology
1. On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to
1530 for lunch at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering
or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought
up from the restaurant downstairs. The meeting was conducted under
secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and
DI GERVENO were present at the meeting. ESCOBAR (201-749244)

AMCLOCK/1/reported that he had been assigned to work in

from PBRUMEN, (Iden C. told AMCLOCK/1 to watch out for Iden B who is a
member of the intelligence service and will be reporting on AMCLOCK/1.

bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.

Regarding the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic
personnel abroad, AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up
taking place in the Foreign Ministry. He regarded these changes
as a routine matter in accordance with their policy to bring back
to PBRUMEN for a a reorientation tour all those diplomats stationed
abroad fox three consecutive years or more. AMCLOCK/1 actually

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned
about it. However, if this is true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be
reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time.
A.
When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the
recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following
information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his
return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during
which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job
assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to

Foreign Ministry. Consequently, after his vacation AMCLOCK/1 want
