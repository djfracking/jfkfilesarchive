(b) PI/OPD notes that while the project review pre-
sents a clear picture of the aims and objectives of the
various segments, it does not provide, except in the
case of SCANTLING, detailed indication of the value or
usefulness of the other segments, particularly the photo-
graphic activity. FI/OPS requests that the Station pro-
vide such an appraisal during the first quarter of 1960.
FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be
reviewed from the standpoint of value and usefulness with
a view to determining whether the LILYRIC activity could
not be safely eliminated and the additional photographic
coverage conducted on a more selective bacis, without
materially affecting overall usefulness. FI/OPS notes
that, in the absence of further proof of usefulness,
color photography and moving pictures appear to be an
unnecessary luxury. FI/OPS commends the careful handling
of the CLACKSTT segment and requests that the next project
action include examples of the team's progress.

1. It is requested that approval be granted to give Oliver G. SCANTLING a
special benefit of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs in the event of
loss of life or total disability if incurred in the performance of duty. This
benefit was included in a contract prepared in the field and signed by Subject on
15 February 1957. The contract was not submitted to Headquarters for approval
until December 1958. The Station and WH Division do not want to delete this
benefit from Subject's contract at this time and we feel Subject deserves this
benefit.
2. SCANTLING, a civil engineer, is a Mexican citizen, who is 40 years old.
He was granted an Operational Approval on 2 December 1954. SCANTLING began his
employment with NUSARK as a footman on the LIPSTICK physical surveillance team and
gradually became a driver of a surveillance automobile, then team leader. As team
leader he was responsible for the operational deployment and administrative direction
of the entire LIPSTICK team, three automobiles, four photographic and radio dispatching
basehouses and the attendant mobile and stationary radio equipment. He collated the
fragmentary surveillance reports into finished intelligence reports for study by the
Case Officer. SCANTLING developed into a fine investigator and has obtained infor-
mation where other Station investigative ascots have failed.
1
3. Almost all of SCANTLING's time now is spent following up leads obtained
from telephone intercepts and photographic surveillances. From July through
December 1958 he made approaches to individuals performing services for the Sovict.
Embassy and he made a detailed casing report of the West German Embassy. In addition,
he conducted nary routine investigations and surveillances. The Station plans to
have SCA: TLING attempt to recruit the landlord of the proposed basehouse for a
LINIMENT (FI/D) operation. SCANTLING no longer handles the surveillance team and the
Station plans to continue to use him as an independent asset. SCANTLING has in his
possession official credentials of the Federal Security Police (DFS). He has used
these credentials in making contacts with targets of various sensitive Headquarters'
operations (i.e., LCMAYFOWL).
4. As a graduate engineer who has spent at least ten years in house construction
in Mexico, he has been invaluable to the Station in submitting detailed casing reports,
including detailed and professional plans of technical targets. He has been commended
by TSS for the support role he has played for them. He has submitted several casing
reports on the Soviet Embassy and is an unparalleled source of information to the
Station for information about the Embassy's construction activities, modifications
and reasons for same,

27 March 1959
1. The attached project, originating in the WH Division, provides the
services of a surveillance activity to support Mexico City operations and
is approved for the period 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959. It is
presented for your approval of amendment to include the addition of a con-
tract agent, Louise J. MACRINO, to furnish administrative support, and also
to formalize a special commitment made to one of the two principal agents,
Oliver G. SCANTLING. A contract prepared in the Field and signed by the
agent permits the payment of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs
in event of loss of life or total disability if incurred in the performance
of duty. This has not previously been included in the project.
2. The LISMPTY project has authorization for the expenditure of
$95,380. No additional funds are required for the amendment. Sufficient
funds remain in the project to absorb the salary expenses for MACRINO and
funds to cover the extra year's salary for SCANTLING will not be requested
until such time as they are needed.
3. Memoranda prepared in the WH Division supporting the request for
amendment are attached, summarizing the important factors involved. These
detail SCANTLING's performance and provide a resume of MACRINO's past activ-
ities in behalf of the Agency.
4. Staff Components have concurred in amendment to Project LIEMPTY.

Name:
J. B. Brady
Room:

Date: 23 June 1959
1. It is requested that approval be granted to amend Raymond H. GERENDE' 8
contract to provide him with a termination settlement of one month's salary for
each full year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July
1959 from $4,030 to $4,560.00 per year. His last salary increase was granted on
1 September 1957. The date, 18 March 1955, has been suggested by the Station as
the beginning date for the computation of GERUNDS's termination benefits. The
Station believes that this benefit will provide GERENDE with the necessary
incentive to make KUBARK a career and at the same time will give the Station an
additional element of control.
2. As pointed out in the LIEPTY Project Approval, GERWANDE, an indigenous
agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. He has a responsible full
time job as the LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYNIC and
LICALLA base houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing
and translation service and all the agents participating in these activities.
He performs his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his
already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.
3. Money was already allocated in the LIEPTY Project approval for the
salary increase. With the effective date of 13 March 1955, for the termination
clause, GERENS will already have accrued 1,520 (his salary is $4,560 per year)
if he should resign today. The LIEMPTY Project, as approved, has sufficient
funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the
present Project year. Therefore, no additional funds are requested.

'
1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented
'for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959. The project provides for the development of operational
information through physical and photographic surveillance operations in
support of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at
Soviet personnel and installations. Previously these operations were con-
ducted for the most part under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY. They are
incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 compromise of
LIPSTICK and to accomplish a more orderly administration of certain opera-
tional support assets.
2. Authority is requested to obligate $95,380 from the DD/P-WH
Division operating budget: $65,580 for the current fiscal year and
$29,800 in fiscal year 1960, subject to the availability of funds. These
estimates include: (a) funds for the compensation of the presently-
recruited fifteen action and support agents, six new agenta, and two
principal agenta: Raymond H. GERENDE (p) (LIEMPTY/1, formerly LIPSTICK/20)
and Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) (LIEMPTY/2, formerly LIPSTICK/19); (b) funds
for the compensation, travel, allowances and Headquarters' training of two
contract agents, Simon D. CLACKETT (p) and Wilma J. FIORDALISI (p), his wife,
who are hereby transferred from Project LIMESA; (c) funds for operational
expenses and equipment, including the purchase of four new or used vehicles
as replacements for previously authorized vehicles and their maintenance,
and a CP vehicle for SCANTLING; (d) the rent, utilities and maintenance of
safehouses; and, (e) other appropriate operational expenses.
3. The attached Meld Project Outline, a covering memorandum from the
Division, and an addendum to the Project Outline, review the personnel assets
and facilities transferred from the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY operations following
the partial compromise of LIPSTICK in June 1958 and describe the concept of
the physical and photographic surveillance operations to be conducted under
this project directed primarily at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. These
surveillances provide photographs and other operational data of persons entering
and leaving the building or present in the garden area, and through additional
foot and mobile surveillances, investigative information concerning their
contacts and destinations. Agent personnel, particularly the principal egents,
are used also to conduct separate investigations, make recruit-approaches to

5. For your information there is attached the Station's review of SCANTLING
for the period July through December 1958. It is believed you will find this report
of interest and further support the justification outlined above for the granting to
SCANTLING of the special death and disability benefit. This agent assessment states
"Oliver 0. SCANTLING has continued to perform his assigned tasks in an outstanding
manner. SCANTLING's poise, common sense, education, ideology, and native ability
for the pursuit of clandestine activities make him one of the most valuable support
assets available to the Mexico City Station. The fact that SCANTLING has a full
time overt occupation as Chief Engineer and Production Manager for a local manu-
facturing company adds to his long-range potential as & KUPARK agent". SCANTLING
has excellent cover as half-owner of a local firm which manufactures farm instru-
ments and he represents the high calibre of person which KUBARK requires for the
institution of their long-term resident agent progran,
6. The LIEMPTY Project (now approved for $95,380) will not be amended at this
tige to includo an extra year's salary for SCANTLING (34,000). In the event it
becomes necessary to fulfill this commitment during the project year, and if the
expense cannot be absorbed by the present project authorization, an amendment will
be submitted.
7. It is also requested that effective 1 March 1959 the LIEMPTY Project be
amended to include Louise J. MACKINO, a Contract Agent, who is a Station support
asset. Her OA was reinstated on 8 August 1958 (C-4152). She was formerly included
under Project LIFEAT. However, the Station requirements for general translation
work increased to the extent that it was necessary to use MACRINO to translate reports
other than those originating from LIFEAT. It was therefore decided it would be mora
appropriate to include her under LIEMPTY. She does typing of reports and non-sensitivo
translations. She is paid on an hourly basis of $2.00, an estimated yearly salary of
$3,500. The Station stated that the present LISMPTY Project could absorb the expanse
of her salary for the remainder of the Project year.

individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooms, and apartments and
perform other support activities. The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITED,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, have been in operation for almost three years without
having been in any compromising situations insofar as the Station knows.
The LIPSTICK unit, a panel truck equipped with cameras, etc., is considered
a particularly valuable asset by the Field. As a replacement for a staff
agent, Wilfred 0. CLOWER (p), who directed and trained the LIPSTICK surveil-
lance team, the husband and wife team of CLACKETT and FİORDALISI are proposed
as qualified individuals to recruit, train, and direct the new LIEMPTY_sur-
veillance team and maintain its records. Appropriate notional cover was
arranged for them while in their previous project, LINESA, as they reside in
Mexico under true names. One of the principal agents, GERENDE, will have no
contact with the new surveillance team, but will be used to conduct special
investigations, counter-surveillances, and for other support activities.
4. The CI Staff comments that LIEMPTY provides several types of physical
surveillance, all of which provide information of CI interest, and as a support
mechanism, a production review is not appropriate cr_necessary. The CI Staff
states further, that with the compromise of the LIPSTICK surveillance team
the Mexico City Station lost its only reliable and efficient surveillance team,
LIEMPTY representing the Station's effort to replace that asset. Because of
the great number of CI targets in Mexico City, the CI Staff belleves it is
essential that the Station be given the opportunity, through this project, to
build another surveillance team capable of operating against sensitive targets.
Additionally, the CI Staff believes the case officer should work at devising
ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will stand the scrutiny of
friends, relatives and less friendly forces.
5. PI/OPS suggests that the Division consider a gradual reduction of the
considerable financial and personnel commitments in this project in view of
the favorably developing LIENJOY liaison relationship. FI/CPS believes that
a smaller, more manageable support group, with greater Station emphasis on
selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective CI and
FI productivity.

Termination Request.

Amendment and
1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted as the
LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in 1958 to provide
financial and materiel support for visual and photographic
surveillance operations targetted against the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.
2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the ADDO in
the amount of $19,000 for FY-72 and $20,000 for FY-73.
Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated 30 June 1972, the ADDO approved
Amendment No. 1 to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of
$9,844 for FY-72 to provide for costs of agent terminations.
3. The decision to terminate all agents and facilities
under the KDFACTOR Project was based on a security review
of the project activities which indicated that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance sites,
and probably the true names and former cryptonyms of the
agents covered by the project.
-
4. The costs of terminating all the agents in the KDFACTOR
Project amounted to $15,573.00 which was considerably more
than had been initially estimated when Amendment No. 1 for
FY-72 was requested and approved. The total amount charged
to the KDFACTOR Project in FY-72 was $36,090 which is $7,246
over the project's authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating agents and facilities associated
with the KDFACTOR Project; the effective date of all termi-
nations was 30 June 1972.

Request for Amendment to LIEMPTY Project
It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project approval request be
amended to include Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) and wilma J. FIOREALISI (ps),
U. S. citizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the
Staff Agent written into the field project outline. At the same time it is
requested that the LIMBEA Project be amended to delete these contract
agents from the latter project.
2. CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are now approved under the LIMESA Project.
They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIMESA base-.
house. Because of the sensitivity of the operation and the equipment to be
installed in the basehouse Headquarters decided U. S. citizens should be
used. The Station said appropriate documentation and backstopping could
be secured for those agents so they could be given false identities under
which they could live while they occupied the basehouse,
3. MEXI-2777 (IN 26519), of 14 November 1958, notified Headquarters
that security factors and difficulty in obtaining adequate documentation
and backstopping precluded the use of U. S. citizens under LIMESA and re-
quested permission to use indigenous agents for this operation. After dis-
cussions between John BRADI, Chief of the Mexican desk, with the LIMESA /
LIEMPTY Case Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representa-
tives of F/D, OC, ISS. and WH at Headquarters, Headquarters concurred in
the field's operational decision to use indigenous agents in the LIMESA
Project. CLACAETT and FIORDALISI received only a very superficial briefing
regarding the LIMESA Project. It is not believed Subject's limited know –
ledge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard.
40 Construction on the LIMEST houses is being kept about two weeks
from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited. The
delay in completion is normal because all construction money in Mexico has
become extremely tight because of the recent presidential inauguration.
5. The Station believes CLACKETT will be an excellent replacement for
Wilfred O. CLO.ER (ps), former Staff Agent under Project LIPSTICK, who
directed and trained that surveillance team. CLACKETT has shown a remarkable
aptitude for clandestine operational activity and surveillance and investi-
gative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in under-
taking this assignment for KUB.FK. The Station needs a good bilingual agent
to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical, surveil-
lance team under LlEMPTY.
6. Clearances and Contacts: CLACKETT was granted a PCSA on 23 July 1958.
A POA/CA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 August 1958. FIORDALISI
was granted an OA for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958. Requests have
been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIEMPTY, CLACKETT
and FIORDALISI have signed contracts effective 1 September 1958. The
sensitivity of the LIMESA Project required them to leave their young son in

the United States. Because of this a special benefit of periodic trips to
their home in Arizona was included in their contracts. Under LINESA their
quarters were to be provided. An amendment has been requested to their
contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters
allowances.
7. Notivation and Control: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are extremely.
patriotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to under-
take the LINESA Project and be separated from their son. They have indi-
cated they are more than willing to do whatever is requested of them, no
matter, what personal sacrifices and hardships are required. Their com-
plete livlihood is dependent on their USR income.
8. Tasks: CLACKETT will recruit, train, and direct the LIEMPTY
surveillance team. The Station hopes to develop this team into a major
Station support asset. He will receive instructions and direction from the
Station Case Officer. FIORDALISI will be used to do all the clerical and
administrative work for the LIENFIY surveillance team.
9. Communication and Contect: CLACKETT will contact the Station Case
Officer in a clandestine manner. All necessary security precautions will be
taken. CLACKETT will also contact his surveillance agents under a cover
which will be determined later by the Station and CLACKETT. In view of his
Mexican background, CLACKETT can pass as a Mexican. Details of communication
and contact arrangements with KGBASK will be arranged by the Station. Under
LIEMPTY CLACKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now con-
tacted by under LIMESA. CLACHETT and FIORDALISI will be in direct contact
with relatives and friends in the United States. The cover company has,
until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency
messages.
10. Cover: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI entered Mexico on United States
documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under
true name. CLACKETT has a notional cover as a public relations consultant
which was established by CCD/NC to use with friends and relatives in the U. S.
The same cover story can be adopted to cover their proposed use under WIIMPTY
vis-a-vis their United States friends. The Station is working on local cover
for CLACHETT to use in Mexico.
11. Anticipated Costs: It is anticipated that the following expenses
will be incurred by CLACKETT and FICADALISI:

MEMORANDUM FOR: FI/OPS-Projects Branch
SUBJECT
1. Justification for Automobiles under Project LIEMPTY
:
1. It is requested that the Mexico City Station be authorised-to
purchase three used sedans for use by the LIEMPTY surveillance team. The
Station plans to expand the LIENPTY surveillance team into a larger, well-
trained physical surveillance asset. They will need three automobiles.
Private automobiles or commercial transportation will not be satisfactory
since the cars must be outfitted with two-way radios.
2. Authority is also requested to purchase a panel truck to be used
in the LIENTRAP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-
graphic surveillances.
3. It is also requested that a quasi-personal car be authorised for
Oliver G. Scantling (ps). Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral
contract. A car is a prerequisite for his work for KUBARK which includes
casings, surveillances, and investigations. Because of the sensitive
nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has
decided that Scantling should be furnished a QP car,
4. LIEMPTY agents were formerly carried under the LIJERSEY and
LIPSTICK Projects. The vehicles used by the LIEMPTY agents under these
other Projects will be disposed of and new ones will be purchased after
the above TVA has been approved. The vehicles which will be replaced
are MV 2148, MV 2147, MV 2138, and MV 2041. One of the surveillance
cars will be new and will not replace an old car. It was decided that
these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIEMPTY
Project for security reasons and because of the age of the automobiles.
The automobiles are 1951 and 1952 modals and have been used for sensitive
surveillance work for over two years. The panel truck which was used in
the LIENTRAP Operation under the LIPSTICK Project has been operating for
two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The
fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance team knows that the truck exists,
even to the point that one of the team members is the listed owner of the
truck, also dictates replacement of this vehicle.

5. All agent terminations were accomplished in an
amicable manner. No visible security risks were apparent
at the time of the terminations although any one, or all
of the terminationed agents may at some future date decide
to divulge to an interested party the details of the
KDFACTOR Project operations. KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5
have worked in photo surveillance operations for the
Station since 1957 and, therefore, obviously have consider-
able knowledge of targets, former safesites, personnel, and
modus operandi of the Station. However, since the KDFACTOR
Project was not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station relations
with the Mexican Government in the event of exposure of the
KDFACTOR Project operations by a terminated agent are within
acceptable limits.
6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project be amended
to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY-72 to cover the costs of
terminating five agents and two basehouse surveillance
sites covered by this project.
7. It is also requested that the termination of the
KDFACTOR Project be approved effective 30 June 1972.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT:
KDFACTOR Project Amendment and Termination
1. The KDFACTOR Project, which provided photographic
surveillance from two vantage points of the Soviet compound -
in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the
VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated in July
1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until
January 1973 because it was necessary to sell one and the
termination of the second was tied to the termination of
KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary
to pay rent for several extra months until these other
términations could be effected.
2. The base houses and agents have now all been ter-
minated and the Station already has rented a replacement
safehouse with new agents to provide the same coverage
(KDALCOVE).
3. Approval of the amendment and termination of
Project KDFACTOR is recommended.

Security Review of Project KDFACTOR
8 - MAY 1972
1. At the time you approved the renewal of Project
KDFACTOR in December 1971 you asked that the Station
conduct an updated security review of this operation,
which provides photographic surveillance of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City. You asked that particular atten-
tion be paid to terminated agents and their families.
The Station has made a security review and a detailed
report on the findings, from Chief, WH Division, is
attached.
2. The report discusses the history of the opera-
tion, describes security problems of the past and steps
taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and
operational situation of the agents presently covered
by the project. The report notes that the two opera-
tional sites and their associated agents are compart-
mented from each other and that processing the film is
now being done inside the Station. One section of the
report discusses in detail the assets who were formerly
involved in these operations but have been terminated.
The final section of the report describes current secu-
rity practices and notes that an alternate photographic
surveillance site has been procured and is available
for use should the present one be compromised.
3. The report demonstrates that the security of
the operation is being kept up to high standards and
that there are no potential security threats from
former agents that the Station is not aware of. The
FI Staff believes that the Station's security review
and the attached report satisfy the requirements of
your request.

: ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated
14 December 1971
1. In response to reference the following is a summary of the
KDFACTOR security review:
The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows:
"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have
all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-
tion of their work for us. As an additional safeguard, the
KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that
either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence".
The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security
is sound. In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR
photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational
activities. Terminated assets could possibly expose the existence

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owner, KDABBEY-1. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-
veillance.
Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the
same view. In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP
coverage of Soviet vehicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970, soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December
1969.
The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY)
film take is now being done by the Station. In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated
amicably in early 1971. The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly
LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-1 for
the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly
by KDABBEY-1 but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-
house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the
KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by
KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in
maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses.
The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on KDABBEY-1's property
when it was active.
The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) KDFACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KDFACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING,
Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR
Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties
are owned by KDABBEY-1, who is witting of the locations and general
activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses..
3. Agents and Case Officers presently active in the KDFACTOR

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters
review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY-1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtful that KDABBEY-l's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities.
2. A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:
The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIJERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's. In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.
These assets were consolidated with one photo base house against the Soviet
Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into a new
project (LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIEMPTY
Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo
basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.
In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any
of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations. (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence.)
The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution. In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

KDFACTOR basehouses.
Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,
the KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance
of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-
old son who lives with them in the basehouse. Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities. LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and
have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives.

Changes:
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-1 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the RED TOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce R. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.
Accomplishments:
1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-,
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and IDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project.” Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

The KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-5, his
wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.
The SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station. The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation. KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by
LIEMPTY-12, a U., S. "citizen with a private company in Mexico City who
is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and
no threat to KDFACTOR security.
4. Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:
A. Raymond H. GERENDE
GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station
intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities.
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent. In 1969, after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H. FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back. The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-
tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement.
There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968. A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation. It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet investigation of GERENDE had proceeded. Nechiporenko
was PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971. GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.
B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)
KDFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDFACTOR
Project. She was terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim. After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment. In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Agency contacted
KDFACTOR-7's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State at the Embassy. It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as
such exposure could jeopardize her job. The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background.
C. KDFACTOR-1
KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project). KDFACTOR-1

There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking
out the LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions concerning
LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed
interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the
KDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-
house keepers by name. Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6. KDADAGE-10, of unknown
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard
it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED base house because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968. It is believed
this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current
KDFACTOR assets.
5. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:
The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they have been throughout the history of the
Project. The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly
with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with
KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE basehouse. In these
meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries
and handles miscellaneous administrative matters. These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup points are changed
regularly. Meeting time is kept to a minimum and meetings are pre-
scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in
the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling
over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office
darkroom. The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;
however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse
can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT
Project as residents. This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife,
LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister, KDFACTOR-1 was terminated
in March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by
KDFACTOR-1 is now done in the Station. The termination was amicable
and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-l's medical
practice expanded. There does not appear to be any security problem
in the termination of KDFACTOR-1 as he is discreet and also a close
relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-l's
medical office was good as KDFACTOR-l's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-
´ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.
D. LIEMPTY-5
LIEMPTY-5 was hired by the Station in 1957 to assist
KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films. She is the sister
of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1. She was terminated along with
KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971. Due to her close relationship with GERENDE
and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.
E. Oliver G. SCANTLING
SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station
agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971.
SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the
Station in recent years largely because his strong motivation to work
against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team
leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project
from 1958 through 1966. He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up
principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable,
and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR
Project.
:
F. LIEMPTY-6
LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station
asset, was retired in May 1968. He had manned the LIMITED photo base-
house with his wife and son assisting him. He had been working with the
Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency.
LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the
names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses.
While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities
up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on
his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-
in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

These photographs and reports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.
Costa:
1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and
$20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested ·
that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of
$4,260 to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR-1 and
KDFACTOR-7.
2. Source of Funds: Project KDFACTOR is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's Operational Program in the
amount of $23,735 for FY 1972 and $24,182 for FY 1973.

1.
CURRENT OBJECTIVES
A.
The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity through stat konary/mobile photo-
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms.
Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms, and personnel are as follows:
B.
3
1.
To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of FJSTEAL personnel,
particularly those individuals of intelligence interesi,
as well as information on the FJSTL physical plant and
FJSTEM,
visitors to the premises.
2.
To collect operational information on persons associated
with FIST-A personnel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the PISTAL intelligence services
or other hostile pro pts which are falmical to the interests
of INFORT.
5.
proips
To provide operational support, counter surveillance,
and/or other protective services to FIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be
deemed necessary.
The above objectives are to be filled through continued
maintenance and exploitation es the LILYRIC and LICALLY base-
houses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the Services of long-time
contract agent, Raymond H. G.R.ND, The LLEMPTY Project is the
cornerstone of the Station's operational progran against the
EJSTRAL target and as such is completely responsive to Priority A-1
of the Station's Operating Directive.
C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LISHPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfill-
ment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for
coverage of various targets falling within the above cited tramework.

·
1. The major change during the preceeding period has been
the closing of the LIMITED basehouse and the termination of
LIEMPTY- This has resulted in considerable financial
saving with no loss in efficiency--to the contrary, as a
matter of fact. The major reason for the change was the
fact that 1.TEMPTY- was growing less reliable with age. He
was not always able to be on the job, and when he was, his
Fixed surveillance reporting was occasionally inaccurate,
and his photography was often poor. There had been
considerable overlap between LILYRIC and LIMITED reporting,
and with the closing of LIMITED, the LILYRIC working hours
were extended slightly so that full working hours of the
FJSTEAL installation continued to be covered. The only
disadvantage to this arrangement is that the vantage point
of the FJSTEML installation which had been shared by
LIMITED and LILYRIC will now go uncovered during periods of
annual leave by LILYRIC personnel (the LILYRIC personnel
are all members of one family and normally take their
leave together).

refinements described in the previous Project Cutline have
been effective and have been maintained. The same can be
said of LIENTRAP, which has become a much more flexible
tool since its partial integration into the LIEMBRACE team.
There have been no changes in 1.ILYRIC procedures, other
than expansion of coverage to include the entire working
week.

LIEMPTY-9 was granted a salary increase, effective
1 May 1988, In recognition of his excellent job performance.
LIEMPTY-14 and -27 were granted salary increases on 1 May 1968,
largely as compensation for the extra hours they agreed to put
in to insure full-time coverage of the FJSTEAL installation by
LILYRIC. Memoranda of Oral Agreement covering these three salary
increases were forwarded with HMMA-34573, 2 May 1968.
Finally,

1.
During the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic unit covered 40 photographie assignments in
support of Mexico City Station's FJSTEAL, PERUMEN, and
Communist Party operations. An average of two to three days
is spent on each assigned target, usually rotating the time
of day the coverage is provided. The LIENTRAP operators,
LIEMPTY-10 and -11. have consistently turned in a useful
and excellent quality photographic product.

2. In addition, while not on an assignment, both operators
have regularly assigned duties. LIENGTY-10 has the responsi-
bility for obtaining, renewing, and servicing most of the
Station's accommodation addresses. The addresses are
serviced three times a week. LIEMPTY-11 has been serving
part-time for the past year as the seventh member of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team and has performed well in this.

LIEMPTY Principal Avent
During the period under review, Raymond B. GRENDE continued in
his role as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent. GERENDE operates
as the full-time cut-out to the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling responsibility
for the related personnel. In addition, GGENDE continued to
bear the contact and handling responsibilities for the operator
of the LIEMPTY photographic developing/processing laboratory,
LIEMPTY-4. GERENDE's overall operational assignment involved
at least 10 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meetings with the LIEPTY Project case officer. It should also
be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential contributions
to the sensitive JMROD operation and assisted the Station greatly
with his detailed area knowledge in many instances. He is used
to make independent investigations and neighborhood checks. HA

1. As noted above, LIEMPTY-6 was terminated effective
31 May 1968 in connection with the closing of the LIMITED
bagehouse. Termination was completely amicable, and
LIEMPTY- received a generous termination bonus.
2. LIEMPTY-26 was hired as of 1 May 19.8 to help LILYRIC
personnel maintain their expanded coverage. No security
factor is involved, as LIFEPTY-23 is part of the same family
as the rest of the LILYRIC personnel. LIEMPTY-2 had been
granted an OA in 1965 and had been used sporadically since
that time.
3. An amendment to GERENDE's contract has been requested.
This amendment would guarantee GERENDE termination benefits
equal to those provided for by Mexican law, in the event of
GERINDE'S termination by WOFIRM. The amendment would also
provide GERENDE with a graduated scale of benefits should
he decide to resign. See HNMA-36312, 27 January 1969, for
details.
3.
EFFECTIVENESS
Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the
1ulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico
City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
01 each component are cited below:
A. Fixed Pasehouses
1.
LIMITED
Until its termination, the LIMITED installation provided daily
photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main
gate of the FJSTEAL installation. During the seven-month
period from 1 November 1967 through 31 May 1968, the LIMITED
base provided 911 frames of operational photographs. In
addition, the LIMITED base provided over 1,000 pages of
physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYRIC
•
During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FJSTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base-
house provided the majority of the operational photographs
produced by the LIEMPTY Project. During the 13-month period
from 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, the LILYRIC
basehouse provided 15,331 operational photographs and several

thousand pages of physical surveillance reports covering the
daily movements of all FJSTRAL officers. As a specific
example of the importance of LILYRIC coverage, it was LILYRIC
photes which made possible the identification of a WCLADY
citizen who had been in clandestine contact with an AEGRIP
officer. This information was turned over to LNERGO, which
was pursuing the case. In general, LILYRIC provides the
Station with a large percentage of the CI raw material
collected on the FJSTEAL target, such as automobile license
numbers, PCS and TDY arrivals and departures, unusual
activities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy
absences of personnel, etc. This information also has
positive operational value, but its most important use is as
the major source of identification of FJSTEAL personnel and
of information on their movements. The Station has frequent
requests from LNERGO which can only be fulfilled by LIEMPTY
coverage, and this "permanent and complete record" of FJSTEAL
activities is invaluable for servicing the CE requirements
of both OFIRM and LNERGO.
3.
LICALLA
-
During the above cited 13-month period, the LICALLA installation
provided photographic and physical surveillance coverage of
the back of the FIST:AL installation and its garden and
patio area, This coverage provided 5,125 individual photographs
as well as numberous surveillance and observation reports.
These reports included daily, weekly, and monthly summaries
of activities, semi-monthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL
personnel), various special reports, and special intensive
ceverage of targets selected by the Station. It should be
noted that the LTCALLA basehouse allows Station Mexico City
te et serve the MUST personnel during their off-duty and
recreational bours, The LICALLA installation has become
the nest valuable of the basehouses, not only because of its
unique vantage point hat also because of the perceptiveness
of ITBYTY-D. His Serveillance reports have frequently given
es valuable losight into personal associations among the
INSTIAL personnel and have enabled us to introduce greater
flexibility and effectiveness into the entire LIETY operation.
LICALLY reporting has the greatest positive operational
value since it provides raw material for use in target
selection. Finally, the LICALLY OP is occasionally used in
.
support of various technical operations conducted from the
LISA complex,

Summary of Fixed Paschouse Effectiveness
The fixed LIMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA, and LILYRIC)
provided approximately 21,267 individual cranes of operational
photographs during the 13-month period reviewed above. This
photographie coverage, linked with the physical surveillance
reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a most
reliable and viable tool for:

assisted the Station in its MHRAVEL program. As a part of the
Station's effort to orcaden GEREND's horizons and to take better
advantage of his capabilities, GERENDY was made the handling
officer for ERFAIN-3 under close case officer supervision,
Similar tasks are envisioned for GEREND in the future--agent
handling as well as the spotting and assessment of operational
leads. These tasks are all assigned with due regard for
GERENDE's primary responsibilities, with the aim of getting the
optimum use out of a capable and experienced field contract
agent.
Overall Effectiveness
As outlined above, each individual operational component of the
LIEVPTY Project, with the exception of the phased-out LIMITED
basehouse, contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfill-
ment of Station Mexico City's operational program. Based on the
continued excellent performance of Project personnel and the
overall contributions of this Project, the Station strongly
recommends that this Project be continued during the forthcoming
Project year as an essential element of the Station's operational
support apparatus.
4.
PROBLEMS AND SECURITY
During the Project year under review there were no known incidents
which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY or the
related personnel. The termination of LIMMPTY- caused no problems,
nor did the construction of a maid's room on the root of the LICALLA
installation, adjacent to LIEMPTY-9's photo point. There is no
indication that FJSTEAL personnel had any suspicions about the
construction work. The exposure of a LIEMBRACE surveillance
vehicle (see MEXICO CITY 9283, 28 February 1929) caused momentary
concern because the vehicle had been bought from a dealer where
LIEMPTY-9 has a part-time job. Along with all other employees
of the auto dealer, LIEPTY-9 was questioned about the purchaser
of the car. While LIEMPTY-9 was worried because he knew the
purchaser of the car and was able to guess what had happened,
the investigation was dropped and the case closed without any
adverse effect on LIEMPTY-9 or the LICALLA basehouse.

non-LIEMPTY-oriented operational activity by GERENDE, there are
no significant operational changes contemplated. LIEMPTY is
a project designed to support the Station's RDTOP program and
is useful only as long as it supports that program effectively.
The Station believes that the support has been eftective, and
that the product of the operation is valuable. Occasional miner
changes will undoubtedly be made in response to specific
requirements and to continual efforts toward improvement, but
continuing emphasis on the FJSTEAL target for the foreseeable
future means, among other things, that the LIEPTY Project, in
essentially its present form, will continue to be a necessary part
of the Station's program.

B. No need for expansion, in terms of personnel or facilities,
is forescen, but costs will probably climb slowly but steadily
to permit salary increases and to keep up with the rising cost
of living as it affects utilities and supplies. Replacement er

It is requested that Project LI:MPTY be approved

represents roughly a 10 percent Jecrease tron the amount
programmed for the previous Project year). While no large
expenditures are anticipated for the replacement of photographic
equipment, during the forthconing period, inflation may result
in rising cost of utilities and supplies, and salary increases
may be granted as indicated above. 1. detailed breakdown of

KMERGENCY CONDITIONS
J.
In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIEWPTY agents via Raymond II.
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.
B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active Project agents,
However, under these circumstances, it is highly probable that
the activities of this Project would be somewhat curtailed,
c.
:
Revised and up-dated emergency contact plans for use with
Raymond H. GEREND: and Oliver G. SCANTLING are on tile in the
Station and at Headquarters (see A-28533, dated 21 February
1965 and HMMA-28253, dated 9 February 1966).

Supplementary Appropriation for LIEMPTY
It is requested that the figures in the attached
field project renewal be amended and that an additional
$26,205 be approved to cover the period 1 December 1968
through 30 June 1969 in order to carry the LIEMPTY Project
to the end of a fiscal year. This sum is identical to that
requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no
present justification for projecting any change in the
financial requirements. The supplement would bring the
cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

Changes:
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Socurity and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-1 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD_departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.
Accomplishments:

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT
: LIEMPTY Project Renewal
•
1. Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period 1 Decem-
ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520
is hereby requested. $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and
$17,315 in FY 1969. The project was budgeted for $45,000 for
FY 1968; funds are available within the Division. Estimated
costs for the coming project year are a little less than the
amount programmed for the previous year and a little more
than what was actually disbursed.
3. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three
nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance
and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic
surveillance are carried out by experienced personnel. The
project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes
the photographs. In addition to collecting this basic informa-
tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel
are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as
servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-
lances. The photo truck which comes under the project is
used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite
embassies, and Latin American exiles. One of the basehouses
is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE sur-
veillance team, but this function has been minimized during
the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of
the signal.
3. a.
The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-
tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the
value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:
"This rather unique operation has
unquestionably made a major contribu-
tion to the increasingly effective
Soviet Operations program of the
Mexico Station. On the positive
side its principal value lies in the
identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets,
from which we must select and develop
the access agents so vital to our oper-
ations against the Soviet human target.
LIEMPTY also provides us with a much
clearer picture of the inner relation-
ships and activity patterns within the
Soviet mission itself, which in turn
facilitates effective targeting. The
CE value of a LIEMPTY type project as
a monitor of real and potential agent
contacts is of course obvious. It is
important to note that LIEMPTY is not,
as might be the case in stations of
lesser overall capability, a simple
case of photography (or observation)
for the record. Rather it is an import-
ant facet of a concerted high priority
effort to get at and recruit individual
Soviets,"
Station reporting has been in a similar vein.
Information produced is largely for operational purposes and
we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ-
ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo-
graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.
It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they
have received from LIEMPTY a great many reports on American
callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double
agent operations.
C. During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the
officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch
that LIEMPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's
operational planning, that he "grabs the LIEMPTY material
first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence
of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy and which
ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talk-
ing to whom or going out of the building with whom, etc. etc.
New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or
GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars
they drive. (The I.S. men are often away from the Embassy,
while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their
offices. The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom
cross lines but stay within their own tight groups.) When

double agents are turned over from one case officer to a new
one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity
of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK
in the spring of 1967.
4. In assessing the security of the operation, the
station assumes that the Soviets realize that they are being
watched, as was evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to
shield an FBI-directed walk-in from observation. There have
been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo-
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it
have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that
the Mexicans are doing this. A former source who lives in
the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew
about LÏEMPTY/6, one of the safehousekeepers, and the Soviets
have said they think he is watching them. On the security of
the LICALLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion.
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are
aware that they are being observed from this post, but station
disagrees and produces good justification for its views, cit-
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks.
We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the
operation; rather it may be assumed that they accept the sur-
veillance as a fact of life.

PROJECT LIEMPTY
REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

:
A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its tenth
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity through stationary/mobile photo-
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:
1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of the FJSTEAL
personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence
interest, as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical
plant and visitors to the premises.
2.
To collect operational information on persons associated
with FJSTEAL personnel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services
or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests
of LNFORT.
3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance
and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be
deemed necessary.
B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued
maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED. LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-
time contract agent, Raymond H. GERENDE. These objectives are
in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters
requirements as received by Station Mexico City.
C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-
lment of Station and Headquarters' requests and requirements for
coverage of various targets failing within the above cited frame-
work. During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly
all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance
reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against
the FJSTEAL installation and personnel. Specific examples of the
LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).

CHANGES

Since the institution of the changes described
in the previous renewal request, it has not been found neces-
sary or desirable to make further major changes. The following
minor changes in operational technique have been made in an
effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:
B.
1. LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see
paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a
system of special coverage on specific FJSTEAL personnel
of interest, or special coverage of specific time periods.
of interest. The purpose is to permit the Station to gain
greater insights into the activities and personal associations
of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a
certain time period. No change in LIEMPTY-9's overall
working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been
introduced.
2. Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling
of LIENTRAP, which is now working more closely with the
LIEMBRACE team in order to take greater advantage of targets
of opportunity. To this end, LIEMBRACE-1 has been placed
in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H. GERENDE
of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time
to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).
3.
In September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee. This position gave him direct
access to FJSTEAL and other delegations of interest, and
¨supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program. It is expected
that GERENDE will obtain MHRAVEL employment again in 1968.
Financial LIEMPTY-4 and -11 were granted salary increases
effective 1 July 1967. Memoranda of Oral Commitment were for-
warded to Headquarters in HMMA-32584 and HMMA-32585, 20 July
1967. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining
LIEMPTY agents.
C.
Personnel – None.
EFFECTIVENESS
Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the
fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico
City. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
of each component are cited below:

B. Summary of Fixed Basehouse Effectiveness
The fixed LIEMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)
provided approximately 18,888 individual frames of oper-
ational photographs during the 12-month period of the past
project year. This photographic coverage, linked with the
physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse,
has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool for:
1. Following the daily comings and goings of
FJSTEAL personnel and indigenous employees.
2.
Confirming the identities of FJSTEAL staffers
and their visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens).
3.
Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the specific intelligence
service connection of various FJSTEAL officers.
4. Providing detailed reporting on the movement and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.
5. Providing physical facilities for the support of
various operational, technical and surveillance
operations.
The Mobile Photographic Unit
1. Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used
by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEAL target, but
also for PBRUMEN and Communist Party operations as well as
the JMTIGER program. Over 2,000 operational photographs were
provided. In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit
was used regularly to service and obtain various postal
accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and
other field stations.
D. Raymond H. GERENDE LIEMPTY Principal Agent
During the period under review, with the exception of short
vacation periods, Raymond H. GERENDE, continued in his role
as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent. GERENDE operated
as the full-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling respon-
sibility for the related personnel. In addition, GERENDE

A. Fixed Basehouses
1. LIMITED
Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations
provided daily photographic coverage and physical surveil–
lance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation. In
addition, the LIMITED base provided for a fixed radio
dispatching station which was used to support the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team. Due to the stringent security measures
instituted in the immediate vicinity of the FJSTEAL instal-
lation by local security forces, normal stake-outs by this
unilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio
dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which
allows the LIEMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas,
secure surveillance coverage of this target can be provided.
During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through
31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of
operational photographs. In addition, the LIMITED base
provided over 2,500 pages of physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYRIC
During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FJSTEAL installation. The LILYRIC base
provided the majority of the operational photographs produced
by the LIEMPTY project. During the 12-month period cited
in the LIMITED section above, the LILYRIC base provided
12,137 operational photographs and several thousand pages
of physical surveillance reports covering the daily move-
ments of all FJSTEAL officers.
3. LICALLA
During the above cited 12-month period, the LICALLA instal-
lation provided photograph:c and physical surveillance
coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its
garden and patio area. Th:s coverage provided 4,917 indi-
vidual photographs as well as numerous surveillance and
observation reports. It should be noted that the LICALLA
base allows Station Mexico City to observe the FJSTEAL
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.
The LICALLA installation has become the most valuable of the
three, not only because of its unique vantage point but also
because of the perceptiveness of LIEMPTY–9. His surveil-
lance reports have frequently given us valuable insight
into personal associations among the FJSTEAL personnel and
have enabled us to introduce greater flexibility and
effectiveness into the entire LIEMPTY operation.

continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities
of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 – see paragraph
2 A (2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo-
graphic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4.
GERENDE's overall operational assignment involved at least
12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meetings with the LIEMPTY Froject case officer. It should
also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential
contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation and assisted
the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in
many instances. He is frequently used to make independent
investigations and neighborhood checks. As noted above,
he contributed significantly to the Station's MHRAVEL
program. Finally, he approached, developed and eventually
attempted to recruit an agent for use in PBRUMEN operations.
.
E. Overall Effectiveness
As outlined above, each individual operational component
of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly
to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational
program. Based on the continued excellent performance and
overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly
recommends that this project be continued during the forth-
coming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus.
PROBLEMS AND SECURITY
During the project year under review there were no known inci-
dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY
or the related personnel.

PLANS
A.
As noted above, the technical and operational changes
made in the past year have been effective and have resulted
in a product which is as closely geared to operational
requirements as possible. While no major changes are
contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to
improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as
an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and
assessor of selected agent candidates. Such utilization
of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel
of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by
GERENDE in operational alias.

B. The LIENTRAP vehicle has been replaced, and no major
changes in personnel or material are contemplated. Salarios
of LIEMPTY personnel will be reviewed, and it is foreseen that
the rising cost of living will compel us to recommend salary
increases for certain of the agents who have not received
raises in some time.
7. COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Project LIEMPTY was previously approved
for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency. Station records indicate that
through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in
the field. It is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
in the entire project year. Bi-weekly accoun
Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H. GERENDE
to the Station finance officer via the project case officer for all
LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated
that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERENDE).
-
"
B. During
During Project Year It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in the rental of the various basehouses may be encountered
as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases. of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969. A detailed break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
A.
In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H.
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.
B.
In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active project agents.
However, under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat
curtailed.

These photographs and reports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
·attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.
Costs:
1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and
$20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested
that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of
$4,260 to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR-1 and
KDFACTOR-7.
2. Source of Funds: Project KDFACTOR is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's Operational Program in the

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this very
valuable Project. The Staff strongly urges the Station to
continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the
installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on
sensitive project personalities. The Station should devise
necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any
security hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are
intensifying such efforts and could be getting "too close"to
the Project installations, personalities and activities.

1. CURRENT CRECTIVES
A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its ninth year of ex-
istence, is to collect operational information on the LDERICK installation,
its personnel and visitors, as well as related targets of opportunity
through stationery/mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms.
Corollary objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:
1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining to the
'
daily movements and activities of the LIERICK personnel, particularly
those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as information
on the LD RICK physical plant and visitors to the premises.
2: To callect operational information on persons associated with
LIMERICK personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have
connections with the LIMERICK intelligence services or other hostile
groups which are inimical to the interests of LNFORT.
3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance and/or other
protective services to WOFACT personnel and operations, as may be
levied upon the Station or as asy be deemed necessary.
B. The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued maintenance
and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses, the
LINTRAP Robile unit, and the services of long-time contract agent,
Raymond H. GERINDE. These objectives are in consonance with and represent
partial fulfillment of the following sections of the current Related
Mission Directive (ND) as approved for Station Mexico City:
PRIORITY A
Section 1, subsection f
Section 2, subsections b & e
PRIORITY B
Section 1, subsection a
Section 2, subsection a
C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LICITY continued to
contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and
Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets
falling within the framework of the above cited sections of the RMD.
During the last 10 months Project LIN-PTY provided the vast majority of the
operational photographs (approximately 16,000) and physical surveillance
reports (4,000) used in Mexico City Station's operations targetted against

target can de provided. During the 9-month period from 1 November
1965 through 30 July 1966, the LIMITED base provided 3,775 frames
of operational photographs. In addition, the LIMITED bese provided
over 1,000 pages of physical surveillance reports.
2. LILYRIC
During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the
front of the LEWRICK installation. The LILYRIC base not only pro-
vided the fority of the operational photographs produced by the LIEMPTY
project, but also provided the most detallal physical surveillance
reports. During the 9-month period cited in the LIMITED section above,
the LILYRIC bese provided over 6,500 operational photographs and 3,000
pages of physical surveillance reports covering the daily movements of
all LIMERICK officers.
3. LICALLA
During the above cited 9-month period, the LICALLA installation provided
photographic and physical surveillance coverage of the back of the
LIMERICK installation and its garden and patio area. This coverage
provided over 3,600 individual photographs as well as numerous sur-
veillance and observation reports. It should be noted that the
LICALLA base allows Station Mexico City to observe the LIMERICK
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.
B. Sunsart of Fixed Rasehouse Effectiveness.
The fixel LEPY basehouses (LOITED, LIGALLA and LILYRIC) provided
approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational photographs
during the first 9-month period of the pest project year. Within the
last year, this photographic coverage linked with the physical
surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a
most reliable and viable tool for:
1. Following the daily comings and goings of LIMERICK personnel
and indigenous employees.
2. Confirming the identities of LIVESICK staffers and their
visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens).
3. Acertaining and verifying the relative rank and position
as well as indicating the specific intelligence service connection
of various LIMERICK officers.
4. Providing detailed reporting on the movement and habit patterns
of selected targets of special interest.
5. Providing physical facilities for the support of various op
erational, technical and surveillance operations.

the LIMERICK installation and personnel. Specific exnaples of the LIEMPTY
Project's progress and contributions to the RMD will be found in Section 3

2. CHANGES.
A.
Operational
-
As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewal,
the former LIMITED property was sold to LINGUSIDE, who as per formal agree-
ment with the Station, demolished the old structure and constructed a new
edifice. While it was initially contemplated to place the LIMITED
(LIEMPTYS -b and -7) personnel in the new building and to retain the same,
equal division of workload between LILYRIC and LIMITED, it was later
accided to move the present LILYRIC basehouse personnel (LIEMPTYS-13, -14,
-26 and -27) into the new base instead, along with the following ancillary
modifications:
An increase in the hours of both the photographic and physical surveillence
coverage provided from the new base by the LILYRIC operators (0800-1500
hours) during the weekdays and to have the LIMITED base provide
photographic and physical surveillance coverage from 1600-1630 hours
on weekdays and from 0900-1300 hours on weekends. These changes were
dictated by the following considerations:
1. The new LIMOUSINE building offers a much better vantage point
for both photographic and physical surveillance than does the
present complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases.
Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this
new base should be those possessing the highest technical skills
and also those able to provide the most thorough and complete
coverage. Since the LIMITED base now has only one trained
operator while the LILYRIC basehouse has three, the LILYRIC group
and a revision of working hours was indicatel.
2.
Because it was apparent that the coverage of the LIMERICK
Installation would be a long-range and continuing requirement,
the Station desired to staff the new base with personnel of long-
range potential. LIEMPTY-6, now almost 60 years old, does not
possess this potential; however, the LILYRIC agent complex
happily combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.
3. Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC
personnel is much more compatible and consistent with the en-
vironment of the new building than is that of the LIMITED family.
The above-cited revised work schedule was initiated in July 1966 and
the actual movement of the LILYRICS into the new base began in late
September 1966.

C. The Kobile Photographic Unit.
-5-
1. Throughout the period under review, the LILITRAP Mobile photographic/
support unit was regularly exploited and used by Station Nexico City.
This unit provided over 1,000 individual photographs and was used in
support of Station operations and activities. of particular value to
Station Mexico City and the JNTIGER program were numerous photographs
of local and exile Communist leaders provided by LLENTRAP. In addition,
the LITRAP personnel and unit was used regularly to service and
obtain various postal acconsolation boxes used by Nexico City, Head-
quarters and other field stationa.
D. Ravaond H. GERENDE
-
LIQPTY Principal Arent.
During the period under review, with the exception of short vacation
periods, Raymond I. GERENDE, continued in his role as the Project
LIEPTY principal agent. GERENDE operated as the full-time cut-out
to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses and bore the first
echelon agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. In
addition, GERENDE continued to bear the contact and handling res-
ponsibilities of the LIENTRAP unit and for the operator of the LIEMPTY
photographic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMITY-4. GERENDE's
overall operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings
per week; in addition to his meetings with the LIMITY Project case
officer. It should also be noted that GNDS made numerous and essen-
tial contributions to the sensitive NCOD operation and assisted the
Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in many instances.
E. Overall Effectiveness
As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIEMPTY
Project contributed regularly and significantly to the fulfillment of
Station Mexico City's operational progini. Based on the continued
excellent performance and overall contributions of this project, the
Station strongly recommends that this project be continued during the
forthcoming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus.
4. PROMLISHS AND SECURITY.
During the Project year under review there were no known incidents which
adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY or the related personnel.
The only significant problem encounteral in the operation and administration
of this project stemmed from the physical move of the LILYRIC personnel to
the new base in the LIMOUSINE building. thumerous delays arising from the
faulty performance of the local contractors and construction crews hampered
a timely relocation of this base. However, it is anticipated that the new
LILYRIC base will be in full operation by the end of October 1966.

3. Financial
-
After a detailed review of the then-existing LIENTY agent
salary structure, selected agents (LIMPTY: -6, -9, -16, and -11) were
cranted salary increases effective 1 January 1966. Formal notification
and revised memoranda of oral cozaitment were forwarded to Headquarters
with MUNA-26,136, stel 25 January 1966. There was no change in the salaries
of the remaining
C. Personnel
agents.
1. During the Prefect year under review, LIAMPTY-6, -9, -13, -14, -26 and
-27 were afforded their initial 50SWIRL examinations, all with satisfactory
results.
2. LIEMPTY-26 was granted an OA effective 29 November 1965 for use as
a cut-out to the LINTUC basehouse (MOW-14177, dated 9 December 1965).
LIETTY-26 has been setively used during the past Project year for the
above-stated purpose.
3. LIEMPTY-27 was greated an OA on 27 July 1966 for use as a part-tize
LILYRIC basehouse operator (1001-14757, dated 1 August 1966). While
LIEMPTY-27's heavy university schedule has thus far precluded his regular
use by the Station, it is anticipated that subject will be regularly
employeed after the end of the present school term.
3. EFFECTIVENESS.
Throughout the period under review, each operational component of Project
LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks levied on Station Mexico City by the UMD and other
directives. High-lights of the accomplishments and the achievements of
each component are cited below:
A. Fixed Basehouses
1. LIMITED
Throughout the past Project year (with the change in working hours
noted in paragraph above), the LIMITED installation provided daily
photographic coverage and physical surveillance of the main gate of
the LIMERICK installation. In addition, the LIMITED bese provided
for a fixed ratio ispatching station which was used continually to
support the LIBORACE surveillance team. Due to the stringent
security measures instituted in the immediate vicinity of the LIMERICK
installation by real security forces, normal stake-outs by this
unilateral teak the precluded. However, with the radio dispatching
support from the LED radio base, which allows the LIMPACE team to
work from adjacent safe areas, secure surveillance coverage of this

5. LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable to Project LIKSMITY.
6. PLANS.
A. As outlined in paragraph 6 of the Station's previous request for the
renewal of Project LIMPY, a progrma was undertaken to reequip and modernize
the LIEMPTY photographie processing base. During the past year, a signi-
Ticant portion of the equipment used in the developing and processing
laboratory was replaced. As a result of this progras, negatives and
photographic prints of auch higher quality are now being producedl.
Consequently, only minor changes in the operation of the photographie
laboratory and its equipment are contesplated for the ensuing period.
B. The present physical conlition, mileage and frequent use of the
LIEFTRAP unit dictates the immediate replacement of this unit. Station
Nexico City has received Headquarters approval for the replacement of this
vehicle.
c. Other then noted above, Mexico City plans no significant operational,
administrative or personnel changes, since it is generally felt that this
Project is now operating at its optimum size and in a highly satisfactory
manner. After 1 January 1967, the Station will review the existing LIEMPTY
personnel salary schedule and consider possible raiser, again on a selective
basis or specifically keyed to the rising cost of living.
7. COSTS.
n
A. Past Project Year – Project LIEMPTY was previously approved for the
period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for the amount of $1,500
U.S. currency.
Station records indicate that thus far, Project LIMITY
has expended 30,506,13 in the field. It is eatinted that approximately
1,500 dollars has been expended by Headquarters, principally in the
acquisition of new equipment for the LIETTY photographic Inboratory.
Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent receipts and/or certifications were
submitted by Raymond E. GERADE to the Station finance officer via the
Project case officer for all LIEMPTY Project expenditures inde in the field.
It is estimated that approximately 12 hours of case officer and 5 hours of
analyst time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this Project. (This figure does not include
the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H. GERENDE).
B.
-
Ensuing Project Year It is requested that Project LIMPY be approved
in the amount of 45,000 U.S. currency for the period 1 December 1966
through 30 November 1967 (this figure represents only a slight increase over
the amount programmed for the previous Project yeni). While no large ex-
Fenditures are anticipated for the replacement of photographie equipment
during the forthcoming period, en increase in the rental of the various base-
houses will be encountered as well as the above-cited replicement of the

C. As in the past, Raymond F. Gb will subalt bi-weekly accountings
for all Project expenditures with appropriate receipts or certifications.
There will be no requirements for foreign currency beyond the Station's
capability to provide.
6. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete or
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is now believed
that regular operational contact could be maintained with the majority of
the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H. GERENDS or in his absence, Oliver
G. SCANTLING.
B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regiae openly
hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be maintained with the
majority of the ective Project agents. However, under the circunstances
described above, it is highly probable that the activities of this Project
would be somewhat curtailed.
C. Revised and up-dated emergency contact plans for use with Raymond H.
GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANTLING are on file in the Station and at
Headquarters (sen HAMA-2-355, dated 21 February 1966 and MMMA-26252,
dated 9 February 1966).

CHANGE
-
A) Administrative As noted in the regularly submitted LEAy progress
reports and the previous Request for Renewal of Deject LIRTY (Section VI,
subsection ), during the past two years it had become obvious that many of
the operational assignments levied on Oliver G. SQL (covered by Project
LINTTY during six months of the past project rear), while completely within
the realm of the HD, were falling outside the proper scope of Project LINTY;
consequently, a new Project was prepared by the station and approved by lead-
quarters to cover 's relationship with and the support of SCUTLING.
SCANTLING was therefore removed from the negis of Project LITY on 1 May 1965
and integrated into the new close support Project LIVIOR.
-
▾
3) Operational As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewal, all
operational activity was suspended in late Ceptember 1964 at the LEITTED base-
house because of the potential security ramifications stemming from the overt
publication of a LETED photograph the Warren Commission Report. The
Station subsequently acquired an apartment in the irmediate vicinity of the
LÜURICK installation and moved the ND besehouse keepers into this tempo-
rary location. After a prudent cooling-off period, all LIMITED operational
activities (photographic, physical surveillance, and radio dispatching) ware
re-initiated from the new location in early Jammery 1965. During the interim
period, and as a result of separate correspondence with Headquarters, the former
LIMITED property was sold to LIMOUSIN), who as per formal agreement with the
Station, demolished the old structure and began construction of a new edifice.
Included in this formal agreement with LEOUSEE is the proviso that one floor
of the new building will be reserved for the sole use of Station Rexico City.
Upon completion of the new structure, the IT personnel and operational
activity will be securely transferred from the temporary apartment to the new,
more ideally located LIMOUSINE building.
C) Finance After a detailed review of the then-existing LIMITY agent salary
structure, 3 selected agents (LIRSTY-9, LINETY-11, and LIEMPTY-14) were
granted salary increases effective 1 February 1965. (Formal notification and the
pertinent revised Nemorandum of Oral Commitment were forwarded to Headquarters
with IMM-26232, Intel 1 June 1965). In addition, as per the Headquarters pre-
pared contract commendment, Raymond II. G.Js granted a salary increase
effective 1 July 1965. There was no
There was no change in the salaries of the eight remain-
ing active LINTTY agents.

D) Personnel LINITY-26 was grantell a POA on 13 October 1965 for use as a
cut-out to the LILTRIC basehouse. PR II information is being compiled and will
be submitted in the near future. LIVSTY-25 Was actively used after receipt of
the POA.
3. EFFECTIVENESS
Throughout the period under review, each operational component of Project
LIMMPTY contributed actively to the fulfillment of the overall operational
program levied on the Station by the FD and other Heriquarter's requests.
Highlights of the accomplishments and achievements of each component follow:

CURRICHT ORJECTIVES
SECRET PER
FEQUEST FOR REHEMAL
PROJECT LIEPTY
A) The overall objective of Froject LIEMPTY, now in its eighth year of ex-
istence, is to collect operational information on the LOTERICK installation
and personnel, as well as related targets of opportunity, through stationary
and mobile photographic and physical surveillance mechanisms. Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through the use of the LIEPTY instal-
lations and personnel are as follow: i
1) To provide operational information pertaining to the daily activities
and movements of the LDERICK personnel, particularly those individuals
of intelligence interest, as well as information on the LIMERICK physical
facilities and visitors to the premises.
2)
To collect operational information on persons associated with LIMERICK
and on individuals known or suspected to have connections with opposition
Intelligence services or other hostile groups which are inimical to the
interests of ODYCE.
1
5) To provide operational support, countersurveillance, and other pro-
tective services to Station personnel and operations as may be deemed
necessary.
B) The above objectives are to be fulfilled through the continued exploitation
of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, the LIEWRAP mobile unit, and
the services of long-time contract agent, Raymond H. GREIDE. These objectives
are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the following
sections of the current Related Mission Directive (FD) as approved for Mexico
City Station:
PRIORITY A
Section 2, subsection b.
PRIORITY R
Section 1, subsection a.
Section 2, subsection a.
c) Throughout the project rear under review, Project LISTY continued to
contribute directly and significantly to the fulfillment of the Station's and
Headquarters' requests and requirements for coverage of various targets falling.
within the framework of the above cited objectives of the ND. Specific
examples of the LINITY Project's progress and contributions to the RD will be
found in Section 3., Exe

A) LIAINED. Throughout the past project year, with the exception noted in
paragraph 2, section 7. above, the LIMITED installation provided daily photo
coverage and physical surveillance of the main gate of the LITRICK Instal-
lation during the afternoon and carly evening hours. (airing the morning
hours, the LEITTED basehouse keepers prepared the typewritten surveillance
reports and photographic logs covering the previous day's activitica). In
addition, the LDAPTED Installation providel a fixal ralo dispatch base,
used regularly to support the LITTERACE surveillance team. Decause of the
tight security measures instituted by the local security forces in the
immediate vicinity of the LIMERICK Instellation, normal stakeouts by this
unilatural team are precluded. However, with the support of the LIMITED
radio base, which can dispatch the team from ascens safo-areas, secure
and effective surveillance coverage of this target can to provided. During
the ten-month ported from 1 November 1964 through 30 August 19/5, the
LIMITED base provided 150 rolls of 35mm operational still photographs, which
provided the Station with approximately 2,970 francs.
del
In
addition, the LIMITED base provided bi-weekly physical surveillance suamary
reports.
B) EINRIC

The LILYRIC installation also provided extensive photo raphic and
ixed visual surveillanes of the front of the
installation through-
out the periol under review, during the morning and early afternoon hours,
with evenings being spent in the preparation of written surveillance reports
and photographic los. Aring the ten-month period from 1 November 1964
through 30 August 1967, the LILYRIC hegehouse provided 5,060 indivitial
frames (226 rolls) of 33m operational photos. In addition, the LILYRIC
basehouse knoper provide? 1,060 pages of physical surveillance reports
covering the daily movements of the principal EDIT officers.
I
c) LICALLA - During the above-noted ten-month period, the LICALLA installation
provided photographic and physical surveillance esterace of the back of
the LIMERICK Installation, the carion and the palio area. This coverage
produced 153 rolla of 3 film, which produced
individual photographs
In addition, various
as well as bi-weekly physical surveillance summaries.
Teadquarters specialists made night-time entries in the LICALLA. hasehouse
for on-site clandestine surveys in support of a petibial sensitive
technical operation.
NUMERY OF FIORD BACHHICUSE 1FFECTIVENES
The fixed LINTY baschouses (LINTRID, LILYRIC, HIMALA) thus produced over
12,000 individual frames of operational photographs Arif a ten-month period within
the last year. This coverage linked with the related physical surveillance reports
prepared by each basehouse has proven to be a rost milisle and viable tool for:

unit provided 1,797 Individual photographs of various targets of
operational interest to Mexico City Station, particulark local
Commulist leaders and installations as well as various communist
exiles now residing in Mexico City. In addition, the AP
personnel regularly servicol approximately twenty postal accommo-
dation boxes used operationally by Mexico City, Headquarters, and
other stations,
Specifically, the LIITMP unit:
1) provided and serviced sccommolation boxes for the sensitive AKCROD
operation;
11) provided photographie/casing coverage of an embassy of interest to
NUTUBE/D for use in operational planning;

provided up-to- late photos of individuals and an installation linked
with the Spanish Republican (loyelists) group in Nexies; and
iv) provided identifientions, locations, and contacts of various local
and exile communists in support of recruitment/penetration programs
directed against the Partido Comunista Mexicane, the Partido Popular
Socialists, and various exile communist leaders.

c) As in the past, Ramond R. GUIDE will submit M-weekly accountings for
all project expenditures with appropriate receipts and certifications.
There are no requirements for foreign currenar beyond the Station's
capability to provide.
8. EVERGENCY CONDITIONS
A) In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete or enforced
neutrality on the part of the host government, it is now believed that regular
operational contact could be maintained with the active LINTTY agents via
Taymond H. GREDS or in his absence, Oliver 3. SANTLING.
B) In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime hostile to
ODYCKS, limited contact could probably be mintained with the active
project agents through GERENDS or CUTLER. However, under the conditions
described above, it is doubtful whether this project would be able to operate
against more than one-or two selected targets.
C) Emergency communications plans for Oliver O. SUNTLING and Raymond N. GERENDE
are on file in the Station and at Headquarters (see EN-15982 and IDMA-15981,
of 23 November 1950). In addition, in late 1964, a review was held with all
active agents of their recontact plans and verbal recomition signals.

and no longer lends itself to the production of high-quality negatives or
photographic prints. The total cost of this equipment replacement program
is not expected to exceed $300 and sufficient Aundo have been included in
the cost section of this renewal request.
B) Other than noted above, Mexico City Station plans no other significant,
operational, administrative or personnel changes, since it is generally
felt that this project is now operating at its optimum size ani in a
completely satisfactory manner. After 1 January 1966 the Station will
review the existing DITY salary schedule and consider possible raises,
again on a selective brais.
7. COSTS
L
-
A) Fast Project Year Station recoris indicated that Project LIBTTY expended.
$30,540.90 during the ten-month period from 1 December 1964 through
30 September 1955. Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent receipts and/or
certifications were submitted by GITUENDE and SCANTLING to the Station finance
officer via the project Case Officer for all HENTY Project expenditures.
It is estimated that approximately fifteen hours of Case Officer and five
hours of analyst time is required each week to fulfill the operational,
administrative and analytical requirements of this project.
B) Dibing Project Year
-
It is requested that Project LIMITY be approved in
the amount of $1,500 for the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966.
(The project was previously programed for 100,000;
of this amount, (25,520 should be
allotted for FY 1965 and $15,000 for FY 1957. A detailed breakdown of
project expenditures by category and by fiscal year follows:

F) HD. SEMAIDE During the period under review, with the exception
of short vacation periols, GUIDI continued in his role as the
LIMITY Principal Rent. This assignment entailed regular meatings
with the LILYRIC, LICHII, and IITED basel ose keepers (or cutte
to these hases); rendar contact with the operators of the LIGHT?
mobile photo vuit; regular contact with the LIZET! photographie
developing and processing boce; and mamarous operational tasks in
support of the 10 operation. Specifically, this offort involved
at least twelve clandestine extent or Case Officer meetings per week, the
first echelon financial accountability for the expenditure of $35,000
per annum, in addition to various cover-job duties.
{
SUMMARY OF NUTECTIVESS
As outlined above, each individual operational component of the LIITTY
project contributed stificantly and regularly to the l^illment of the over-
all operational progrem levied on the Station by the RD and other directives.
Rased on the fine performance and overall contributions of this project, the
Station concludes that this operation in accential to the ulfillment of the
RD and should be continued during the forthcoming year.
4. PROFLING AND SECURITY
The only significant operation becurity problems which confronted the LIETY -
project during the period under review, were those which stemmed directly or
indirectly from the overt release of the clandestine LIMITED photographs
published in the Warren Commission Report. The precise derece occasion.ed
locally by the public disclosure of this clandestinely acquired information
still cannot be measured. However, time-consuming personnel moves, with the
attendant loss of coverage and additional cost as well as otherwise unnecessary
expenditures of Station time and effort were required this incident. (See
paragraph IV of the 1964 LIEPTY Project Renewal Request for details). Other
than the above affair, there have been to operational, aministrative, or
personnel problems which the Station could not readily and securely resolve.
5. LIAISON AND INTRAGENCY COORDINATION
E.
Not applicable to Project LIEPTY
PLANS
A) As further implementation of a program initiated during the latter portion
of the past project year, Mexico City Station will continues to give increased
emphasis to improving the quality or the photographic product from the
LIMITY basehouses. While no concomitant reduction in the quantity of photo-
Craphs is anticipated, the Project Case Officer, with the assistance of the
local KURICT representative will continue to emphasis the quality rather then
the number of photographs. An ancillery objective of this program is to
replace a significant portion of the equipment now used Ir. the LIMPY
developing and processing lab. Much of this equipment is over eight years 11

HMMA 24650
° 1. The LIEMPTY Project Renewal request forwarded in
reference, was approved on 29 January 1965 for the period
1 December 1964 through 30 November 1965 for a total of
$45,300; $27,675 for FY 1965 and $17,625 for FY 1966.
2.
At the time of approval, 'Assistant KUDOVE stated
he expects this project to live within the sum authorized
for the year, and that there will be no amendment for
additional funds.
< 3. As you were informed in HMMW 13282 in the dispatch
on the LIEMBRACE Project Renewal, KUTUBE is interested in
the problem of hostile monitoring of any radio communications
from LIMITED. You should remain alert to this problem, and
inform us if Headquarters can be of any assistance in helping
you maintain communications security.
4. You are reminded that the LIEMPTY Project, as approved,
only covers the salary for Oliver G. SCANTLING through 31 May
1963. It is suggested that a separate project be written to
cover SCANTLING if his new duties do not fall entirely under
any other approved project.

Review of Project LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
1.
CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
24
"
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities. SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,
13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.
a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair
safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner.
•
b. SCANTLING is still the Station's primary source for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal
request for additional details).
1
2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets:

d. SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here,
4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station. For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July 1961 when Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations.
5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, It is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in general, SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY.
B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses.
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as
described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.
2. "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this

a. On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO
demonstrations. Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.
b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable
counterespionage Interest to Headquarters,
c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates,
3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:
.
a. SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruitment
made by another Station agent.
b. Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. Sce
the last renewal for additional details on this case.
c. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations
for the Station. SCANTLING also does most of the local
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components.

objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation. For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle. Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIÊRODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.
"
3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.
4. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.
C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:
As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so. The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
Information in support of other Station operations.
CHANGES
There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans.

•
EFFECTIVENESS
There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made in Section III of last year's project renewal request.
IV.
PROBLEMS
The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29. May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year.
V.
PLANS
The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements.
VI.
COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00. It is anticipated that about $8,000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project. year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some $12,500.00
under the budget estimate of $53,000.00.
B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49,500.00 budget, itemized below,
$29,500.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the
balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting
procedures will be used for all expenditures.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):
1.
"To collect operational information per-
taining to LIMERICK personnel and physical
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per-
taining to the above objective. There follow
a few examples of SCANTLING's production:
8. A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded
to Headquarters as an attachment to
HMMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro-
duction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection effort.
b. SCANTLING has been used frequently
to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/
LIMERICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated
that the LIMERICK target was having con-
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi❤
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
Station with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm. Such information
then becomes readily available for exploitation
should a LIMERICK shipment of particular
interest come to the attention of the Station.
C. SCANTLING is the Station's primary
investigative asset for keeping track of
current residence addressees of LIMERICK
personnel. The Station considers it important
from the counterespionage standpoint to main-
tain information on the location of all
&S COTY SECRET
50:6.70/1

--- Image 104-10187-10014_page_233.jpeg ---
14-00000
LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific
targeto are continually considered for LICOOL
installations. A recent example of SCANTLING's
efforts in this connection would be the spot-
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTOR base in
the same apartment building with LITALON -1.
Contributions of this type operational informa-
tion are quite time consuming due to the
necessity for checking out several apartments
that a LIMERICK individual may initially be
considering as a residence.
2. "To collect operational information pertaining to
other targets of opportunity, foreign official installa-
tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating
in Mexico." As indicated below, SCANTLING is also
extremely useful for collecting information on targets
other than LIMERICK:
8. In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental
in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY
installation which the Station has since
rented in anticipation of initiating photo-
graphic and technical operations. SCANTLING
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi-
gations of the several pieces of property
appropriate for such operations.
b. SCANTLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister targets (See example as to type
under I,A,1, b and c above).
C. SCANTLING was used as an investigative
asset to determine the local address and
exact employment of Gordon William GROVES
(201-220025), a counterespionage case of
interest to Headquarters and ODENVY.
3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments
debriefings, and surveillances." As examples of
SCANTLING's contribution to this objective, the
following cases are listed:
8.
SCANTLING devoted a considerable amount
of time to his attempts to locate Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Com-
munist Country. He followed various leads
on GONZALEZ from March to August 1960 before

This information is particularly useful in keeping track of
LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation. Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day.
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American. The results of this
assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables. LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.
b. LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, LILYRIC
also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the
LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photographis also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees.
It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each
day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maința ins
photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day
except Sunday.
c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families. Also, the base operator,

i
LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees. He accomplishes this objective by careful
observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a daily
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-
espionage effort.
2. "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext Investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The
cases listed below are cited as examples:
a. In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3, a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters.
b. LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apartment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the Investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject,
3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for
other Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make
him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.
GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them.

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced.
C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets. of opportunity.
During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support
efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances. Some
examples of the team's work are listed below:
a. Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960. The surveillance, together
with information acquired from other sources, eventually
resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER.
b. Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO is a
Dominican of interest to the Station. The LIJERSEY team
devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting
Information on subject through physical surveillance.
c. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.
LOPEZ was later deported from Mexico through the efforts
of LITEMPO-2.
d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous
pretext investigations on Station targets of opportunity and on
three separate occasions during the project year served as
a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other
operations.
2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent
about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to
LITEA-1. Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,
this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-
tribution to the Station's support efforts.

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31
August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to
the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project wiþl
not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that
the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the
expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations
were justified.
D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:
It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should
do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations.
CHANGES
A. Simon D. CLACKETT
The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.
B. Oliver G. SCANTLING
Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the
LIJERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewise
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING is
known to L-20 only by an alias,

GONZALEZ was finally identified and his
Mexico City home and business addresses were
ascertained. See HAMA-15626, 9 September 1960,
for further details on this case.
5.
.
The preliminary investigative work on a
KUSODA case of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it
was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aquascalientes, Guanajuato and Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
See the attachments to HENT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation.
In addition to his contributions to the above objec-
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING
handled several of Raymond H. GERENDE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
and September 1960. Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960. It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon
as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
been used to spot and rent safe houses for various
Station operations, a valuable operational support
service.
5.
As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, al though SCANTLING'S LIEMPTY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in general. SCAN TLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures,
case officer time and other intangible factors, uniques-
tionably justifies his continuation as an integral part
of Project LIEMPTY.
Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to
LIMERICK personnel and physical facilities through use
of photographic base houses." Together with their
extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information:
& LIMITED - This base compiles daily logs
indicating all arrivals, departures and,
where possible, identities of every person
visiting or working at the LIMERICK target.

Wilma J. FIORDALISI.
EFFECTIVENESS
A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them.
The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as
the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect operational
information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped
in its operational activitles should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable.
.
:
B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-
espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed
knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK
personnel. The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undoubtedly provide
more of this type information than any other Station operation. The
production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY
project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of
little use in producing good identified shots of individuals. In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted.
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all
base photographs have been increased considerably as a direct result
of this new film.
C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim
responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIJERSEY team
to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an
appreciable amount. It is not planned, during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities.
COSTS
A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120.91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734.69. Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional
$4,000.00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54,000.00 for the
entire project year.
B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below,
$31,900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21, 100.00, should be expended during Fiscal
Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all
expenditures.

IV.
V.
C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent
assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other
essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant. It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in
support of sensitive operations and activities.
D. Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year.
PROBLEMS
A. Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time,
there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed. The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a
possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No
other security problems have occurred during the past year.
PLANS
A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable
progress has been made in the Station's handling, i. e., sorting, indexing,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.
B. Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using
HY-PAN film in night photography-HY-PAN film was used on a trial
basis during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No. 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions.
the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives. However, both principal
agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse
conditions. Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are). It is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation,

Be KUDESK notes that the CI value of the project is
difficult to judge since it appears that much of the material
produced remains in the Station for exploitation. However,
KUDĖSK remarks that the value of the project should be increased
when the CLACKETT surveillance team enters into active operation,
KUDESK suggests that the Station be queried as to the pretext or
circumstances under which SCANTLING frequently visits Ines Parada
de Narano, the ecoupant of the property adjacent to the Soviet
installation.
b. KUTUBE/OPS notes that while the project review presents
a alear picture of the aims and objectives of the various sag-
ments, it does not provide, except in the case of SCANTLING,
detailed indication of the value or usefulness of the other ceg-
ments, particularly the photographic activity. KUTUBE/OFS
requests that the Station provide such an appraisal during the
first quarter of 1960. KUTUER/OPS recommends strongly that the
photo coverage be reviewed from the standpoint of value and use-
fulness with a view to determining whether the LILYRIC activity
could not be safely eliminated and the additional photographie
coverage conducted on a more salective basis, without materially
affesting overall usefulness. KUTUBE/OPS notes that, in the
absance of further proof of usefulness, the color photography and
moving pictures appear to be an unnecessary lunury. KUTUBE/OPS
camends the careful handling of the CLACKETT segment and requests
that the next project action include examples of the team's
progress.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)
I.
PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):
For
1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities." During the past year SCANTLING has devoted
a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although
other Station operations and personnel are also concerned with the collection of
operational information about LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions
are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources.
example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK
physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-
struction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK
installation. He regularly visits Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property
adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior
grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities
which she may have observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a
thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all
other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information
is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical
meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points
where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and
because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING
has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might
conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent
training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,
SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work at the LIMERICK installation;
however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLAČKETT on dispatching tech-
niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance
team using two-way radios.
2.
"To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING
in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT
operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a
pretext cover story. During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly
valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has
added materially to KUBARK's knowledge about the target. SCANTLING has also
cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

HEADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER

SUBJECT
• Project LIEMPTY
Renewal
Room
Ext.
2121 Barton
2555
Date 9 December 1959
1. It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be renewed for the
period 1 December 1959 through 30 November 1960 for a total of
$84,910.00; $48,485.00 for fiscal year 1960 and $36,425.00 for fiscal
year 1961. LIEMPTY was last approved for the period 1 December 1958
through 30 November 1959 for a total of $95,380; of which it is
estimated $74,259 has been obligated.
2. It is requested that the Project be renewed on the basis
of the Project review prepared by the Station which is attached.
3. The security incident referred to in paragraph IV.B on
page 6 of the attachment, occurred on 20 September 1959. While on
an operational assignment LIEMPTY/10 and the LIENTRAP vehicle were
temporarily detained by the Servicio Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret
Service). At the time of the incident the LIENTRAP vehicle was
carrying out an assignment of photographing a Cuban rally which it
was expected would be attended by many of the leading Mexican and
Central American Communists. The police were also covering the
meeting for the purpose of preventing a Communist-inspired demonstra-
tion and they searched LIENTRAP believing it might contain Communist
propaganda. When they saw the film they seized the film, the truck and
LIEMPTY-10 with the belief the Communists had filmed some rough-handed
techniques used by the police against some persons attending the rally.
LIEMPTY-10 was held under unofficial custody for approximately 26 hours
before his release was obtained. When a member of the Station using
State Department cover intervened with the police on behalf of LIEMFTY-10,
the film, LIENTRAP, and all the equipment were also returned in taot.
LIEMPTY-10 had not been interrogated and had not been formally charged
or booked. Although the FBI representative and the U.S. Embassy Security
Officer also learned of the incident, the Station does not believe that
this incident has materially effected the security of the Project. The
Station, however, is allowing a one month's cooling off period for the
LIENTRAP vehicle and LIEMPTY-10.

and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.
2. Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will
continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In
addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i. e., investi-
gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives
of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projects. The Station still plans to maintain
SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super-
vising other agents and operations.
3.
SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative
support to LIEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be
responsible for the operational direction of L-3.
B.
Raymond H. GERENDE Segment;
1.
During the past year the three photographic base houses have
been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of
photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently
begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This
film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not
possible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel
will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the
past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that
Headquarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking
place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.
2.
Other operational progress has been made in connection with
relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team. This
now leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic
base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory.
-
3. Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for
expansion. Rather, the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures
now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast
HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate
on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base.
C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment:
1.
CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LIJERSEY
surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional
and much needed support ascet. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence
for several years, it was only during the past year, with the assignment of

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses."
This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base houses, ·
LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced
approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuals
entering and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of
non-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage
could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi-
gation. The LICALLA base produced approximately 4300 photographs during the year.
Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families
and have been of considerable value in maintaining current and accurate listings
of LIMERICK personnel in Mexico. The LICALLA base has recently begun taking
motion pictures of LIMERICK personnel conversing in the garden area. These
movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip
reading analysis. The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment,
is also used as the radio central for dispatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily
attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's
reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel. Also, the bases
devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK
employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of
confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associate with
their colleagues.
2.
.
"To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." This is a broad objective
and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation. LIENTRAP is used
to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify
a more permanent photographic base. During the period under review, LIENTRAP
has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group
activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)
-headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY
targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational
information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing
operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated
in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.
3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i. e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE,
because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the
Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictițious names for use on other
Station operations. He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office
boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational
support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security
of important Station activities.

he gains more experience. There have been no security problems or incidents in
connection with CLACKETT's assignment to this Station. Although the notional
cover provided by Headquarters has held up very well during the past few months,
the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante
papers for him. However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, this
cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate
another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.
CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION.
'V.
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING
•
-
The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING
on the average of three times each week. For regular meetings, a total of eight
prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat"
and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car. This procedure enables
both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for
possible surveillance. Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than
30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch
with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting
is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station are currently working on the details of
an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME.
Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements to facilitate contact with
SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the
Station is severed.
B. Raymond H. GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five
times each week. Meetings are conducted in the Case Officer's car using the same
procedures as outlined above. GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11
contact points in different areas of the city and generally hold their meetings during
the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING,
GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which
will facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIME
Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements just as soon as they are completed.

CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to
place them under the supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above,
CLACKETT has done an excellent job during the past few months in getting the
team ready for future operational assignments.
2.
The Ștation plans, during the coming year, to increase the
_ strength of the LIJERSEY team by at least two agents and one car. This would
then give a total LIJERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars. The
Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development
of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.
It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next
month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-
tration progranı.
IV.
PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,
SECURITY AND COVER.
r
of what
A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained
and motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was
excellent. His production is in the category of operational information rather than
positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the
Station. He never fails to do a thorough and detailed job on all assignments
given to him. He is an unusually valuable principal agent. There have been no
security problems or developments during the past year in connection with
SCANTLING's assignments. Likewise, his cover is very good and places him
in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.
-
B. Raymond H. GERENDE Since GERENDE's marriage in December
1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one
of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,
completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,
regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,
his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well. In fact, GERENDE
recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very
large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This,
of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to
GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining,
in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951,
16 October 1959, for details).
C. Simon D. CLACKETT
-
CLACKETT's performance has definitely
measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he
is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine
activities. He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported
in separate correspondence.
3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
and surveillances." This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project because
SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY
photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of
leads obtained from the above sources. The information resulting from these in-
vestigations has enabled the Station to maintain current data on the various firms
used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201- ).
caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of
activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the
primary target.
4. Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless, of
significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He devised a súperior method for
numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
without reference to street names and areas. The entire radio dispatch code, when
used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and
reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
to terminate LIVESTOCK-2. SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
hote! rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operations such as
LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.
5. Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
activities in general. SCANTLING's production, measured against monetary.
expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

4.
The production of operational information as represented by
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the
Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i. e., money
and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued.
C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):
1. "To collect operational information and to identify operational
leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity." Very
little production has been realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving
surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the
rest of April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile sur-
veillance techniques. Then LIEMPTYs 15, 16, 17 and 20 were placed under his
supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and
mobile surveillance. This team, known as the LIJERSEY team, is just beginning to
show the excellent effects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessions. Although
LIEMPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including
CLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month
to begin its contributions to the above objective.
2. Based on the training time devoted to CLACKETT and to the LIJERSEY
team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's
opinion that this activity should be continued.
II.
EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN
FURTHERED.
Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of
Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance
of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended nor designed to
produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station operations.
III.
A.
PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.
Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:
1. SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same
now as they were when the original LIEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since
SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LIEMPTY, progress, other than
covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that
SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a few more helpful tricks of the trade

Renewal of Project KDFACTOR
in 1972 for $19,000
in 1973 for $20,000
1.
This project covers photo and visual surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation
post covers the front gate of the building, and another
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back. An
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings
with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed
inside the Station.
2. The production from this operation has consis-
tently been rated high by the Bureau (which is the prin-
cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies
and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy
might not be a high priority target in some countries.
But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large
and active one and the fact that its primary t

3. This seemingly straightforward operation has not
always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in
operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than
a dozen years. At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now-
terminated principal agent was divorced several years
· ago from a wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some
desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for
years was supposed to be developing the films was simply
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by
his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI/OPS
FROM
SUBJECT
1 Chief, WHD
1 LIEMPTY Project
3 February 1959
1.
Reference is made to your comments on the IIFTY Project which was
approved on 16 January 1959.
2. The LIENFTY Project provides for the development of the former
LIJERSEY surveillance team, the maintenance of photo surveillance bases, and
other support facilities for the Mexico City Station. In their review of the
Project before it was approved, FI/OP3 suggested that WH Division consider a
gradual reduction of the considerable financial and personnel commitments in
this project in view of the favorably developing LIENVOY liaison relationship.
FI/OPS believed that a amallar, more manageable support group with greater
emphasis on selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective
CI and FI productivity..
3. The Mexican desk wishes to point out that rather than reducing the
assets carried under the LIEMPTY Project, WHD believes that this project is
an extremely important one and should receive Headquarters support.
The only
other Station surveillance teams, LIVESTOCK and 1I5-PRACE, are both known
to the Mexican authorities. Therefore LIEFTY remains the Station's only
secure surveillance asset. It is a very snall untrained unit at present, but
through this project it will be developed into a useable, valuable asset.
4. We are not passing FI/OP's comment to the field, because WH Divisio.
believes that unilateral assots should not 'e reduced in favor of liaison.
First, the liaison has not yet been firmly established. Secondly, oven with a
good liaison relationship, the Mexican services must be considered anything but
secure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations.
Thirdly, because of its proximity to the United States, and the activity of
hostile intelligence groups there, the Mexico City Station is called upon to
support many very sensitive operations which we would never wish to reveal to
the Mexican authoritios.
5. Experience in other latin

5. Experience in other latin American countries where liaison has been
established, has shown that many Station's tend to reduce their unilateral
estat
operations and capabilities in favor of the liaison. Under these circumstances,
the production of the Stations have often been at the morey of the liaison
service and a change in the attitude of the service toward cooperating with
this Agency has left these Stations virtually helpless. We certainly cannot
recommend that the Mexico Station reduce any of it's unilateral support assets
in favor of a proposed liaison relationship.

believe it is time for the Station to make an updated
security review of the operation with particular attention
to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their
families. We also believe that the Station should now
address itself to the contingency that the present sites
or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative
means of continuing their valuable coverage.
4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970
with the condition that termination payments to the
principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a
monthly basis. This condition has been met.
5.
The budgets requested for the next two years are
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional
bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000.
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to
$5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses.
This project action also requests amendment of the FY
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of
termination bonuses to the principal agent and his di-
vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project.
The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.
6.

2. Headquarters is requested to select a suitable contract or Staff
Agent to replace Raymond H. GERENDE as leader of the LIJERSEY surveillance
team.
From the security standpoint, it is essential that GERENDE be relieved
of this responsibility. The individual selected by Headquarters to fill the
slot formerly occupied by Wilfred O. CLOWER (BAP-8100) should have had
experience in surveillance operations and should speak Spanish fluently.

1. The Field Project Outline submitted with HD'A-11257 was approved
on 16 January 1959 without change, for the period 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959 for a total of 395,330; $65,580 for the current fiscal
year and $29,800 for fiscal year 1960.
2.
An amendment to the original request for project approval was
submitted before the original project was approved. This amendment
requested approval to include Simon D. CLACKET: (ps) and Wilma J. FIORDALISI
(ps) under the LIFEFTY Project effective 1 January 1959 and remove them
from the LIMESA Project. The funds designated in the original FPO for
the undesignated Staff Agent were used to cover the expenses for CLACKETT
and FIORDALISI. Therefore no additional funds were requested for the
project in this amendment. The approval on 16 January 1959 included this
project amendment. A copy of the amendment request is being forwarded
for your information and records.
3. Asong the Staffs'
recommendations were made.
comments on the LIMFIY Project, the following
KUDELK suggested that the Case Officer should
work at devising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will
stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces.
4. An amendment to CLACKETT's contract has been requested to allow
for a quarters allowance. The educational allowance requested in paragraph
11 of the project amendment was disapproved because CLACKETT was a Contract
Agent. The Quarters Allowance of $2,500 was turned down because it was too
high in relation to CLACKETT's salary. Therefore, a quarters allowance of
$1,800 has been approved and will be written into CLACKETI's contract. If,
however, operational and cover reasons require CLACKET to rent an apartment
larger than the one he would normally obtain under his allowance, the Chief
of Station can authorise the extra rent as an operational expense which will
not be considered as compensation for CLACKETT and therefore not subject to
federal income tax.
5. Flease advise headquarters whether you wish to have the cryptonyms
for CLACKSTT and FIORDALISI charged to LIPTY's.

PROJECT OUTLINE
PART I

HMM-A-11257

1. Area of Operations
The general area of operations will be Mexico and the specific area will be
Mexico, D.F., Mexico.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a mechanism for the development of
operational information in support of other Station operations. This purpose is
in consonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico.
3. Background
As the reviewing authorities will be aware, this project includes several
operations which were formerly carried under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY.
Partially as a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK compromise, when three surveillance
team members were apprehended and placedin custody by the Mexican Police, and
additionally as a means for the orderly administration of assets, this new project
is submitted.
There follows below a background sketch of the separate support assets, excluding
details concerning personnel which will be discussed later in the outline, which the
Station proposes for inclusion in LIEMPTY:
LIMITED - The LIMITED Base is located in such a position across the street
from the LIMERICK installation that photographs can easily be made of persons enter-
ing and leaving the LIMERICK main gate. These photographs are later developed and
printed by LIEMPTY-4, then returned to the LIMITED operator for the proper annotations.
After receipt of the photographs by the Station, the Case Officer reviews them for
LIMESA leads, newly arrived LIMERICK personnel, local and other nationals of possible
operational interest and PBPRIME citizens who have visited LIMERICK.
KUBARK owns the property housing the LIMITED Base, having purchased it in mid-
1955; however, the ostensible owner is LIMOUSINE, to whom LIEMPTY-6 pays his rent
each month through LIMOUSINE's bank.
LIMITED, with LIEMPTY-6 as base house operator, has been operating for nearly
three years and has not yet been involved in a compromising security situation. Prior
to April 1955, when Headquarters authorized the purchase of the LIMITED Base, the
Station rented the Base and used LIPSTICK-7 (later LIMESTONE-6 in LIFEAT Project
and now terminated) as the operator. This arrangement was in effect for about two
years.

The major security threat to LIENTRAP is the fact that it has been operating
for about two years in all parts of the city and should soon be replaced by a truck
of a different make. Provision for this is made in Section 15 of this Field Project
Outline.
-
LIJERSEY This is presently an approved project; however, it is believed
advisable for administrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assets within the
framework of the LIEMPTY Project. Other than LILYRIC, which has already been
discussed, LIJERSEY consists of a foot surveillance team with three members, LIEMPTYs-
15, 16 and 17. LIEMPTYs 15 and 16 have been employed for about one and a half years
and LIEMPTY-17 for about one year. They have not developed into as competent a surveil-
lance team as the LIPSTICK team was and probably never will become as good. The
LIJERSEY team has been used mostly for stationary surveillances and observations of
people of interest. LIEMPTY-17, however, has also been used as a pretext investigator.
He has excelled at this type of work and the Station continues to use him in this
capacity. The Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSEY team as much as it
could have been used because of the close association of the team with GERANDE and,
in turn, GERENDE's knowledge and work on LIFEAT and the LIPSTICK surveillance team.
The Station plans to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable
for all types of surveillance work than the present LIJERSEY team.
-
Oliver G. ACÅNTLING SCANTLING has been associated with KUBARK for several
years in a number of different capacities. He was originally used as a member of
the LIPSTICK surveillance team and later was head of the same team. He has been
used to train new agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to
acquire office space and apartments for the Station's operations and to conduct
investigations and make recruitment approaches to individuals of operational interest
to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of
LIMESA leads andis still actively pursuing the LIMESA/MKLIGHTING operation.
SCANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIEMPTY-3 and monitors his elicitation
effort against the LICOOL-6 target. In this connection, both SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3
meet regularly with Doris M. KILLGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see
the LICOOL Field Project Outline for additional details on LICOOL-6).

LILYRIC - This Base has been in operation for about two and one-half years
and is located in an apartment building across the street from the LIMERICK
installation. As in the case of the LIMITED Base, LILYRIC takes photographs of
persons entering and leaving the main gate of the LIMERICK instállátion. The
LILYRIC photographs are handled in the same manner as the LIMITED pictures. In
addition to taking photographs, the LILYRIC operators also prepare daily logs on the
activities of each LDERICK employee, record the license plate numbers of most cars:
carrying people to and from the LIMERICK installation, and prepare an observation
diary on all target personnel seen each day. (This permits the Station to tell when
target personality is out of town or not working for some other reason.)
The LILYRIC Base was originally acquired and made operative to provide for
continuous¨ èoverage of the target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This
is still the primary value of having two bases cover the same portion of the target.
LILYRIC is compartmented from LIMITED and with the possible exception of GERENDE
could probably weather any security flap involving LIMITED. Obviously, there is
some duplication in the work of LIMITED and LILYRIC; however, the insurance value
of having two basis is quite apparent.
LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as
the Station knows, no compromising security situations have arisen.
LICALLA
-
The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographs can be
taken of people within the LIMERICK garden area. In addition, the operator of the
LICALLA Base submits weekly reports on LIMERICK construction work, daily logs show-
ing when a target individual was seen that day, and reports showing the association
of target individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled
in the same manner and by the people who handle the LIMITED and LILYRIC pictures.
The LICALLA Base was acquired and operations began about two and one-half
years ago with the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information
concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for
the physical penetration of the LIMERICK installation. Approximately one year ago
the LICALLA, Base was purchased by KUBARK through LIMOUSINE. LICALLA will probably
remain at its present location and will continue to submit photographs and reports
of the same type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that LIEMPTY-9,
the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are
currently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the
local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and
the LCFLUTTER tests give no indications that LIEMPTY-9 was ever mentioned during
the LIPSTICK flap.
LIENTRAP - This is a panel type truck equipped with cameras, telescopic
lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has been used during the past
two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards from a
target of interest (usually a residence or apartment building) and the photographer
in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station.
LIENTRAP is a valuable asset for any station to have and has enabled this Station to
get pictures of individuals which could have been obtained in no other way.

8. To collect operational information and to identify operational leads

6. Targets:
Oliver G. SCANTLING
->
The primary target is, of course, the LIMERICK installation
and personnel. However, SCANTLING devotes most of his time to following up LIFEAT
leads which pertain to services provided the LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firms, e.g. construction engineers, floor waxing firms, safe experts, furniture
makers, interior decorators, etc. To an extent, these are considered targets of
opportunity and it would be impossible to list specifically what future targets
vill be available. One specific target which SCANELING is concerned with is the
occupant of the LICOOL-6 apartment; however, LIEMPTY-3, whom SCANTLING handles,
should more correctly be given credit for information produced on this target.
LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have as their target
the LIMERICK installation and personnel, plus any local nationals and PBFRIMERS
who visit LIMERICK. LIENTRAP is concerned with targets of opportunity and follow-
up investigations on operational leads obtained from other Station and Headquarters
Bources. The same targets apply to the LIJERSEX surveillance team as apply to
LIENTRAP.

The agents and operations listed in this project have previously been
carried under the LIPSTICK and LIJERSKY Projects. It is the Station's under-
standing that the LIPSTICK Project was extended to 1 December 1958 to give the
Station time to submit LIEMPTY. The LIJERSEY Froject expires in 1959 or upon
approval of LIEMPTY.
The LIEMPTY Project represents a major operational support asset of the
Nexico City Station and, as such, will run for an indefinite periodɗf time.

Raymond H. GERENDE is the only LEEMPTY agent who has cover provided by
KUBARK. GeRENDE ostensibly is a salesman for LISTERINE's firm. However, he
seldom spends any time pursuing his cover occupation, since his operational
activities are so numerous and time consueding. GEREADE's cover with the LISTERINE
firm was arranged by the Station and, so far, has been adequate for GERÄNDE's needs.

16. Special Problems and Commitments:
8.
No commitments, expressed or implied, have been made to any LIEMPTY
agent by the present Case Officer, except as stated in the project outline and/or
in the contracts of OPAZADE and SCANELING.
b. In the event of compromise to the local government of any LIEMPTY agent,
KUBARK is morally responsible for doing all within its power, and within the
limitations of security, for resettling or otherwise taking care of the LIEMPTY
agents.
No special benefit commitments have been made to any LIEMPTY agent except
those contained in the contracts of GERENDE and SCANTLING.
0.
d.
A change of government or political conditions in Mexico will not affect
this project. It is a unilateral effort on the part of KUBARK.

b. The Case Officer, Quinton N. OUSLER, is known only to GERENDE and
SCANTLING. It would not be possible to develop a suitable cover story that
would apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal
Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are usually conducted in the
Case Officer's car. However,
However, suitable cover stories have been developed between the
Case Officer and SCANTLING and between the Case Officer and GERENDE involving back-
ground information as to how we met and how our friendship developed, to be used
in the event the Case Officer is apprehended with either of the Principal Agents.
J
C. None of the status cover occupations of any of the LIEMPTY agents is
completely compatible with his operational activities. Action cover stories are
decided upon before each assignment and devised to complement each agent's status
cover as closely as possible. Base House operators, of course, generally conduct
operational assignments within the confines of their quarters; consequently, the
need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between
GERENDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3.
11. Contact and Communication:
Appropriate clandestine communications arrangements exist between the various
echelons of LIEMPTY. At the present time these plans consist of regular and
rapid-non scheduled (emergency) means of contact. GERENDE and SCANTLING are both
in the process of preparing detailed written communications plans for their
respective agents which include complete regular, alternate and rapid-non
scheduled meeting arrangements. Provisions will also be made in these plans for
oral recognition signals and physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown
to the agent to contact him should the need ever arise. The Case Officer is cur-
rently working on a Warning System of Communications which will permit the ex-
peditious exfiltration of GERENDE and SCANTLING from Mexico should a security
situation arise which would necessitate this.
12. Central and Motivation:
8. Control - All LIEMPTY agents are local nationals. GERENDE and SCANTLING,
both of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PBPRIME and still
have relatives living in PBPRIME, are in many respects more pro-PBPRIME than
many PRPRIME citizens. In the past, both GERENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced
a high degree of loyalty to Matthew S: DINGLEY, their former Station Case Officer,
and appear to be devoting that same loyalty to the present Case Officer. The
control over GERENDE and SCANTLING stems directly from their pro-PBPRIME beliefs
and their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officers. The control
over other LIEMPTY agents is based in part on pre-PEPRIME attitudes and on the
financial remuneration and good handling they received from GERENDE and SCANTLING.
Realistically, control over LIEMPTY agents is based on mutual understandings and
confidence among individuals and should any agent decide to denounce PBPRIME or
KUBARK, as the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.
->
b. Motivation With the exception of GERENDE and SCANTLING, whose primary
motivations are ideological, financial compensation seems to be the basic
motivational factor surrounding LIEMPTY agents.

Changes:
!
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-7 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.
Accomplishments:
1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy.
Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

Station case officer. LIEMPTY-13 and his family (seo
paragraph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct
their surveillance operation from it during daylight hours
(0800-1800)
* .
3. LIEMPTY-13 (201-119961) is the key member of the
LILYRIC basehouse team. He maintains contact with the
principal agent and does some photographic work. However
because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside as an industrial
engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the
LILYRIC photographic equipmont, and most of this work is
done by his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26
and LIEMPTY-27 (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow).
4. LIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographor
and observer at the LILYRIC basehouse. She works closely
with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, in running the operation,
including the preparation of observation reports and logs.
She also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife
would do.
5. LIEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and
LIEMPTY-14, has been a student at the Mexican Technological
Institute. In his spare time he operates the LILYRIC photo-
graphic equipment, and helps LIEMPTY-14 in maintaining the
arrival and departure logs of target personalities.
6. LIEMPTY-27 (201-762112), another son of LIEMPTY-13
and LIEMPTY-14, has been a prep school student. Ho assists
in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.
7.
LICALLA (MEXI-03) is a basehouse located behind
the Soviet Embassy. It has been in operation since 1957.
The building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as
LIMUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through
LIMOUSINE in September 1957, and the property is in his
name. The LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see¨
paragraph 8. below) and he runs the surveillance operation
from it.

8 LIEMPTY 9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating
from the LICALLA site: He does all the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares observation reports. He also main-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 is a
part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.
9. Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national
contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher
and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with the LIEMPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1).
.
10. Bruce H. FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative
matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.
11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance
units. The work is done by LIEMPTY-4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIEMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.
.
12. LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required. He does this work at night
in the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
as a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE,
in whose home the laboratory is located.

Project LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. The
aim is to identify and cover the movements of persons
entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and
visitors. The intelligence collected through such activity
contributes to the Station's overall Soviet operations
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some
extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.
Description:
1. The Project operates through two fixed basehouse
surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a
principal agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub-
agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains visual and
photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front
entrance. One sub-agent, operating from a second base-
house, covers an area in back of the Embassy, where Soviet
officials meet, play and work. These units photograph all
persons moving in or out of the specific target areas. They
also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed
activity. All of this material is passed to the principal
agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-
ing a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the
film is processed and printed, the principal agent passes
the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the
Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,
each agent and his role in the operation follows.

Changes:
1 The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
a growing demand for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial
aspects of the change.
2. Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security.
problem (sec Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on.
9 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has
"caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved
considerably.
Accomplishments:
In
1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed.
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed.
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-
ations program.
2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at

t
;
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the meeting site and this
person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the Soviets in Mexico.
3. Within one week after a biannual change of license
plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of the new tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his
last few days in Mexico.
4. LIEMPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Embassy backyard.
This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.
5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico. The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
"restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

4. Foreign Currency: There is no special need for
foreign currency. No non-CIA funds are used.
5. Commitments: Christmas bonuses to all agents
totaling $2,354 for FY 1971, and termination pay in an
amount to be determined by the agents record and length
of service.
6. Funding: Funds are hand-carried from the Station
case officer to FERNALD, and from FERNALD to the sub-agents.
The transfer of funds takes place under clandestine meeting
conditions, and appropriate security measures are always
taken.
7. Accountability: FERNALD accounts in detail to his
case officer, who in turn submits receipts to the Station
and certifies that funds were spent to cover expenses for
which it was intended.

several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known. Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.
6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. The LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations.
Problems:
1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
that has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of
the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.
Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose him as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided
that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end of FY 1979. GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve

*project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount. .
2. Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged.”. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target area. Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIEMPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY–4
directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-
ation and collect the product.
Coordination:
Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.
Future Plans:
1.
The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).
2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters
⚫ in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents
and two baschouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET

Agent termination was accomplished without any
immédiate difficulties; however, continued security will
depend on the terminated agents' silence. In the event
there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR's
operations.
3.
The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc-
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination
costs. This project action requests this additional
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.

ment/termination request.

LIEMPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only agent operating
from the LICALLA site. He does all the photography, main-
taina logs and prepares observation reports. He also main-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 is a
part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.
9. Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
principal agent for this project. He is a Mexican national
contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher
and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with the LIEMPTY agents, paesing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1),
10. Bruce H. FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERNALD, a U.8. citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. He also handles administrative
matters, including agent salary payments. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.
11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance
units. The work is done by LIEMPTY–4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIEMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.
12. LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required. He does this work at night
in the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
as a medical doctor, and he is a brother-in-law of GERENDE,
in whose home the laboratory is located.

several other times during his stay in Nexico City and
had contact with other known Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.
6.
At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. The LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations.
Problems:
•
1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
that has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behalf of
the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDS's Agency employment and
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.
Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose hin as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDS and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDI's cover and that of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided
that continued employment of GERUNDS is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end of FY 1970. GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve

Changes:
1.
The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
a growing demand for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both 1
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial
aspects of the change,
2. Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY |
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
problem (see Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved
considerably.
Accomplishments:
1
In
1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed.
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-
ations program.
2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to meet a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the meeting site and this
person is believed to be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the Soviets in Mexico.
3. Within one week after a biannual change of license
plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a
complete list of the now tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his
last few days in Mexico.
4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitato to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Embassy backyard.
This fact enabled the Station to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.
5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurato
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN,· mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
YerofeyevoA KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico. The sume applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officor.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, & known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
"restricted arca" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIKMPTY was able to observe
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV· also visited the Soviet Embassy

project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is being amended to cover this amount.
3. Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target area. Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIEMPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for "Victor”
(FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-
ation and collect the product.
Coordination:
Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY.
Future Plans:
2
1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).
2. The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dateḍ emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters
in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

SUBJECT
:
Renewal of Project LIEMPTY
1. WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's
Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal
Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termin-
ation payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife. Last
year LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970. One agent termination
and the transfer of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to
another project are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.
2. LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It includes a
Principal Agent, Raymond H. GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who
maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in
the rear of the Soviet Embassy, from which anyone entering or
leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed. The
various members of the team handle and service the photographic
equipment, develop and print photographs, keep observation
reports and logs, including the arrival and departure of tar-
get persons, and maintain the two safehouses mentioned above.
3.
This project does not provide positive intelligence,
except incidentally. It is designed to furnish a running
account, both photographic and in writing, of all Soviet
Embassy personnel and their visitors arriving at, or leaving,
the Embassy. Photographs taken by LIEMPTY personnel were
used to produce an updated "mugbook" on Soviet officials in
Mexico which has been loaned to other US security agencies
for operational use in activities targeted against Soviet
services in Mexico City. LIEMPTY agents also provided infor-
mation which enabled the Station to identify the companions of
known KGB officials, to identify the habit patterns of new
arrivals at the Soviet Embassy and provided a wealth of other
information of operational value concerning Soviet Embassy
activities.
4. A security problem, resulting in a Station decision
to restrict the activities of GERENDE, place him on half pay,
and replace him with a career agent (a valuable asset who

also handles SB operations) arose during the project year.
GERENDE has been having marital difficulties which may end
in divorce. Along with other incompatible features of the
marriage, which have resulted in numerous family fights,
there have been long, bitter and violent arguments as to who
will have custody of their 4 children and concerning a mone-
tary settlement: The Station has become involved in these
altercations because GERENDE's wife is knowledgeable of his
CIA relationship and could, if she chose to do so, expose him
as an agency employee.
employee. She has promised to keep quiet but
there is no assurance that she will do so. In view of the
risk involved, should GERENDE's wife expose his agency rela-
tionship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years
of service and his undisputed ability and experience, other
unfavorable qualities militate against his retention, the
Station is considering terminating GERENDE. It is proposed
to pay him a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of
service in accordance with Mexican law and his wife $2,500 as
a security measure designed to keep her quiet. After discus-
sion with the desk, FI Staff believes that, if GERENDE is
paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to
him in one lump sum but should be paid on a monthly basis,
the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus
eliminating the possibility of his squandering it all at
once and possibly coming back for more of the same. The same
procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his
wife. In both cases at least an element of control is
assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-
tinued receipt of their monthly payments will depend upon
their continued loyalty to the agency. In the meantime, we
feel this man, whose morale, and ability have been seriously
affected by his marital strife, given time, can perhaps be
rehabilitated and once again become a valuable Station asset.
This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income
out of which to pay his alimony. Aside from the foregoing
there were no other problems, security or otherwise. All
meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent
are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary,
at prearranged dates, times and places. Meetings
Meetings between the
P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The
Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-
contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly
program report for this project.
5. Agents' salaries, safehouse rentals, motor vehicle
maintenance and travel, property maintenance and Christmas
bonuses will total $23,635. Despite the security aspects

5. Project LIEMPTY contributes substantially to the Mexican
Station's SB effort. The occasional identification of U.S. nationals
in contact with the Soviets could have an important bearing on National
Security. The operation is handled by an experienced and capable,.
outside contract agent under the direction of a Station officer which
-provides good security and personnel economy. It is a well managed and
productive operational support mechanism necessary to Station opera-
tions. FI Staff recommends approval.

5 JUN 1969
: FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970
1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican
Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet
personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.
From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-
graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were
completed by personnel in this project. SB Division is pleased with
the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them
useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the
past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in
Mexico City and their photographs were identified by the FBI. There
is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City
and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.
2. There have been no significant security problems.
3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and
termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken
from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who
serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and
was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was
added to the project.
4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse
rental and maintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval
was for $43,520 and estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.
A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.

LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970)
1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in
the amount of $38,970. Funds are available in WH Division.
$45,000 was programmed for FY 1970.
2. LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations
of the Mexico City Station. It provides for two basehouses,
a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic
and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently,
two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the
location from which the photographs are taken and observers
are stationed. One basehouse is adjacent to the rear of the
Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work. The
other basehouse is across the street from the front of the
Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or
leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW
van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station
operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H.
GERENDE, an indigenous contract agent, is the principal agent
of the operation and meets daily with the `basehouse keepers
and subagents.
3.
LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's
Soviet operations program and is considered an essential
element of the Station's support apparatus. During the
period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi-
mately 21,367 photographs were taken.
photographs were taken. In response to a
request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the
following comment was received: "There are few such sources
of high resolution photographs of Soviets, especially giving
good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division
since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity
data..." The photos are useful to the Station in confirming
the identities of Soviet personnel and visitors to the

Embassy, some of whom are U. S. citizens. During the past
year, several of these U. S. citizens were identified with
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI).
Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are
studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends
and associates, especially Mexican nationals, This informa-
tion is useful in target studies. For example, the senior
TASS representative, a known XGB officer, is a recruitment
target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for
leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts.
LIEMPTY support is an integral part of this current develop-
mental activity.
4.
During the past year, one of the three basehouses
was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was
terminated. This was done because the agent was becoming
less effective with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those
of another. The termination was amicable, and the working
hours of the personnel of the other basehouse were extended
slightly. Another agent was also hired to help. This new
agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel
occupying the basehouse, and no additional security risks are
anticipated from this addition.
5. There have been no security or administrative prob-
lems. The Station and GERENDE are constantly on the alert
for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance
activities. While it is quite possible that the Soviets are
aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they
are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by
them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy.
6.
Approval is recommended of this valuable operational
support project.

Amendment
: Project KDFACTOR
and Termination Request.
}
1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.
2.
->
The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
ADDC in the amount of $19,000 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 for FY 73. Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment 10. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY - 72 to provide for costs of agent
terminations.
3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.
4. The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412. The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

PROJECT : LIEMPTY

Mexico
1 Dec 67 - 30 Jun 69'
PURPOSE: An operational support project providing three basehouses and
a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet
Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo-
graphic surveillance.
BACKGROUND: The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy
(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one behind the
garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried
out. It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck.
Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous
support tasks such as servicing postal boxes and for counter-
surveillance and other protective services.
PROGRESS: During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera-
tional photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the
Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel.
SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionably
made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet
Operations program of the Mexico Station.
FUNDS
The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-
gence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet
officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,
who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out
of the building with whom. (One photograph from this project was ✓
used in the Warren Commission Report.)

LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Soviet target. Some of these agents are
used also in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.
3.
This project is only part of the complex of
Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI.
It
is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation
serving important needs.
4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
personnel or operational techniques have been introduced
nor have there been any known incidents adversely
affecting the security of the project or its personnel
since the previous project renewal period. As a uni-
lateral operational support effort, LIEMPTY continues to
be a most useful station asset supporting a number of
station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
as discussed above, the project is considered to be holding
the line on cost and personnel.
5. The objectives of project LIÈMPTY are in direct
support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
Operating Directive for Mexico. It is considered by SB
Division to have made significant contributions to the
Station's well developed, high priority Soviet Operations
Program. During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
house installations produced valuable information in the
form of photographic coverage and physical surveillance
reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.
In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
intelligence service connections of Soviet officers in the
Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party
targets.

LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting
1 December 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest
increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the
estimated total disbursement of $40, 130 for the past
project year. This will provide for small salary increases
Ne to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents
involved in the project who have not received raises in
some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth
year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection
of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City, including the identification and movements of its
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY provides
for the maintenance and exploitation of three basehouses
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the
Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of a
panel truck used for mobile photography against the Polish
Embassy, leaders and meeting sites of local communist
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important
corollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in
the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and
operations, including those of other bases and stations
as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit.
The funds requested include $43,520 for the period 1
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30
June 1969. The latter funds are asked for in a supple-
mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.
A long-term contract agent and eight other support
agents are involved in the management and operation of the

project, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral
Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican
law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested. Termination payments made to each
agent are as follows:

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
law and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.
5. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.
6.
It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this
project.

COMMENTS: FI and CI Staffs concur in renewal.
CI STAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close
monitering of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and
attempts to obtain information on sensitive project personali-
ties. The Station should devise necessary contingency plans
of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined
that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be
getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities
and activities.

SUBJECT:
MTS/BG
Project LIEMITY
1. This action seeks renewal of Project LIEVITY covering
Mexico City Station's stationary surveillance basehouses almed
against the Soviet Embassy. The activity will cost 45,000 for
the period 1 December 1966 to 30 November 1967. Approval is
recommended.
2. Project LIEMPTY has been in being for alve years. At
present it supports three stationary basehouses near the Soviet
Embussy and a mobile photographic basehouse. These are used to
obtain photographic coverage and logs of Soviet movements and
visitors to the Soviet Embassy. The mobile basehouse is used
also to cover meeting sites of the local communist parties and
turgets of opportunity.
3. A principal agent and eight agents are used in the
LIEM-TY activity. The agents are variously employed as basehouse
keepers, photo lab technicians and surveillance operators.
4. Security has been generally good although one incident
occurred in mid 1966 which may have some impact on the future
security of the operation. An approach was made to an agent of
the Station, who owns a small store near the Soviet Embassy, to
report on his neighbors among whom are some of the LIEMPTY agents.
One, LIEMPTY-6, wis mentioned by name. The Station is watchins
this development curefully.
4. The LIEMPTY activity proved its worth during the past
yeur when check was made on conflicting stories told by two
Station agents. The LIEMPTY surveillance reports proved that one
of the agents was lying about his contacts with the Soviets.
LIMITY is well managed and continues to serve an important Mexics
City Station need.

PROJECT BRIEFING

11 Jan 67
PROJECT: LIEMPTY
ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal
WH Mexico City
->
1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67
PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy
and a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders.
PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-.
vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.
Throughout the past renewal period each operational component
contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks levied on the Station. In the first nine-month
period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These
served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and
their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The
mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1,000 individual photo-
graphs. Of particular value were photographs of local and
exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued
in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall
operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project
case officer.
PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the
Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached
him and asked him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly the
Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC.
However, in view of LICOWL's previous history of lying, it is
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just
what LICOWL/1 may have told them. The Station is still looking
into this development.

.
5. One development which may affect the security
of the LIEMPTY basehouses of LIMITED and LILÝRIC
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small
store near the Soviet Embassy) reported that a Soviet
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and
requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly
the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse)
by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed)
of the new building which now houses LILYRIC. The
Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being
built by a person who fit perfectly the description of
LIMOUSINE. LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet
reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE. The occupants of
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1
indicated to his Station contact that the only person
he really suspected in the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6
(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing,
lives comfortably, and owns a car. He claims to have
heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the
Americans. (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio
and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it
∙is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has
already assumed that the Soviets have identified this
basehouse.) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons
named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever
with CIA.
6.
The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become
an informant on his neighbors. According to LICOWL-1,
he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to
collect the information the Soviet wanted. However,
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked
of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the
Soviets. The Station is still looking into this develop-
ment.
7.
WHD recommends renewal of this Project.

PURPOSE:
PROGRESS:
1 Dec 65 - 30 Nov 66
To provide support for mobile and stationary photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a dispatching base
for a physical surveillance team.
Assets included under the project include three base-
houses which provide front and rear views of the Soviet
Embassy, and a panel truck equipped for spot photo
coverage. Raymond H. GERENDE (p), principal agent,
meets the basehouse keepers regularly, maintains regular
contact with the mobile photo unit and with the develop-
ing and processing base. He also performs many other
support functions.
The photographs from all these operations have been of
value to the Station in operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, and
for Headquarters permanent files. The Station believes
that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of
the overall operational program levied on the Station by
the RMD.

SUBJECT
:
LIEMPTY Project Renewal
1. It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be
renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30
November 1967 for a total of $45,000: $29,020 for
FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968. The Project is in-
cluded in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000.
Funds are available within WH Division.
2.
LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-
houses targeted against the Soviet Embassy. These
basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. Two
of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the
activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides
coverage of the back courtyard area. The LIEMPTY project
also covers a mobile photographic basehouse in the form
of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy
where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and
against other targets of opportunity.
3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover-
åge during the past year was proven when the logs
maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on an
operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL-1 who had told
conflicting stories of certain events concerning the
activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance
reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,
it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just
taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying
about his contacts with the Soviets.
4. The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was
targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local
Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,
particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in
Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

Project LISMPTY Receval
1. FI Staff recommends approval of the renewal of Project
LIEMPTY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following
Mexico City assets: a panel truck used for mobile photography,
three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract
agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base homes is
used as a control point to dispatch a surveillance team. (The
latter is not a part of the project, however.)
2. The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet
activities in Mexico City. LEMPTY is part of the complex of
station instruments by means of which requirements from a variety
of U.S. agencies are met. One of the sites provided pictures
later used in the Warren Commission Report, and the publication
of the report created a security hazard. The Station moved the
site and it is now back in operation.
3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to
the surveillance team has been carefully weighed recently by SR,
the desk, O/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears
to have been taken with due deliberation.
:
4. This is clearly an effective, well-managed operation
serving an important need. We recommend renewal without hesitation.

:
1. The attached project, originating in WH Division,
is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960
through 30 November 1961. The project provides for physi-
cal and photographic surveillance operations in support
and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations,
particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and in-
stallations.
2. Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 in fiscal year 1961,
and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the availabil-
ity of funds. The amount includes $38,000 compensation
for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an
hourly basis, and eleven surveillance and support agents;
$7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post
office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information,
vehicle maintenance, and operational travel); $2,500 re-
placement, repair and maintenance of photographic equip-
ment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and mainte-
nance.
3. The field's renewal request, supported by a cover-
ing memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments
of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and
estimates effectiveness. It is noted that one principal
agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and
the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him
will be transferred to project LITEMPO, consequently being
omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses con-
tinue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which
compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the
LIMERICK installation, together with attendance lists of
LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

5. The photographs from all these operations are of
value to the Station in their operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, which
are often used by surveillance teams and singleton agents
in identifying Soviets, and for Headquarter's permanent
files.
6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last
year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis-
patching from the LIMITED installation might have made this
base a target for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth
with the Office of Communications, TSD, and SR Divisions.
The Station has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa-
bility and they have developed a signaling system and inter-
car communications system that will leave the LIEMBRACE
surveillance cars on the air for a minimum of time, and
with limited open conversation. The result of Headquarters
and the. Station's research on this problem resulted in the
conclusion that, if a surveillance team is to operate with
automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient
surveillance, and regardless of what presently availab_le
type of scrambling or coding is used, radio is susceptible
to monitoring by the opposition. It was therefore concluded
that if the Station is to use the LIEMBRACE team against
members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to
be used as the radio dispatching center and the risk factor
must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient
commo system is devised.

LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance
units at the Station, both of which are used extensively
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage
of diplomatic installations, agent meetings, and current
identification photos of targets among others.
4. Although there are three stationary photo
basehouses under this Project all targeted against the
Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened
through the termination of any of them. LICALLA covers
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is
in a unique position to observe informal meetings and
activity there. In May 1965 a thorough assessment was
made of this basehouse to determine whether an audio
installation could be based here, directed against these
garden conversations. It was determined that due to the
high incidence of street and other noises, this was not
practical. TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this
requirement, however, and if any new equipment is
developed which might make this operation more feasible
it will be tested. LIMITED and LILYRIC which both cover
the front entrance, provide coverage during different
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

of opportunity. This basehouse also provides photographic
coverage, concentrated on visitors. (b) LILYRIC which pro-
vides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors to,
as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares
weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, and
reports on license numbers of all cars visiting the instal-
lation. (c) LICALLA, which concentrates on photographic
coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well
as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs
of the target employees, and as well as personnel changes.
Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile
LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p)
continues to coordinate basehouse activities; principal
agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) continues to be an independent
asset used to follow-up and exploit operational information
on target personnel and installations, to case various in-
stallations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING
has managed the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO in the interim following the resignation of CLACKETT.
The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA basehouse
were suspended in September 1960 as the result of the ar-
rest of a knowledgeable TSD technician in another area and
it is not known precisely when it will be possible to re-
sume these operations. The Station believes that the
GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements
and SCANTLING will soon be relieved from his interim respon-
sibility for the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and
casing activities. It is not planned in the coming year to
expand project activities.
4. Appropriate Special Staff components concur in rec-
ommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance
that the transfer of the unilateral surveillance team to
LITEMPO will not affect its independent status, and remarks
that the current project review presents a clearer picture
of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous
one.

1. The attached project, originating in Wil Division, is
presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1959 through ·
31 November 1960. The project provides for physical and photo-
graphic surveillance operations in support and exploitation of
other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at
Soviet personnel and installations.
2.
Authority is requested to obligate $84,910 from the
DD/P-Wil Division operating budget: $40,480 for fiscal year
1060 and $26,423 for fiscal 1:01, subject to the availability
of funds These pums include $01,010 compensation for five
contract agents (three of whom serve as principal agents for
segments of the project), and sixteen support agents; 3,500
for vehicle maintenance and commercial carrier travel; $7,500
for operational equipment: $5,000 for maintenance of three
safehouses; $2,000 for addisional cafehouse, post office box,
and vehicle rental; $1,000 exchange commodities; $2,000 key
money, broken contracts, etc.; and 2,000 for the purchase of
information, documents, parvent of bribes, etc.
3. The attached renewal request, prepared in the Division
and supported by a project review prepared in the Field, reviews
the activities of the project during the past year and present
a detailed breakdown of the funds requested. The project
operates in three coone: (a) contract agent Oliver G.
JCANTLING is an independens asset who is used to follow-up and
exploit operational information on target personnel and installa-
tions, to case various installations of interest, acquire pro-
perty, etc.; (b) a photographic surveillance team, under prin-
cipal agent Raymond H. GENENDE, utilizing three houses or apart-
ments and one photo truck; and (e) a physical surveillance team
under principal agent Simon D. SLACKETT, consisting of three
trained members at the present tine. The attached renewal
request reviews the activities and accomplishments of the pro-
Ject in terms of these three segments and in relation to pro-
ject objectives. SCANTLING's contribution to the collection
of operational information pertaining to Soviet personnel and
installations is regarded by the Station as unique. He also

SCANTLING also has rendered valuable support to the LITAC IT
operation having gained entry to the target under a Fabri-
cated cover. Nc has also eased and prepared reports on the
LITABLY target in preparation for future operations and per-
formed investigations of murous other Station targets or
opportunity. He investigated many leads from other audio-
surveillance operations chabling the Station to maintain
current data on various Series contacts and resulting in a
recruitment attempt which, while unsuccessful, is believed
to indicate future potential along this line. He has fur-
ther been used to develop radte procedures for the mobile
teams and to rent various properties in support of other
Station operations. The segment, using three base
GD
houses for photography, produced upwards of 10,000 photo-
graphs during the year. One base has recently begun taking
motion pictures of Soviet personel in the course of conver-
sation which have been forwarded to FI/D for possible exploita-
tion by lip reading analysis. This segment also operates the
mobile radio surveillance vehioles. A mobile photography sur-
veillance truck has been used during the project year for
coverage of various Station gets which do not warrant the
establishment of permanent photographie. bases. GERENDE has
also served to rent post office boxes, hotel rooms, etc., in
support of other Station operations. During the past project
year CLACKETT, who returned to Nexico in early April 1959
after Headquarters training, spent the following two months
being trained by SCANTLING in mobile surveillance techniques.
He then undertook training of a four member team which was
Judged ready for operational use toward the end of the project
year. Two additional contract agents, Wilma J. FIORDALISI and
Louise J. MACKINO, performed translation and support functions.
Appropriate staff components concur in recommending

renewal.
a) UI Staff notes that the CI value of the project
1s difficult to judre since it appears that much of the
material produced remains in the Station for exploita-
tion. However, CI Staff remarks that the value of the
project should be increased when the CLACKETT surveil-
lance team enters into active operation. GI Staff sug-
gests that the Station be queried as to the pretext or
circumstances under which SCANTLING frequently visits
Inez Porada de Moreno, the occupant of the property
adjacent to the Soviet installation.
