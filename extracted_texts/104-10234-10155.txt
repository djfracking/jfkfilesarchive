that STOCKWOOD met AMLASH/1 and UNIT/1,
mably in alias but I do not lose the
Gotails. It was ales apparant by the time AMLASKŷl left that ke keser URISNAPU/5 was
worlding for KUBARK and we imar that WHICHAPO/7 was aware to some extent of AMLASH/1's
plame (UNSELFW/9 had Sung been recruited by KUBARK at that time). It was agreed
that AMLASH/1 would used the address of UNSHAFW/13's parents for s/w letters to
KUBARK (UNISHA PU/19 is vifo of UNBXAFU/9).'
AMLASH/1 mart arrived in Paris in late November or early December 19th. AMSHI P/1

TRONAPU/5,
You will recall that in December 196h UNSKAPU/S had a nervous breakdown and
AFLASH/1 played an importent part in convinaing UMSHAFT/5 that be should agree to
hospitali gation. It was in this commation that CLOADEN and RODAMOR met AMLASH/1.
GLOADEN subsequently met with AKASHA1 two or three times to received reports for
STOCEFOOD. These meetings vere sikrest meetings or in the ham of TMONAFI/3.
During this stay, AMASH/1 trevaled to Madrid at least one to meet with AMEIDDY/2
and AMBANG/L. I am not mare of results of these metings except that AFLASH/1 was
seeking the physical instrumente to carry out his plan to eliminate AMTHUO.
UHDKAPU/5.
There was no additional contest with AMLASH/1 in Paris subsequent to February
1965 but the Station (CLOACE and MIRLETS) dié have subsequent contact with UNSMAFU/5,
UNSHAFU/9, ANLASH/2 and AMLASE/3. You will recall thatit was ANLABR/3 who mdo
the "joking" pitch to MELLES en 6 197 1965. AMLASH/2 and HLSH/3 were both mare

- Paris Station Aspect
Paris Station involvement with the AMLASH case began in 1962, after AMLASH/1
came to Paris after attending the Helsinki Youth Festival that year. In Helsinid,
AMLASH/1 was contacted by UNRUMELE/2 (an asset of the Paris Station who attended the
Postival for purposes of disruption) and by other KUBARK assets. It is not clear from
our files just whan AMLASH/1 was "recruited" but it appears that he was recruited during
or shortly after the Festival.
In Paris he was in contact with Peter J. KYMINGHAM (probably in alias although
I know that AMLASH/1 was at KYMINGHAM's home upon socasion). In 1962 AMLASH/1 was
given training in explosives by OTEX (I believe) upon request of the Paris Station.
He appears to have returned to PBRIPES in late 1962. It is not loown if other Paris
Station personnal were in content with AMLASH/1 during that period.
11
AMLASH/1 ment arrived in Paris on 14, September 1963, coming from the International
Games held in Porto Alegre, Brasil, where he was in contact with TYPIC officers,
At éhis point AMSFORT/1 (now QUSPORT) was in contest with AMLASH/2.in Paris and ANS/HIP/1
was another comms channel (the cas being used primarily by Hqs.). The Emadquarters
TIFIC officer, ONTRICH (F), arrived in Paris on 3 October 1963 and picked up the contact
with AMLASH/1 which was being maintained by AMSPORT/1 and IDIMHM THE metings with
AMLASH/2 took place in KTHIM's hom as best I remember. These discussions concerned
AMLASH/1's plane to assissinate AMTEO and overthrow his regime.
OUTRICH returned to Paris In late October, after discussions at Headquarters
were
on the cass. ONTKION ERS DAIWILD, who was tay in Paris at the time, not with AMLASH/1
in late Ostober or early November. DAI HOLD's participation was due to AMLASH/1 strong
desire to talk with som high-loval ODYOKE official concerning his plans and to obtain
Mə
OUTOXE blessing if possible. I m not ware of exactly what happened at these
meetings but I received the impression from KYMMOHAN that sush blessing was given.
ELASI/1 returned to PBRIJMEN on 27 Eovember 1963. It was during this visit to Paris
