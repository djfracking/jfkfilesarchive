1. Station regrets the delay in keeping Headquarters informed
of the progress of our association with LICOOKY-1. When the
proposed amendment to the LIREAM Project involving WICOCKY was
turned down, we informed her on her return to Mexico that we could
no longer justify the continued association at the present rate
pinte wo wow simply moi selling, us
she could regularize ber status here and obtain working papers, De
would be more than happy to conclude a new arrangement with her.
She felt there was little chance of this, and we then told her we
would conclude our arrangement with her sometime in the summer. Ag
indicated in paragraph 2 of the attachment, the date has now been
established as 30 June, at which time all outstanding financial
arrangements with her will be terminated and she will be given her
air fare to New York.
1
2. Unfortunately, LICOOKI-l seems to be incapable of realizing
which side her bread is buttered on, at least here in Nexico. She
cannot parcel her time out to her various interests, and therefore
finds all her time taken up by her unpaid AIMAC duties. The profiles
we bave been harping on have not materialized except for the one
submitted under HA-28831. We still hope for one on Francisco
VILIAGRAN Kramer and such of the Mexican literary figures as amount
in her judgment to "non-pignies.' Fe are not sanguine. Be are
still after a copy of Osegueda's paper on university reform.

c.
LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her
time to the Mexican Writers' Association (AEM). She
continues to handle most of its administrative work.
She also organizes and does most of the work on the
majority of the projects or activities which the
AEM sponsors.
L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the
Latin American Writers' Community (CLE), including
198***
the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.
She reported on the steps taken by Mario Monteforte
Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967
Congress in Mexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.
L-ì supplied information on reactions among the Cen-
tral American community in Mexico to the Guatemalan
election campaign and results.
d. She maintained contact with and reported on individuals
of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,
Carlos Pellicer Cámara, Manuel Germán Parra, Francisco
Villagran Kramer, and Raúl Osegueda Pelala.

3. The advance made her st Headquarters is being held
over bar as an inducement to give us the balance of har time
before departure and finish in a blaze of activity. If she
does this, we will write off the advance here. If she does
not, $195 of the advance will be counted as her February
salary, $18 28 travel expenses from New York to Washington
and the remainder will be written off.
4. Rather than go through the formality of a project

tivities at the AEM. There are enough jobs that
need doing at AEM to occupy her full-time and there-
fore the immediate partial withdrawal from AEM work
is a prerequisite to the accomplishment of these
assignments.
Because L-1 has played such a key role in all AEM
activities, and therefore in determining the direc-
tion and scope of these activities, her sudden with-
Hunwol mould result in important changes within AEM.
1
Any major change in direction by AEM would probably
become predictable once the identity of the person
or persons who will move in to fill the vacancy left
by L-1 become known. By having L-1 step aside now,
rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Mexico,
she may then be able to provide Station with an ac-
curate account of any change resulting from her with-
drawal.
1. d. L-2 has not been met regularly since 25 January. On
that date he was given a mailing address which he uses
to request a meeting only if he has information to
report. L-2 is paid on a piece-rate basis for infor-
mation supplied and does not receive a regular salary.

better than we had expected. It is unfortunate that "Janet"
is not available to query about the material allegedly turned
in following L-l's return from Venezuela, since she is so in-

3. This is the first of a series of profiles we hope L-1
can get around to preparing before she leaves Mexico.

3. L-1 has been instructed to do her best to obtain
Subject's manuscript on university reform, which is now in the
hands of someone at the UNAM press. This could be a highly
popular subject in the train of the current trouble at the UNAN.
No indexing is requested here since nothing of substance
is said about anyone except subject.

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement
was reached that the WOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.
A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached
herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No admin-
istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters
in this instance, of Low/1 was not being paid by us here, and
was formally terminated once before (1966). Her file can be retired,
again, and this time presumably will be the last time.
25
2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 holds no ill-
will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship
with WOFIRM anymore.
3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time
to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the
meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten
to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal
contact.

1. A meeting with LICCOKY/1 was held at 1100 hours, Friday,
5 April 1968. We breakfasted, and then held the meeting at the
BARTHOLOMEW site. As is detailed below, we reached a mutual
agreement that the relationship was not worth pursuing this was
thoroughly amicable, and recontact methods are available on both
sides.
& 5)
2. Substantive matters first. LICOOKY/1 said that John GERASSI
nad been in Won 20 ::
Low on 23 March for the day. He was invited to lunch
at the CMUN that day, Sunday. Apparently, GERASSI, is back in the
good graces of the Cuban regime. He told LICCOKY/1 that he would
be spending this Summer in Arizona.
3. LICOOKY/1 has been commissioned by M. S. ARNONI, editor
of The Minority of One, to write a piece on the recent intellectual/
political developments in Czechoslovakia.

LICOOKY/1 thought up, and is arranging, a Czech film festival
to Regin 15 April. It is to be sponsored by the St. Clemens Film
Association, St. Clemens Church, 423 West 46th Street (this church
houses the American Place Theatre Robert LOWELL's group). LICOCKY/1
got this idea from the recent Czech travails -- which she hails as
evidence of the power of Czech intellocracy and from the common
Referred to in paragraph 3 above. Se contacted the Czech UN MissiVIA
which put her in touch with PAVLIC, the Czech Cultural Attache in
the Washington Embassy. PAVLIC was all for the idea, and will be
ere for the opening of the festival. Milos FORMAN (director
the film "Loves of a Blonde") is currently here at the Hotel Ches
\(a "dump on 23rd on the West Side" LICOOKY/i's characterizati
and will participate in the festival. KADAR (director of the "..
of Main Street") has been invited to participate. LICOOKY/1
ging to ask PAVLIC whether it would be OK for her to ask DRV.……….
nes film at Columbia and who is a Czech in exile, to part_į…ate.
COKY/1 is̟ very enthusiastic about this venture.
5. COMMENT: Wlos FORMAN is mentioned in the article about

: Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of Estel
Sakolowska
3.
1.
On 7 February LICOOKY-1 told the writer that Estel
Sakolowska, a long-time acquaintance, had told her that she
is planning a trip to Cuba. Sakolowska is now married to
Mario Madrigal, a Costa Rican medical doctor who is now in
Cuba.
Sakolowska told LICOOKY-1 that she is now in the pro-
cess of obtaining a (U.S.) passport for her child so that
they can travel together to Cuba. This is her child's first
passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is
for making a trip to Costa Rica. Sakolowska claims that
the passport application is now in the State Department
"Security Section".
2.
Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-1 that the "Prensa
Latina Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel-
ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba. She believes
this mission is to take place in Miami. LICOOKY-1 reported
that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement
with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may
be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1
further speculates that this may only be a gift to someone
in Cuba.
3.
4.
LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information.
It should be noted, however, that this item was given in a
last minute rush just prior to her departure from the writer.
LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February.
LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time
"left winger". LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and
her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and
Havana in dispatch HMMA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages
4 and 6. This office is planning no further action on this
matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversation
with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand your
office will be coordinating the Subject with the FBI and
State Department.

Mr. Hughes
Rose and George SIHINOW Plans for Vietnam
Conscientious Objector Demonstration
1. Confirming telephone conversation with your office
March 1st the following information was obtained from LICOOKY-1
in Fashington on February 28th:
Rose SIMINOW, 382 Central Park West, New York City,
long-time communist and contact of LICOOKY-1, told 2-1 at
several meetings during February that she was making plans
for a demonstration against the
i
son, George, discharged about September 65 from the military
after active duty in Panama, expected to be recalled for
active duty in Vietnam as a member of a military reserve unit.
It is planned that if recalled George will refuse induction
as a conscientious objector and mass demonstrations will be
promoted in New York. Rose has had discussions with a
"constitutionalist lawyer", one Boudion, to handle the
expected court trial. Boudien's secretary, Teresa, is a
friend of Rose. Rose plans to pay the initial attorney fees
after which she will launch a national drive to raise funds.
According to Rose, Boudine is "swamped" with similar cases.
Rose is employed by Wolf Popper Jones Ross and Wolf. She has
been a secretary for ten to fifteen years.
a. This office is taking no further action on this
report unless so requested. Please advice if this matter is
turned over to the FBI or any other action taken.

TH/C Attention: Mr. Castoro
Alleged Planned Travel to Cuba of
Estelle Sokolowska
CC in
Kemo, Same Subject, Dated 8 February 1936
1. On 22 February LICOOXY-1 told me that the referenced
Pronsa Latina correspondent, according to Sokolowska, had
Just advised her she would receive $300 operational expenses
for the alleged intelligence assignment in the Miami area and
$450 for mal CHRable to Cuba. This information WAS
passed orally to your office 23 February.
2. On 28 February LICOOKY-1 told me that while visiting
with Sokolowska in New York on 23 February two FBI agents
called at the Sokolowska apartment and interviewed Sokolowska
about her intended travel to Cuba. According to L-1 the
agents warned Sokolowska that she would be in serious trouble
if she attempted such trip. The interview went on about thres
hours during which time L-1 remained in Sokolowska's apartment,
sometiree in the living room and sometimes in the kitchen
where the interview reportedly was taking place. L¨l stated
that as a result of the warning by the FBI agents Sokolovska
later told L-1 she would not make the trip.
3. Presumably the FBI, if the above story is accurate,
had reason for this reported action even though from the
limited information available, from L-1, there would seen a
possibility of other more profitable courses of action.
L-1 states that Sokolowska had heard that her
kusband, now in Cuba, was living in Sokolowska's house and
with a nurse to whom he was (engaged). It was partially for
this reason Sokolovska wished to visit Cuba at this time.
5. This office is taking no further action on this
natter unless no requested and suggests that addresSEEN
coordinate any planned advice on this matter to the Bureau.

6. I knew something was bothering LICOOKY/1 and made her
drag it out into the open. She started by remarking that WOFIRM
and its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents
every so often, and that this was the nature of our relationship.
I explained that this was not the case, that I had found out she
was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOKY/1
might be of some value to us. This surprised her, and she apolo- |
gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cuba she had
dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, and when she was involved
with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she
didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to
dealing with top politicos and intellectuals; she referred to a
statement that I had made previously that perhaps she could get
Tana de GAMEZ to invite her along to one of Tana's lunches with
Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said
that she didn't want WOFIRM to think that she would seek out and
cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way.
LICOOKY/1 said that even though Tana was a friend and that she
liked ner, Tana was not ner equal, and that Täna wasn t 'on her
pedeștal". That ALARCON was certainly not in LICOOKY/1's intellectual
category. LICOOKY/1 said that she considered herself as very flexible,
but not that much. LICOOKY/1 is a "special person" and that
WOFIRM bureaucracy' - with the exceptions of "Bill" (her Mexico
case officer, a friend of the writer), C/WH/1 (with whom LICOOKY/1
is particularly taken), and the writer (LICOOKY/1 repeatedly assured
me that she had a very sincere esteem for me)
probably didn't
understand or acknowledge this. LICOCKY/1 said her feelings for
certain WOŞIRMers were one thing, but her dislike of WOFIRM itself
was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel
Angel ASTURIAS as an old "Nicaraguan war-horse" ASTURIAS of
course is Guatemalan. LICOOKY/1 couldn't stop liking Communists
regardless of WOFIRM desires.

7. LICOOKY/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, very
impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor
for the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she does
not wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as
follows:
A. fear of compromise
B.
--
LICCOKY/1 said that were her
relationship with us to become known, it would ruin her
standing in and associations with the intellectual
community;
distaste for WOFIRM

Source explained the Subject promised to sévice source where she

HY until the corning of 10 March in the hope that this information vill be
forthcoming. Source was also requested to consider the feasibility of
visiting the Higxi area to determins Bubject's where; bouts. Source stated
that an excuse for this visit could be to visit Dr. LEAPPER and his wife in
Miami in that they are leaving BT 9 March for a long-planned 10 day holiday
there. Both Subject and Soures are close friends of CHAFFER so this arran
ment would be plausible. In this regard, Bource stated that to save all
concerned from embarassment, she advised SHAFFER not to question Subject tor
closely as to íubject's plans upon Subject's departure from NY in that EǎAPPER
was under the impression that Ɛubject vas travelling directly to Cuba. Eourns
implied to ERAPPER that Subject has to "eera ber vay" to Cuba. SMAPPER

Cubject's cover fer this assignment is to gather material for a book she
plans to write on the Cuban Revolution. The questions themselves are not
intelligence requirements and reputedly are along the lines of "what was
your role in the invasion attempt? Why did your particular sortie fail! :
otc." Pertinent here, however, is that the CUIS rep told subject that he
is very interested in the "Municipalidades" organizational development by
the Cuban exiles. He said this was the smartest thing the exiles have donn.
Soures stated that she understands the exile community has regramped into
cell organizations so that exiles from the same community Tros tasir homes
in Cuba now form the individual cells. In this fashiɔ they can batter
protect themselves from penstration and will be a better informed and
cohesive group. Subject was given $550. for the Miami trip expenses.
Source saw the money. Subject plans to spend two or three weeks on this
mission and then return to BY to report to the CUIS rep.

5. Fubject is taking her two children with her to Mimal and is taking
along a "babysitter." Eubject had mated to take a Puerto Rican girl
aliasinis so we ca
girl could not cètain a leave of absence from har job, the PR girl's brother
is serving as babysitter. He is described as being in his early twenties and
is a supporter of CASTRO. Subject's immediate problam is to obtain entro
to the Cuban exiles and a czesy vay to live in the Kiani ares. To accomplish
this she has re-established contact with a former acquaintence and ally, one
Jerry FEMIN. FB(IF) is described as being an American member of the Willias
Korgen græp in the invasion attempt. Subject mat MEMBRG in the Frente
Candino in Ficaragua. She re-established this contact by finding an old i
Miami telephone number for EDUNG and spore to a person at this number who
identified himself as "Little Joe." Little Joe said that näkij zoved baš
that he could put her in touch with him.
6. Fubject told source she was delighted at having received a pass-
part for herself and her children and permission from the State Department
to travel tō Cabs with them. Permission vas granted on compassionate
grounds. She was so excited at this development she immediately telephonnd
the CUIS rep despite an earlier admonition to never again call him at his
office. He said his business is strictly compartmented from other neabers
of the Cuban UII group. Fubject stated that with her passport she now vill
be able to travel to Europe after returning to Cuba. Fource understands
that European travel will be for Cuban intelligence purposes but has no
details. Source speculates that because tubject is fluent in Polish and
French, with some knowledge of German, coupled with her American citizensälp
and Polish background, she will be able to gain entre into European Bloc :
circles to glean waɛt she can of their true feelings and intent to the CASTRO
government. Upon completion of her Miami mission and her return to HY, Subject
then plans to depart to Cuba via Mexics. The plans only about two days
Mexico. She will be provided travel funds by the CUIB rep.

WOFIRM, except for the three

officers cited above, does not really understand the
real LICCOKY/1.

Obviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that really
brought about this "confrontation", in the writer's opinion. These
are as follows:

--
Money LICOOKY/1 receives no money from us anymore
(since her termination in Mexico), and the writer suspects
that LICOOKY/1 could have more easily rationalized working
for the "Giant Indices in Washington" were she on salary; ·
--
sex in this case, lack of same (LICCOKY/1 comes always!
to emotional involvement with her male associates, and
her Case Officers cannot fulfill this need, thus giving
rise to problems; in the past, LICOOKY/1 could easily
obtain her physical/emotional fulfillment in Cuba and
Rexico without relying on the Case Officer, but now she is
getting older and quite shop-worn and cannot compete for
attention from men in the environment of a place such as
Manhattan);
discipline
--
again, in this case, lack of same; LICOOKY/1
tell us what she does, we don't tell her what she should
do.
LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair.
She has been upset for the past month, over this as well as over
the confused outlook for her in general. It was made very clear
At one point what aid and comfort could have been extended to
_ICOOKY/1 to alleviate her anguish, and the writer beat a hasty
setreat to the kitchenette for a tactical drink of water.
10. Not elaborated above were the writer's answers to
LICOOKY/1's opinions, but these were effective in counting her
logic, if not her actitudes. LICOOKY/1 had to agree th I WOPIKA

Jack,
DODS
I briefed Gaines for 30 minutes on LICOOKY
giving him the full background on her bio,
education, CIA relationship---from recruit-
ment through current use in Mexico. My
suggestion was that she be told to go to
NY and find a job which would give her a
means of livelihood as well as cover for any
future CIA income. After 6 months (or some
other specific period of time) it would be
arranged that either we contact her or she
contact us to determine what her personal
situation was and whether she would then be
in a position to target against selected
persons of interest to CIA in the NY area.
She could then be paid un a spel basis
for herCIA work. Mr. Gaines wanted to
think about it but thought that this would
be the best approach. He will talk to you
before Friday.
vu
His only question was whether we had any
indication whether she was under develop -
ment by the opposition ---Soviet, Cuban, etc.
I told him that as far as I knew there was
no such indication. If I am wrong (per
your and Bill Johnson's recent activity)
you better correct this.

11. At any rate, the entire proceedings were very amicable,
and, as mentioned above, LICOOKY/1 stressed that her basic oppo-
sition to WOFIRM was not on personal grounds, as she had enjoyed
her dealings with her "three favorite contacts". She offered to
call the writer anytime she had something tangible to pass on, and
that he should do the same. It's just that she would be more
comfortable as an ex-agent than as a current one. The writer
fully expects to hear from her from time to time.
12. It actually was quite an interesting session.

Kiss Joyce H. Pineinch
Dear Miss Pineisch
SECRET
morandum of Oral Commitment
Reference is made to your current contact with the United States
Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.
Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
Independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include
a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4% and 3-5/8% respectively.
As a consequence thereof, said contract is amended by deleting
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:
"Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly
deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does not imply in any manner the actual creation of an
employce-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agree-
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor.
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and
- covert deductions returned.

Box: 27 Foll::! 3
LICOOKY-1's efforts as described in reference have
substantial merit and some potential particularly if the Station can
find a way to tie them in with the LIKEAM effort in the intellectual
field.
1.
=
2. LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be commended for her effort in
getting sitors both of the right and left euch as Carlos PELLICER
Camara to join the AEM. From a KUBARK standpoint the most interesting
contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force
behind the COMES/CLE effort in Mexico.
3. Although her assigned tasks as reported in para 7 a, b and d
of the LILINK nemo do not entail making her witting of other Station
assets engaged in KHSPAWN Ops among the intellectuals, an amendment
to her QA is required, and one has been requested. If her efforts
progress to the point where she might be able to influence leftist
writers in their efforts to establish the CLK in Mexico (para 7 c of
LILINK memo) Headquarters should be forwarded your ideas on why and how
LICOOKY-1 should be used as an active MHSPAWN agent, and another
ammendment will be required for this role.
4. ANDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station during
his TDY.
7
5. In view if the restricted OA which confines KUBARK's
association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Headquarters remain
aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect
her security or the granting of amendments to her OA for individual
operations. Therefore, we would appreciate your keeping us informed
on a more timely basis of any undertakings such as the recruitments
for membership in the AEM described in reference.

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 7 March 1968, the agent
passed on the following information which may be of interest to the
appropriate Headquarters components. L/1 apologized for the lack
of details, but the agent was not in a position to pump for further
information beyond that which was volunteered.
2. On 7 March Tana de GAMEZ, a naturalized U.S. citizen of
Spanish origin, said that she had been telephoned the night before by
tha enn of her half-elster Mercedes (last name unknown to L/1). her
nephew Roy. The latter is a college student somewhere in Connecticut
(possibly the University of Connecticut), and his home is somewhere
in Westchester County. Roy said that he was calling his Aunt Tana
because he knew that she had worked for CSS during WWII; Tana
rejoined that she had never had anything to do with OSS, that she
had worked for the office of war Information (OWI). At any rate,
Roy said that he wanted to tell his Aunt Tana that he had been
"recruited" by the CIA, and that he was only going to work for the
CIA so as to evade the draft. Upon being questioned on this, Roy
maintained that he had been recruited' by the CIA on campus. :
3. The nephew's statements rather rattled Tana de GAMEZ, to
the point where she had to take her heart medicine for palpitations
(she has a heart history). Among other things, Tana was upset by the
thought of a family member being affiliated with the CIA, even though
the nephew is disliked by her as an individual.
4. Tana de GAVEZ was a member of the U.S. delegation to the
Havana Cultural Congress in January 1968. She is a well-known figure
in the intellectual leftist set in New York, and is outspokenly pro-
Castro. She is a member of the editorial board of Grove Press; is
a published author herself; and is a close friend and associate of
John GERASSI, formerly of Ramparts Magazine,

Jose Revueltas, Communist landmark personality in
Mexico for the past several years, on a regular basis.
Jose Revueltes has become an alcoholic and for the last
several seeks has been living with an Indian girl. Mrs.
Revueltos blames this situation of her husbands relation-
ship with two brothers Arturo and Jorge *Filio and on
&
Jaine* Havarro. According to Mrs. Revueltas these three
are engaged in smuggling contraband goods into Mexico
and are also enɛaged in skúgiling drug activities. Mrs.
Revueltas claims that they use their smuggling channels
to help the PCK pass items and bodies in and out of the
country. Jose Revueltas was the contact man between this
David ALFARD
+
group and Alfredo Sequeiros and Luis Arenal who were in-
terested in smuggling Guillermo Rousset Banda accused of
murdering Carlos Farias Jimenez, both known Communists,
out of the country. There has been speculation that this
murder was the result of differences between the ProfSovist
and Pro-Communist China groups of PCM. Mrs. Revueltas to-
lieves that if she could cause the arrest of the Filios
and Navarro she could rescue her husband from their influ
ence. At L-l's suggestion, she wrote an anonymous letter
denouncing the Filios and Navarro, describing their activ-
ities, types of contraband the addresses where the contra
band was located. Mrs. Revueltos was told by L-1 she would
give it to a friend of hers on the Marcoties Board in Mexico.

The lotter was passed to the Station where it will reach
the proper Mexican authorities. This may not work, but if
the information provided by Mrs. Revueltos is true and the
group is arrested, publicity plus additional help from the
stations publicity can create a damaging scandal against
the PCM.
1-1 has been additionally instructed of the require-
ments outlined in para 2 of Ref. 3.
LICOOKY-2 reported on 15 March that Judith Ferreto
called him to send a ticket to San Jose, Costa Rica for
Manuel Mora or to the person to whom he assigns it. The
ticket was for travel from San Jose to Mexico City. On
March 18 Ferreto called saying Mora was in the city and had
not used the ticket but had given it to Señora Carmen Lopez
de Ferreto who travelled to Mexico on 21 March. Ferreto
called again on 26 March making a reservation for Carmen
de Ferrete's return to San Jose on 1 April.
1-2 took advantage of this phone call to remark to

Ferreto that there had been little travel lately. She told
him there was no explanation other than people were just.

for the preceeding week, the tasks she was working on, the people
she was in contact with and the results. She also lists the tasks
she will work on during the coming seek, the people she will see,

conversation there is no opening to bring up the subject she wished

In discussions concerning the Communist and leftist movements,
she admitted that at one time she was influenced by their ideology,
but as she had grown older and had observed more of their activities
and personalities, she had lost all respect for them. She said that
she had been fooled by Fidel Castro in his early days and had
thought he would be good for Cuba, but as events have developed
she has seen how mistaken she had been originally. She also commented
that in long talks with LINLUCK, he had opened her eyes to the
fallacy of the Communist ideology. In all of these conversations ·
she has appeared sincere in her statements. Her liason with LINLUCK
appears to be based on deep affection for him and not on promis-
cuity. The case officer has the impression that if there was not
a present Mrs. LINLOCK she would become legally his wife. This is
a problem that may have to be faced in the future.
LICOOKY-2 doesn't present any personnel problem. While his
niche is a small one and his access is limited, his assignments
are carried out conscientiously.

LICOCKY-1's target studies and suggestions on possible recruitment
approaches has been helpful. While her reporting for the jíšší past
month has not produced any Information Reports, it has kept the
station aware of the activities in her particular area of access.
If she is successful in performing her tasks as outlined in the
paragraph under "Production" above, such information will be useful
to the station. LICOOKY-2's effectiveness is limited to his narrow

harmless. She considers herself a loyal American, but does not find
this to be incompatible with being a vigorous "New Left" type. She
recently became the Latin American editor of Manhattan FM radio sta-
tion WEAI, an interesting melange of bourgeois/avant-garde programming
slanted toward the left, according to L/1.
6.' Tana de GAMEZ is in frequent contact with Ambassador
Ricardo ALARCON Quesada, Permanent Representative of Cube to the
United Nations; she also is in contact with Jose Raul VIERA Linares,
DGI officer within the CMJN.
7. Tana de GAMEZ probably is the subject of a 201 file at
Headquarters; if so, this dispatch should be cross-referenced to
that file. If not, the Base suggests that de GANZZ be indexed.
8. Re paragraph 2 above, L/1 agreed that what the nephew prob-

would appreciate receiving copies of LICOOKI/1's PRQ Part I
and her most recent PRQ Fart II. No other material from her
voluminous 201 file is really needed here, as the undersigned

1. The following summaries indicate no derogatory
information on Subject.
2.
New York report dated 12/29/59 captioned "June COBB
Registration Act-Cuba" furnished CIA 1/8/60. This report
stated that June Lood trausiatou pamphlets as part of how
Job for Fidel Castro with the idea of familiarizing the
American people with Castro's writing. June Cobb believes
Castro is doing a tremendous job in reconstructing the
economy of Cuba. However, she stated that in her opinion
it is unthinkable that Communism would ever be embraced by
Castro or the people of Cuba. There seems to be no particular
significance to this report as this information was previously
known by the Agency.
-
3. Letter to Director, FBI, from CIA dated 11/7/60.
captioned "June COBB
Bernie
Internal Security - Cuba".
Brennan asked June Cobb to deliver some information to
Juan Orta who stated that Brennan was not needed anymore.
Cobb thought Brennan might have been attempting to obtain
a position with the Cuban Tourist Commission. The Agency
has no further interest in Brennan. Therefore, there is
no significance attached to the report.
-
4. Washington report dated 4/26/62 captioned "Lyle
Stuart IS Cuba; SM-C: RA-Cuba", furnished to CIA
5/4/62 was merely interview with Stuart. There is no
significance attached to this report.

A Provisional Operational Approval is granted for the use of this Subject
as set forth below.
A Provisional Operational Approval issued by CI Staff grants the same
authority, on a temporary basis, for the use of an individual as the authority
granted in an Operational Approval unless other ise specified by CI/OA. It is
based, however, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
ject to a further final review when all investigation is completei.
A POA is issued for contact with Subject to explore her access to targets
and informbi of operational interent in the Tatin American and possibly Cuban:
_context.
In dealing with this Subject it should be recalled that her past association
with CIA has been widely blown through broad publicity.
It is recommended that Subject be handled by a strong, mature case officer who
can and will avoid emotional involvement with the Subject.
The case officer should be fully briefed on Subject's background and her
emotional and sexual problems. Worthy of particular note is her involvement with
John Rettie, BBC correspondent in Mexico and an MI - 6 agent whom the Soviets
tried to compromise while he was serving a tour in Moscow.
Please forward PRQ Part II.
To process the Operational Approval, full information (completed PRQ
Parts I and II) must be submitted as soon as possible and not later than six
(6) months from this date. An Operational Approval will follow when all
investigation is completed and upon the receipt of satisfactory FFQ Parts Ì
I
and II. Cancellation must be requested if use of Subject by interested Di-
visions ceases.

BACKGROUND
.A. Around June or July of, 1959, AMDOFF/1 was ordered by Celia
: SANCHEZ to pay the Habana hospital bill of an American named June COBB.
The bill, which \A/ recalls,
*2000.00 plus Habana. Hilton Hotel
expenses, were paid out of the PM's office account. A/I believe i
miss COBB became acquainted with Fidel and Sanchez on their US trip of
April-May 1959, but ignores the details. Sanchez instructed A/1 to
employ Kiss COBB in the press section of the PH's office: She was
responsible with seeing all American and English speaking newsmen who
desired to Interview Castro or. requested permits to visit the interior
of the island. She also helped to translate Fidel's important speeches
into English. It is`A/1's understanding that she had no other duties
or responsibilities. She never dealt with Castro directly, but through
Maria VITOSKA, who was Sanchez's "laison with the PH's office.
A/1
states that their relationship was limited. to her official function.
She appeared to have a newspaper background, but A/1 ignores the details.
b. About late 1959 Kiss COBB, together with Jose PUENTE Blanco,
then PEU (Federacion EstucŢintii Universitaria) president of the
University of Habana, in conjunction with the INIT (Instituto Nacional
de Industrias Turisticas), took over a finca (formerly owned by. Batista)
near- Ceiba del Agua, Habana, and set up a boarding house to be used by
American students visiting Cuba as guests of the government. A/1 ignores
the details of this operation.
c. By mid 1960 A/1 learned that Miss COBB had left for New York
City.. She never returned. A/1 claims he does not know why she made
this decision.
d. When A/l'arrived in Mexico un late October 1954, he came to
know an American writer, Daniel JAMES (address: Vicente Gomez #145,
Mexico City, DP. tel 40-19-71). James' told A/1 that Miss COBB had..
recently been deported from Guatemala and was living in Mexico City.
Later, A/1 met Kiss COBB accidently at the Mexican Ministerio de
Gobernacion offices. She was very friendly and said she was helping a
Yuu PELLICAR (believed by A/1 to be a Guatemalan) to write a book,
describing his defection from Communism. She wanted A/1 to help
Pellicer with reference material on the Marcos RODRIGUEZ trial.

that the telephone number of the flew York WOFACT office is listed in the

2. Forwarded under separate cover are two copies of
the Secrecy and Termination agreement signed by LEXXY-1,

3. At the time of termination, 110(OKY-1 was given (1)

9,005.00 KN. The household items in her possession at the
time of termination, which belonged to the Station, were
sold to her for US $300.00.
4.
It should be noted that although 110037-1 claims
she intends to remain in the United States, she retained her
apartment, which was turned over to a rental agency for sub-
renting. The station believes that she intends to return
within the next several months or so should it develop that
she cannot find suitable work in the New York area. Should
she do so on her own it may be that the Station would want
to make occasional use of her, and for that purpose a post
office box to which she can write to initiate contact was
given her prior to departure.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Chief, WH Division
:
Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY
Project LICOOKY
}
The LICOOKY Project was last approved for the period
1 January 1965 through 31 December 1965 for $5.140--$2,530
for FY 1965 and $2,610 for FY 1966. It is requested that
the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective 1 January 1966,
based on the following information geared to the outline
in CSI-F NO. 230-60.
(1) Project Name: LICOOKY
(2)
:
Original Project Objectives: Identify and report
on plans activities and associates of Central
American Communists resident in or visiting Mexico
(3) Heagon for Termination: LICOOKY-1 lost ter access
to the hard core group of CA communists partly
because of her close association with LINLUCK who
publicly renounced his break with the Guatemalan
CP in 1962. The los c accres was also partly
due to L-l's own apparent indiscretion vis-a-vis
some of her close friends in Mexico City. This
can be attributed both to her growing distante
for the grubby and blindly unreasoning members of
this group with whom she was asked to consort, and
her reaction in her social group which took the
form increasingly of anti-Communist remarks, and.
to the concomitant for possibly resultant) rumors
of increasing currency. that she was in the pay
of PBSWING. Attempts were made to take advantage
of her connections with literary circles in
Mexico, but her inability to budget her time.
sufficiently to satisfy station requirements led
to the decision to terminate her. A contributing
cause was also her inability to regularize her
status in Mexico so she could accept a paying
position which would give her reason to remain
there, with the resultant strain of the thin
legend that her father was providing her support.

Effectivenes of Project· Project supplied a
certain amount of miscellaneous detail on the
Central American Communist group in its early
stages. Detail and continuity have always been
lacking.
During the post-project period of as&O-
ciation, after termination notice was already
given, she began to be more attentive to Station
requirements and supplied several rather detailed
profiles of controversial persons in the intelloy-
tual world who could be of operational interest
to the Station.
Date of Termination:
Status of commitments:

1 January 1966
LICOOKY-1: This Contract Agent is being
carried under LIRANCH (00A) from 1 January
through June 1960 to prepare special - d
against non-LICOOKY Project objectives.
Termination costs will be borne by Project
LIRANCH.
LICOOKY-2: LICOOKY-2 was terminated on 31
December 1965 for lack of continuous produc-
tion. He was very understanding when told
of the termination and recognized that his
limited and occasional access made a regular
salary illogical. Contact 15 mainiàiued
with him via a letter box through which he
can indicate his need for case officer con-
tact. He is then paid small sums for travel
information supplied.
Disposition of funds, material and personnel:
There are no funds or material to be disposed of.
LICOOKY-1 is being terminated effective 30 June
1966. At this time she will be supplied with air
fare from Mexico City to New York and paid the
income tax refund due her. Station owns some of
the furnishings in her apartment and she has
expressed a wish to purchase some of these. The
normal three-bid process will be complied with in
this case, through her advertising the sale and
then offering slightly higher prices for the items.
She plans to retain the apartment in Mexico and
sublet it furnished so she will have a pied-a-terre
whenever she returns there. Her specific plans
for leaving the city are not known. The Station
has no objections to ter remaining in Mexico and

She was given a post office box address to use to contact
the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico
and feels it necessary to do so. But no committment was
made to her regarding any future contact or payment for
information.
5. She was previously told that the telephone number of the
New York KUBARK office is listed in the directory and
**
•
she could call that office if contact were necessary while
ere nec
she was in the United States. She asked if that would
still be the case and was told that it was but only to
attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter.
But since she tends to liberally apply importance to a
wide variety of events and subjects, and since she is
likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, it
would not be surprising if she did try to establish such
contact.

7. The Station believes that most or all articles attacking the Conference,
and particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, were Soviet inspired, and it is further
believed that SEMO wrote most if not all articles attacking the Conference which
appeared in La Voz, Política and Sucesos. The Soviets, who are probably aware of
previous Cuban charges that LICOCKY-1 is an ODYOKE agent, probably felt that as
an American closely associated with the AEMAC LICOOKY-1 would be vulnerable to
such an attack.
8. As a result of the Sucesos article of 4 June 1966 an official from the
Ministry of Government did visit LICOOKY-1 to check on her documentation. The
official said that he did not believe the charges made in the Sucesos article,
but since her tourist visa had expired he advised her to immediately leave the
country in order to renew it, and he provided her with a letter to show to
Mexican border authorities permitting her exit. She is currently in PEPRIME but
1 cpected to natum to Mexico in a few days.
9. As Headquarters is aware, LICOOKY-1 will be terminated effective
30 June 1966; the decision to terminate her was made some time ago, prior to the
occurrence of the Conference and the resulting adverse propaganda. While she
may be of some occasional use should she return to and remain in Mexico, it is
believed that the recent adverse propaganda has impaired her future usefulness
in Mexico, although zany Mexicans undoubtedly do not believe the charges and
others offered to "come to her defense."
10. A dispatch will be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been
completed, end any new developments with respect to her alleged participation in
the above Conference will be included in that dispatch.

Action Required: j None; FYI.
1. As Headquarters is already aware, a Latin American Conference to Study
the Situation of the Jewish Minority in the Soviet Union (Conferencia Latino-
americana de Estudios sobre la situación de la Minoría Judía en la 17SS) was
held in Mexico City during the period 13 - 15 May 1966. Judging by numerous
articles in the press, Política, La Voz de México, Sucesos Para Toics (see
attachments under separate cover) and excerpts from conversations between
numerous persons on LIENVOY and LIFEAT, the Soviet Embassy, the Mexican
Communist Party (PCM - Partido Comunista Mexicano) and other groups and indivi-
dual Communists were determined, if possible, to prevent the Conference from
welling and, lalling that, to discreant it completely a pin the UDIUKE/
ODACID label on it. Despite their efforts end the voluminous adverse propaganda,
both before and after the Conference, the Conference was held and was probably
Hildly successful.
T
1
2. Política, 1 May 1966, carried an article attacking the proposed Con-
ference and ridiculing some of the Mexican participants (Attachment A). It
contains, among other things, a partial reprint of the text of an interview
or statement by Nicolas S. Leonov, Press Attaché of the Soviet Embass in
which he states that Mexico should not be drawn into the cold war propaganda
battle, and he maintains that Jews in the Soviet Union are not mistreated or
discriminated against. In addition to the attacks and counterattacks in the
press, efforts were made (based on LIFEAT on Enrique SENO Calev, Gerard
PIERRE-CHAPLES, and LIENVOY) to prevent Carlos Pellicer, a darling of the Mexican
left but not a formal PCM member, from taking part; Pellicer is an official of
the Mexican Committee for the Defense of the Jews in the USSR (Comité Mexicano
Pro Defense de los Judíos en la Unión Soviética). Política, 15 May 1966

As of
(Attachment B) continued the attack on 'the Conference and its participants,
claiming in effect that it is a clear anti-Soviet move backed by ODACID.
18 May, according to the article, numerous signatures had been collected on a
"progressive manifesto" protesting the Conference. The list includes many well
known Mexican Communists and pro-Communists. Attached also (Attachment C) is a
copy of the "progressive manifesto", which was published in 1 Día on 13 May 1966,
and a copy of a manifesto (Attachment D) published in El Heraldo, 22 April 1966,
by the Mexican Committee for the Defense of the Jews in the USSR, in which a
mumber of demands are made on the Soviet Government with respect to the Jews and
their rights.
3. La Voz de Mexico,15 May 1966 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly
attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized and held by groups.
and persons in the service of ODACID. It specifically names LICOOKY-1, although
the latter's name is incorrectly spelled, as one of those responsible for the
Conference and says she is "well connected" with ODYOKE police.
Sucesos,
21 May 1966, carried an article (Attachment F) attacking the Conference and its
organizers and charging that there are bibe the Confonance.
This article carries a picture of LICOOKY-1.
4. Sucesos, 4 June 1966, included an inserted sheet (not found in all copies
of this edition) entitled "An Agent of the FBI and INTERPOL in the Association of
Mexican Writers," which deals almost exclusively with LICOXY-1, her expulsion from
Cuba, work in Mexico, and contacts and activities in Mexico. It charges that in
Mexico she is working for Daniel James, who is responsible to KUBARK (Attachment G).:
5. LICOOKY-l's name appeared in a notice (Attachment E) appearing in El
Excelsior, 28 May 1966 by Vicente Echeverría del Prado, treasurer of the Mexican
Association of Writers (AEM - Asociación de Escritores de Néxico, A.C.), which
simply stated that LICOOKY-1 is not authorized to accept dues or handle other
business of the AEM within the province of the treasurer's cuties and obligations.
However, in view of the adverse publicity previously, the announcement had the
effect or implied that the AFMAC or members of that group believed the charges
that LICOOKY-1 had a part in organizing the Conference and/or is an agent of
KUBARK. The notice, as it appears, also implies that LICOCKY-1 was mishandling
AVAC funds. Echeverría offered to publish the clarification on the sheet on
which the AEMAC announcement appears; however, LICOOKY-1 asked him not to do so and
· said she would take up the notice and any clarification with the AEMAC Justice and
Honor Commission.
•
6. On 9 June 1966 while conversing with SEMO (Attachment I), Leonov said
that LICOOKY-1 had called him to say that she had had nothing to do with the
Leonov
Conference, and does not want the Soviets to catalogue her as an enemy.
commented that LICOOKY-1 had left him her phone number and had asked him to help
ber (presumably refute the charges that she was involved with the Conference).
The LILINK case officer who currently handles LICOOKY-1 said on the morning of
14 June 1966 that LICOCKY-1 told him she had called the Soviet Press Attaché to
deny that she had had anything to do with the Conference "because it is what she
would normally do." She did not, however, mention beforehand that she intended
to call the Soviet Embassy. (Tape of conversation is forwarded as Attachment J.)

Comentario soviético. En entrevista
con El D:1. Nicolás S. Leonov, agregadɔ
de prensa de la embajada de la URSS
en ilustro país, afirmo: "Mexico no es
campo propicio para hacer propaganda de

mundo entero no permiten que florezcan
en este puis brotes de la guerra iria. Ea
la actual no hay ni datos, ni situa

Hema judio en Rusia. A juzgar por los
argumentos, la aplistante mayoría de los
firmantes para sus conclusiones no
los datos personales, no los resultados de
una investigacion (Djanary Janes

erróneo y muchas veces tergiversado por

En referencia al pedido de control de
Las publicationes antisemitas que hacia el
Hamamiento, Leonov comentó: “Es cu-
rioso que pidan esto a la URSS y no a
otros paises en donde prolifera esta clase
de literatura. Es falso afirmar que las

Deniamin Laureano Luna, presidente
del Fans Mexicano Pro Defensa de los
Dendo Humanos, cirio su anticomu-
nismo con reiteradas y demagógicas pro-
rostis en contra de las agresiones nortz-
americanas a Santo Domingo y Vietnam.
Luego lanzó las mis graves calumnias
contra la Unión Soviética, y poco le faltó
para poner en el mismo nivel del geno-
cidio hitleriano al régimen de la primera
nación donde se han sentado las bases
para realizar el comunismo.
La jornada del 14 de mayo se cerró
com banquete al que asistieron, además
de los delegados extranjeros, numerosos
miembros de nuestra versitil y desapren-
siva intelectualidad. Alli hablo Jacobo
Mondiak, gerente ejecutivo de la confe-
rencia. De este seudoescritor, La Voz de
México (en su edición 1829) denunció
suflición de extrema derecha y lo pre-
sentó como "dirigente de: JEIRUT (par-
tido israelita de crederecha y fascista),

México por su ideologia chovinista y reac-

Mendiak sólo dirigió ditirambos a la
"gloriosa y hospitalaria patria mexican"
y a sus "monumentos solteras de piedra“.
Después de barajar demagigicamente -

pretensió curarse on slud: "No es preci-

encargó de Iniclarla, por mul de una

UNA SESIÓN DE LA CONFERENCIA "PRO JUDÍA"
………sus nexos con d imperialismo norteamericano y la intervención de ¿ze…….
de la Caión Soviética en nuestro país, la
condenó como parte de la "guerra iria“.
Analizando, aun en form: somera, la
extracción de los diferentes delegados ex-
tranjerco, es fácil inducir sus nexos con
el imperialismo norteamericano y la inter-
venciia de éste en la conferencia. Los
delegados son en su mayoria o han sido
funcionarios de gobiernos gorilas de Cen-
tro y Suramérica; entre ellos se cuentan
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, exministro de
Cultura de El Salvador; Ricardo J. Bermú-
dez, exministro de Educación de Panamá;
Gerardo Molina, exrector de la Univer
sidad de Colombia; Lic. Gardillo Barios
caminisero de Economia y Trabajo de
Guatemala; y Dr. René de Sola, caminis-
tro de Justicia y de Relaciones Exteriores
de Venezuela.
A esca campaña, nada democrática y
de calidad intelectual harto dudosa, fueron
arrastrados algunos intelectuales mexica
nos honestos. Una larga serie de artima
ñas fuceon usadas para ella, desde el ocui-

rece entre los firmantes del nefesto "La
mado de Conciencia”. Sin embargo, el li-
terato había sido designado con interio
ridad para presidi: la conference; así lo
sprueban tanto el mensaje dirigico a su
nombre por el sofo inglés Bertrand
Russell el 26 de abril, como el discurso
de inauguración de la conferencia, que
debia dirigir Martin Luis Guzmia y que
fue impreso y repartido por la oficina de
prensa aun antes de que comenzara la re-
unión.
La conferencia. En la sesión de aper-
tura se escenificó una farsa en la que se
intentó despojar a la conferencia "pro ju-
dia” de toda implicación politica, ubicán-
dola dentro de una esfera exclusivamente,
humana". Al mismo tiempo, se pretendió
dar a las delegaciones extranjeras —al
gunas de las cuales sólo constaban de una
sola persona una representatividad "de.
mocrática" en las dos comisiones que se'
formaron: la de estudio y la de resolu-
ciunes.

Russell para "demos-
trar” què “…….no, de-
trás de es no.
hay ninguna fuerza
que nos leva a ac-

haciendo". Y finalizó
su carta con estas pa-
labras: "Nunc co-
mo hoy se bla tan

El gobierno savišti.
co los proclama to-
dos los dias. ¿Qué
ocurre entonces con

A continuación, el
presidente de la conferencia, Marría Luis.
Guzmán el que actuó como inestro
de ceremtals, Benjamin Laureano Luna,
hicieron seados discursos ea is que, cada
uno a sa manera, trató de justificar los
objetivos de la conferencia
Martin Luis Guzmán añzzó: “Pese a
la revisića de aquellos factores negativos
de la viša soviética y a les frecuentes
cambios que en ellos se introdujeron, el
gobierno de la URSS no ha restituido a
los judics sus indiscutibles derechos al
goce de sa cultura ancestral, a la conser-
vación de sus instituciones, a la continui-
dad de su tradición milemaria". Despues
de algunas vaguedades añadidas a la pri
mera, ci escritor finalizó con ésta: “Así,
enterados de las persecuciones que hoy
sufre un gran grupo del pueblo judio,
cuyo millenario legado cultura forma par-
te de li civilización de Occidente, hemos
considerado deber includible el acudir
aqui para que esta conferencia manifieste
su decisión de protestar, como lo haría

tenths (02.8) per cent of PINEINCH's gross, texable Agency entitle-
ments has been approved by the Covert Tax Committee. This percan-
tage assessment is effective 1 December 1964, the begining date of
tax year 1965.
2. The retroactive application of this assessment to tax year
1965 will result in a dollar assesment of $84.00 (02.8% or $3,000.00).
After applying the 1965 covert tax withholding of $540.00, a refund
of $455.00 will be das PINEISCH for 1965. This eliminates the requires
ment for a covert tax return for 1965.
3. An scknowledged letter of instruction will be forwarded at a
later date.

UN LLAMADO DE CO
PRO DEFENSA DE
EN LA
Al termino de un examen, bre de do
espiritu partidario, hemos comprobado cientos
Rechos que nos llevan a abrigar el temor de
que aún existe una brecha entre la situación
ce igualdac que la Constitucion de la URSS
confiere a los judios, y su situacion real, en
el plano religioso, cultural, económico y hu-
mano. Estamos convencidos que dicha sita-
cion se halla en contradiccion con los fines
que persigue la socieda sovietica, y su evo-
lucion desde 1936. Estamos asimismo conven-
cidos que la misma constituye un obstaculo
para aminorar la tension internacional. Es
por esta razon que estamos igualmente per-
suadidos que el Gobierno ce la Union Sovie-
da se mostrara sensible al llamamiento que
hoy le dirigimos:
SOLICITAXOS DEL GOBIERNO DELA URSS
1.-Que confiera a los judios soviéticos
at dawn to desarrollar libremente su cul-
tura especifica, con medios identicos a aque-
Los de que disponen las demás culturas na-
1 cionales: textos, periodicos, bibliotecas, tea-
tros, enseñanza, etc.
2.-Que permita a los judios soviéticos
practicar su religion y disponer libremente
de los textos, contar con oficiantes y con
los objetos necesarios a la observancia del
culto:
3.-Que autorice a los judios viaticos
para que, a semejanza de las demas religio-
nes, puedan organizarse en comunidades re-
ligiosas en todo el territono, y a establecer
1 intercambios culturales y de culto, con sus
correligionar os;
4.-Que, a fin de evitar en el futuro toda
publicacion antisemita del tipo de: "El Judais-
mo al Descubierto" y "El Judaismo y el
Sionismo Contemporaneo", asi como ciertos
folletines y caricaturas que aparecen en forma
regular en la prensa sovietica, se ejerza un
severo control sobre dicho tipo de propaganda
racial. Dicho control sena sumamente viable
toda vez que existen en la URSS los organis-
mos adecuados para llevarlo a cabo;
5.-Que una legislacion especial sancione
los delitos de indole cista, veiando espe-
cialmente porque dichas tendencias antise-
mitas no lleguen a pozer en peligro ante la
justicia, la igualdad de los derechos de los
ciudadanos sovieticos, considerando que los
recientes procesos por delitos economicos y
las condenas a muerte que les siguieron, dan
lugar al temor de que dicha igualdad no es
enteramente aplicada en el caso de los judios;
6.-Que considere con benevolencia el

caso de los judios que deseen reunirse con
sus parientes y conjuges que viven en Israel
y en stros paises, despues de haber sido se-

Tenemos la plena convicción que la aten-
ción que otorgue el Gobierno de URSS a
ests peticiones, habra de satisfacer la aspira-
cion te justicia de los pueblos y sucesion

debido a la renovación y fortalecimento de ias

aporna a la URSS, al relajamiento de la

siguientes:

70,600 libros en vidish y 50,000 volúmenes

Leningrado, Los judios en la URSS dis-
ponen de publicaciones en su idioma, así
por ejemplo la revista mensual "Yidish
Hemland" fira 25.000 ejemplares. Se pu-
blican ediciones de autores judios tanto
soviéticos como extranjeros que alcanzan
tiradas de millones de ejemplares como es
el caso de Sholem-Aleijem. Los hebreos
disponen también de sus propios teatros.
“Además de ello —se dice en el docu-
mento, disponen de una tierra particu
lar, exclusiva, a la que muchos llaman
patria propia y que existe desde mayo
de 1934, mucho antes de que los héroes
judios de la postguerra arrancaran Israel
al poder inglés... calculamos en medio

Fi
T
UBLIN es una ciudad polaca en la que Hitler
pensó concentrar a los judíos en un bacinado
ghotto de tantos millones de discriminados
como habitantes tiene hoy Tokio. En el histérico
avan par:
[inión de Repúblicas So
cialistas Soviéticas, Hitler consideró que en vez de
concentrar a los judíos se creaba meños problemas
si los mataba de una buena vez. En los crematorios
y fosas de los campos de concentración erigidos por
los nazis en su marcha hacia el oriente quedaron
las crias y los cadáveres de seis millones de judíos.
La luna contra el nacifuscismo costó a la URSS 20.
millones de vidas humanus.
En la ciudad de Lublin Nació Jacob Glatstein. Joven
sún emigró a los Estados Unidos y se convirtió, con
el correr de los años, en una de las más brillantes fi
guras de la poesía y de la critica literaria en lengus
fdish. Tiene ahora 70 años y milita en las filas del
partido Polé Sión (Trabajadores de Sión), que agru
pa a los sionistas de tendencia socialdemócrata de
derecha. Los poalesionistas editan en Nueva York
el semanaric Indisher Kempfer (Luchador judío). En
septiembre de 1965, y en este periódico, publicó Ja-
cob Glatstein un comentario bibliográfico sobre Ho
rizontes, una antología con la producción más recien
te de los poetas judíos de la Unión Soviética que es
criben en lengua (dish, de la que se acababan de
editar en Moscú 5,000 ejemplares, número que el co-
mentarista señaló como bastante considerable para
una antologia de poesia nueva en cualquier parte dei
mundo. Glatstein celebraba haber descubierto en Ho
rizontes a por lo menos una docena de poetas de
primer orden a quienes, decía, "elogio sin titubeos
porque son maestros del verbo y notables artífices
de lo emotivo y lo temático... El Idish en manos de
los magistrales poetas de la Unión Soviética es una
creación madura que se sustenta más en un sabor
popular que en la gran poesía del pasado. Ahí se
ha conservado una savis popular que ha ampliado
verdaderamente sus horizontes". Ya para terminat
su comentario Jacob Glatstein afirmaba: "La antolo
gla Horizontes viene a demostrar que la palabra
poética idish vive en la Unión Soviética".

goitia, Vicente Leñero, Carlos Monsiváis, José Re-
vueltas y Gutierre T.bón, que junto con Pellicer
firmaron ese "Llamado de conciencia", que de tal
sólo tiene el titulo, pues el nombre que le correspon-
dería, después de someterlo a un riguroso análisis
objetivo, sería el muy inonesquiano de "Llamado de
un grupo de mal informados que firmaron porque
dicen que les dijeron lo que no les consta porque no
saben nada al respecto y la culpa de todo la tiene
Bertrand Russel?”
Dunde no sparece la firma de don Martín Luis.
El ya anciano (79 años) autor de El Aguila y la ser
plente y La sombra del caudillo, el escntor Martin
Luis Guzmán, gusta del infantil juego de las escon
didilas. En 1965 fue él quien convenció a Carlos
Pellicer para que juntos asistieran a la Conferencia
Latinoamericana Sobre la Situación de los Judíos
en la URSS que se celebró en Río de Janeiro los
días 14 y 15 de septiembre de ese año. Pero he aqut
que entre las 53 firmas que suscribieron el "Llama-
do de conciencia", que apareció en cuartos de pla
ña, al día siguiente, en todos los diarios, en inser
por in norteamericana June Cob, no
aparece el nombre de don Martin. ¿Se habla retira

The University of Puebla has decided to invite a series of
Ambs. to talk about the economic achievements of their countries.
At the Economy School. France, USSR, U.3., Czech and other countries
are invited. ES has the letter of invitation for Soviet Amb. What
does Leonov think about this? Could this arrange this? They can try.
Leonov understands that the Amb. is going onx vacations to Moscow
at the end of this anth, in 2 or 3 weeks. He is only waiting for
the Councillor who is in Moscow (now) and Amb. will leave right after
his return. Amb. will return in August. Perhaps there is someone
else who could represent the Amb. The Councillor could go or some
other "high-class" attache. Or First Secretary. ES says perhaps
Leonov. No, no is ignorant (inking).

good since he could talk. Spenish. M, any person who

speaks Spanish. ES thinks this would be a positive (act), a good op-

they could see about this on Monday. ES could xxx send Leonor the
letter meanwhile and then on Monday they can get together. Yes, they

Leonov will take this up. ES will send Leonov the letter and perhaps
he could arran e an interview for Monday. Leonov thinks it is not
worthwhile for ES to talk to hia. Leonov will tak to him (Amb.) and
he (Amb) will tell Leonov frankly how things are and Leonov will give
ES the message... Then, they can have lunch together on Monday. Fine.
ES wil go by for Leonov at 1400 on Monday.
ES asks how Leonov liked all the things and articles on the
Jewish matter. They (Joviets) have sent everything there (to USSR).
L. liked all of it. ES says that Leonov know that ....fell immediately

No, Leonov can tell him about the name of some people who call Leonov
