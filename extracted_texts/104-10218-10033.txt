Jose Antonio MENDIA, Counsellor (Cultural and Pross)
Argentine Embassy
$1
He was chief correspondent of La Prensa in Paris
and married a Frenchwoman. Source thinks he is a likely
target of the KGB because he needs a lot of money. This
is because his wife is very snobbish and ambitious and
insists on buying quantities of expensive clothes.
MENDIA thinks he is shrewd, but he is not.

Catherine BARSACQ, Secretary Archivist, French Embassy
She is young and speaks Russian well. She is the
daughter of the well-known French theatrical producer
1 (?) Andre BARSACQ. She works in the cultural office of
the Embassy. She goes out with Soviet men, one of them
Andre VOLKONSKY, the well-known pianist.
C.O. Comment: VOLKONSKY, as a teen-age boy, came
to the USSR after World War II with his father, who re-
patriated voluntarily from France. He was the target
of an SR/10 recruitment operation, since he groused
openly about his father's decision to leave France and

He had an affair with the ballerina PLISETSKAYA
eight or nine years ago, while previously stationed in
Moscow, and was kicked out of Moscow for it. However,
he is now married, apparently happily, and has three
children. He is a very bright and charming man who
speaks Mongolian and Chinese. He is a cultural officer
but since these languages are rare among cultural offi-
cers, Source assumes that he is MI-6.

Ahman MIRFENDERESKI, Iranian Ambassador
He is a very interesting character. His grandfather
was Ambassador to Russia before the revolution, and he
speaks extremely good Russian. He is a very sharp man
who knows a lot of Soviets, and has excellent rapport
with them because of his language and open manner. In his
diplomatic pose, he doesn't seem to be anti-Sovict, but
Source does not know his true feelings on that score. He
is not anti-American, although he sometimes considers some
☐ American actions stupid. He is married, but his wife is
often out of Moscow. He is able to stand a lot of liquor.

C.O. comment: AEPASSIVE stated that the Ambassador had
some of his primary education in Russia and confirmed his
expertise in the language and knowledgeability, but stated
definitely that the ambassador is 100% anti-Soviet.

SOURCE comments this is little more than a brothel where
the lower echelons of the foreign diplomatic colony arrange
trysts. There is a great deal of passing whiskey and cigaretts
here, particularly among the foreign service personnel (maids,
etc) of members of the diplomatic corps. At least within the
French embassy the general feeling is that one should stay away
from the place, since no diplomats of status go there, except:
on rare occasions (an especially good film). The enlisted
American military personnel are known to use the facilities of
the club to shack up with foreigners.
DATE ACQUIRED:
SEPTEMBER 1966
✓ The tone of the Club has improved greatly owing to security
measures which have been introduced in controlling the people

A too serious type, wife never smiles. Very impressed with
his position in the embassy' - a "heavy" person. Both drink a
good deal and only after they've had a few drinks do they let
their hair down. His wife is French. SOURCE sees them at a
number of American and British parties. Frequently present at
African parties, since he is embassy officer responsible for
African affairs. Wife is a bore.
DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966
Source and her husband think LOGAN is an intelligence
officer because the Soviets are very interested in him and
publicized him as a spy for his interests in Africans in
Moscow. After this article, the Africans stopped seeing
LOGAN. He was very well liked however.

about Russian, very well informed. SOURCE speculates SHAPIRO

but does not think he has to now that he has established himself.
SOURCE comments that SHAPIRO, like all Western press people have
to be extremely careful what they file, otherwise they will be
thrown out of the SU. This is very true in SHAPIRO's case, since
he married to Soviet national who might not be able to leave with
him if he were thrown out. Most noteable thing about SHAPIRO
is his very extensive contacts in the dip circuit

ambassador (Thompson). Probably because of religious bonds, he

DATE ACQUIRED: September 1966.
Shapiro hates to spend money. He is very hard on his assistants,
; and very quick-tempered. He hates Edmund Stevens and his wife.
He is close to the Austrian ambassador (Walter Wodak), the Italian
ambassador (Federico Sensi) and the Norwegian ambassador (Frithjof
Jacobsen). Recently Shapiro decided to do a story on the prostitutes
who hang out at the Hotel National. He sent someone to interview
some of these girls. As a result he was attacked in Pravda.
Shapiro was terribly upset at this, almost crying. He is normally
a very careful man. He knows all the Soviet journalists well,
and possibly cooperates with them. T

General Comments:
#
Embassy officers all believe they are very
important people by virtue of the fact that the Department sent
them to Moscow to represent the States. They try to impress
everybody with their position and with their knowledge of Soviet
affairs (which is not too good in the first place). They tend
to live a gotto-like existence, do not wis with other members of
the dip set. Stay at home or in the embassy and do not get out
around in the city. From a social point of view they are for
the most part boring - only wish to talk business and office
politics. No lightness of sense for "things gay." Heavy. Do
not have many of the social graces, do not dance well, do not
play cards vell, etc. Wives are poor dressers and can not cook!

as a good source of information for two American journalists
in Koscow who were suspected of having been recruited by the
KGB.
2. Although we have no record of his being stationed
abroad, Subject has made, several visits to non-bloc countries.
In June-July he visited New Delhi and Fangkok. In December
1962 he visited Iran. While in Iran he was introduced as
IZVESTIYA's special correspondent. lle corrected the
Individual who was making the introduction by saying that he
was an international observer.
3. Subject visited Turkey in April 1963. While in
Ankara he is reported as having participated in "propaganda
tactics" and made an "attempt to feel the pulse of the public"
as part of the Soviet efforts at that time to establish
closer relations with Turkey. During visits with various
heads of Rass media organs he commented that while in Iran
he had written "friendly articles" which were well received
by the Iranians. As a result he was the first Soviet
journalist to be admitted to the oil regions of Abadan and
Ahvas.

cheek bones, small mouth, wears clear plastic-rimmed glasses,
