6. Despite COS LUXE's viewpoint, I happen to know that
QJWIN can do more spotting in Corsican circles whenever we
want him to.

1. Per our discussion of 2 July 1962, I. expect that we
shall proceed to transfer QJWIN to Baden-Baden per the proposal
in OLLA-1463 dated 2 February 1962. LUXE 0489 dated 19 June
1962 stated that COS would have the full details of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the information
has not been received as of 3 July. The last cable to the
Station, DIR, 18321 told COS to contact you directly on his
arrival on 16 July.
2. With regard to candidates spotted by QJWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and a quarter ago can
probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessments
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti.
Magonetti's assessment is contained in OTRA,27542 dated
10 May 1961. The names of the two French candidates are
are con-
tained in OLLA 1426 dated 15 December 1961. No action has
been taken on these names regarding tracing or anything else.
My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
fuller descriptions of the two people than appear in the
dispatch.

3. The other spotting effort that can be made is
through Hank Manfredi (TN) in Rome. Hank was well briefed
on the qualifications desired and the security precautions
to be observed in the spotting activity. COS Rome has a
copy of the qualifications and restrictions in his safe;
however, if Nanfredi is told to proceed with his contact in
Florence, I suggest that he be re-briefed in detail.

Frankly, all the rest of the paper in the file is
crud except for the pay receipts which are assembled in one
envelope. I have already given the ZRRIFLE authorization
paper signed by Helms and Skip has been given the QJWIN con-
tract, including the extension to 1 March 1963.
5. The details which have yet to be worked out are
a. The precise method of contact with QJW IN
b.
The system of drawing funds for payments to him
probably be COS LUXE).
c. An emergency contact for him (this should
