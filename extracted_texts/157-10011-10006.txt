DESMOND FITZGERALD originated a scheme to assassinate CASTRO: "The idea
was to taken an unusually spectacular sea shell that would be certain to catch
CASTRO's eye, load it with an explosive trigger to blow when the shell was lifted,
and submerge it in an area where CASTRO often went skin diving." (77).
FITZGERALD explored this idea at several sessions with SAM HALPERN and BRUCE
CHEEVER but it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. (77).
DISCOVERY LEADS: Note: There is no indication that FITZGERALD told any-
one above him in the CIA hierarchy of this plan.

SANCHEZ reported that although AMLASH had wanted "a high-powered, silenced rifle
with an effective range of hundreds or thousands of yards," (92) he decided finally
that he knew, as a Doctor of Medicine, that "we could devise some technical means
of doing the job that would not automatically cause him to lose his own life in
the try." (92)
Samuel-HALPERN--and SANCHEZ requested assistance from Dr. Edward GUNN of the CIA--
Office of Medical Services (92) On Nov. 20, 1963, they told GUNN that "the
device for administering the poison (a ball point pen rigged as a hypodermic syringe)
had to be ready in time for SANCHEZ to catch a plane at noon the next day." (93)
The next day GUNN delivered to SANCHEZ a pen capable of injecting a poisonous
insecticide known as "black leaf 40". (92-93)

OCCURRENCE:
HARVEY testified that QJ.Win was an agent that he considered for possible use and used for a
limited period through ARNOLD SLEVER for the spotting of individuals with criminal and under-
world connections in Europe for possible multipurpose use, none of whom were ever advised of
the use. (50) Or were ever used.
When HARVEY was asked if the multipurpose-use-included-assassination, he stated-that-if
he had ever been directly ordered to perform an assassination, he would have considered the
people spotted by .J.Win as possibilities. (50) He testified that before someone would have
actually been approached to carry out that operation, there would have been a long, period of
assessment and cross checks. As far as he knew, the particular spotting mechanism never went i
that far. So far as HARVEY could recall K.J.Win was used only once in connection with an opera-
tion in the Congo, which was not an assassination operation. (51)

and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned
Dr. Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high
lethal content, and little-or-no-traceability. Six of these items were produced and
after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, three pills were
ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on

The notes in Harvey's handwriting entitled Project Zrriffle state "3. Background:
In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign
code and cipher materials, division D in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as a
developmental activity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more
refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped
to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize
control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest
touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting
activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit

Harvey's hadwritten notes entitled Project Zrriffle (exhibit 1) state "Objectives".
The objectives of this project is the procurement of code decipher materials, and
information concerning such materials, in accordance with requirements levied on the
clandestine services, primarily by the NASA security agency. Since these requirements
are subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the duration
of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of need and
opportunity. The Project will be conducted by division () with assistance from area
divisions and stations as needed." (exhibht 1)
Harvey testified that his notes didnot cite assassination or assassination capability as
an objective of project Zrriffle. However, assassination was a contemplated purpose of the
project. If an agent had been recruited for assassination he would have been recruited
under the cover of obtaining code and cipher materials (49)

The EXECUTIVE ACTION program authorized by BISSELL and run by WILLIAM HARVEY "came to be known
as ZRRIFLE. Its principal asset was an agent, QJWIN, who had been recruited earlier by CARNOLD
SILVER for use in a special operation in the Congo (the assassination of PATRICE LUMUMBA) to be
run by JUSTIN O'DONNELLY (O'DONNELL made a survey of the scene, decided he wanted no part in
that assassination attempt, and asked to be released which BISSELL granted.)" (38)
NOTE: In the copy of the I.G. REPORT provided to the Committee, which was, according to
EARMAN's cover memorandum the ribbon copy, which was the only text of the report in existence, th
phrase in the above paragraph "(the assassination of PATRICE LUMUMBA)" was crossed out. S.
BRECKENRIDGE indicated to the Committee that this phrase was crossed out by RICHARD HELMS when
he read the report. Why?

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the
interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico, where
he can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin
American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the
original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.
This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against
the unarmed people of Cardenas: "The-Cuban-source to story-need not await-your-determina-
tion of the true cause of the Cardenas demonstration."

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty
thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father.
Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that
the current thinking contemplated figures more on the order of 3,000." Mr. Barnes
replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

on assassination plotting in relation to FIDEL CASTRO indicates
OCCURRENCE: that the only written records which served as a basis for the IG
Report were: Notes of William Harvey; Records of Dr. Edward Gunn
(Office of Medical Services; and, brief records of Ray Treichler
(of TSD). Some operational files were also used.
For the most part, the Inspector General's office relied upon
information given to us orally by people who's memories are fogged
by time. (1)
"We interviewed everyone whom we could identify as likely to be
knowledgeable, with the exceptions of MR. DULLES and GENERAL CABELL."
A complete list of the interviewees is attached to the IG Report
at Tab A. "If there are significant innaccuracies in the Report
they are most likely to occur in faulty ordering of the sequence
of events." (2).

CARD 1 of 2
DR. EDWARD GUNN, Chief, Operations Division, Office of
Medical Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960,
he received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with a
lethal material. (21). He understood them to be CASTRO's
favorite brand. (21). GUNN's notes show that within the
next month he contacted Ray Treichler, of TSD, (Sept. 6,
1960) and gave him the box of cigars (21). Treichler.
recalls "that he did contaminate a full box of 50 cigars
with Botulinum Toxin, a virulent poison," (21) which would
kill the intended victim upon merely putting it in the
mouth. Treichler's notes showed delivery of the box on
February 13, 1961, although they do not indicate to whom.
(22).

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA and AMTORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever's
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
SOURCE:Would logically have led to the discussions at the time STAFF:
of the Matahambre operation."

OCCURRENCE:
SANCHEZ reported that although AMLASH had wanted "a high-powered, silenced rifle
with an effective range of hundreds or thousands of yards," (92) he decided finally
that he knew, as a Doctor of Medicine, that "we could devise some technical means
of doing the job that would not automatically cause him to lose his own life in
the try." (92)
Samuel HALPERN and SANCHEZ requested assistance from Dr. Edward GUNN of the CIA
Office of Medical Services. (92) On Nov. 20, 1963, they told GUNN that "the
device for administering the poison (a ball point pen rigged as a hypodermic syringe)
had to be ready in time for SANCHEZ to catch a plane at noon the next day." (93)
The next day GUNN delivered to SANCHEZ a pen capable of injecting a poisonous
insecticide known as "black leaf 40". (92-93)

OCCURRENCE: In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing the mission, Sam
Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but that if he could be furnished with
some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink. Sam indicated
that he had a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had
been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,
and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned
Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high
lethal content, and little or no traceability. Six of these items were produced and-
after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, three pills were
ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on
the ultimate use of the pills.

Jaeich Ler Ray The memorandum of April 25, 1967 which introduces the IG's Report
on assassination plotting in relation to FIDEL CASTRO indicates
that the only written records which served as a basis for the IG
Report were: Notes of William Harvey; Records of Dr. Edward Gunn
(Office of Medical Services; and, brief records of Ray Treichler
(of TSD). Some operational files were also used.
For the most part, the Inspector General's office relied upon
information given to us orally by people who's memories are fogged
by time. (1)
"We interviewed everyone whom we could identify as likely to be
knowledgeable, with the exceptions of MR. DULLES and GENERAL CABELL."
A complete list of the interviewees is attached to the IG Report
at Tab A. "If there are significant innaccuracies in the Report
they are most likely to occur in faulty ordering of the sequence
of events." (2).
