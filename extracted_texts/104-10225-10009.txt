2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
:
MEMO FOR THE FILE
SECRET
7 March 1975
Meeting with PACHANKIS 3 March 1975, 1345-1500, Restaurant at
Meeting with PACHANKIS 3 March 1975,
the Marrior Motel near National Airport
i
DIAZ
PACHANKIS stated that our old agent Miguel DIAZ Isalgue
was having trouble getting his U.S. citizenship approved,
had sent in all the papers and I&NS told him the only thing
left was the swearing in. So DIAZ waited a year and a half
and I&NS never called him in.
in. He called them in November 1974
and was told that there were no problems; that he would be called.
The DIAZ file shows that I&NS requested our traces in
in thom
December 1974. IP/EIB sent them; there may be something XNXXX
that is causing a problem now though that doesn't explain the
½ year delay before.
'
On 6 March, I told PACHANKIS to have DIAZ call I&NS one more
time and if there is a real problem, we'd see what wo could
do.

cancel Subject's OA and MOC.
2. JMWAVE believes it worth noting that Subject has an
excellent operational record and has participated in a number
of special operations as a team member, team leader and principal
agent. In addition, he had a hand in the recruitment of AMTRUNK-
19, and, as recently as June 1967, made a WOFIRM-sponsored opera-
tional trip to Madrid.
3. As a result of the good will built up with Subject over
the years of WOFIRM service and the excellent rapport maintained
with him throughout, Subject offered to make himself available on
His 201 filo
short notice for any WOFIRM operational assignment,
contains his current location, in the event recontact with him
becomes desirable at a later date.

HMMA-33829, 12 January 1968
1. On 30 January 1968 AMSTALK-1 was shown the passport
picture of Pedro Luis PINERO Eiria, which was recoived at
JUWAVE as an attachment to the reference, for possible
identification as one of the two Cubans he had mot with in
Nadrid on 23 Juño 1967.
.
2.
AMSTALK-1 said the individual in the photo was
definitely not "Guillermo". He said that if the individual
was one of the two he had met with, it would have to be the
second man, who used no name but gave the impression of
being a bodyguard. However, he said the second man had
darker skin tones; looked like an Arab or Lebanese; appeared
to have some Negro blood, although he would not classify him
as a mullato; and had curly hair which was almost kinky.
The eyes, lips and roceding hairline are very similar, but
the individual ho mot had a large bushy mustache.

Cuba y quiero a mis amigos que estan alla, no a los amigos que estan en

gar con Wis.

Esa es una disyuntiva un poquito cerrada, un poquito cerrada. Yo no
puedo creer sobre los amigos que tu tienes alla y que estan en el
Log
gobierno, no se que no te gustaria nada positivo para ellos.
otros amigos que tu tienes alla que estan presos, esos si que tampoco
puedes esperar nada positivo para ellos. Hay una cosa cierta, a tra-
ves de 3 años que son 8 años de revolucion, tu sigues manteniendo una
conducta en tu opinion minca jamas equivocada. Hasta cuando tu podras
seguir manteniendo esa linea de conducta? 27, 14, 15 anos? Tus arigós
seguiran presos, yo xx tendre una opinion quizas no ruy buena de ti.
El problema de Cuba yo no creo que se defina en una forma facil. Cuba
ya no es un caso aislado, tu lo sabes. Cuba forma parte de un problemà
continental incluso mundial.

I think we sight to go out on record on this case before JMWAVE really
gets all wred in a bun oration. Dic that cabis xxx we had drafted
ever fly 27 in any event, you knew pretty much what my feelings on this
matter are and we should get the (assuming we are in agreement) doim en
paper someplace. Although there isn't any blame on us for the FAGHOST/B
flasco it has made me rather leery of taking JMWAVE's ideas. Even though
Jake says We can't knit-pick on JNJAVE we can at least make our views a
matter of racord.

Subject: Idon A
DESENSITIZED
ANSTALK/1 was interviewed and tested at a covert site in the Miami,
Florida area on 17 May 1907 at the roquest of Stanley B. JERGABIT.
The interview and conducted in English in which MKSTALK/1 1s fluont.
Tosting was requested following receipt by AISTALK/1 of a recruit-
mont lotter, apparently from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Dotailo
regarding the letter wore forwardod to Headquartorn under UPGA-27562."
AUSTALE/1 is presently a WOFACT principal agent who, although no
nover worked with the CUIS, was acquainted with numerous Cuban Intelli-
gence personalition. He was last 605#Ikled on 7 December 1966.
REFULTS
AKUTALK/1's cousin, Iden B, did bring ANSTALE/1 a letter from Cuba
and ANSTALK/1 belloves that the lottor can from the CUIB.
ANSTALK/1 van never previously contacted by the CUIS and he has not
boon given &ny Beans of contacting the CUIS which no has aut revealed to
WOFACT.
AUSTALK/1 has no reason to believe that his cousin has not told him
all she knows about talo Enttor and he himself is not concualing from
WÜFACT anything that no knows about it.
AMETALK/1 cablod a reply to the letter exactly as instructed by
WOFACT.
While Future intentions are not a valid topic for 8C8BIL testing,
AMSTALA/I was naked hiring tosting whether he is now willing to engage
in an operation involving direct confrontation with the CUTS and whether
he would continue his nati-Castro activitios oven though his triones or
relatives in Cuba might be in danger, For what it is worth, there was
no indication of docoption when ASTALE/I replied affirmatively to bota
of thong quastions,
DETAILS
Prior to testing AMSTALE/1 montioned that during the pre-Castro cra
he van frequently in contact with persons nov in the upper echelons of
the Cuban government. Among these were Iden and Isten D. Although he
was asized on numerous occasions to join the 20th of July Movement he was
nover asked to work for CUIS or contacted by Cuban Intolligence with
respect to working for them prior to the present instance,

AMSTALK/1 said that no belioven that Idan B has passed on to him
all the information who was told to by the CUIS, No said however that
Idoa B talkod with Iden C about forty-five minutes and be foola, cortain
that Idau C told her more about his (AMSTALK/1's) activities than sho
has admitted knowing.
ANSTALK/1 said that Idon & told Idon C that she would not cooperate
with the CUIS in any action which would haru her husband, Idon Z, who
15 prosently in prison in Qibu. She was apparently ro-ausured that what
nho was to do would not make her luisband ashamed of her. For this reason
ANSTALK/1 says that he fools that the intent of the CUIS is to noutralize
him. ANSTALK/1 is of the opinion that the CUIS thinks he occupies a much
moro important position within WOFACT than he actually does.
ANSTALK/1 said that he is perfectly willing to follow NOFACT direc-
tions; that ho will gladly engage in a direct confrontation with the
CUIS if this is desired and that he would do so even though friends or
rolatives of his in Cuba might be in danger.

A'STALK/1 has probably already sent a cable to the CIS agreeing to meet
them in Madrid since we be fooled around
Renuing over backwards not
to hurt JMJAVE's delicate sensibilities. However, the attached is a pretty
good try a d we should at least make it a matter of record that wo don't
think it is a well thought out operation when WAVE has to send a CO when
there is a three man PERUMEN section in the Kadrid Station.

REF: JMWAVE 7100 (IN 64414)
1. IT IS OUR OPINION THAT BEFORE SENDING AMSTALK-1 OFF
TO SPAIN WE OUGHT TO TRY TO OBTAIN MORE ASSURANCE THAT THERE
WILL ACTUALLY OCCUR A MEETING BETWEEN AMSTALK AND A RESPONSI-
BLE CUIS OFFICER TO DISCUSS A PROPOSAL MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT
DESCRIBED IN THE CUIS MESSAGE.
2. IF THIS OPERATION RESULTS IN ANY SORT OF AN ENTENTE
BETWEEN AMSTALK-1 AND THE CUIS IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO REVIEW
AND EXAMINE EACH FACET MINUTELY.
THEREFORE WE SUGGESTED THE
SGSWIRL, IF POSSIBLE, OF AMSTALK-1 AND MARTHA TO ASSURE THE
CLOSEST EXAMINATION AND CORROBORATION OF EACH PHASE OF THE
STORY AT THE EARLIEST POINT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THIS
IS AN OPERATIONAL JUDGEMENT AND WITHIN WAVES PROGATIVE TO
DECIDE.

SUBJECT:
Recruitment Proposal Received by AMSTALK-1.
- 1.
On 25 April 1967, RAMSKILL and COBFIELD met with
AMSTALK-1 at safehouse #316 at his request for the purpose
of discussing what the agent described as "a matter of '
urgency".
ISALGUE
2. AMSTALK-1 said that his cousin, one Marta ISALQUE
Rodriguez, 44 years old, arrived in Miami via the Freedom
Flight on 11 April 1967. She is the wife of Fernando de
ROJAS, who is presently serving a 30 year sentence in la
Cabana Prison for conspiracy against the Castro Government,
Marta had applied for exit from Cuba some time ago, but it
wasn't until she wrote a letter to Manuel PINEIRO,) aka
-Barba Roja, Director of the DGI and close family friend of
the ISALGUE's prior to the Revolution, that she had any
inkling that her exit request would be honored. Following
dispatch of the letter, she was telephoned by PINEIRO who
said that he had taken her case under his personal supervision,
and that she would be visited by someone from his office in
the near future. The following day, PINEIRO's secretary
called on Marta to discuss the situation, and obtain necessary
additional dotails. Not hearing anything concrete for about
one month, Marta again wrote to PINEIRO, who again telephoned
her saying that immediate action would be taken. The follow-
ing day she was visited by two men who claimed to be from
PINEIRO's office. One identified himself as MENENDEZ and said
that he was a former close friend of AMSTALK-1. They gave
Marta a definite date for her departure from Cuba, and
promised to return again to insure that the plans were working
smoothly. Just prior to leaving Cuba, Marta was revisited hy
the two PINEIRO representatives, and was told that she had been

tho
Spelling
Attached for Headquarters information and evaluation
are copies of three JMWAVE memoranda, WSO's 3012, 3013,
and 3022, covering the background and events of the CUIS
proposal to AMSTALK-1 requesting a mooting to be hold in
either Canada or Spain. It should be noted that some
information reported initially is corrected in later
memoranda. As presented in referoncos and brought out
in more detail in the attached memoranda, the operation
by the CUIS seems to be directed by Manuel/ PINIERO

and the subsequent concealment of the message woró

purpose were only to get a message to AMSTALK-1, a
simple typed letter in a sealed envolop would have done
the job. The use of strip film which necessitates
special equipment for reading, also suggests the possibility
that the entire operation is designed for the purpose of
opening a channel to WOFACT. PINIERO would probably assume
AMSTALK-1 would report the incident to WOFACT and the
utilization of professional techniques might be a means of
establishing bona fides in order that WOFACT not dismiss the
message as other than genuine. Also attached for Headquarters
are photographs of the crucifix in which the message to
AMSTALK-1 was concealed.

Matanzas following the CUBELA/GUIN wrap up, and was interroga-

La Cabana,
b. During Marta's conversations with her husband prior
to her leaving Cuba, the two PINEIRO agents joined in the
talk without being in any way oppressive, and encouraged
Marta and her husband to suggest ways in which "the system"
might be improved.

intention of getting any further involved in clandestino rela-

instructed to review the message he had received, talk again with
his cousin, Marta, and add whatever he could to amplify the available
information in this matter.

granted a farewell moeting with her husband in a cabana.
On her way to the airlift, she was permitted lengthy
conversation with her husband, and was given a how cross
to attach to her rosary beads, and told that inside the cross
was a message for ANSTALK-1 in Miami, and that she would be
doing AKTALK-1 and horself a favor by delivering it. MENENDEZ
added that the message was from a good friend of ALLSTALK-1's.
Marta later boarded the Freedom Flight under the supervision
y of HEIENDEZ who permitted hor to bring with her certain of
her personal jewelry which a normal exile is not permitted.
'
2. AMSTALK-1 avoided meeting Marta at the airport for
reasons of security, and saw her for the first timo on the
following night, 12 April, but there were so many friends and
family present that they had no chance to talk alone. Marta
did indicate, however, that she wanted to have a long talk
with AMETALK-1. The following day, Marta loft for Wost Palm
Beach where she stayed with rolatives for about one week. Sho
returned to Miami and telephoned AASTALK-1 ou 24 April, at
which time a meeting was arranged for the same evening. It
was at this meeting that Marta gave AMSTALK-1 the above story
and the rosary.
'
3. There is attachod a translation of the message to
AUSTALK-1 which was hidden in the lower upright of the cross.
It appears to be a positive 35mm film strip of one frame.
According to TSB, it was a professional concealment job. The
name and address to which AMSTALK-1 may direct his replies
is unknown to the agent, although all of the facts in the
message indicate that the writer knows AHSTALK-1's position
exactly. The agent believes that the reason for the sonding
of the message at this time is that he was involved in the
CUBELA/GUIN wrap up and because this is the first time that
a close relative of his has come out. The agent has agreed to
follow whatever instructions we may have for him without
question, and reiterated that the Cuban colony here and the
Castro Government know that he cannot be influenced by any
such threats of blackmail against his family, a condition he
has been living with for the last five years,
4. In addition to the above, Harta provided the following
information:

action against his mother and another sister of his mother
living together in Havana (ages 72 and 78 respectively) and
unable to obtain permission to leave Cuba, and Andres VARGAS
Gomez, a friend presently serving a jail term in Cuba.
4. ANSTALK-1 agreed to follow whatever course of action

1. COBFIELD and RAMSKILL had a second meeting with AMSTALK-1
at S/H 316. An enlargement of the message which was concealed in
the crucifix and brought to Miami from Cuba by the cousin of
AMSTALK-1 was shown to AMSTALK-1. He read the message and the
English translation, commenting that the English coincided with
his own interpretation.
2.
AMSTALK-1's reaction to the contents of the letter was
mild and he did not appear too concerned about the threats to
his family (paragraphs 2 and 3). He stated that he did not
recognize the name at the bottom of the letter (Arturo PITA Rey)
and commented that from talks with his cousin he believed the
real sender of the letter was Manolo PINIERO\"Barba Roja" (Director
of the DGI), and that the name and address was probably an
accomodation address used by the Cuban Intelligence Service.
3.
AMSTALK-1 identified the names in Paragraph 2 as follows:
Fernando
Carlos
-
Ramon
Gina
-
-
Fernando de ROJAS husband of AMSTALK-1's
cousin, Marta (the source of the message)
presently serving a 30 year jail sentence

by AMSTALK-1 as a fanatical Catholic.
Carlos PEDRAZA

1. For the meeting AMSTALK-1 prepared the attached material.
Attachment 1 is a type written report by AMSTALK-1 of events which
took place in Cuba between his cousin, Marta ISALQUE Rodriguez
de ROJAS, and Manolo PINEIRO and his representatives. Attachment
2 is a message written by AMSTALK-1 and addressed to PINEIRO
containing his thoughts regarding a possible answer. (The message
has not been sent by AMSTALK-1, and he will not take any action
without our concurrence.)
2.
On April 30, 1967 AMSTALK-1 met with his cousin. According
to his cousin, the only persons, who know about the crucifix, and
the conversations about it and the message, are Manolo PINEIRO,
MENENDEZ and the other representative of. PINEIRO inside Cuba; and
AMSTALK-1 and herself in Miami. She told AMSTALK-1 that none of
the conversation about the crucifix or the message took place in
the presence of her husband, at the jail, and that MENENDEZ and
the other PINEIRO Representative, specifically cautioned her not
to reveal anything about the subject to anyone including members
of the Cuban G-2, security etc. To her knowledge no one else
knows about the subject. As a sidelight she told AMSTALK-1 that
MENENDEZ had informed her that unless she cooperated with them
and agreed to carry and deliver the message, she would not be
permitted to leave Cuba; but that the other individual with
MENENDEZ, interrupted at this point and told her that she would
be permitted to leave whether or not she agreed to do as they asked.
3. ANSTALK-1 also stated that his cousin told him that she
had not been asked by PINEIRO, or his representatives, or anyone
else, to carry any other messages or do anything else for them in
the U. S.

RECEIVED YOUR LETTER THRU MY SISTER MANTA AND MY
ANSWER IS AS FOLLOWS: SINCE YOU GAINED THE POWER IN
CUBA IT WAS MY DECISION TO FIGHT YOU; HAVING DONE SO
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT NOT DUE TO POLITICAL OR ECONOMICAL
AMBITION BUT TO THE IDEOLOGICAL DISCREPANCIES YOU WELL
THE YEAR
KNOW. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THAT IN/1956
WE SAW EACH OTHER AT THE CAFE WHICH BELONGS TO YOUR
COUSIN IN AGUIAR AND OBRAPIA IN OLD HAVANA. THEN YOU
TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE GOING TO THE SIERRA MAESTRA AND
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS LEAVING FOR THE UNITED STATES. FROM
THAT TIME AND EVEN BEFORE THEN WE HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE
SAME IDEOLOGICAL LINES. I KNOW THAT I HAVE FAMILY AND
VERY DEAR FRIENDS, SOME IMPRISONED AND OTHERS AT YOUR MERCY,
KNEW
IN MY COUNTRY. BUT THAT I / FROM THE TIME I CLANDESTINELY
LEFT CUBA. FOR THIS REASON I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE
REALIZATION OF THESE FACTS COULD AFFECT YOU OR ME. IF
THE SCALE IS IN YOUR (PL.) FAVOR AS THEY SAY AND IF
AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE BEEN GENEROUS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR WAY OF ACTING FOR THE PLEASURE
OF PUNISHING SOME ELDERLY AND POOR INDEFENSIVE PRISONERS.
WITH REGARDS TO A CONVERSATION I HAVE NO OBJECTION IN HAVING
ONE
AT ALL IN ANY ONE OF THE TWO COUNTRIES YOU HAVE MENTIONED
AS LONG AS YOU SEND ME THE MONEY FOR THE ROUND TRIP FARE
TO THAT LOCATION AND, OF COURSE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
THE ONLY OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO CONVERSE PREFERABLY WITH
YOU MANOLO, SINCE WE BOTH KNOW EACH OTHER.

Action Required: For Your Information
1.
Operational Activity:
A. During the period June-August 1966, AMSTALK/1 was
instrumental in assisting in the preparation of the AMTRUNK
Oporational Team consisting of AMAKA/1, AMTRUNK/24, and AMTRUNK/25
for STEAMER IX and X, a two phase oporation targetted at southern
Matanzas and Havana. During the final planning stages, however,
it was decided to omit for the present the portion of the operation
directed at Havana, and AMTRUNK/7, a former AMTRUNK Team guide on
operations in the northern Matanzas area, was rehired specifically
for the exfiltration phase of the STEAMER IX and X Oporation.
AMSTALK/1 was responsible for convincing AMTRUNK/7 to rejoin his
former team, and arranged the necessary cover details which would
explain AMTRUNK/7's absence from the JMWAVE area during the
operation.
B. During July 1966, AMSTALK/1 attended the majority
of the three week communications instructors course, but as the
result of the press of business in preparing for the STEAMER
Operation, was unable to complete the course; it is believed,
however, that AMSTALK/1 could perform as a qualified instructor
even though he did not receive his "diploma".
C. A part of AMSTALK/1's contribution to the STEAMER
Operation was the extensive and comprehensive debriefing of
refugees to the JMWAVE arca from the operational area..
information obtained from these reports was of value to the
The
AMTRUNK Team in planning for the STEAMER Operation.

Subject: Iden A
AMSTALK/1 was interviewed and tested on 2 June 1966 at a
safe site in the Nismi. area at the request of George R. RAMSKILL.
The interview was conducted in English.
ANSTALK/1 18 a Principal Agent of an infiltration team.
RESULTS
AHSTALK/1 is not cooperating in any way with the government
of any country other than PRPRIHE..
He has never done anything on purpose to cause a mission to
fail.
He is not obligated to any of the Cuban exile organizations.
He does not discuss with or report to any unauthorized por-
gons regarding his operational activities. He has not taken any
naauthorized persons to a safehouse or a training site.
AMSTALK/1 was asked whether anything had ever happened on a
mission which he did not report during his after-action debriefings.
Ho replied in the negative and there was no indication of deception.
DETAILS
ANSTALK/1 stated that ho was interested in the possibilities
of going into private business in Costa Rica, but so far be bad
made no commitments. If and when he does he plans to give KUBARK
the necessary notice.
EXAMINER'S NOTE:
While ANSTALE/1's charts during previous tests were unresolved,
the charts of 2 June 1986 were readable and are considered valid.

See Below

1. During late 1962 while still a member of the
AMICE organization, AMICE-14 received some informal para-
military training from JMWAVE. The cryptonym was assigned
to him at that time.
2.
Subject resigned from AMICE in March 1963 at
which time he became a fully-recruited asset of Station
JMWAVE. Subject has been associated with the MHAPRON-
oriented AMTRUNK (STEAMER) project as Team Leader and
Principal Agent since his resignation from AMICE.
3.
Since Subject's activities for the past three
years have been totally unrelated to those of AMICE, it is
requested that his cryptonym be changed to forestall any
further possible confusion between his current duties and
the activities of his former parent organization.
4. In anticipation of a favorable reply to this
request, the cryptonym AMICE-14 will be cancelled effective
15 March 66 and the new cryptonym AMSTALK-1 assigned to the
Subject of 201-307337 as of that date:

of the New York office was that be recentle letter of introduction from the benquan
Consulate in New York. This latter was relayed by phone on 17 tril, and resulted in
Subject's return to Washington. Luring the interim between the 17 April shone call and..
the tex 19 April meeting it was decided to have Subject make an effort to secure the

on 19 April and war informed that no visas were granted you by the Embassy, but that
he could get, one from the Consulate in Baltimore. Fubject called the Baltimore office
and was informed that if he showed us prior to 1500 hours ŉ visa could be shed without
writing. Subject asked about requirements such as a letter of introduction from the a
- Nicaraguan diplomatic installation, and was told that there was no such requirement..
Following the call Subject was fold to take a bun to Haltimore and make lication

Request for an Amendment of RN 9117'e
Operational Approval (201-307537)

1. It is requested that Subject's Operational
Approval be amended for his one-time use to assist in the
easing and possible installation of a proposed audio
operation under the cover of an air ocoditioner repairman
against the Soviet Rubans in Buenos Aires,
8.
We would appreciate axpeditious handling of this
request because this operation is expected to get underway
sometime in early April 1965, (per (ENCO AIRES-2341,
18-75483).

CANDIDATES UNCOVERED TINIS FAR HAVE
NO KNOWLEDGE MOFIRM AUDIO DEVICES AND NO AUDIO TECH ABILITY (IN CON.
TRAST GENERAL MECHANICAL, TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE).
APPEARS QUESTIONABLE
HOW MUCH AGENT SUCH AS AMSTALK-1 CAN ACCOMPLISH BEYOND CASING. SINCE
ULTIMATE INSTALLATION WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE PREFABBED DEVICE WHICH
COULD BE INSTALLED BY CASTAGNA, WE SUCCEST YOU ALSO CONCENTRATE ON
SUITABLE COMPONENT PARTS, ACCESSORIES OR OTHER ELECTRICAL PIXTURES
