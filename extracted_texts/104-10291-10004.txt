The figures cited in the last Fitness Report as to
the workload of the CCS Registry continued to be representative of the volume and
variety of Mr. Woods' responsibilities. He supervised the work of six subordinates
with a successful combination of patience and firm professionalism. He continued to
be the source of sound, constructive suggestions for coping with the paper "explosion"
occasioned by the investigations of CIA and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.
Mr. Woods is a highly valuable, reliable, unobtrusively effective records manager.
In moving on to new responsibilities in an area division he leaves behind a solid record
of achievement and the admiration of those with whom he has served in CCS.

Since his last Fitness Report, in June 1974, Mr. Woods has continued his extremely
fine performance as a conscientious, hard-working and thoughtful records manager and
registry supervisor. The CCS registry workload remains at about the same level as
préviously reported, and Mr. Woods regularly works an hour or so of uninterrupted over-
time every working day personally reorganizing procedures, cleaning out, consolidating,
and retiring files. His enthusiastic determination in reducing the numbers of out-of-
date and no longer useful files is most exemplary. Knowing the numbers of primary and
supplemental files involved in this exercise, and as a retiring supervisor, I can only
wish him "good luck"!

Mr. Woods also continues eager to learn and use new methods and techniques.

Both Mr. Yates' letter ratings, and narrative comments accurately reflect
the quality of Mr. Woods' performance during the reporting period. He
is a thoroughgoing professional records officer who uses his extensive
experience and his good judgement to take initiatives toward improving
the Registry service and the management of records. Hand in hand with
his high substantive competence goes his excellent ability as a super-
visor. I can say nothing more laudable in this regard than that I have
not had to deal with Registry personnel problems during the last year.
He knows the job that needs to be done and so do his people. With this
kind of leadership, the work gets accomplished with a high state of
_ morale.

After a short overlap with his predecessor, Mr. Woods assumed his responsibilities
as Chief of Registry, CCS, on 3 October 1973 - roughly nine months ago. In this
position he is responsible, overall, for CCS registry and records management activi-
ties, including the supervision of seven other individuals. As could be expected from
even a casual reading of his past fitness reports, Mr. Woods quickly took hold, and
has been performing his new responsibilities in an exemplary manner. Despite the
volume and variety of files with which he was required to become familiar, early on he
systematically began cleaning out, consolidating, and retiring files as appropriate,
reorganizing and updating the indexing system for individual and project files, and
redistributing employee workloads. He also reorganized the placement of file machine-
ry, desks, and service counter to achieve greater employee comfort and efficiency in
the utilization of personnel. Although his task as Staff Security Officer is a
secondary function, he also reorganized, simplified and re-wrote the security check
and duty officer roster procedures.
Indicative of the work which he supervises are selected Registry statistics for
May 1974 7015 documents filed, 8200 files pulled (and re-filed) for Staff officers'
use, 6642 cables processed and distributed, 9900 facility and name searches, 2353
documents logged, 833 index cards made and filed, and 200 new files opened. During
his nine months with CCS, Mr. Woods not only has had to learn the CCS "system" himself.

high degree of effectiveness and accomplishment. He has concentrated on
improving our records holding standards and on purging irrelevant and out
dated files. In May 1972 he began a monthly series of progress reports
for the Chief of Station outlining the month's accomplishments. Copies
of these reports through January 1973 were sent to Hqs in OIRT-18014 and
18015, dated 9 Feb 73. These reports clearly show this officer's focus
on records management activities, his ingenuity and agressiveness in
launching programs of review of files and his tireless efforts in reduc-
ing Station holdings to a practical and useable minimum. His records
inventory as of September 1972, reporting a total reduction in excess
of 85 feet, speaks for itself. His next report also promises to show.
dramatic reductions.
This officer shows a sense of professional responsibility and deter-
mination in the oft neglected function of records management, deeper and
more intense than any other witnessed by the rating officer in his career
He performs his other duties as Chief, Registry with an equally high
degree of effectiveness. Subject officer may have been inadvertently a
hiding his talents under the proverbial bushel basket by having remained
in the field for so long. It is the rater's hope that, llqs now has
focussed on him and has discovered his potential for greater responsibili
ties. The records in this Station are tremendously improved for his
having had a tour in Rome. We are certainly glad he came.

This officer has been remarkably effective during his tour in Rome.
While we are very sorry to lose him, there is no question that his
formidable talents should be used on a much broader range of records
management and rated problems than could be done in this Station.
His next assignment in Headquarters appears to give him that additional
scope. We are glad that he served in Rome and that during this tour
here he received a well-deserved promotion. Rome Station's records
have improved considerably as a result of this officer's tour here.
I am in full agreement with the above comments and ratings.

is affable in dealing with his peers and confident and persuasive in
dealing with the senior management of this Station. Shortly after his
arrival he took over the analysing and distribution of the cables, and
prepared a Station procedure for this purpose. Immediately following
that, he devised a new procedure for handling correspondence and..
installed it. He had reviewed the multitudinous files at this Station
and has plans to trim them back to more reasonable and appropriate

In the four months he has been under my supervision, Subject
has demonstrated that he merits in full measure the high opinion
of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful,
fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has gone about his
day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without the
need for constant supervision. He is prompt in his response to
requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He
is an intelligent and concerned supervisor who has been meticulous
in keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems
as they have arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully
capable of assuming larger responsibilities in the records field.
The rating officer regrets that Subject's family situation pre-
cludes his staying for another tour.

Mr. Woods first made a survey of the Augean stable that the Italian Branch
files had become over many years of shifts in personnel,and changes of direction.
He then reviewed, downgraded, and retired approximately 350 Top Secret docu-
ments with appropriate Project and Subject files and copies destroyed. At the
completion of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch. He devised,
gained approval from FI/D, and carried out a new procedure for the downgrading of
TYLOTË material from Top Secret to Secret so that it could be retired. He retired
approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files. He surveyed the Commu-
nist Party of Italy files and discovered that there were a total of 93 of which 19 were
already closed. He closed 47 of the remainder and left 25 open and arranged for
RID/ARD to retire all the material in the open files prior to 1 January 1971. He
closed and retired Plan files dating back to the early 1950's. All in all, out of 76
feet of safe space filled with CS material, he retired 36 feet of files leaving a cata-
logue of where everything is or has been sent. A remarkable record (and done with
a minimum of fuss and Branch dislocation)!¸
What he did in such a short time speaks eloquently of how he went about his
duties fòr which see the accompanying memorandum of recommendation for promo-
tion.
Reporting officer has known him over fourteen years and has the unvarying
impression of him as a quietly competent, diligent, reliable, self-reliant individual.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL ] concur in the above evaluation. Subject turned in
a most impressive performance during his brief time on the Italian Branch.
Largely as a result of his enthusiasm and initiative, the Branch was able
to achieve what had never been accomplished before; a complete overhaul,
cleaning, purging, and restructuring of its filing system. To his credit,
Subject has a keen appreciation for operational requirements and all of
this work was done without sacrificing the future utilization of information
acquired in the past; on the contrary, the efficient use of this material
has been so enhanced that it will surely be reflected in our future opera
tions. Mr. Woods has a unique contribution to make in Rome or any other
place he is assigned. The Station is fortunate to have him....his presence
is sorely needed to do the same thing in Rome that he has just accomplished

With about nineteen months experience managing the station
registry already under his belt, his usefulness here increases.
Ho continues to demonstrate the same quietly effective leadership
and talent for sound organization in his own shop as were noted
on the last fitness report.
While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day-
to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to
supply, he has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully
phased and continuing review and, where appropriate, purge of
registry and other file holdings. Administering this ambitious
reduction program requires sound judgment and experience in
handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these
qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete
this task, he has asked to extend his tour here for one year
until November 1971 and Headquarters has approved this.
He is invariably completely responsive to guidance from the
DCOS, his immediate supervisor, and conscientiously seeks to
achieve the work goals which are identified during our occa-
sional accomplishment and performance consultations. The
spirit of cooperation with which he deals with other station
personnel is equally commendable.

This is Subject's final Fitness Report as Chief, Registry at Vietnam
Station. He has worked long and hard but can look with pride at
the many accomplishments that he has effected during his tenure. He
will depart leaving a sound and well-functioning organization. His
planning has been effective and his cross-training and development
of the personnel under his supervision-have been fully productive.
During this period, his unit has experienced heavy increases in work-
load and assumed now or additional functions, with no reduction in
the service provided to Station components. ·
Subject has been responsible for many work saving innovations, pro-
cedural changes and a thorough updating and revamping of the highly
important registry reference rocords,
The personnol under his supervision display onthusiasm and dedication
in their work. Thoir pleasant manner is a reflection of Subject's
management ability.

on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amelity or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if
applicable. He arrived ten months ago at this post, with considerable
experience in Registry work at Headquarters at Other field stations
and with a thorough understanding of how a Station Registry should be
organized and run. He immediately put this understanding to good use.
While maintaining the overall efficiency of Registry "programs already
in effect when he took over, he enthusiastically began a carefully-
planned and continuing effort to further reduce less than essential
Registry paper holdings with results which are already impressive.
His suggestions on new procedures designed to conserve space and man-
power are usually imaginative and practical.
He himself is a remarkably well-organized, conscientious and
cooperative person.
He has had to undertake his improvements while accommodating
to the loss of one Registry slot which fell victim to a Foreign Service
reductions program. Primarily due to his managerial talents, the
Registry has been made to carry on almost as well with three regulars
as with the previous four. Although his people are increasingly hard-
worked, their morale is high. He himself appears to be a glutton for
work but his Registry is obviously a happy shop.

This employee continues to be Chief of the Station Registry. During the past year
his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exceptionally proficient. He
continues to welcome hard work, is not bothered by constantly changing deadlines
and is able to fill in for any absent member of his unit, and keep up his own work
as well. He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and materiel,
and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He continues to come
up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective
manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station. It is regretable that the
position this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been performing
at a level above his present grade for several years.

As the Chief of the Tokyo Registry this employee has performed well.
He has abundant energy and constantly comes up with ideas for the improvement
of the efficiency of his unit. He welcomes hard work and is able to fill in and
take over any job in his unit and keep up with his own duties as well. As a
supervisor, he has a slight tendency to be arbitrary when convinced he is right.
This may be due to the fact that the Registry frequently operates under conditions
of pressure due to the recent reorganization, reduction, and relocation of the
Station. The Station has been required to get the job done with fewer people and
under more difficult working conditions.

As Chief of the Tokyo Station Registry, this employee has performed at a level
of exceptional proficiency for the past year. He welcomes hard work, is able to fill
in for any absent member of his unit and keep up his own work as well. He continues
to bring up ideas for the improvement of his unit. These have been particularly
welcome during the past year in view of the impending move of the Registry to a new
location at Fuchu Air Station. The slight tendency to be arbitrary mentioned in the
last fitness report has been eliminated during this reporting period. In view of this
employees strong performance over the past year, he is being recommended for
promotion to GS-10.

In
I concur in this rating and add that this employee has not let the
very serious personal problems thrust upon him during this period
interfero in any way with his consistently dependable performance.
this key role, in any station of this size, dependability, reliability
and confidence are “musts" and while there are quite naturally small
aggravating incidents of mis-routing or mis-direction of documents, I
have been struck by the lack of them here, because ratee has the "must"
qualities. His performance certainly warrants favorable consideration
of the projected promotion action.

Ratee has been in charge of station registry since A
MAROON. This has been
a period of dramatic conge in the station and expecially in our paper management.
He has responded well to these changes and shows a degree of adaptability that boden
well. His handling of our recent "holdings" inventory, his unceasing efforts to reduce
unnecessary holdings, end his knowledge of his business (RI) have ade him a valued
addition to our shrinking tean. In this short rating period there has been little

produced results in his own work, but have kindled enthusiasm and interest
within the Division in developments in Agency records management. He has
been able to improve records within the Division with a great success,
and at the same time avoided the usual aversion to records responsibility
which too much emphasis on records creates in the case officer. His ability
to get along well with others is important in his liaison function.
Mr. Woods' work on the vital materials program in the last year has
resulted in a much more realistic program for the Division. The creation and
4616/116h up-to-date retention of vital materials has for some time been
a problem for which little solution could be found. It appears that the.
present program will result in vital materials which will be current and

Subject is an excellent records officer. He is enthusiastic about his specialty
and works hard at it, putting a great deal of energy into his work.
He is quick and understands records thoroughly. Because of this, he is at
times inclined to jump ahead of others in records discussions and should attempt
to slow down his approach to the subject to meet the level of persons who do
not have the same records background.
Subject could fill any position in the records management Nald, and should

classic registry functions normally performed by a station registry.
i
"Subject has energetically applied himself to improving procedures
within his Section and to the cross-training of employées under his
supervision to provide flexibility in his operations. His efforts in
these areas bore welcome fruit during the recent disturbances when
his Section was placed on twenty-four (24) hour duty for several weeks.
During this period, while operating with a reduced staff and an ever-
Increasing workload, Subject kept all services operationally effec-
tive and on a timely basis with the excaptica of the in-country courier
rone' which were interrupted for a few days by clzcumstances beyond
bis control.

SUBJECT:
James S. WOODS
-
Recommendation for Promotion
:
"
1.
Subject has been in grade GS-10 since June 1968.
Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Registry in
the Romo Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits
promotion to grade GS-11 at this time. When Subject took
over the responsibility for Registry a year ago, he found a
system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy which
discouraged getting rid of it. He found many procedures in
force which were out of date, if not obsoleto, and proposed
streamlined procedures, which were adopted, to replace them.
He asked for and was given the responsibility to analyze and
distribute the cables, which had previously been a function
of the Chief of Station's secretary. He recommended the
discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had
been adopted by most elements of the Station. He recommended
a reduction in the retention period for cable and dispatch
chronos. With the help of a TDY team here for the first half
of CY 1972, he devised and instituted a program of purging
the files This program has resulted in the disposition of
most of the departed Soviet files, a severe trimming of the
true name files, and the review, reduction and up-dating of
the project and operational files. All of this work was
Lccompanied by appropriate name checks, cntries on the index
cards and selection of pertinent documents for transmittal to
Headquarters. In summary, Subject performed a thorough "house-
cleaning" of Station records in the full meaning of that phrase.
This program is by no means finished. In fact, Subject has
plans for continuing efforts along these lines which may exceed
his tenure at this Station since he intends to return to Head-
quarters not later than May 1974, The on-going program includes
a review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted
201's and the disposition (hopefully) of about 50 feet of micro-
film. A corollary to these projects will be a significant
reduction in the index cards, which at present lead to the micro-
film and to other superfluous material we either have or will
destroy.

namely the introduction of procedures to lessen the likelihood

if not prevent the reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
is not lost on this officer. He constantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.
3. Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
scientious, and hard working. He reports to work each day
an hour before the Station opens in order to distribute the
cables by opening of business. He never hesitates to respond
positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits
work which he believes can be done more easily or more simply
in his unit. In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
sional records management officer who is thoughtful as well
as enthusiastic about his work.
4. It is strongly recommended that Subject bo pro-
moted to grade GS-11.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Chief of Station, London
SUBJECT

Promotion Recommendation
James S. Woods

L
!
Subject, who has been in grade as a GS-10 just two years,
has been Chief of the Registry of the London Station for eighteen
months. Subject,
Subject, fresh from a Saigon assignment, brought with
him a broad and varied background of field experience (Far East)
and several Headquarters' assignments. He has been in one or
another aspect of records management work since he started with
us as a very junior clerk in 1952.
Subject's fitness reports, since he has been in London,
testify to the high regard in which he is held by the Station
and the excellent results he has managed to achieve. When he
arrived at the Station, the start had been made on a file reduction
program but an enormous amount of organized work remained to be
done. Subject set about it with great enthusiasm and a high degree
of professional organization. As a result, the Registry inventory
today is the leanest and the most efficient the Station has scen
for many a long day, if ever before. To a great extent this can
he laid at Subject's own door and he personally did much of the
work. At the same time, Subject surveyed and reorganized the over-
all workload of the Registry and was finally able to recommend to
the Station gement a reduction of one Registry clerk. The
Naller Sisif cas certainly required a more intensive work effort
on the part of Registry personnel, which has been attained without
any loss of morale; in fact, quite the reverse. .
-
Subject, aherefore, emerges as a records management officer
who has thoroughly learned his business and a hard-driving,
sympathetic and successful supervisor. In the opinion of the
Station management, Subject is already quite capable of taking
over broader and more senior responsibilities in the records manage-
ment field. In this respect, however, we do not believe he will..
be wasting his time in London by spending, as he currently plans to
do, an additional year here on the completion of his tour in
November. The London Registry, reflecting the multi-faceted work
of the Station, is sufficiently complex an operation to warrant

Request for Quality Step Increase
for Mr. James S. Woods, GS-09
i
:
1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is recommended
that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. James S. Woods.
2. Mr. Woods entered on duty with the Agency in April 1952 as a GS-03
Records and File Clerk assigned to RID. Since that time Mr. Woods has
served as a Records Analyst at Headquarters, in Korea and Atsugi, Manila,
and since 1961 in the Central Registry Section of the Tokyo Station.
Mr. Woods is 37 years old and has been in grade as a GS-09 since 1958.
3. Mr. Woods exceptional performance is described by the Tokyo
Station as follows:
"A. Mr. Woods is now on his second tour as Chief of the Tokyo
Station Registry. This unit is located at Fuchu Air Station and handles
all correspondence for all Station elements. In view of the fact that
the Station is located in five different geographic locations, a great
deal of responsibility is given to Mr. Woods to ensure that action
responsibility on incoming cables is rapidly and properly assigned,
dispatches are correctly routed and processed, correspondence from
other local military agencies is correctly analyzed and routed, the
twice-a-day courier system is functioning effectively, and the Station
flexowriter is rapidly churning out priority dispatch traffic,
"B. The Registry is presently composed of six employees in
addition to Mr. Woods, who is Chief of this unit. Mr. Woods does
an exemplary job in supervising these employees with the result
that the Station Registry is a smooth and well-functioning unit,

"C. In addition to his normal duties, Mr. Woods is constantly
thinking of ways to increase the efficiency of the Station Registry,
and to be of greater assistance to the Station as a whole. Several of
his ideas have been adopted by the Station with a resulting increase
in effectiveness. His positive approach to all problems and his
cheerfulness and willingness to perform any task have benefited
both the Station and the Agency.
"D. In view of Mr. Woods' demonstrated ability to provide
leadership to the Station Registry unit, his positive approach to
the solution of the many problems which daily beset this unit,
it is strongly recommended that he be promoted from GS-09 to
GS-10 at the earliest opportunity."
4. Mr. Woods has continued to perform in an over-all "Strong"
manner as indicated in his recent fitness report. He recently planned
and effectively implemented the move of the Cable Secretariat from one
location to another. In a dispatch, dated 22 November 1965, the present
Chief of Station, Tokyo, stated, "There is little I can add to my prede-
cessor's recommendation, dated 9 November 1964, for promotion of
Mr. Woods. He is performing his duties as Chief of the Tokyo Station
Registry with efficiency and dispatch. He is a strong supervisor who
constantly strives to achieve the maximum economy in the use of his
personnel and materials.
11
5. Consideration has been given to the granting of an Honor and
Merit Award to Mr. Woods, but in this particular case it appears that
a Quality Step Increase is more appropriate.

for his most diligent performance of duty during his recent
TDY hero, his highly cooperative attitude and above all, hic extreme
eagerness to got a job done woll and expeditiously.
Į
It was largely with his help that Koren Station was able to
screen and process the voluminous matorial which nocded to be handled
in order to ostrblish a coordinated and integrated record and file
maintenurice system.
All Koron Station personnel connected with the work of th TDI
Team members were impressed and gratified by the earerness with which
they assisted with details and helped with problems that were outside
the responsibilities of their assigned task. Their pleacant manner,
apt suggestions, their excellent cooperation and untiring efforts
to complete more than the initially ontimated workload, all creatod
a most favorable impression which reflects much credit not only on
the toan membora themolves but on the Records Integration Branch

MEMORANDUM FOR: James B. Woods
VIA
1. Chief, FB
The problem of effective management of the operational records
of the Clandestine Services is one of our most important responsibilities.
In this connection, you have been selected by your Division, and
authorized by the Clandestine Services Records Committee, to act as
Records Officer for your component. Your selection is based on your
professional qualifications to carry out an assignment requiring
experience, judgment, and a knowledge of the objectives of the Clan-
destine Services. A copy of this memorandum will be placed in your
official personnel folder to record your appointment as Records
Officer
2. You are to act on behalf of your Division or Staff element
in authorizing the destruction of material of no value to the Clandestine
Services in accordance with criteria established for this purpose. You
are empowered to authorize the destruction of documents and index
cards recommended for destruction by other members of your Branch,
and to desensitize KAPOK and RYRAT material which is no longer sensitive
or which has been restricted in error. Your signature will be recognized
by RID as that of an officially appointed Records Officer.
+
3. At the meeting of 16 December 1958
, you were briefed on
the details of your duties as Records Officer. It is now considered
that you will be able fully to execute your duties as Records Officer
and thus make a real contribution to the CS Records Management Program.

1953 and has performed the duties of his present assignment since 10 August

time has managed to keep his backlog to a minimum.
A
CDS is conscientious, hard-working and more than willing to work
long hours of overtime without additional compensation in order to maintain
his section on a current basis. Subject indiviland devoted unusually long
hours to establish himself during the recent have of this Mission to Japan.

Commendation for Exceptional Performance
1
The Directorate of Operations Records Review
Task Force has finished its work in Warrenton I want
you to know that I realize that a large measure of the
success of this effort was due to the exceptional per-
formance of the Records Management Officers who worked
long and hard during the six-month period, patiently
guiding the 435 Directorate personnel who served on
the component teams. Many of you performed additional
duties, voluntarily and cheerfully, extending beyond
the ten-hour, work day, which kept the task force
functioning smoothly.
2. This fine team effort and your personal
contribution to it is in the best tradition of the
Directorate of Operations. I commend you for a job
we'll done.
