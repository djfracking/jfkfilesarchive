NOTE: [AESTORAGE represents a collation of information
provided by several reliable and sensitive sources,
some of them documentary.02 (AE STORAGE information is
not to be released outside of the Clandestine Services
Components of CIA unless written authorization has been
granted by C/SR/CI.02 (AE STORAGE information may be trans-
mitted to CIA field stations only after it has been
coordinated with C/SR/CI.
Source transited Helsinki in May 1961, at which time he
obtained a visa at the Soviet Embassy from one KLIMOV. Beginning
shortly after Christmas 1961 and continuing on and off for the
next three months, Source was interrogated by the KGB in Moscow
about his contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki.
Source prepared a written report giving in detail the physical
description of all KGB officers who had met him in Helsinki.
2. In 1963 or 1964 Source was told by the KGB that it was
unlikely he would ever be assigned to the United States as a
Soviet who had defected in Helsinki could personally identify
Source.
