Senator Schweiker:
After October of '622
Mr. Halley. No, prior to October of 162, because the
Cuban crisis was in October of '62, but the buildup preceded
It, and our operations which were collecting Intelligence in
Cuba detected this buildup as it was unfolding. Therefore,
the national priority became now how do you take action against
Fidel Castro, but what is the nature of this soviet buildup.
And therefore the operation changed.
Then after the Cuban missile crisis of October of 1963,
the problem became one of monitoring the Soviet disengagement
from Caba, and then there was another phase after that when
the Soviets were out, Castro wan clearly recognized as the
established power in Cuba, and the problem became one of
looking at Cuba in the context of was there some other way từ
get a political change in Cuba other than by military action
or by paramilitary action. In other words, the emphasis...
shifted to looking at the Castro military establishment to
see it 4 coup could be pulled from within, to see if economi
pressures could be put on the Casbro regime.
So the tasking of this particular unit did change, and
change of nuances and degrees during this period, but in pul
professional sense it was focused on the Cuban targets. BO
in that sense you are correct, but it did go through variou
changes as events changed.

Senator Schweiker
What was the relationship of your
station and your assignment to General Lansdale? What role
did he play?
Mr. Halley. Wall' in the early days, in the early period
of 1962, General Lansdale was a member of a group that was
looking at the basic problem of what could be done against the
Cuban activity. This came up in one of my previous conversation
with Mr. Baron.
Senator Schweiker. Are you talking about something we
call Operation MONGOOS6, are we talking about Special Group
Augmented, or what are we talking about?

Mr. Halley.
Well, when I first cano into this activity
In 1952, the principal people that seemed to be involved with
it at that time were Robert Kennedy, General Lansdale, Dick,
Helms, and William Harvey, and the group of Kennedy, Lansdal
and lelas were providing, if you will, the guidance and the
direction as to where this thing should go in the early days.
Shortly after the operation was established and I was
in Miami, Lansdale seams to have faded out of this particul.
picture, and I was not involved in the Washington nuances of
this, so I am not clear as to exactly what was the reason for
his departure from this particular scene.

Mr. Wall
Wallach. Let's go back to terms, then. I'm not
about an investigation where you could obviously have the
freedom to go up and interview anyone you wanted to interview.
MrJallay. No. We are talking about through clandestin
resources. In other words, to conduct this kind of investig:-
tian, you know, in my view, you would have had to have had
a penetration of one or more of the Cuban intelligence servine
The penetration would have had to have been in the 26th of Ju
Movement, and had enough rapport with the top leadership that
It could have moved freely in and out of a specific dircle
would probably had to have been at the level of a Comantiänis,
We did not have that kind of resource in death to conduct
that kind of investigation.
Mr. Walfach were there ever way discussions at thựt a
that you remember between yourself, Pitzgerald, Helms,
wayons, as to whether or not the CIA did have the capabili:;
to conduct such an investigation?

Mr.. Halley. Well, for instance, we had let's say, for
the month of October 1963, we would draw up an operational
plan in September. In the course of that operational plan and
geated to the dark of the moon, we would have a number of
Infiltration Sissions scheduled to put in caches. We'd have
ar of missions scheduled to put in teams or to take
people out of Cuba. We'd have a number of missions
scheduled to conduct commando raids againer fixed installation
So we would draw up the schedule and coordinate the
schedule with the appropriate agencies like Coast Guard dr
Customs so that we could move our boats in and out and not

pursuing our boats.

The reason this name trace thing sticks:

my mind, frankly, is because of the name traces that ware com

was made on the fact that there was the discussion and debate
between Oswald and the DRE follow, and we were tracing à lớ
of names at that time, and in conjunction with this particular
event, once people were acrested and detained and there was
some reason to expect that there was what I called an investi-

Mr. Halley, Well, as that particular point in Nimé,
think higher authority was a euphemism for the President and

Mr. Johnston. And again, you don't recall knowing in
the same tine period, December 1963, that you were cabled that
the headquarters procedure was to present the infiltration

Mr. Halley. Noll, I have forgotten the date when this
transition took place. As of a fixed date, in the course
of this operation, we had to supply all of our infiltration
operations a month in advance. I'm sorry, I just don't

we were constantly making projections of where the sugar cza
