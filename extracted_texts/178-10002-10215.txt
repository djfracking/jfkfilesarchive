here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

I beg your pardon
does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have
a career agent who has been with us for a good many years

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
12
13
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths,
this

type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
17
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like

he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double him,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever.

So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens in this

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a
boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations
and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,
sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in
any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever
do it on any of our boats, planes, or anything that belongs
to the Agency.
Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain
a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting
together his own crew?
A
No. He had an assigned crew and every boat had a
Case Officer operating either out of the
probably out of
the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have
some people in the Key West base. But he, Martinez, would receive
his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.
So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis
along on any of these operations?

some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic
Training Station is under the Office of Training and but I
would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would
probably staff the training facility with their people who have

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

We had the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept
Fidel kept
16
saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and
17
18
we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because
some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutting
19
this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,
20
this type of thing. So subsequently,
we found out that he was
21
lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any
22
place.
He had no storage facilities and put it any place he
23
could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in
New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

BY MR. MANFREDI:
When we broke for a moment we were discussing other
instances where the Agency has enlisted the support of American
business in economic warfare against Cuba. Can you think of
any other such instances?
A Oh, certainly. The Cubans were having an awful time
with their Maritime fleet, such as it was. These boats were
powered with Nordberg engines. We simply went to the Nordberg
people and told them asked them to cooperate with us, which

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going to

And did you commute with some frequency to Miami?
Yes.
Were your activities in Miami in any way connected
with the operations of the Miami Station?
A In some way. My responsibilities were worldwide.
I took temporary duty predominantly in Europe, and then Miami.

What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the
Puerto Rican thing?
A Well, that is one of the things I had in mind.
Would you describe that for me?
A Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of
opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar
to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to
it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or
something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.
16
17
In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the
drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and
18
put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came
19
up with a plan to try to widen the rift between

21
put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done.
And then when it
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar
firm buy it back from the Soviets.

they had a recep-

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there and
we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration
and Naturalization Service cover. When the NEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to fill
out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biographic-
type thing. These forms would be passed to our people who would.
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, and they felt that perhaps they
might have some information of intelligence value, they would
reinterrogate them.

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?
A Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
7
known as Legal Attaches,
obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from.
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Well, I can't give you a real yes or no to that. I
would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could
have been used to debrief people within the community, within
the Cuban community, but we had in the organization all these
people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an
On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he
had a couple of assistants; including a secretary. These people
were directly under his control: Though the organization as it
was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,
but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

A. We may assist if we are asked but the idea of the whole
airlift was having relatives here for somebody to claim you when
you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the
Government, and normally when these refugees came in, they were
processed through the Center and then they had a place down on
Biscayne Boulevard they called Freedom House and this was, of
course, all run by HEW, and they if need be and they had to
stay overnight or stay several days, HEW would put them up and
care for them in Freedom House.

commo. for the infiltration.
As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made
available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA tasks them with
the frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications
nets they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another
important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,
sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior
network they covered too. But all electronic intercept coverage
is dictated by NSA.

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require

because the common interests,
we have a common interest in
what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular
operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubans
were doing, then we would task our people with that.
For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into
Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then
there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.
But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the
boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when
it came back on the air. And this is the type of thing. As.
a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200

Now, with particular reference to the last half of
1963, including whatever period in June '63 may not have been
involved, were there a great many. Cubans in the southern United
States who were active in revolutionary fronts that were being
sponsored by the Agency?
A
Wellm you mean Agency sponsored fronts?
Yes.
The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to
have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-Castro
factions. Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the
CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these
fronts did not know they were being subsidized by the Agency
or the U.S. Government.
0. But when you say "supposedly," does the fact appear
to be otherwise?
A. WEll, based on my experience with the Cubans and this
type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that
it wouldn't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to surface
itself.
Was it your opinion and impression at that time, Mr.
Sturbitts, that a great many Cubans considered themselves to be
involved in the CIA organizations?

I understood you to say that it was your impression in 1963
that large numbers of Cuban exiles, Cuban people in the southern
United States, talked about and believed that they were involved
in the CIA sponsored activities. Is that true?

I understood from what files I have seen, Mr.

Office of Finance showed that he had had nine hours of sick leave
during the two-week pay period ending the 23rd of November but
that the records were not available as to how much sick leave
or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

Am I mistaken?

No. I really wouldn't know, but the relationship was
a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these
people as well as they were assigint us.
Q
What assistance would you render for members of
the press in Miami?
A
Well, in the case of the Latin American editor
we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of
areas he periodically visited and the Chiefs of Stations
would give him background briefings and this type of thing
on the developments within a given country.
0 Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?
Predominantly, I would say probably the Miami
Herald received probably a little more attention than the
other papers, principally because it was a large paper and
their Latin American editor traveled a great deal throughout
the Hemisphere.
Was he also used as a source?
No.
