Pursuant to Reference C, the Station requested UEAVE traces on the Sub

The Station concurs with the suggestion that the REDSOX section of FOB
undertake the recruitment and processing of the Subject. For reasons that need not
be discussed in detail in this dispatch, the undersigned has become extensively
known in the Georgian colony in true name, and plans to continue spotting and assessing
Georgian candidates for other SR activities in France. The Georgian colony in France
is small and the Station already has ample evidence that news of intelligence activity
within the colony often becomes common knowledge very quickly. Therefore, it is
best to risk an unknown outside asset for something so unequivocally compromising as
a REDSOX recruitment.
3. Attached also is one of two copies of Subject's signature which was ob-
tained by AEPADDIE as a means of establishing bona fides (see OF PW-20982).
4. The Station will be glad to discuss the various problems of this case
with FRIGANZA or anyone else designated by FOS. It is requested that Headquarters
advise what further action will be required of the Paris Station.

Specific REDSOX Candidate in France
Reference: OPFW 20952, dated 23 May 1958 201-207137
Action requested: Please advise if it is desired
that we contact and assess Subjeot
Subject of this dispatch is the person thought to have genuine
PEDSOX potential mentioned in the first paragraph of reference.
12. Subject was described to us by AEPADDLE before the latter con-
tacled him in Prance and from the report submitted under reference, it
would appear to us that he may be even better than first was thought.
We have noted the pros and cons as outlined in reference and would like
the opportunity to comment on the latter. It would seem to us that the
fast that subject is on parole ought to make little difference, as far
as his candidacy for REDGOX 1s concerned. Surely a means can be devised
to remove him from France so that he will neither be hunted by the French
authorities nor become the object of suspicion simply because he has left.
He might emigrate to South America, which we probably could help him

flects on his character, we believe that what we wrote about the criminal

in Georgia being considered as a con is difficult for us to understand,
but we assure there must be some special circumstances which maire it so.
Generally speaking, we should have thought this to be a positive factor.
Regarding possible surveillance by the other emigres we submit that such
must be assumed in every case, notwithstanding what the Subject in
question may think. The presumed surveillance becomes a problem when it
is time to remove a candidate for training, which calls for a smooth-
cover for his disappearance (cf. EGPA 21407). After all, emigre sür-
veillance can only do so much; it cannot keep close tabs on an individual
hourly. About the last point: Unless there are some special reasons not
explained in reference why contacting Subject is difficult, we believe

means of authenticating the approach outlined in reference should te

3. Unless the Paris Station is in a position to make the contact
with subject, we request permission to do so. If granted, we would visit:
Gap, contact Subject by means of a photograph which, it would seem, could
be supplied by Headquarters. It should be an uncomplicated matter to
establish our bona fides. We should then try to arrange for Subject to

Since 1953 BERESHVILI has been contacted two or three

feels the Americans are not following up properly. He said the
latest attempt involved a letter written to him in Russian, giving
him a telephone number to call. Before calling it he tried to
trace the number through connections of his wife's. He feels that
contact with Georgia is important if the emigratiɔn organizations

Shota and Sorgo TSOULADZ devised a code to advise Shota
whether he should repatriate or not. Shota is to inform AEPADDLE
of any such message. Shota was formerly an engineer, is now
a taxi driver. AEPADDLE feels that Serge ISOULADZE is no

c. Nearly everyone received the Georgian lang sago
paper of the Mikhailov Committee in Eerlin.
2. CABACHVILI, PATARIDZE and ZURABICHVILI all expressed
interest in American support for their group. They stated that
the support given to their group as a whole by Polish intelligence
before WW II largely contributed toward the readiness of large
numbers of Caucasians to fight against the USSR during the war.
PATARIDZE said he would like to be sent to Turkey to organize
contacts with Georgia. Says he can get necessary papers for
trip to Turkey, and has maa in mind for such mission (apparently
DJAPADZE). PATARIDZE says this operation would cost no
more than one million French francs.

Both the Socialists and National Democrats would like to

apparently want to play down anti-communism (as opposed to
Georgian separatism) and also want to have nothing to do with

callaboratɔr with the American Committee refused to break the
connection or to drop the anti-communist line.

Caucasus. Concerned with this activity are Micha ALCHIBAYA
and fnu MENDE, the German officer in charge who was interested
in the Caucasus during WW II. So far nothing concrete has
been accomplished. AEPADDLE received this information from
PATARIDZE, who has been to Munich in connection with this activity.

Nothing came of the check and there is no reason to believe that Subject
will be troubled further. But the prespect of complications with the
Prench authorities, who are cow-a-days frequently in an angry mood anyway,
distarted Subject so that he was not as pliable or as intent on the exercise
with fäentity as he had been. Also, not kicking what could have been be
en
hind the police check and not wishing to take unnecessary risks in the
circumstances, we did not dally with the remaining things which needed to
be daze Identity was finished with Subject shortly before noon, whereupon
we instructed him to check out of his hotel and have his picture
the latter because we had claims to
have sent. We met Subject at the Gare Montparnasse at 1500 hours to
discover that he had not been able to get the negatives owing to the
reluctance of the photographers to part with them, or so he claimed.
Instead, we got several "Photomat" shots and accompanied Subject to the
vicinity of his hotel near the Gara St. Lazard where we waited until we
san Subject depart from the hotel after checking out with his things
This we knew that he had departed safely and that he had not got involved
in a police follow up
not received by post the negatives heken,
7. Arrangements with Subject: By the time we left Subject on 9
January we promised him that we would write him within five days to in-
form him of the approximate dete of the next
the next meeting and/or give him a
general answer whether he will be transferred to Germany; 1.e., whether
he has been hired. DIR 07455 had not yet been received by us in Paris.
Before leaving Faris on 10 January we received DIR 07455 which requested
that no definite commitment be asde to Subject and we accordingly left a
draft letter with the Paris Station which will be sent to Subject on or
about 15 January. In double talk this letter will tell Subject that we
(the undersigned) have not received a definite answer, that we shall try
to get one for his sake, and that we expect to have one by about 1 February.
In the meantime Subject should make no definite plans one way or the other.
We trust that it will be possible and convenient to reach a decision con-
cerning Subject by anout 1 February. In the course of the Paris meeting
We also informed Subject that we (the undersigned) would probably come to
fetch him, which tentative assurance was given in order that subject would
not have reason to think that he would lose contact with someone he knows"
and thereby to help buck up his morale. Subject was also told that he
would probably go to PEPRIME if hired. Otherwise, no plans or tentative
arrangements were discussed with Subject.
8. Identity's Assessment of Subject: Case officer discussed Subject
at length with Identity and we believe it is safe and fair to state that
there is complete general agreement concerning Subject. We may disagree
on the point of pairing Subject with ASSATCHEL, but so far this would seem
to be a minor matter. Identity struck the phrase that Subject "satisfies
all selection criteria" used in PARI 4625 and will have concurred in this
dispatch. Identity would prefer not to write a procis of his assessment
at this time; he would rather submit his full assessment which will cover
his views concerning pairings with other possible candidates after his
return to Headquarters. There is little we can add and trust that this
will suffice for the time being. In general we believe that our 888009-
ment submitted as Attachment C to EGPA-24034 is not wide of the mark.
We do not, however, wish this to be construed as an indirect report on
Identity's assessment of Subject; he will submit his own report. In-
cidentally, we have enjoyed working with Identity on this case and have
learned from his techniques and approach. His trip has so far been most
salutary.
9. Comment concerning a decision on Subject: The decision on
Subject's candidature for REUSOX cught not be delayed any longer than is..
necessary. Identity agreed that subject will keep for a time and that he.
very much wants the job with us. There are several reasons why we think
that it would be unwise to delay the decision to remove Subject from
France to Germany where he can be held without undue difficulty.
First,
he is naturally impatient and will not be happy if he is obliged to wait

for an extended period. While we recognize that Subject's hapiness is not
a matter of much imediate concern, we believe that it could be an in-
portant factor in his future handling. Second, Subject reports that his
business is doing well and that he hopes eventually to acqui Prench
passport which in effect would remove the restrictions under which he now
11ves. The acquisition of a passport and financial success
Would we
believe, considerably change Subject a frame of mind and possibly
willingness for REDSOX. ird, Subject might at any time have a run-in
with the French authorities. might not be his fault but it might make
t Impractical or impossible to reach him when and if he is wanted.
Fourth Subject points out that he cannot simply disappear from Gap with
out straightening out his affairs, particularly his business affairs with
his business partners
Cannot may be an exaggeration, but the fact is
that Subject is he sort of person who would leave his friends in the
lurch as he sees it onl under extreme circumstances. He would not be
happy about having done so. He would like to have about three
warning before his departure and as far as we can judge this is

albeit not ideal candidate and that it would be wise to insure his
availability insofar as we can by bringing him at the earliest possible
date to Germany where we shall have better control.

CEMENT
REPORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
SUBJECT: AEASPIC
Dates of Examination:
S, 9, 10 January 1959.
:
Subject was met in Paris on the above dates by the case officer
and the examiner and was submitted to a preliminary psychological
examination via a French interpreter.
LA'~
Subject was born 12 July 1918 in Georgia which, at this time,
was not yet part of the USSR. The Subject classifies his parents as
"Nobles and is of the opinion that their status had a great influence
upon his behavior and development particularly in the period which
followed the family's flight from Georgia to France in 1921. In other
words, the Subject abides by the prejudicial class attitude of Noblesse
Oblige and feels an obligation of honorable and generous behavior
attributable to his birth rank. He is also of the opinion that this concept
of nobility has evolved into a system of dignity and pride in his endeavors.
This concept is also extended to include the attitude: "If you pretend to be
something, you have to act accordingly."
i.
The family fled Georgia before the Soviet invasion. The Subject
feels that he was too young to understand but recalls having revolted
against the flight because it was a humilitating defeat rather than a
tactical retreat. He operates by the attitude that one must fight,
surpass or conquer rather than to submit or accept defeat. He is,
according to his own self-concept, a person who can not tolerate being
beaten in competition. As a child the Subject felt that he was much
stronger than several million men. He presents the analogy that he
is like a man who wants to kill an elephant. All he needs provided for
him is a high powered rifle and then he would feel equal to the elephant.
The Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by
tue of his size
and strength but he denies any feelings of intellectual inferiority and
admits that he depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his
physical abilities. Apparently the Subject has never been able to
accept what he considers the original defeat and flight from Georgia.

In addition, his father later returned to Georgia because he wanted to
die in Georgia. Although the Subject can appreciate his father's point
of view he is unable to forgive his father for tai admitted his defeat
by returning to Georgia to die. Although the Scoject does not regard
himself as a Georgian and is certainly not regarded as a nationalist,
he is a competitive individual and may be motivated for affiliation in order
to compensate for having experienced what he regards as defeat at the
hands of the Soviets. To substantiate the validity the presence of
this attitude in his personality he offers the example that when he was
committed to prison he was not bothered by the prison life but by
the fact that he had made a wrong calculation in associating himself with
an unreliable partner and consequently was arrested and imprisoned.
For him, therefore, the first day in prison was worse than all the others
According to the Subject, the sense of defeat together with the competitive
urge to balance the score is the primary factor i cis personality and
life experience. In addition to these, as was mentioned above, he is
highly self-confident and optimistic that he will succeed despite the
hazards and odds. It would appear that these attitudes are important
as regards his motivation for affiliation, management and utilization
of his services.
L
1 ..
Because the father had provided himself with certain monies the
family was able to live comfortably and even opulently upon its arrival
in France. However, the vicissitudes of life brought the family
progressively to financial difficulties and later to material degradation.
The Subject is of the opinion that this loss of economic status had a
marked influence upon his way of thinking thereafter. Whereas the
family had previously lived in an artificial, feudalistic way it was
not brought into more direct contact with reality and, although this
was not necessarily a bad influence, life was tough. The Subject's
early loss of economic status is important as regards his selection
for affiliation because it also constituted a loss of social status which is
more primary in Subject's personality. A review of the Subject's life
history reveals that he has always responded to material incentives in
his various schemes and ventures. However, in terms of his personality,
material success is a short-cut method of attaining social status.
Consequently, it may be concluded that his drive for social status is
more basic than his need for financial status.
From an early age the Subject was non-disciplined and in the
school situation he constantly rebelled against the authority of those
teachers whom he felt did not regard him as intelligent or pay him

to the Subject's handlers because he indicates that he will abide by
firm authoritative decisions even though he objects to them.
Whereas the Subject was attached to his mother, his sister was
identified with his father
father. The sister followed her father to Georgia
out of a spirit of affection and sacrifice because she felt that her father.
needed her. The Subject regards his sister as a tributary of his father's
mistakes. The sister taught languages in school and at the time of Stalin
the children would say: "We have done this and that thanks to Stalin!"
She would reply: "You are individuals and you have done this or that
without Stalin!".. As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration
camp but with the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and
returned to her job. It would appear that the sister is an individualist
like the Subject.
The sister's husband had emigrated to France at a much låter
date and apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left
Russia. He returned to Russia and the Subject believes that because
he had served in the German Army he was sent to a concentration camp
in Russia. Subject regards the intellectual level of his brother-in-law
as that of his sister. The brother-in-law also had an inferiority complex and
this may have been an additional reason why the Subject had rejected him
as a brother-in-law.

The Subject's brother, who is an architect in Gap, appears to
be an independent person who is conservative and more conforming than
the Subject. The Subject does not regard his brother as having distinguished
himself in extraordinary fashion. It is of interest that the Subject may be
jealous of his brother and states that his brother has been more successful
but in his own sphere and in terms of his own standards. It is of interest
also that the Subject's philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been
unsuccessful but to try to explain his lack of success by the process of
introspection and self-analysis. This emphasis and orientation as regards;
obtaining a greater knowledge of himself is typically a neurotic and
represents his need to love himself and to rationalize his failures.
The Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him whereas it is likely
that both are jealous of each other. It is also likely that the Subject
and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection. For example,
the Subject feels both he and his brother loved the same type of women.

sufficient individual attention. Because he felt his teachers were too
distant they were automatically unpleasant and apparently his rebellious
behavior was his way of obtaining attention and getting closer to the
teachers. He consistently refused to abide by the conformist attitude
of his peers and felt compelled to do those things not normally done by
others. He engaged in practical jokes and was generally regarded as
an activist in the school situation. As a result he was expelled from
one shcool after another and accumulated a record of having attended 18
different schools. It is also of interest that he never obtained a degree
from the institutions of higher education which he attended.
M
ya
This early delinquent behavior in the school situation is of
interest to us because it reflects the Subject's motivational attitudes
which are present to date. As far as he is concerned, his scholastic
experience, generally speaking, represents frustration, the seeking
of a goal to puruse and his hope that his ideals would crystalize and
materialize. The Subject is rather abstract in this interpretation.
It would seem that his ideal involves not only material but moral
comfort and security. However, he has always regarded society,
through his disappointments and mortifying experiences, as wicked and
selfish in its majority. Consequently, he expressed his dissatisfaction
in the form of aggressive and anti-social behavior typical of the malcontent.
One might ask why this individual reacted to his life experience
in this manner. He was apparently a precocious child who experienced
disillusionment both in his family and in his society. At first he felt
this disillusionment was unique and peculiar to himself, but he soon
discovered that his discontent was also shared by others. This
reinforced his combative attitude and he reflected this attitude in his
non-conforming behavior. It was as if he suddenly had discovered to
his great disappointment that there was no Santa Claus.
Another aspect of his system of ideals proceeds from his concept
of chivalry which he feels his parents inculcated. This is a sort of
Robin Hood concept by which the Subject visualizes himself as a hero
who rushes to the rescue of the weak and oppressed. This concept is
somewhat afantastic and has misguided his behavior in various situations
throughout his life. For example, the school situation, he would typically
assume blame for the wrong-doings of others. Later in life he responded
to the plight of others for the conscious reason of wanting to help them.
The Subject feels that many people need help and that he has always wanted

The Subject feels that throughout his school experience, perhaps
only one or two teachers really understood him. He regarded the others
as apparently idiotic or worthless. These particular teachers taught
him that it was often necessary in life "to swallow a great deal of useless
stuff" so that thereafter, certain essentials could be more easily
digested." - This is another helpful hint as regards the trainers who
may be assigned to the Subject.
Subject feels that, apart from his academic progress at school,
he learned that it was necessary to communicate, to express himself,
to understand and explain. He feels that these are necessary skills in
-society and he relies quite heavily upon his verbal intelligence. It is
likely that he would relate well with a person who exhibited superior
wisdom and expressive ability. It is also likely that he would relate
poorly to an inarticulate person of lower intelligence.
The Subject was also influenced in his mental development by
heroes such as Lindberg, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, et alia. The
Subject reasoned that if such people existed, the possibility to act
either for good or evil also existed. The Subject never identified with
one hero in particular but with heroes-in-general. As a result he
wished to be a hero himself. The Subject also remembers certain
outstanding men of history from whom he learned a certain order
was necessary for the good of the people. However, it developed
that the Subject was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were
shaken when he later learned to his dismay that they could commit
abject or monstrous acts. Related to these experiences, is the fact
that the Subject puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or reputation.
He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not impressed.
The fact that he tends to be a skeptic or a cynic should be important
to his handlers.
'
As a foreigner in France the Subject was liable to mobilization
into the French Army at the beginning of World War II. However, he
felt the authorities took an awful long time to make a decision in connection
with him and because of this he joined the French Foreign Legion and
left immediately for North Africa feeling that at last he was becoming
a member of a famous unit and at the same time fulfilling his obligations
towards the French military service. This is an example of his impulsivity,
sentimentalism and need for prestige. However, it was not long before
he became dissatisfied and expressed his discontent in opinions that

in his life.

The Subject regards his mother as having been the axle of
He also regards her as having been the major influence
He is particularly disappointed in his mother because he
feels, although he loved her, she deserted him through suiefde. He
feels she had sacrificed herself completely for her children and that
she killed herself because she no longer knew how to distribute love and
care. Concomitantly, the Subject began to lose regard for his father
when he realized that his father was not providing his mother with
affection. – However, the Subject identifies with his father in the respect
that both have never achieved anything significant and consequently may
have disappointed his mother The Subject misses his mother's love
and feels that his life was broken when she died: He found himself
completely alone and all his illusions apparently disappeared. He
has tried to obtain affection through others and realizes that his need
for affection is a big part of himself. On the other hand "I am
complicated person, however, I am not difficult to understand.

L,
The Subject reflects disappointment in his father as a personal
ideal. He regards his father as an independent person who was kind
but profoundly selfish. Nevertheless, the father would give the shirt
off his back. The father was fond of children, loved the whole family
and was happy when he saw others happy. However, the Subject is
disappointed in his father in that his father never
Succeeded. He feels
that if his father had succeeded none of the things that happened in his
life would have come to pass. He feels that his mother's suicide is a
direct consequence of his father's failure to succeed.
When the father returned to Georgia the Subject was driven to
dispair over the dissolution of the family.
family. The Subject was the bab
baby
of the family and the death of his mother and the departure of his
father and sister were a threat to his emotional security. He tried to
restrain his father by threatening him that because of a French law
requiring foreigners to pay taxes before leaving the country, the father
ran the risk of being arrested. When the Subject told his sister this,
she became angry and replied that the father was mature enough to act
as well as possible. The Subject's attempt to prevent his father from
leaving was conflictual for him because, although he didn't want his
father to leave, he also did not want to interfere with his father's desire.
This experience taught the Subject that when his father made a decision
he would carry it through at any cost. As it happened, the result was
the disintegration of the family. However, this incident is of interest

to help others in order to help himself. In other words, he is
motivated to help others in order to obtain love and affection. His
need for love and affection is probably one of his most basic needs
and this need is expressed in all of his interpresonal contacts.
The Subject's mother reacted to his neurotic behavior with
over-affectionate solicitousness. Although she wasn't actually able
to determine the reasons for his internal distress she was aware that
something was taking place within him and finally took him to a psychiatrist

him of what she was doing and took him to the psychiatrist on a subterfuge
addition, because the Subject disagreed with the psychiatrist's
conclusions, he did not benefit by this experience. This would indicate
that in handling the Subject it would be wise not to approach him
covertly or as if he were a problem but to permit him to maintain his

marked conformist who insisted that the Subject should abide by the
social order. To be successful, the Subject's handlers should avoid
trying to make him conform in his attitudes toward society by well-
meaning gestures or contrivances.
The Subject continually deceived and disappointed his mother
because each time she started him in a new school he made promises
that he would behave but each time he managed to be expelled because
of his behavior. The Subject is consciously convinced that his mother
acted in his good interest and not for her satisfaction of wanting a
perfect child. However, it is the opinion of this examiner, that the
mother's over-solicitousness was compensatory for her basic rejection
of the Subject. It is not likely that she did things for him but that she
did things to and with him for herself. In other words, she wanted the
Subject to be perfect so that he could be worthy of her love. This may
also have been her attitude toward her husband. The Subject did not
behave perfectly, did not merit her love and consequently appears to
be continually seeking the love and affection of other persons. However,
the Subject cannot accept this opinion as regards his mother and denies
that she acted in her own interest. One of his principal defenses is
denial simply assuming the attitude that such and such is not true
when he probably believes it is true.

The Subject was more expressive of his affection toward his mother
whereas his brother was more timid, shy and independent. When the
brother saw the Subject getting his mother's attention he tried to replace
the Subject. When the brother learned that the Subject was seeing a girl
whom he knew too he advised the girl to leave the Subject alone
sibling rivalry may continue to date. However, the fraternal relationship
is likely to be more complex. It may be that the brother regards the
Subject as "Peck's Bad Boy" or the balck sheep of the family and is
interested in fostering the Subject as regards opportunities for
accomplishment or success. For some reason or other this examiner
has the feeling that the brother may have been indirectly instrumental
in the spotting of the Subject. The Subject tends to steer away from a
discussion of his brother and chiefly presents the data that this brother
is kind, somewhat vain and that he is fond of his brother. By a
comparative analysis of the Subject and his relationship to his brother
it is apparent that the Subject has a very strong desire to succeed
and to accomplish. He was also influenced by others in this regard.
For example, at a certain time in his childhood the Subject lived near
some former Georgian resistance who had fought against the Soviets
The Subject regarded these persons as uneducated but admirable and
affectionate. He feels that he certainly must have been influenced by
their exciting stories of their many exploits. He feels he must also
. have been impressed by their patriotism. The Subject is a sentimental
person and he was exalted and deeply impressed by the warm and
enthralling manner in which they expressed themselves. He feels that
this particular association may have contributed to his passion which
he always puts into the execution of whatever he undertakes.
The Subject claims that he has learned from his personal
experiences in life rather than from school or from the experiences
of others. He feels that he has educated himself in the school of life
and has derived little from formal education or from the experiences
of others. For example, he claims that his mother's opinion had
importance for him only at the time she rendered her opinions. As
far as he was concerned they did not have a lasting influence This
item is important as far as the Subject's reaction to future training. is
concerned. It is likely that he would be impatient to proceed with the
task in actuality rather than to learn about performing a task through
the experiences of others.

France was an incoherent mess. He bitterly regretted that he had
become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they
wanted. The Subject feels that his experience in the Foreign Legion
did not have any great influence on his character except that it
mobilized a profound dislike for irresolute persons. This point
was dealt with before. However, it is worthwhile to repeat that the
Subject is an impatient fellow who desires immediate action as regards
his interests. He is impatient with postponement and with what he
regards as à lack of resolve on the part of others. Unless he is dealt
with promptly he develops critical opinions and complaints. As regards-
his affiliation, it is important to note that he has no real alternative at
this time and is therefore required to accept normal procedures.
Although he may regard these procedures as a waste of time he will
accept them because he lacks control at this point in his processing
~
The Subject married for the principal reason of creating a family
and a home. Even though he understands the values of the principles
involved, principles which were inculcated by his father, he now feels
that it was a ridiculous mistake to marry just for the sake of principles
without the necessary sentiments. He rationalizes that, at that time,
he was merely abiding by the precepts of his father without thinking of
the possible consequences. However, he soon discovered that creating
a family did not represent anything at all except "aggravating the
incoherence and the division of society". In other words, for the
Subject, marriage meant building a wall around himself. He also
found that, instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all he
obtained from the partnership was a reflection of himself. (In selecting
a partner for this Subject it would be wise to consider this aspect.).
The Subject feels that so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He

to have children. Actually, however, he did not want children as
individuals in themselves but he assumed that the marriage would
produce a child whom he exactly imagined and which would be a
reproduction of himself. However, the first child turned out to be a
female and this may have shaken the Subject. The Subject voluntarily
submits that he has learned the difference between the male and the
female. This would seem to be a peculiar statement but it has a good
deal of meaning for him, particularly as regards his relationship with
his mother, sister, wife and first child. He regards women as alogical
and as being determined by a psycho-feminine education. He developed
this attitude originally as a defense against his mother's conforming
tendencies and it is probable that he crystalized the attitude when his
wife rejected him after he had attacked the bank and was arrested.
His wife had a second child while the Subject was in jail and the Subject
knows nothing about either of his children.
(This is enough to tip us off that the Subject should not be
exposed to females who would be important in his handling.)
During World War II the Subject became involved in black
marketeering and in the false documents business and claimed to have
created a gang which he led and to have traveled throughout Central
Europe. He also claims that the primary purpose of the gang was to
repatriate or liberate war prisoners and that technically speaking, the
black market business was a worthless branch, the only purpose of
which was to solve financial problems. However, he admits, that it
is true that the black market business reached such a magnitude that
a person that was interested only in making money could have found it
a quite satisfying and sufficient activity in itself.
As was mentioned above the primary purpose of the gang, according
to the Subject was to liberate prisoners. He was successful in releasing
13 French prisoners from Germany. He claims not to have done this for
patriotic motives but for humanitarian reasons. He helped the prisoners
because they needed help and because he felt it was the right thing to do.
He was paid for this but claims to have given his money to help the
prisoners. He helped the French prisoners despite the fact that he
had sympathy for the Germans. He claims that his sympathy for the
Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in
Germany and he hoped that the Germans would defeat the Russians. If
the prisoners had been Germans he would have done the same thing.

Even though he admired and sympathized with the Germans he claims
he would not have harmed France. All this is rather complex. However,
it is possible to understand his motivations according to his basic principle,
which involves a vague desire to help others who need it. He also
expresses pride in doing the outstanding and the difficult. The material
reward is not an ultimate end in itself. His emotionalized ideals are
not expressed clearly in terms of politics or nationality. This comples
of motivations will also be discussed in terms of the Subject's participation
in the bank robbery.
.
Although the Subject was satisfied, on the whole, with the
technical efficiency of his gang and although he was pleased with the
freedom of movement and his apparent security, he was arrested becaus
of carelessness or a slip, not in the actual functioning of the gang, but
rather on the part of one of the men whom the gang was helping.
Consequently the Subject was arrested by the Gestapo. Because he
was considered by the Germans to be a very important prey he played
along and led the Germans to believe that he was more important than
they had figured. He hoped that such a tactic and belief on their part
would bring him certain advantages. Although he realized that he could
have been shot for only half what he had done and that it may have been
disadvantageous for him to exaggerate his part he claims to have done
so in order to mix the tracks, to confuse the German authorities and to
avoid "fingering" certain partners whom he made appear as negligible
in the scheme. He played this game as long as he could but his end
gradually drew near. However, he is an imaginative fellow and he

behavior is typical of that of a con man. He has the capacity to control
a situation in his own interest and to imaginatively talk himself out of
rather tight situations. This is an outstanding characteristic
of his personality and consequently should be noted by his handlers.

The Subject claims that after he casually learned of his friend's arrest
he fled to the Spanish border. He had not foreseen or had prepared
himself for such a consequence and he implies a conflict as regards
leaving France. In any event, he was captured and imprisoned. The
question arises in this examiner's mind as to why the Subject either
panicked or was awkward in his flight, if he did have a chance to flee.
It may have been that he unconsciously wished to be caught and to be
punished in order to relieve his guilt. He was ambivalent about
attacking the bank. If this is true, then important consideration
should be given to the Subject's personality as regards plans for the
eventuality of his being captured in the course of the project.
Subject feels that he failed badly when he was arrested both
by the Germans and by the French. He feels that these two incidents were
a consequênce of poor selection of friends and poor planning. If he were
to find himself in the same type of situation again he would take all the

jailed by the French Police he was some what depressed by the facts that
he had failed in his planning and also that he had greatly disappointed his
relatives who looked down upon him as a noisy and rash fellow rather
than as a man who was capable of carrying out a crime. This was
quite a blow to his ego. However, his ego didn't collapse. There have
been times in his life when he felt the entire world seemd to conspire against
him and when everything seemed destroyed. He has always felt that there
are ways to get out of a mess, principally by exerting his ego. He
continues to believe that, unless a man is so weak, both physically and
morally, it is always possible for him to get back on his feet or at
least to hope that this is possible. Consequently, the Subject continues
to believe that there is always a possibility to fight and to conquer.
This optimism may be motivational in his present desire to affiliate
with us.
In the two projects which involved liberating French prisoners
and attacking the bank, Subject claims that he was betrayed by another..
However, he felt his betrayal was unimportant and consequently was not
angry at these persons. Because he feels that there are certain moral
values which he holds dearly, namely friendship, these persons lost
his esteem but he was more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated.
Although his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life,
regardless of their size and consequences, he does not feel that they have
discouraged him about future possibilities. "If there is a future, there is
hope!" The Subject feels that he has never completely lost self-control

However, it would appear to the examiner that there is more to this
story than meets the eye. One would suspect that, since he obtained
mild treatment at the hands of the Gestapo. he probably collaborated
more than he is willing to admit at this time. It may be that he did
not fool the Gestapo at all. It is quite possible that the Gestapo used
him to pass on the authenticity of documents of other prisoners or in
some other nefarious activity. If this can be established as true by
other techniques then we are dealing with a person who places self
preservation above all else.
FL
The Subject also has a history of criminal activity in France
after the war. At that time he was married and was the father of one
child. He was working at a model-maker's shop and although he was
not well off he was earning a decent living. According to the Subject
close young friend solicited his assistance in attacking a bank in order
to finance an intended-marriage. At first the Subject felt that the
other fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank. He also claims to
have had a twinge of conscience and asked himself the question, Is
it right to do harm by robbing a bank?" Furthermore, he never felt
that a team of two partners would be able to attack a bank successfully
Apparently the other fellow was a fairly good recruiter. He reminded
the Subject of his war activities and he was of the opinion that since
the Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities in
the past that he would be quite capable of attacking a bank. He also
displayed a confidence in the Subject's capability to invent a plan of
attack and played on the Subject's love of risk, of his need for friendship.
At each point in the developments the Subject tried to withdraw by
saying: "If my mother learned of this, she would die." He postponed
the job indefinitely. However, in the meantime his mother died and his
friend felt that he no longer had an excuse. The Subject compromised
by agreeing to knock over a jewelry store. Apparently they knocked over
two jewelry stores for the sake of good measure. However, after having
spent his money, the friend again returned with a proposition to attack_
the bank. The Subject told him: "You got your money for your marriage;
now leave me alone." However, the friend had not married his intended,
was broke, and was interested in financing another marriage. They
agreed that this would be the last job. Afterwards, however, the other
fellow apparently threw his money around and was arrested and squcaled.

and that he has always been a master of his actions at all times and
that these actions could have been changed by his own volition. This attitude
reveals his tremendous narcissistic investment in his own powers. As
far as this project is concerned, it would be unwise to rely upon the
Subject's judgements and it would be more prudent to plan every detail
for him and require him to abide by directions. He is an imaginative
executor but he is a very poor planner according to the testimony of
his record. His actions are often impulsive and unreasoned. Such
irrational behavior may take place in the context of a relationship
with another person despite the fact that the Subject may actually have
no particular responsibility b the other person except a tie of affection
The Subject is unable to explain this peculiar aspect of his personality
and he is aware that any explanations which he might offer are not rational
or sufficient. Consequently, this examiner concludes, that his impulsivity
and tendency to behave irrationally, and to his own disadvantage amounts
to an unconscious determinent of his behavior and is not available
to a rational analysis. His propulsion by an uncontrollable interna
force is an important point of consideration as regards his utilizatio
by this project.
In summary the Subject's chief motivations for illegal activity
appear to be the following:
a. The Subject will apparently do anything for a friend or
for a person in need.
b. Subject's relish of novelty, excitement, derring-do and
action. He is a Jesse James type.
C.
Emotional outlet as regards the Subject's desires to
invent and to realize a success of an invention. The Subject
is an inventor by virtue of his temperament and mentality
and indulges himself in problem-solving behavior and apparently
obtains a compulsive satisfaction if his ideas work out. In
other words he is activated to carry out an action because of his
displaced interest in successfully engineering and accomplishing
a challenging task.

There is an indeterminancy in the examiner's mind as to whether
the Subject is a leader or a follower. He claims to have been a leader
of the gang during World War II but in a careful analysis his relationship
with his bank partner it would appear that the other person was the leader.
The Subject, in this instance, was more of an "idea man" and exécutor
whereas the other chap was the instigator. There is no question that the
Subject regards himself as a leader. However an inspection of the record
indicates that he is a poor leader because he is impulsive, rash and tends
to fail.
Furthermore, he is like the cat in the Walt Disney film who,
while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention directed to
catching and incorporating the mouse, inadvertantly gets himself
run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered by the truck
is one of disappointment as regards not having arrived at the goal,
catching the mouse. - Despite this defeat he is able to pick himself up
again, figure things out and continue his pursuits. However, he does
not learn by experience and he repeatedly is defeated because he keeps
his eye too much upon the goal and not enough upon the hazards involved
in reaching the goal In addition to his lack of attention to necessary
details the Subject is also as was stated above, emotionally "stupid"
impulsive, rash, immature, inexperienced, misguided and unplanful
Consequently it is no surprise that he has failed repeatedly throughout
his life.

In regards to the above, another incident of this man's life is
relevant. His left index fingertip and thumb tip are missing. He claims
to have lost these in an explosion which occurred in Germany when he
was involved in the repatriation deal. According to him, after the
bombing of Berlin, he picked up among the ruins an unexploded bomb
of British origin and took it home to salvage the explosive which he
might have used in various ways. While he was removing the detonator
which was probably stuck in its receptacle, it exploded in his hands.
The explosion occurred so quickly that there was no immediate pain
but those around him became panicky. He remained cold-blooded and
gave the order to remove all things which were there because the
explosion undoubtedly alerted the police. When the police came they aralin Stonka alada a
explained that he had played with a fountain pen which had burst. They
took cognizance of his decorations and advised him never to pick up
objects dropped by the enemy. The Red Cross cared for his wound.

bomb. because he feels he had definitely learned that one should keep

d. Material reward. As was mentioned before, material
reward appears to be a means to social status. In the case
of the bank robbery the friend obtained three-fourths of the
take and the Subject was content not to spend his money
freely in order not to arouse his wife's suspicions.
e. Competition with authority. Apparently the Subject
regarded the Paris bank as a symbol of authority and was
motivated to compete with what this symbol represented.
It may be that he did not actually wish to defeat the authority
but that he wanted to obtain the attention of authority as he
did in the school situation. He certainly accomplished this

g. The bank robbery may have represented the Subject's
expression of his feelings of freedom upon release from
his mother through her death. She had always attempted
to try to make him conform. His wife is apparently the
same type of person as his mother and she proved it by
rejecting him when she learned about his anti-social
behavior.

his hands away from certain things. This bomb incident may be indicative
of the things which were discussed in the preceeding paragraphs. There
may be more to the bomb incident than the Subject offers but this could
not be established by the clinical method.
Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority of
his undertakings have brought results which were considerably less
than hoped for. Consequently, he feels that a critic would regard him
either an optimist or a joker or else that his views on the possibilities
of accomplishing are not very sound.
In his own defense the Subject feels that he has made many
mistakes in his life but however big these mistakes were, he does
not feel that they have basically influenced his character. He feels
that his character basically involves the desire to become a worth-
while individual even at the cost of behaving wrongly. He feels that if
the only criteria for judging a man are his achievements, that he may
be regarded as a failure. He emphasizes that the value of an achievement
does not consist in its spectacular magnitude or in its multiplicity.
For example, he feels that it is not necessary to mass-produce
machine or an object in order to fully understand its function.
realizes that, commercially speaking, it is more rational to mass
produce the item but this repetition does not interest him. In his
opinion, the creative idea and the prototype have a much greater
value and importance than the establishment of a factory which would
popularize the prototype. To illustrate this attitude further, the
Subject is of the opinion that one single thought from a great figure
is more valuable than millions of books which are published annually.
This attitude, of course, may be interpreted as the defensive orientation
of a romantic idealist who has not achieved in practical affairs. However,
there is more to this. In the Subject's value system, it is more important
to act intelligently, sensibly and efficiently. For example, if he were
asked to open a window he feels that it would be up to him to decide
as regards the appropriate method. He likes to carry out an intellectual

to his future handlers is his desire to independently figure out the way
that something should be done. This tendency is likely to appear in his
training and preparation. It would be well to keep this in mind.
Subject feels that he has a tremendous vitality which, in the past, has
expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery etc.

He feels that he is not being used properly and that there is a power
within himself, a creative urge for movement and realization which
is highly emotionally charged and which permits him to feel that he
is capable of doing much more than he has in the past. However, this
energy will have to be rationally harnessed if it is to be productive.
Another aspect in regard to the above is that one of the Subject's
chief motivea is curiosity. He continually seeks the unknown. However,
when he approaches the unknown he experiences emotional insecurity and
is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing. This may have been a
factor which influenced his unsuccessful escape through the Pyrenees.
The Subject has a fear about which he doesn't know or understand and
is afraid of getting himself into something which he cannot get himself
out of. His immediate action is to withdraw without solving the problem.
Consequently, it would appear that the Subject needs the direction of
superior intelligence in order to help him evaluate the realities of a
situation or predicament. He needs firm support, guidance, and
direction as regards the consideration of all possible eventualities
and alternatives. As was said before it must be kept in mind that his
urge for self-preservation is stronger than his desire to solve problems
or to carry through on a venture. On the other hand, the Subject claims
that he always tries his hardest to heep his promises. Thus, if he
agrees to do something he will attempt to carry it through despite
the dangers involved. He may be rash in this regard but feels his
rashness is due to the fact that he thinks quickly and is able to rapidly
apprehend and synthesize the components and essence of a problem
in its various perspectives. In other words, he is alert and quick
and gets the point immediately even before you finish your sentence.
However, it would be wise not to interpret his intellectual alacrity as
La commitment or as an index that he will complete a task. It means
merely that he gets your point; it doesn't mean that he will cooperate,
especially when the going gets rough.
Another factor of interest to the project is that this person is
not likely to change as regards his basic characteristics. He has
marked difficulty projecting himself in terms of what he would like
to be. It is his opinion that in order to change himself, it would be
necessary that he would become an entirely different person.
However, he feels that everything is relative and perhaps he should
show more strength of character, be little more compromising,
more realistic and less sentimental. However, according to him,
this would imply that the environment would be such that there was
no room for sentiment. In this case, his personality would be

he is "mouthy" and he will eat you up if you are not careful or if you
get too close. Incorporation is the epitomy of control. Consequently,
if you allow him to incorporate you he's got control, not you. Be wary,
and detached in this regard. He has already eaten up the case officer.

and is the owner and exploiter of several patents. He has engaged the
financial and technical interests of several others in his inventions.
between the
He currently presents the problem of bein

He claims that if he were to join us he would have to relinquish every-
thing to his business partners. This is probably true, and it is also
probably true that he would relinquish his invention interest but at the
same time, he presents this item in the fashion of a con man. It would
be wise to ignore this gambit.

Additional description of the personality includes the fact that
he reflects a superior intelligence, is capable of abstract conceptualizations
and is easily able to deal in symbols. He would have no difficulty as
regards the intellectual aspects of training However, in his training,
other things will have to be kept in mind. He is an narcissistic
character who feels that because he lacks the love of others he needs
to love himself. In other words, he is quite in love with himself
and thereby acts accordingly. He also tends to rationalize and to
offer socially acceptable reasons for his individualistic behavior
and for his past failures. He acts because he thinks he is right
and because he will succeed. He is quite egotistical in this regard.
He strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction. It would be wise to
remember also that he appears to be altruistic-but at the same time
he is selfish. He will do things for others and for the community
but will hope to get something out of it for himself. The altruistic and
selfish drives merge and he is motivated by both at the same time.
He needs to prove to others that he is capable of success and he is
self-confident in his power but is insecure that others may not regard
him as adequate. Basically he is an exhibitionist, but is too sophisticated
to brag or to display himself in a transparent manner. However, he
needs attention and is likely to do things in order to get attention. This
is what he has done in the past. He particularly strives not to be regarded
as bad evil. He wants to be regarded as a person who has differences of

definitely out of place. Consequently, the Subject does not think he will
be a very different person in the future from what he is now. However,
he hopes that his material situation will have improved not necessarily
financially, but socially. He also naively hopes that the world will
change and that there will be no discrimination and that there will
be a general improvement of living conditions for everyone. He is a
humanitarian in his outlook but he is not an activistic social reformer,
except in the sense that he is an individualistic rèbel. Generally he
strives to improve his own standard of living and he feels that his
own inclination to better things is the disease of all inventors. The
Subject also hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality by virtue of
which he could feel that be actually belongs to a society. However
he is ambivalent in this regard. He regards society as being anxious.
to stamp and label individuals and he would prefer to be an individualist
outside of society than to be a member of society if he is required to
conform. As was said before his handlers would be wise not to label,
to type or to try in any way to get the Subject to conform to society.
He will run rings around them like he did his mother. As regards his
future outlook, the Subject is not entirely optimistic. He feels that he
will never be able to reach his ideals because his material ideal (social
reform), is so distant and so difficult that he would need to lead-many
lives in order to attain it. It might be unfair to designate him as a
pessimist. As was said before, he is more of a skeptic and perhaps
a cynic. Consequently, one should be careful as regards inculcating
ideological or social motives. One should be content to accept his
motives in their present state. Tampering with them would only result
in disturbing the Subject and the relationship.

The Subject denies that he has any emotional-interest in or
emotional attachment to France at this time. Although it was likely
that he was sentimentally patriotic before the war it is a fact that he

is rejecting France. Nevertheless he strikes the examiner as a
Frenchman in terms of the way he thinks, feels and acts. He is
certainly not a Russian in his personality. He expresses himself
freely, is discursive, voluble, and is able to carry on a conversation
intensely and indefinitely on his topics of interest. This is typically
French, but, in terms of his personality, it represents an oral
characteristic." In other words he is inclined to express himself
orally and is motivated to obtain love and affection together with
other supplies by oral incorporation. What this means to you is that

with such a provocation. Because of this it appears that the Subject
needs the guiding influence of a more mature experienced person who
is in more control of the situation. An additional point of interest is
that the Subject is capable of using such an experience as the visit by
the police as a dévice to control. For example, because of the visit
by the police, the Subject aborted the psychological analysis.

741
As regards the general selection criteria for the project it
would appear that the Subject satisfies the requirements of intelligence,
resourcefulness, mechanical talent, team-ability, infiltration-exfiltration
capability, good health, physical stamina, motivation, etc. However,
there are other factors which may or may not vitiate the positive features.
These factors are pertinent to areas such as security and handling. It is
recommended that before the Subject is removed from Gap that he be
administered a security examination in a controlled situation. Such
an examination should be conducted by a skilled and experienced
individual who is fluent in French, who is unbiased and objective and
who is not overly rigid as regards his conventional standards. With
such an examiner, there is a fifty-fifty chance that the Subject would
satisfy security standards. The other problem area which remains is
that of handling, and unless this is thought out carefully and appropriate
personnel assigned, the hand will be quicker than the eye.

opinions and conflicts with the social order. It would be fair to say that
he is not a true criminal but is more of a neurotic character who
expresses his conflicts and difficulties by non-conforming behavior. He
is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated and strives to
conquer. Despite his tendencies to magical thinking he strives to be
rational and realistic, but his strong emotional pressures get in his
way. He experiences melancholy and depressive mood swings but
maintains a light side and attempts to relieve his dysphoric feelings
with lightness and humor. He relies heavily on the technique of
humor to relieve tension and to avoid the demobilization of anxiety
in interpersonal relationship. His humor may be regarded as a
good index of his anxiety.
-
In light of the above the Subject's motivation for affiliation at
this time is rather complex. However, on the surface it is positive,
spontaneous, voluntary and tense. He is really on the shelf in Gap.
is isolated lonely, controlled in his movements, restricted in his
aspirations and unable to realize freedom and to develop himself as an
individual - Consequently, the assignment represents a unique opportunity.
to escape from his present level of existence and it is no wonder that he
is pushing for a quick release from Gap. However, if he were released.
without the sufficient establishment of controls and the application of
selection techniques he may prove to be a difficult handling problem in
the future. It is recommended that his processing be slowed down to
a hault and that security and other operational requirements be satisfied
prior to lifting him out of Gap: Once he is taken out of Gap he, like the
con man, is on first base, and, no matter how you slice it, he will have
established himself in a bargaining position.
The Subject likes Americans for sentimental reasons. Although
he realizes that the United States may have selfish political interests
he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the
Americans. He likes the liberty which exists in America and the
fact that people are treated like individuals rather than as numbers.
General ly his attitude toward the Americans is typically emotional
and is understandable in terms of what has been said about his
personality.
Although the Subject is a rank individualist and a non-conformist
he realizes that he must cope with the community and must sacrifice
for the good of the community. Liparticular, he would not like to harm

j
others. In this regaid it is unlikely that the Subject has even
committed physical assault nor is it likely that he would in the
future. No matter what the other person would represent to the
Subject he would still be regarded as a human being whom the
Subject would respect and would not harm. The Subject is not
necessarily a hostile person. He will act out of exigency but will
deliberately avoid being sadistic or wontonly cruel. This is of
importance as far as the project is concerned. If the Subject were to
find himself in a tight spot which required killing another person it
is not likely that he would do so. It is more likely that he would attempt
to resolve.the situation by verbal machinations.
The Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research
but as regards the execution of an operation, he prefers to be part of
an organization. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is alone
and that others have been unreliable in the
Past. However, if it is
necessary for him to work with others he will accept it. It must be
kept in mind, however, that he would prefer to work alone. The
Subject is likely to be loyal to a person whom he regards as superior
and in the relationship he may even be critical of himself. In order
to express his loyalty he would like to prove his usefulness to the
superior but, at the same time, he would feel inadequate in that he
would require the protection of a superior. In his initial contacts with
a partner, the Subject would attempt to assume leadership on the team
but if the partner were superior by virtue of intelligence and/or experience,
the Subject would tend to follow. It is likely that he would be a better
follower of an adequate leader than a leader of a less adequate person.
The reason for this is that he is more of a dependent than an independent
person in terms of his interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, he is
inclined to act on impulse and sentiment and consequently his judgement
is questionable. In terms of ideal pairing, the Subject would work better
with a more sober-minded, calculating and mature individual whom he
would respect and with whom he would enjoy an informal but authoritative
relationship.
.
Prior to the last session of the preliminary examination on the
10th of January 1959 the Subject was routinely contacted by the French
Police who were investigating his reasons for being in Paris at that time.
As a result of this contact, the Subject was markedly apprehensive and
preoccupied and was not able to freely devote himself to the psychological
analysis as theretofore. The Subject's primary motive is, of course,
self-preservation and since he is an extremely alert and vigilant.
individual he is likely to over-react and to become emotionally upset

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD
SUBJECT
DRAFT
11 December 1958
David TZITZICHVILI - Red Sox Candidate.
N
This is an indirect assessment of the above named individual
based on a W-B test administered by a case officer in the field and on
a PRQI. Subject apparently is being considered for a two-man mission
of relatively short duration. The main questions about him seem to be
Can he learn to do what will be required? What would be his motivation?
ith what sort of person would he got on best
special problems can be anticipated and avoided in his handling?
two-man team? What
2. ”A brief telephone report was supplied to the headquarters
case officer on 10 December 1958. It was stated that Subject possesses
adequate intelligence, unusual social skills, and a propensity for getting
what he wants without conscience. He is impulsive and surprisingly
irrational in satisfying his personal desires. He will appear at first
to have leadership skill and interest hence will probably just take
over leadership of the team. In the long run, however, most persons.
who would be team-mates would become disenchanted and either reject
him or take over themselves. Because of this man's social versatility,
impulsiveness and freedom from conscience, he would be particularly
difficult to control. That is, it would be difficult to ascertain that he

Factually did what he claimed to have done. His case officer would ha
to be especially alert for double-dealing, careful to build in checks
counterbalances, and tough and firm in handling style. Despite the
limitations noted it was felt that this man is worth the risks involved.
In comparison with agent candidates of the same nationality
No
which we have assessed, Subject's intelligence is above average
intellectual; he is nevertheless unusually well informed and unusually
observant of what is going on around hira He
He is likely to be quite
pedantic, but his thinking is not rigorous. He makes decisions im
r.
pulsively and on analogy. He is therefore likely to appear-more
reasonable and better organized than he is in fact, and one is less likely
to be prepared for his impulsive acts of bad judgment. To summarise
the intellectual factor, he is intelligent, but he looks brighter, better
educated and more capable of good judgment than he is in fact. Howe
ever, these are not intellectual limitations to his usefulness in the type
of mission considered.
Perhaps this man's strongest skill is his versatility in
playing social roles. If he so wants, he can make himself appear
acceptable to a wide variety of people. He is accustomed to getting out
of tight spots by exercising charm or "personality." At the same time,
however, he can be very temperamental when his desires are frustrated

and when he feels he is crossed. He needs a lot of sensual experience
and his sensuality and desire for emotional experience is not too well
controlled. He especially likes new and novel experiences, which he
will go after with little attention to the probable consequences.
This man is quite dependent on social activity and social
relationships for amusement, support,and incentive. He may at times
try to play the role of the independent, self-sufficient, lone-wolf, but
could not sustain such a role for long. He must participate with
people in a relatively emotional wa At the same time he is likely
to be exceptionally suspicious of all the people he works with. He
He is
not very realistic in his *suspiciousness, and he is inclined to exaggerate
clues and signs. With reference to the proposed mission, he is likely
to express distrust of anyone who is introduced as a partner. Like-
wise it may be assumed he will try to take over the role of leader
even though he has no particular leadership skills. This will present
problems, because in our opinion over the long haul he would make a
poor leader, for the following reasons: (a) he is not accustomed to
playing any rōle consistently for a long period of time, (b) he is more
dependent socially than he likes to admit, (c) his judgement is not con-
sistent; he operates too much on impulse or sentiment and hence when
the chips are down he cannot backstop his decisions with reasoned
judgement.

6. It is our opinion that this man is unusually unencumbered
by conscience. When he wants something, he takes it. When
requires him to cross a friend, he does so without guilt. If he looks
ahead at consequences he does so in terms of "getting caught and
being punished" rather than losing moral stature. He certainly feels
little genuine loyalty to codes, institutions, or causes other than
He is more likely to remain loyal to a specific individual whom
own. He
he respects or fears. The principal implications of these characteristics
are: (a) he is not regarded as a promising candidate for polygraph testing
the record is more likely to be misleading than in most cases (b)he
will require a particularly firm straight forward, alert case officer
whom Subject either respects or fears. A warm, friendly relationship
here would likely result in Subject becoming exceedingly suspicious of
his case officer, in efforts to manipulate the case officer, and disruption
of relations owing to temperamental outbursts.
7. The best single characterization we can make of his
motivation for the assignment is that if his personal desires happen to
be-congruent with the purposes of the mission, then his motivation is
appropriate. His interests might include desire for an exciting clandestine
expereince and for social prestige, as well as for money. They certainly
do not include any abstract political or ideological motives. The important.

Men
thing is that this man is unusually intent on satisfying his own whims
and caprices whenever they are set-off, which makes him more incon-
sistent than one expects and hence more difficult to control.
8.
Conclusion:
Even more than the normal run of agent candi
dates, this man is solely out for himself. Coupled with this characteristic.
his social skill and his ability to get away with gratifying his own desires
irrespective of the feelings or interests of others. This indicates
peculiarly difficult control problems, which in our opinion require an
unusually competent, alert, strict, even authoritarian case officer.
Despite the number of negative characteristics discussed in this report,
it is nevertheless our opinion that this man is still worth considering
providing he has the minimum requirements of language, access to target,
and cover. He has the requisite intelligence and very useful social skills.
He can get away with activities which would be disturbing or upsetting to
other people, and this would appear to be a major qualification.

Subject still carries a special identity card which means he

within 48 hours to get a special pass from the police which permits him
to visit any city in France up to seven days and if he had demonstrable
good reasons for a longer visit, he believes arrangements could be
made. Subject believes that for about French franos 50,000 he could
acquire a French identity document bearing no restriction. This would
take time; the money would be needed for legal counsel and bribes. Wo
discussed with Subject the possibility of visiting Germany for 7 days
including travelling: time on a false German identity document. Being
an old hand at forgery, Subject was enchanted with the idea and quite
confident he would be able to pull it off. This was discussed because
we thought it might be botter and more convenient to bring Subject to
Frankfurt for an LCFLUTTER examination and assessment rather than to
do this in Paris. Subject cannot get legal permission to go outside

willing to repatriate to the Soviet Union at our behest. We believe he
is sincere in this contentica. He could be moved to Germany using a
false document to get him across the border for a few days, but is we
were to do this, we would incur the risk that Subject might be picked
up or might invent some incident in order to claim that it would be im
possible for him to return to France. Subject does not like Gar and
very much wants to leave. Although we did not go into the matter
deeply, we may assume that there is no possibility that Subject

Approval to contuct and assess subject was given in reference

to Headquarters his personal impressions of subject.
2. We arrived in Paris on 13 October where we discussed our plans
with John P. Platipodis who informed us that the Paris Station had no
P.
objections to our proceeding as we proposed. The undersigned travelled
as Maj. Michael C. Long; Newens and Winship travelled in true name.
3. We rented a oar in Paris and drove to Gap, arriving before
noon on 14 October. The remainder of the day was spent in familiarizing
ourselves with the town and locating the house where Subject was re-
ported to live. Because none of us spoke French without a noticeable
Anglo-Saxon accent, we did not wish to visit the apartment or subject!
brother and risk meeting the trother or sister-in-law who would easily
be able to detect that we were not Frenchmen. Therefore, the under
signed drove to Voynes about 40 km. away where he got an older woman
working in a small inn to put through a telephone call for us. The
woman had no idea what she was doing and was not suspicious. She
spoke with Subject's sister-in-law who said that Subject was no longer
sleeping there but was expected to visit the house at about 2100 hours.
Consequently, the undersigned returned to Gap where Winship and Nevens
were on hand to survall Subject's house. A second call to the house of
Subject's brother was put through at about 2130 hours from a different
torn also about 40 km. from Cap. The man who made the call for us
learned that subject was plarning to visit Paris, and that it was not
known whether he had left.
4. Not wishing to risk missing Subject altogether, wo decided to
call at the apartment of Subject's brother on the morning of 15 Cctober
after 9130 when it could be expected that the brother would have left
home for his office. The undersigned made the call, spoke with the
sister-in-law (who, we subsequently learned, tock tho undersigned for
an Englishman). The conversation lasted perhaps 15 minutes. The
eister-in-law gave us Subject's present address where he is not
registered and told us there he eats lunch daily. While Newens and
Winship counter-surveilled the site, the undersigned waited for
Subject outside the restaurant where he takes his meals until Subject
approached at about 1245 hours. Subject had already been alerted that
a non-native French speaking person was looking for him and recognized
the undersigned at once. An introduction wis made, subject was elican
the photographs which ARPADDLE had taken and accepted these as proof
of the undersigned's authenticity. Subject said he was planning to
leave that night for a two day visit to Paris on tuu Ihodd. It waw
suggested that Subject, in order to save fare and no that we should:
have an extended opportunity to discuss "certain matters" with him,
night prefer to drive with ca. Subject accepted this suggestion and
arrangements were made to pick him up in front of a cafe on the cut-
skirts of Gap where he is temporarily lodged.

Approximately in 1940, Subject listed in the Foreign Legion, Ro
was accepted in Paris and sent via Lyon-Marseille-Port St. Jean to Sidi-
bel-Ables. February-August 1910 he was stationed in Tunesia (Susa).

of Armenians, se Spaniards, and Jews. Subject knew of a so-called Coorzien
Company which subsequently was encircled by the Germans; however, he did not
belong to this company. The occupation of France in April/May 1941 endat
his military career. He was demobilized and returned to Paris.
During hd I
After the discharge from the Legion Subject felt a great desire to
fight for France, He told us that he loved France and that he wanted to
do something for his chosen holand. Houver, it seems that he never got
around to doing anything about this ambition. He said jokingly that mombers
of the resistance were not listed in telephone directories, and therefore
did not know how to make contact with tres. in the other hand it appasit
that he did not try very hard and that his love for independence (personal
independence) was greater than his wish to join any collective resistanca
activity. Thus he decided to act on his own.
He told us that at this time there was some recruitment of labour-
forces in France for Germany. He decided to enroll as labourer. He wont
to a certain office in Paris and was sent in due course to Germany.
For a
while he worked in a synthetic gasoline plant in Beelitz mear Forlin. Sub-
ject said that this was the only time that he was actually steadily employed.
Because the Georgians were rather esteemed by the Germans, he had certain
freedoms. For a while he lived with a married German woman and genorally
speaking, it appears that he had a couple of other girl-friends on the side.
For some reason or other he also worked in a munitions plant. When playing "
(as he told us) with a small hand grenade, one of his fingers was crippled,
It is obscure how he obtained another job in Germany, but it is probably
a fact that he worked as a driver for the NSKK (National Socialist Party
Motorized Corps)..
It is felt that Subject actually went carly into the black marketing
racket. He told us that he had traveled extensively and had been in occupied
Poland (Lodz for example). He terned thees travelo as "fun" because to had
enough money to spend (orgo black market). It might also be possible that he
traveled in conjunction with the forged documents business he had begun,

and out of Germany. During the interview he claimed that his aim was to help
imprisoned his to pet back to the. Nevertheless, Although a
plausible reason (as mentioned that he wanted to help France), it is felt
that the ulterior motives right still have been love of excitement and wish
to make money. Technically speaking Subject must have been an accomplished
mint
former. He told us that his past studies at the cinematographic technicus
had given him valuable techniques to be applied to photo-nachanical forging
of documents, stamps) and cachets.
It is folt that he must have had accomplices. Nevertheless, he claim
that he did not work with the French Froinincs, although it might be possible
and probablo that they gave his on or the other order to fill. At a cer:
point Subject sprout working through intermindinisend cut-oute.
Generally it still might be possible that ho actually worked with
the French Resistancy but does not wish to tell us.

1. Introduction:
The Subject was contacted in Cap by Friganza. General familiarisation
with him was undertaken en re-te to Paris (by car) on the right of 15/16
October 1950. Subsequently he was set in Parla on 16 Setebar (afternoon)
and on 17 October, On the last day the Wechsler Sellevue was given alse
further meeting- and comications arrangements made
Bocause of the time-laitation (he was unable to stay in Paris also
he had song business of his am to transact), the debriefing and assessment
had to be necessarily held to general terms, the main consideration given
to Subject's over-all life-run the main stress put on the assessment for
REDSOX suitability.
There were no personal or security problems From t be beginning
Subject was willing, cost sager, and co-operative. He is also willing
to co-operate in the future and would not hesitate to take a long tri
in order to meet us again.
2. General Giography,
a. Pre WWII
Subject is a Georgian national. Both his parents were Georgians. Ha
was brought to France by his parants, who fled from the Soviet Union. Until
WWII they lived in Paris or surrounding areas. For one or the other reason
they moved frequently. This might have been due to the profession of his
father, who was a graduate mining-onginaer and who probably held an admin-
istrative or engineering deb in France.
Cuing to the above, Subject changed schools accordingly. He said that
he never had trouble in his studies because of a good memory and fast retention.
Conusquently, he was usually bored because of frequent repetitions. Oring to
boredom and possibly to some sense of opposition, he became usually a nuisance
to the teachers. Subject told us that once he had to be transferred to another
school, because he got into a violent argument ulth a teacher. His mother was
quite concerned about his behaviour and took him to a psychiatrist (from Sub-
ject's narrative it is not clear what the diagnosis was).
In his free time he liked to perform odd jobs, such as, for example,
fixing bicycles or helping out in electrical repair jobs or installation
work. He also loved to invent cadrats and odd machines.

Subject was moved from jail to jail and from concentration camp to

Brief Biography
Subject 18 a 40-year-old Georgian emigro living in Gap, Hautes
Alpes, France. Together with his parents, brother and sitter he moved
from the disintegrat.ng Georgian Republic in 1921 to Prance where he
has lived ever since, except for about three years during World War
II when he worked voluntarily in Germany as a semi-skilled laborer.
Ho joined the French Foreign Legion in 1940 and was demobilized in
1941, having served for the most part in North Africa. While in
Germany he developed a skill at forging documents which he used to
holp Franch officers to escape to France. He was arrested, convicted
and jailed for about a year and a half. After the war he returned to
Paris. In 1946 and 1947 Subject committed two armed robberies. In
1949 he robbed a bank in Paris, subsequent to which he was caug
convicted and sentenced to ten years, which was later reduced to five
by the terms of a general amnesty. Since his release in 1955 Subject

Comments on Contact and Debriefing

Subject was contacted by Anthony H. Friganza in Gap cn 15 October
1958, having been assessed and prepared for the contact by AEPADDLE, an
old friend of subject's, in February 1958. Shortly after the first
meeting with Friganza, Subject met Patrick B. Newens and Peter K. Win-
ship. In the course of meetings lasting a total of about 22 hours he
was debriefed and a preliminary assessment, including a Wechsler-
Bellevue psychological test, was made. There was no difficulty in
authenticating ourselves with Subject and in the course of our con-
versations, we got no indication that Subject did not answer the
questions put to him in a frank and open manner. If anything, Subject
perhaps tried to please for it is clear that subject would like a job,
almost any job, with us because his present situation in Gap. is re-
strictive and holds no promise of a future. But, Subject by nature ia
-not easily debriefed or interrogated because he is glib and seems quite
naturally to answer specific questions in a general way. Noteworthy
and indicative is the fact that the only birth date Subject knew was
his own; he did not know his parenta', his wife's or even his brother's.
This is not suspicious or unique, but it indicates that it is difficult
to pin him down to hard facts. When dealing with unpleasantnesces or
touchy matters, Subject is apt to philosophize as he did when he was
asked questions about the current relationship of his brother and his
new wife. Rather than give opinions on facts about the girl, he noted
that marriage is sixty percent love and forty percent county, which is
true, but only in a round-about way at best
does it express Subject's personal
oussion. No attempt to be tough with subject was made and there was no
occasion when we conveniently could have challenged his sincerity or
veipalty, co se do not know how Subject believes in with circumstances.

Subject claims to speak Georgian with native fluency. He may
speak it well but we venture that it is not the same language burrently
being spoken in Georgia, the probably being so
probably being so carecause he has
never been to Georgia. Thoro is no indication he uses the language
much, if at all. He speaks, reads and writes French with native
fluency. Actually, French is his native language; at lease he cal-
culates in French. He speaks and reads Germain well and a capable of
expressing himself quite fully in it. He understands English and can
say simple things in it. Subject says he is able to understand and
speak Spanish well enough to get along.
Culturally Subject is French. His mannerisms are French, as are
his habits. If there is anything particularly Georgian about Subject,
it is not noticeable. We would guess that Subject was brought up
not too well-to-do middle class circumstances bider the influence
of his parents who had had a much better, possibly even prosperous,
past.
r
Character and personality: It is safe to describe Subject as
independent and as a man who instinctively prefers to take his chances
relying on his own abilities and resources in order to avoid com-
promising his independence by assuming commitments. He is a long wolf
type. We guess that Subject behaves this way partly because he has an
exaggerated notion of his competence, and partly because he is im-
patient with delay and with people who are less quick or able than he
Even though Subject needs people and likes company, he does not want
to have his affairs, particularly his business affairs, dependent on
others. There are several points which support this: By his om
admission (which, incidentally, may be quite misleading because he may
have quite incorrect opinion of himself) subject as a student was ob
streperous, impatient, and consistently so. As a voluntary worker in
Germany when he seems to have struck out on his own is further evidence.
Now, rather than taking a steady job of some kind which suits his
abilities, Subject is once again striking out on his own, although his
record as a convict mitigates this because he has no choice. One of
the reasons why Subject does this is that he has an insatiable desire
to strike it rich or at least to achieve success and stature. This
“desire to attain something may be related to the comparison he must
be forced to make between his record and that of his brother: Hla has
been unruly, irregular, troublesome, and he has attained very little;
his brother became an officer in the French away (even though he was
foreign born) and is now a so-so successful architect. Also, we sun-
pect that we have not yet gotten the full story on Subject's marriage
and divorce. Perhaps Subject married unwisely, lost. face with his
family, and/or was considered a low type mate by his wife's family even
before he was arrested.
One of the underlying reasons why subject is so independent
is that he is impatient. In conversation we noticed that he did not
wait for questions we wished to put to him to be fully formed. He
tends to interrupt in order to supply usually interesting and sometimes
even pertinent information. He seems unable to bide his time. Ne
doubt that Subject has any definable moral or other standards.
In any
given instance he either rationalizes the facts. in order to reach a
conclusion which appealed to him to begin with, or he simply overlooks
the certain significant issue. Still, Subject is not amorel or a
criminal type. We believe he knows right and wrong, sometimes con-
siders whether any given act would be right or wrong and/or decent.
His trouble is that not having any firm base point leads him into
poral contradictions which he can't solve and frequently is unaware of
because he doesn't really care. We doubt that subject's morals con-
cerning drink, women, gasbling and the other vices differ greatly at
rest from the average person of approximately the game background. To
repeat, it is not that Subject has no standards his are just different
and peculiarly his own.

:
he believe that Subject is sentimental but is ashamed of being
so; he makes a joke of it. He wants to be liked by people and realizes
that most people find him interesting, entertaining and attractive.
Wo think that Subject unconsciously gives an important place to
comradeship. He can influence poople aixl be influenced by them. He
and
is mature about such things but still we think he would stick by a
friend in trouble, perhaps to the point of foolishness. Because
Subject has the winning personality he does, he has never been obliged
to retain friends and/or acquaintances because he alows he will al
ways be able to find new ones.
new one Interestingly enough Subject more than
once distinguished between a friend and an acquaintance, and in so many
words stated that he has had very fow friends as such.
Subject demonstrated that he is able to reason and to do so
very well. «lle saw the solution of logical and algebraic problems he
was given remarkably quickly. While attempting to solve these problems,
Subject reasoned well enough but showed that his memory is perhaps not
as good. Subject knew his own date of birth and hardly any other; of
course, he had no interest in the others.
Subject is perceptive and is able to combine his perception
with his ability to reason. He made several remarks which indicated
that he saw through the behaviour of certain personalities, political
questions, etc. which were discussed. Subject is observant but we
did not have sufficient time with him to know whether his powers of
observation are excellent or simply above average.
IF
Subject has a winning personality and is quite capable in
dealing with people. He listens well, talks rapidly and at length
without attempting to monopolize the conversation. He is quite will-
ing to climb out on a conversational limb, listen when he hears somens
else speak up who is apparently better inforried, and asks questions
if his interest has been aroused. We would guess that subject would
be particularly well suited to dealing with the public. He nicely
combines pseudo-attentiveness and Gallic charm.
We doubt that Subject has much resolve and almost certainly
would not stick to a boring, difficult job for very long. We doubt
he would simply quit in a huff; he would far prefer to rationalize and,
if necessary, to manufacture excuses for release. Connected with this
is the possible character weakness in subject concerning his reliability
to fulfill any given set task. We doubt that he would oversleep or
get drunk but if he personally did not understand and appreciate the
Importance of the job, he would be inclined to let it slide or ignore
it. An excellent point in Subject's favor is that he could not be
brow beaten or easily dominated. For instance, we doubt that even the
threat of physical torture would force Subject to tell something he
did not wish to say. To preclude any such crisis, Subject would be
glib, second guess his interrogators, invent facts or at least re-
arrange them to suit whatever purpose he might have in mind. Subject
could probably be dominated by a man of superior intelligence (at
least considerably superior to his) who spoke native French and was
sufficiently informed about Subject's background so that he could
catch out Subject in any one of his evasions.
Subject is a materialist because he has the idea that material
success is necessarily the passport to respectability, social success,
happiness and a host of other such abstract Imponderables. Not that
Subject is too unhappy or emotionally imbalanced at the present time;
ho enjoys the very carefree life he leads. We think that because
Subject has this desire for material gain and hence respectability,
the promise of a sizeable financial reward would by itself be sufficient
to win his loyalty and wholehearted cooperation. This is not to say
that the anti-Communist struggle for good and against evil means
nothing to him. It does, of course, and he might undertake dangerous.
work for the love of adventure, but he would do so with a great deal
more verve and conviction if he were sure of the pot of gold at the
end of the road.

least not for very long we think he would work hard at learning any

and correct in claiming he is a willing candidate.

last moment. He is no physical coward.
ever, Subject is willing for REDSOX because in it he sees a way out
of the bind he is now in. He can't leave France because there is nowhere
to go. Because he has a criminal record he is unable to build a future
for himself in France, and he is unable to travel in order to look for
possibilities. He has been euled to a hick town where he is paroled

.
So basically Subject is willing because it is a way out. There is an
element of adventure in his willingness but any adventurous ideas wou
immediately evaporate if Subject were a French citizen and had a
financially successful business. Subject is anti-Comunist, etc., we
feel quite certain, but he is either too jaded, or too mature, ot too
cynical to permit such notions to play much of a role. If he were given
the idea that KUBARK demands fiery anti-Communist motivation, Subject
would do his best to convince us that that is what he is. Subject in
'
so many words said that one of his prime desires was to get out of
Prance, and as a first choice to go to the United States. The promise
of American citizenship would weigh in heavily as a factor in Subject's
willingness to undertake almost any REDSOX mission regardless of the
danger. In a word, Subject's motivation is material.
7. Handling
of Subject: The handling of Subject from this point
on must be ruthless and calculated. We think that Subject would be
neither shocked nor offended by such handling; as a matter of fact he
probably expects it. We would recommend against paying Subject more
than the absolute minimum he needs to survive until the mission had
been completed. If Subject is removed from France, some neens must
be found to convince Subject that we can dispose of him to an area or
a place at least as disadvantageous to Subject as his present one is.
In other words, don't give Subject the carrot until he has done the job.
Subject would not necessarily need to be trained in French as this is
the only language in which he is perfectly fluent. Even though his
Georgian is very good, it is not current and he could be used only on
a black mission. He appears to be physically rugged and in good con-
ditich. Very arduous and exacting training would be salutary.
We do not think that subject would be an awkward disposal
problem if he wore transferred to AEACRE for training and his mission
were subsequently cancelled. Given scie money and a job, ho could be
resettled in any South American country without difficulty.
8. Recommendation:
(a) We hope there is sufficient information on: Subject now
recorded on which Headquarters will be able to decide if subject is of
Interest for REDSOX or not. If he is, he should be further debriefed
and interrogated and given the LCFLUTTER test. The LCFLUTTER test could
be given in Paris or Frankfurt.

If it is given in Paris there will be a less favorable climate,
some risk will be taken that we might have difficulties with the French,
and we might face several operational problems in getting a secure
house, etc.
If the test is given in Frankfurt, Subject would
Subject would necessarily
need to travel here on a phoney German Reisenuswels (which we consider
he could use properly from the language point of view). The principal
riak in bringing Subject to Prankfurt is that Suoject might have an
accident or he might manufacture some reason not to return. In either
case we might have an awkward disposal problem on our hands and we
might be embarrassed vis-a-vis the Germans
We would prefer to bring Subject to Prankfurt because we be-
lieve that Subject is bona fide and would be unlikely to double cross
us.
(b) We wish to emphasize that this is a preliminary assess
ment and recommendation With that caveat we would recommend Subject
for a fully black REDSOX mission which requires: (1) able bodiness
(2) superior intelligence (considering the calibre of person who is
likely to be willing) and reasoning power, (3) willingness to under
take an extremely hazardous mission, (4) no native Russian fluency,
(5) basic technical, mechanical, and pseudo-scientific abilities.
We would hesitate at this point to recommend Subject for a repatriation
mission even though he is willing because we question whether Subject
has the resolve or patience for such a task.
