Dear Mr. Pereira: Jok
As we previously discussed, please initiate the necessary action to grant the appropriate
SCI clearances for Carolyn Carpenter, SSN 538-46-7574. Ms. Carpenter's file was
reviewed by the Department of Justice Personnel Security Office. The DoJ
recommended granting a Top Secret clearance and postponing a decision on SCI
pending a CIA review for special exception to DCI Directive 114, paragraph 5C, due to
foreign in-laws.
As you may recall from our conversation, Ms. Carpenter is a former CIA employee. I
would like to request that the investigation for her SCI clearance be given careful
consideration. It is extremely important to the Review Board that our clearances meet
the highest standards of the agencies with which we have dealings.
The Review Board has informed Ms. Carpenter that her employment is contingent upon
receiving the appropriate clearances. Therefore, I respectfully request that her case be
given top priority. If you need further information, please contact either me or Tracy
Shycoff, our Deputy Security Officer. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Sincerely,

SUBJECT:
Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members
1. At your request, PRD searched its files to find information on how secrecy
agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with
intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such
commissions. The first was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a
PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and
Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of
Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission
report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official
declassification.
2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles
and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996.
Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.
3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic
Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed
secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March,
explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board's and staff's
willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that
time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for
review.

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS
}
Ramona,
The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of
whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the
Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted
diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy
agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful -
to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency
records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy
agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy
agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members
may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these actions will bear fruit are not
good.
Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect
to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified
information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever
approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the
Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we
submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:
1. Do and say nothing, and hope that the Board members will voluntarily submit any future
writings for prepublication review.
2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing
obligation not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning
prepublication review, and again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for
prepublication review.
3. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they
have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish
(related to their work as Board members) as part of their obligation to protect classified information,

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY
and hope the Board members do not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide
them with any signed secrecy agreements). In essence we bluff the Board. (**A variation of this
approach would be to have the Board execute an SCI debriefing statement, which includes a
prepublication clause, although it is limited to SCI material**)
4. Have the Board members sign secrecy agreements on the way out. This option would
be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist
no sanctions for not signing), and it would be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would
provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to the Board members, and therefore would not contain the
legal consideration necessary to establish a binding contract). We would have to hope that the
question of enforceability issue is not raised - essentially, amounting to another bluff.
5. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice
in the mid-1980's, that appears to permit the Agency to write a regulation that requires
prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel given access to CIA
information, to allow the DCI to protect intelligence sources and methods. The regulation would be
signed by the DCI, and then the Board would be briefed on their responsibilities and obligations
under the regulation.

5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly
mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to
publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified
information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this
obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy
agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.
6. Ask Board members and staffers to sign secrecy agreements on their way out. This option
could be difficult to implement as there would be no incentive for a Board member to sign it (there exist no
sanctions for not signing), although Board staffers have indicated they would support this approach.
Generally speaking, a secrecy agreement signed on the eve of separation from government service would
be legally unenforceable (since the agreement would provide a benefit to the Agency, but not to Board
members or staffers, and therefore would not contain the legal consideration necessary to establish a
binding contract). However, in this case, if the agreement was modified to indicate that it merely reduced
to writing understandings which had been previously agreed to by the Board, we would have a strong
argument the agreement was legally binding. Of course, this option would alert the Board to the fact that
we do not have any secrecy agreements previously signed by the Board. Even if the Board agrees to sign
new secrecy agreements before they disband, nothing would preclude them from disputing the
enforceability of the agreements at a later date.
6. We can rely on language in the Snepp case, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in the
mid-1980's, that appears to permit the DCI to write a regulation to protect intelligence sources and
methods by requiring prepublication review of the possibly classified writings of non-CIA personnel who
have served in positions of special trust and have been given access to CIA information. The regulation
would be signed by the DCI, and promulgated immediately. Then the Board would be briefed on their
responsibilities and obligations under the regulation. Of course, nothing would preclude the Board from
disputing the validity of such a regulation at a later date.
None of the above options guarantee success. However, I have discussed these options with
Dawn Eilenberger, and we believe that Option #_ is the best approach to take. OIM concurs. Please let
me know how we should proceed, since our last chance to deal with the Board as a group will be at their
23 September meeting.

The EXDIR concurs with the OGC recommended option (#5), provided that the letter is low-key and
stresses that the pre-publication review "obligation" is standard operating procedure. Additionally, he
requests the opportunity to view the letter in draft. Thanks.

(Option 5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly
mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to
publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified
information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this

READ IMMEDIATELY: JFK Board Secrecy Agreements Issue
ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS
Ramona,
The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether
secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board"), and
offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both
internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the
Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have
been found. We are also searching selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference
to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition,
we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any
secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these
actions will bear fruit are not good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the
outset, the FBI was given responsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board.
Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to
future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified
information). The last meeting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of
business as of 1 October. If we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September
meeting will be our last opportunity to do so. Otherwise we will have to deal with each Board member and
staffer individually, if at all. Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever
approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's
unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the
Board. With that in mind, our options are:
1. Do and say nothing, and hope that Board members and staffers will voluntarily submit any
future writings for prepublication review.
2. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation
not to reveal classified information in any way, without specifically mentioning prepublication review, and
again hope that they will voluntarily submit any future writings for prepublication review. Board members
and staffers sign nothing.
3. Provide a generic security exit briefing for the Board which mentions their continuing obligation
not to reveal classified information in any way, and also makes available our prepublication review services
to assist them in this regard, if requested, with respect to any future writings (related to their work as Board
members or staffers). Board members and staffers sign nothing. The success of this option depends
upon the willingness of Board members and staffers to voluntarily submit any future writings for
prepublication review.
4. Provide a specific security exit briefing for the Board which expressly mentions that they have
an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to publish (related to their
work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified information, and hope
the Board does not ask for the source of this obligation (since we cannot provide them with any signed
secrecy agreements). In essence, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.

(ARRB) Reviewers
Attached is Scott Nann's note on INFOSEC procedures.
It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap-
tops in and out of the building as long as security
requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified
PCs are met. HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and
forms.
I propose we implement Situation #33 (board reviewers
can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the
building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form
4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG
staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or to
escort the Board reviewers out of the building.

SECRECY AGREEMENT
(print full name), hereby agree to accept as a prior condition of my
being employed by, or otherwise retained to perform services for, the Central Intelligence Agency, or for staff elements of the
Director of Central Intelligence (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Central Intelligence Agency"), the obligations
contained in this agreement.
2. I understand that in the course of my employment or other service with the Central Intelligence Agency I may be
given access to information or material that is classified or is in the process of a classification determination in accordance
with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 as amended or superseded, or other applicable Executive order, that if
disclosed in an unauthorized manner would jeopardize intelligence activities of the United States Government. I accept that by
being granted access to such information or material I will be placed in a position of special confidence and trust and become
obligated to protect the information and/or material from unauthorized disclosure.
3. In consideration for being employed or otherwise retained to provide services to the Central Intelligence Agency, I
hereby agree that I will never disclose in any form or any manner, to any person not authorized by the Central Intelligence
Agency to receive it, any information or material in either of the following categories:
a. information or material received or obtained in the course of my employment or other service with the Central
Intelligence Agency that is marked as classified or that I know is classified;
b. information or material received or obtained in the course of my employment or other service with the Central
Intelligence Agency that I know is in the process of a classification determination.
4. I understand that it is my responsibility to consult with appropriate management authorities in the component or
Directorate that employs me or has retained my services, or with, the Central Intelligence Agency's Publications Review Board
if I am no longer employed by or associated with the Agency, in order to ensure that I know: 1) whether information or material
within my knowledge or control that I have reason to believe might be in either of the categories set forth in paragraph 3 is
considered by the Central Intelligence Agency to fit in either of those categories; and, 25 whom the Agency has authorized to
receive such information or material
Pi
5. As a further condition of the special confidence and trust reposed in me by the Central Intelligence Agency, I here-
by agree to submit for review by the Central intelligence Agency any writing or other preparation in any form, including a
work of fiction, which contains any mention of intelligence data or activines, or contains any other information or material that
might be based upon either of the categories set forth in paragraph 3, that I contemplate disclosing publicly or that I have
actually prepared for public disclosure, either during my employment or other service with the Central Intelligence Agency or
at any time thereafter, prior to discussing it with or showing it to anyone who is not authorized to have access to the categories.
set forth in paragraph 3. I further-agree that I will not take any steps toward public disclosure until I have received written
permission to do so from the Central Intelligence Agency
6. I understand that the purpose of the review described in paragraph 5 is to give the Central Intelligence Agency an
opportunity to determine whether the information or material that I contemplate disclosing publicly contains any information
or material that I have agreed not to disclose. I further understand that the agency will act upon my submission and make a
response to me within a reasonable time I further understand that if I dispute the Agency's initial determination on the basis
that the information of material in question derives from public sources. I may be called upon to specifically identify such
sources. My failure or refusal to do so may by itself result in denial of permission to publish or otherwise disclose the information
or material in dispute
7. I understand that all information or material that I may acquire in the course of my employment or other service with
the Central Intelligence Agency that fits either of the categories set forth in paragraph 3 of this agreement are and will remain
the property of the United States Government, unless and until otherwise determined by an appropriate official or final ruling
of a court of law. I agree to surrender anything constituting, containing or reflecting such information or material upon demand
by an appropriate official of the Central Intelligence Agency, or upon the conclusion of my employment or other service with
the Central Intelligence Agency.
8. I agree to notify the Central Intelligence Agency immediately in the event that I am called upon by judicial or con-
gressional authorities, or by specially established investigatory bodies of the executive branch, to testify about, or provide, in-
formation or material that I have agreed herein not to disclose. In any communication with any such authority or body, I shall
observe all applicable rules or procedures for ensuring that such information and/or material is handled in a secure manner.
9. I understand that nothing contained in this agreement prohibits me from reporting intelligence activities that I con-
sider to be unlawful or improper directly to the Intelligence Oversight Board established by the President, or to any successor
body that the President may establish, or to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives or the Senate.
I recognize that there are also established procedures for bringing such matters to the attention of the Agency's Inspector
General or to the Director of Central Intelligence. In making any report referred to in this paragraph, I will observe all applicable
rules or procedures for ensuring the secure handling of any information or material that may be involved, I understand that
any such information or material continues to be subject to this agreement for all other purposes and that such reporting does
not constitute public disclosurg or declassification of that information or material.

10. I understand that any breach of this agreement by me may result in the Central Intelligence Agency taking admin-
istrative action against me, which can include temporary loss of pay or termination of my employment or other service with
the Central Intelligence Agency. I also understand that if I violate the terms of this agreement, the United States Government

11. I understand that the United States Government may, prior to any unauthorized disclosure that is threatened by me,
choose to apply to any appropriate court for an order enforcing this agreement. Nothing in this agreement constitutes a waiver
on the part of the United States to institute a civil or criminal proceeding for any breach of this agreement by me. Nothing in
this agreement constitutes a wavier on my part of any possible defenses I may have in connection with either civil or criminal
proceedings that may be brought against me.
12. In addition to any other remedy to which the United States Government may become entitled, I hereby assign to the
United States Government all rights, title, and interest in any and all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted
or will result or may result from any divulgence, publication or revelation of information or material by me that is carried out
in breach of paragraph 5 of this agreement or that involves information or material prohibited from disclosure by the terms of
this agreement.
