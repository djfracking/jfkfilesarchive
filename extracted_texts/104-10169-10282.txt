and her husband would attempt to travel to China before returning to
U.B. ODSITY asked for any information we might receive which would
Monte Subjects had traveled to China. We have passed the gist of
information in reference to ODEVY. We shall appreciate receiving
additional information on the activities of Subjects which you say .
