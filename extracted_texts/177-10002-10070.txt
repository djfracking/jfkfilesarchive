MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
g
Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos Jun
We do not expect to make any major political decisions
but want to give new emphasis to the friendly relations
which exsist between Mexico and the United States. These
relations are now at an all-time high. Mexico felt it had
a real friend in President Kennedy. They feel the same
relationship exsists with you but want to be reassured.
A warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that
relationship.
We want to stress the identity of interests of our
two countries and our ability to work out in the "spirit
of El Chamizal" any problems that may arise between us.
Despite the informal atmosphere of the visit, we
should give scrupulous attention to Mexico's extreme
sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong
desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to the
United States
At times
Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government
and no important decision is made without his approval.
He has followed an "independent" foreign policy but
knows that good relations with us, especially in the
economic sphere, are essential to his country.
his foreign policy has been too independent--for
example on Cuba and in commercial and cultural rela-
tions with Communist China. But when fundamental issues
are at stake we have usually found him understanding
and willing to be helpful--controlling travel of
Castro agents, non-recognition of Red China, offering
help on Panama.
C
Lopez Mateos has chosen his successor, Gustavo DIAZ
Ordaz, who will take office in December 1964 after
elections in July. Power is therefore drifting toward
Diaz Ordaz.

Control of Narcotics
Mexico and the United States are cooperating in
controlling the importation of narcotics and dangerous
drugs into the United States. We should strengthen this
cooperation in the mutual interest of both countries.

are prepared to go ahead with a feasibility study if
Mexico desire and will share the cost.
MAJOR POINTS LOPEZ MATEOS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE
1. Salinity Problem on Lower Colorado
The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of
President Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent and
effective solution at the earliest possible time" of the
salinity problem. We can agree but should avoid any commit-
ment on timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem
of the groundwater recovery program at Yuma, we agree that
the Boundary Commission should study the problem. Farmers
in the lower Rio Grande Valley are seriously concerned
about saline drainage discharged to the river by Mexico and
want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early solution to
this problem.

MAJOR POINTS OF INTEREST TO THE UNITED STATES
1. General Information and Hemisphere Relations
We desire to continue close working relations with
Mexico both within and outside the OAS and the UN.
We hope Mexico will continue to use its key political
and geographic position to help control Castro Communism.
Mexico is very sensitive about publicizing its cooperation
and we have carefully avoided any public comment on Mexican
control measures.
Mexico has offered its assistance on Panama.
is not aware of the role of President Orlich of Costa Rica
Mexico
in mediation efforts and we do not desire that this come to
Mexico's attention. We welcome Mexico's assistance within
an OAS context.
2: Red China
The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil in
March has prompted speculation that these two countries
are about to recognize Red China. Lopez Mateos has given
us secret assurances, through CIA channels, that he has
no intention of recognizing Red China. We do not desire
to raise this issue, but if Lopez Mateos raises it, we
should let him know we are aware of his assurances.
3.
Mexico's Role in the Alliance for Progress
Mexico's participation in the Alliance is essential
to its success. Mexico has played a leading role in IA-
ECOSOC and has named the Director General of the Bank of
Mexico as its representative to CIAP. It has cooperated
with us in providing extensive training facilities for
Latin American technicians. We want to encourage Mexico to
make a greater contribution. Mexico is making renewed efforts
to promote private enterprise and we also want to encourage
Mexico along this line. We should continue to cooperate
with Mexico in maintaining financial stability and promoting
economic development.

2. Bracero Program
The Mexican Government is privately seriously
disturbed about the termination of this program.
Congressional oppostion to it is strong and we cannot
commit ourselves to continue the program. We are looking
into the problem to see if anything can be done to help
Mexico. One possibility is an expanded community develop-
ment program in Mexico through private channels (P.L. 480
foodstuffs through U.S. voluntary agencies) if Mexico is
interested.
3. Mexico's Concern about U.S. Trade Policies
Mexico is concerned about United States restrictions
or threatened restrictions on textiles, lead, zinc and
meat and other products and United States cotton policies
which it claims hurt Mexican cotton exports to the world
market. We recognize that we are natural markets for
each other. We desire to expand trade, promote competi-
tion and develop markets. We want to maintain or expand the
present level of access to each other's market but we would
not be able to guarantee Mexico its present share of our
market in each commodity or a share in increased consumption.
4.
Chamizal Settlement
Lopez Mateos wants to be recorded in history as the
máº¡n who returned the Mexican flag to the Chamizal. He
wants a ceremony at the Presidential level at El Paso-
Ciudad Juarez before December 1964 to symbolize the Chamizal
settlement. We should only agree to consult later in the
year on an appropriate ceremony and a possible date.
