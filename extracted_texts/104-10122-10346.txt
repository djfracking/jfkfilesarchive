SUBJECT: Project HARPSTAR ·

1. May 1958 – FE Division initially contacted Director of
Security and briefed him on Project. Basically, Project capitalized
on President Sukarno's weakness for women, especially Caucasian.
Because of our inability to get controlled asset close to him to deter-
mine his thinking and plans, and the recent apparent success of
Soviets use of a woman, believed he may let down guard and become
expansive in discussion of plans with a female and accept advice
that he would not ordinarily accept from a man.

and trustworthy female who would accept assignment which would

16. Records of this Office do not reflect any of the activities
during the course of her mission. It is believed she left
for Indonesia sometime in January 1959. It is known that she did
meet Sukarno, but due to unfortunate timing that had him leaving
his country on official business, she had little time to cultivate him;
consequently, the purpose of the mission was not fulfilled. It should
be noted that Sukarno took sufficient notice of her that during an un-
official visit to the United States in June 1959, he expressed a strong
desire to see her and did.
17. The last known contact had with the Agency was in
the form of a telephone call on 12 April 1961 when she called on the
sterile line and talked to Hugh Tovar, who she knew as George Henry.
She advised that
asked her to give a party for Presi-
dent Sukarno who would be in Los Angeles on 21 April 1961. She
wanted to know whether Henry's people were interested in sponsor-
ing this party. A negative response was given.
18. It is not known where she is or what her activities are at
the present time, but presumably she is still in the Los Angalas
area.
