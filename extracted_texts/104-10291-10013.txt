Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance
to vary very much from year to year. He has continued to in the highly
creditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for him for
many years. He has managed his subordinates well and has exercised uni-
formly good judgment in directing their operational efforts. Of particular
value has been his steadiness in the face of administrative adversity disrupting
the organization of his Base. Mr. Noel insured that the work of the Base
continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of
all details and report them to Headquarters as appropriate. It is a credit
to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparts exposure period there was not a single
instance of an academic asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.
The performance of his officers attests the careful guidance and wise
-leadership which has enabled them to operate securely and well in sensi-
tive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS are excellent. He is
appropriately economy "minded. In short, he is a decidedly strong super-
visor.

Mr. Noel is an old hand at running Bases or Stations
abroad and his performance as Chief of Base, San Francisco,
amply attests that. It goes without saying that he understands
all aspects of the business, knows how to delegate, organize,
direct and report. He has continued to do all these things
well. His seniority, experience and maturity served the Agency
in particularly good stend during this period when the location
of his Base was compromised in the public press, through no
fault of Mr. Noel. His subsequent and consequent actions were
all taken with sound judgmont and appropriate calm and circum-
spection. He was also most receptive to, and cooperative in,
Headquarters suggestions in this matter. He is, of course, cost
conscious and an excellent supervisor. His overall performance
is that of a high order of senior Agency officers.

of any given situation, evidences sound and objective judgment,
and works well under pressure. He writes lucidly, speaks
articulately, and exhibits a high degree of cost consciousness
in the use of government funds and property. His delegation of
responsibility to others is meaningful and well delineated.
5.
Subject's performance has been strong throughout the
rating period. He has given the station purposeful direction
and competent management and as an effective supervisor who
commands the loyalty and respect of those whom he supervises, he
has succeeded in obtaining a maximum effort from the station
personnel. He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other
principal officers of the Embassy, several of whom have expressed
their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value
of the station's contribution to the functioning of the Embassy.
The fact that the Ambassador arrived in Madrid with definite
prejudices regarding the Agency but was of quite another mind
upon his departure is testimony to subject's skill and tact.
6. Subject has conducted the Agency's liaison with the
Spanish services most competently, as evidenced by the rela-
tionship, he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, his
ability to persuade the AEM to undertake sensitive operations
in Cuba, and the fact that this liaison did not suffer following
the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu", Marked
progress has been achieved in joint CE and CP operations, and
subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the
latter's collaboration far exceeds the cooperation normally
expected in an official liaison relationship.

In addition to his considerable executive and liaison
duties, subject has carried out the previously cited opera-
tional assignments with marked ability. He is a convincing and

Under the direction of Mr. Noel a far reaching and fruitful major operational
program against the high priority Cuban target has been undertaken and Madrid Station
today is making a substantial contribution in good operations and good intelligence
information to the over-all Agency effort. Another notable accomplishment directly
attributable to Mr. Noel, and in part a reflection of his long years of service in
Latin America, has been his professional handling personally of the station operation
involving Juan Peron. Interested CB components have stated categorically that Madrid
Station coverage of Juan Peron and his activities is essential in satisfying existing
intelligence requirements on Peronism.
Despite the Station's heavy diversion into Cuban and Latin American activities
and State Department policy restrictions on internal political activities, Mr. Noel
has encouraged the development of a long-range program involving activities against
the Spanish Communist Party and clandestine contact with the Spanish political
opposition.

Fitness Report Covering the Period 14 August 1961 to

Mr. Noel assumed his duties as Chief of Station, Madrid on
on
23 September 1961. The Station, as constituted when Mr. Noel arrived,
included some 21 staffers plus numerous contract personnel, as well as
a two man base in Barcelona. The Madrid Station proper not only includes
the Embassy installation but an outside operations section as well. Since
Mr. Hoel arrived the Station has been launched into a Cuban operations
program of considerable scale and on a crash basis. In addition, in this
period, one State cover slot was withdrawn, and the experienced Chief of
Base, Barcelonn had to be brought home due to a family emergency.
2. To date Mr. Noel has given every evidence of a particular ability
to cope with the crash program and the acute shortage of personnel with
Judiciousness and maturity. While it is too early, yet, to pass judgement,
there are indications that Mr. Noel has been preoccupied with Cuban
problems (an area of special interest to him) to the detriment of lower
priority but, nonetheless, necessary Spanish targets (for example, contact
with the local opposition and a budding effort against the Spanish Communist
Party).
i
3. As indicated above, Mr. Noel has not been in place as Chief of
Station long enough to justify firm reservations concerning his management,
nor to permit meaningful criticism. Also, as indicated above, his out-
standing noticeable strength to date has been his ability to cope with a
heavy operational program, a shortage of personnel, and a sometimes difficult
operational climate, with judgement, calmness and patience.

SCORET
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
:
26 October 1960
SUBJECT:-
James A. Noel
-
Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report
trifle
Mr. James A. Noel arrived in Havana in September of 1958,
more than three months before Fidel Castro assumed power on 1 January
-1959. With the advent of that new government Cuba became, so far as
U.S. economic and political interests are concerned, one of the most
important spots in the world, as well as increasingly more difficult
to conduct CIA business. As a result, with the constant worsening of
Cuban-U.S. relationship, it is doubtful that there is at the present
time a more difficult assignment than Havana in this Division. Never-
theless, with an extremely limited staff, Noel has been able to con
tinue, and even extend, his operations to the point where almost every
significant phase of Cuban life is covertly covered. When the increase
of anti-U.S. feeling is considered, to say nothing of the increase of
effectiveness of the Cuban counterintelligence resulting from its
direction by Soviet professionals, it is amazing that Noel has been
able to produce the great volume of important reports which he has sent
He has conducted some extremely delicate operations in the face of
almost certainty of discovery. In all this, however, he has offered
leadership of a high quality to his staff and has been a fine example
of good morale, which is reflected in the attitude of every member of
his staff, all of whom respond readily and without complaint to the
demands made of them by their surrounding circumstances. Mr. Noel
deserves to be warmly commended for a job well done.

My dear Mr. Dulles:
I should like to express my appreciation to you for the
security assistance furnished by your representatives during
the Tenth Inter-American Conference at Caracas, Venezuela.
Colonel J. C. King, the Head of your Latin American Division
and Mr. James A. Hoel, your station Chief in Caracas were
tremendous help to us in carrying out our security arrange
ments for the Conference and for the protection of the
Secretary and Conference Delegates.
-
"
Colonel King was most cooperative and assisted us
greatly during the initial planning of the security and
throughout the Conference. The cooperation and advice of
Mr. Icel was an invaluable service. Through Mr. Noel's
knowledge and contacts our work was greatly facilitated.
He consistently made available his time, equipment and the
facilities of his office and maintained a close working
relationship with our security representatives in Caracas.
Please accept my thanks for the assistance of Colonel King
and Mr. Hoël and for a job well done.
Sincerely yours,
The Honorable

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Liaison Control, OSO
SUBJECT
: Integration of James A. NOEL
2. On 20 March 1952 the Department of State was requested to
integrate Mr. James A. NOEL for assignment as Chief of the 050
station at Caracas, Venezuela. It is understood that Mr. Noel's
papers are still in process at the Department..
.
2. This Division has now been informed that the medical
staff of CIA will not approve an overseas assignment for r. Nool
until 1 August 1952. At that time r. NOEL will undergo another
physical examination and if results are satisfactory he will be
certified as fit for overseas duty.
3. In order to avoid cancellation of Mr. NOEL's appointment,
it is requested that the Department of State be asked not to call
1. Mr. HCEL to enter on duty until advised by OSO that he is certified
for overseas duty and ready to proceed. to his Caracas assignment,
subject to State's concurrence. It is anticipated that this will
occur about 1 August 1952, or shortly thereafter.

1. This memorandum is to remind all concerned that Cecil J.
KLOBUKAR (P)**
GS-16, of your component is schedul-
ed for retirement under the CSC system during the month of March 1971.
2. As you know, the normal retirement date is the last day of
the month in which the individual becomes eligible to retire. To
insure complete understanding, it is suggested that this matter be
again explained to the employee and an appointment be arranged with
the Retirement Counseling Branch, Retirement Affairs Division, Office
of Personnel, extension 3328, for further discussions or counseling
´on benefits available upon retirement. Formal application for retire-
ment should be made at least three months prior to the scheduled date.
3. If you should propose to take any steps to retain this
employee after his retirement date, your attention is invited to
HN 20-324. Any recommendation in that connection will require the
concurrence of the Deputy Director for Plans and should be submitted
at least 12 months prior and not more than 18 months prior to the
scheduled retirement date.
4. If a replacement is required, early notification to CSPS
will assist in locating a qualified replacement. (See CSPS Memo No.

FROM
SUBJECT
Chief, Domestic Operations Division
: Request for Non-Official Cover
for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR (P)
The following paragraphs are keyed to points raised in
Form 10-64, 2311.
A.
General Information
.
•
1. and 2. This request concerns Staff Employee Cecil
J. KLOBUKAR (P) formerly Woodrow C. OLIEN (P), who is converting.
to Career Agent status. He is presently Chief of Base San
Francisco. He will operate in the same area on the outside
as a Career Agent. KLOBUKAR has been under Department of State
Cover since the Agency was established. From 1931-44 he was
a bona fide Foreign Service Officer. From 1944-47 ho was
with OSS/SSU/CIG. KLOBUKAR is a senior staff officer who has
had Chief of Station positions during his entire career as
an Agency employee.
3. N.A. KLOBUKAR will serve under unofficial cover
domestically.
4.
KLOBUKAR has been operating under LNSLED cover in
San Francisco.
˚5.
KLOBUKAR can assume his new cover immediately.
6. Since KLOBUKAR's change of status involves a domestic
base where he is presently assigned, the only consideration
involves establishing him under non-official cover in San
Francisco as a contributing Base asset as soon as possible.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
1.
James A. Noel
Chief, DO and I talked to Jim Noel this morning about
the possibility of his converting from staffer to career agent.
After considerable discussion, Jim agreed to the conversion. He
is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the situation
within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long-
time employees is blocking the promotions of junior officers.
2.
Jim urged that he be retained as a career agent until
he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years).
Chief, DO stated that the need in the San Francisco area for handlers
of contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need
for experienced career agents on the outside of the small San
Francisco Base. I told Jim that unless he pulled something stupid,
he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached
age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant after
that time if his performance was productive and if operational
requirements remain as they are at present.
3.
Jim explained why he could not retire -- the next five
years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to
put through college.
4.
i
Chief, DO and Jim will work out the details and timing
of his conversion to career agent.

A policy decision has been made that a participant in the CIA Ret Systom should
not later than 18 months prior to his retirement apply to be removed from the
CIA Retirement System and transferred to the CSR System.
In order to retire under the CSR System (55-30) he must be under that system

Request to Revert to Civil Service Retirement System
ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES
Reference: USFS-577 dated 21 April 1967 ..
1. On 26 November 1967, I reached the "break even"
point between the Civil Service Retirement System and the
Organization's System, having completed 36 years and 11 months
of Government Service on that date.
2. Since I plan to work until age 60, at which time I
will have 40 years of Government Service, it is my desire to
revert to the Civil Service System in order to take advantage
of the increased annuity under that System.
3. I would appreciate it therefore if you would take
whatever steps may be necessary to transfer my retirement
account back to the Civil Service Retirement System.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. James A. Noel
SUBJECT
Retirement Information
18 JUL 1967
1. There are a few situations in which an employee at the time of
retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would
receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Sỷstem, than
under the Organization System. Because of this, the policy decision has
been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive
a higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than eight-
een months prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from our system
and transferred to the Civil Service System. Since you will complete 37
years of Federal service in January of next year it is felt that you
should be advised of your retirement status under the Organization System
and also if returned to the Civil Service System. The following infor-
mation is being submitted to assist you in determining which course of
action you desire to follow:
8.
-
During the period from 15 August 1944 through 19 October
1946 there were no retirement deductions withheld from your salary.
In order for this time to be credited in counting total service
under the Organization System it would be necessary for you to make
a deposit, with interest, to cover this period. The maximum annuity
under our system is 70 per cent based on 35 years of creditable
service. If you should return to the Civil Service System in order
to receive the maximum annuity it would be necessary for you to make
a deposit, with interest, to cover that period for which no contri-
butions were made; however, you may receive full credit in counting
total service without making a deposit but your annuity will be
reduced by one-tenth of the amount due as deposit.
b.
As you are aware, you are presently entitled to apply for
voluntary retirement under the Organization Retirement and Disabil-
ity System. The annuity estimate given below as of 31 October 1967
would be applicable if a deposit were made to cover the period for
which no deductions were withheld. The annuity estimate given for.
31 March 1968 would be applicable without a deposit since you would
have completed 35 years of creditable service at that time without
this period of service.

1. This memorandum contains in paragraph 2 a recom-

2. Mr Hoel arrived in Madrid as the Chief of
Station on 21 September 1961. After home leave, he
returned to Madrid on 7 August 1964, for a second tour
of duty which would normally be completed on 6 August
1986. We have been advised that upon completion of his
current assignment, Mr. Noel will be assigned as Chief
of the DODS field office in San Francisco, California.
Since the officer now filling that position is required
to leave in early September for another assignment, it
is very desirable that Mr. Noel arrive in San Francisco
about 6 September. Therefore, it is requested that
Mr. Noel be permitted to leave Madrid on or about 1 July.
1986. This will permit him to take some home leave and
arrive at his new post in sufficient time to settle his
family, which includes two school age children, and
report for his projectod assignment on schedule,

If you were to return to the Civil Service Retiroment
System, you would be entitled to retire under the 55-30 optional
provision at any time after you have been back in that system for
a period of one year. The Civil Service Regulations stats, that to
retire under the Civil Service Retirement System an employee must
have been under that system for at least one year during the two
years immediately preceding retirement under that System. Therefore
if you should desire to return to the Civil Service System you
should submit a request to Headquarters sufficiently in advance of
your planned retirement in order to allow time for your request to
be acted upon and for transfer to be made effective, as well as
allowing for the aforementioned one year required by Civil Service
Regulations. The following annuity estimate would be applicable
in this situation as of 31 December 1968, assuming a deposit is

Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR
for the Period 31 March 1969 to 31 March 1970
Cecil J. KLOBUKAR, a career agent, has been primarily targeted
against the local consular community during this reporting per-
iod. For this purpose he has maintained membership in two
local organizations concerned with foreign affairs. More than
that, ho has been an active contributor to their programming
and has participated in most of their social and cultural
functionH.. This has enabled him to come in contact with a rela-
tively large number of consulate officers. During the past year
he has met, on one or more occasions, thirty consular members.
He is concentrating, however, on the ten consulates which have
representation in the denied and semi-denied areas. Within this
area ho is further refining the target by attempting to contact
the more junior officers who give promise of a longer future
career and a greater chance of being posted to an area of opera-
tional interest. To date, he has succeeded in establishing such
contacts in the Japanese, Finnish and Indian Consulates. In this
last case he has successfully passed the target to another Base
officer for further development and hopes to accomplish the same
with his Japanese and Finnish contacts.
In addition to this primary responsibility, KLOBUKAR also handles
a support asset who is targeted against the academic community.
He is directing this asset's efforts in the cultivation of two
promising leads one, Japanese and the other, Vietnamese.
Both of these cases are progressing very well due in great part
to the direction and guidance which KLOBUKAR gives to the support
asset.
--
KLOBUKAR also played a very important and direct role in the
assessment and intermediate cultivation of TWPARROT/1 and
TWPARROT/2 who were subsequently successfully recruited. He
is now developing a local QKWAFER student who is an interesting,
but difficult, recruitment prospect.
KLOBUKAR is cost conscious in the expenditure of operational
funds; he does not have supervisory responsibilities.

As has been indicated above, KLOBUKAR has been given a

little information or prior experience. While it has been
a frustrating and sometimes exasperating assignment,
KLOBUKAR has shown both initiative and perseverance in
attacking it; his performance has been Strong.

Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report for Cecil J. KLOBUKAR
for the Period 26 July 1968 to 31 March 1969
1
Cecil J. KLOBUKAR was the Chief of this Base until
July 1968 at which time he was assigned new duties as a
career agent, targeted primarily against the San Francisco
consular community. Until that time there was no specific
program¨aimed at the official foreign community. It was
KLOBUKAR's responsibility, therefore, to break ground in
this new target area. He went about this chore in an
orderly and organized manner by refining the community to .
those which were of priority interest because of their rep-
resentation in denied and semi-denied areas. He then started
looking for a means to get information and gain access to
members of this target group. To assist him in this endeavor
he recruited two members of the consular community, repre-
senting Latin American countries. Since their performance
did not live up to expectations, KLOBUKAR took the initiative
by joining three local organizations relating to foreign
affairs in order to enhance his cover and possibility of
direct access as a retired LNGOLD officer. By participating
in the gatherings of these organizations, KLOBUKAR is aiming
at direct contact with at least a few of the officers from
target consulates.
KLOBUKAR has demonstrated excellent initiative in pur-
suing as many avenues of approach as possible to this rather
difficult target.
target. It is not a cohesive community and does
not experience the usual mixing and contact that one finds
in normal diplomatic circles. It is fragmented and cliquish
and for this reason KLOBUKAR has had to show both imagination
and perseverance in probing for access to those specific
consulates in which the Base has priority interest. He is
now demonstrating his determination to get at this target
by exploring another possible means of approach of his own
device.
In addition to his primary responsibility against the
consular target, KLOBUKAR also handles one support asset
currently being used against a high priority student target
and three general purpose assets who are used from time to

Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance
to vary very much from year to year. He has continued to turn in the highly
creditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for him for
many years. He has managed his subordinates wall and has exercised uni-
formily good judgment in directing their operational efforts. Of particular
value has been his steadiness in the face of administrative adversity disrupting
the organization of his Base. Mr. Noel insured that the work of the Base
continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of
all details and report them to Headquarters as appropriate. It is a credit
to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparts exposure period there was not a single
instance of an academic-asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.
The performance of his officers atteststhe careful guidance and wise
leadership which has enabled them to operate securely and well in sensi-
tive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS are excellent. He is
appropriately economy minded. In short, he is a decidedly strong super-
visor.

Mr. Noel is an old hand at running Bases or Stations
abroad and his performance as Chief of Base, San Francisco,
amply attests that. It goes without saying that he understands
all aspects of the business, knows how to delegate, organise,
direct and report. He has continued to do all these things
woll. His seniority, experience and maturity served the Agency
in particularly good stead firing this period when the location
of his age was compromised in the public press, through no
fault of Mr. Noel. His subsequent and consequent actions were
all taken with sound judgment and appropriate calm and circum-
spection. Ho was also most receptive to, and cooperative in,
Headquarters suggestions in this matter. He is, of course, coat
conscious and an excellent supervisor. His overall performance
in that of a high order of senior Agency officers.

ization and management of the station and is responsiblo

and as the coordinator of U.S. clandestine intelligence opera-
tions in Spain. Accredited as the Agency's representative to
the Spanish Intelligence (AEM) and Security (DGS) services,

Mr. Noel has atly administered a large Station and has displayed maturity, good
Judgment and tact in the day-to-day management and direction of Station activities
and personnel. This has been achieved despite the physical location of Station staff
personnel in a number of separated office sites.
Under the direction of Mr. Noel a far reaching and fruitful major operational
program against the high priority Cuban target has been undertaken and Madrid Station
today is making a substantial contribution in good operations and good intelligence
information to the over-all Agency effort. Another notable accomplishment directly
attributable to Mr. Koel, and in part a reflection of his long years of service in
Latin America, has been his professional handling personally of the Station operation
involving Juan Perol. Interested CS components have stated categorically that Madrid
Station coverage of Juan Peron and his activities is essential in satisfying existing
intelligence requirements on Peronism..
Despite the Station's heavy diversion into Cuban and Latin American activities
and State Department policy restrictions on internal political activities, Mr. Noel
has encouraged the development of a long-range program involving activities against
the Spanish Communist Party and clandestine contact with the Spanish political
opposition.

of any given situation, evidences sound and objective judgment,
and works well under pressure. He writes lucidly, speaks
articulately, and exhibits a high degree of cost consciousness
in the use of government funds and property. His delegation of
responsibility to others is meaningful and well delineated.
5. Subject's performance has been strong throughout the
rating period. He has given the station purposeful direction
and competent management and as an effective supervisor who
commands the loyalty and respect of those whom he supervises, he
has succeeded in obtaining a maximum effort from the station
personnel. He enjoys the confidence of the Ambassador and other
principal officers, of the Embassy, several of whom have expressed
their appreciation of subject's work and commented on the value
of the station's contribution to the functioning of the Embassy.
The fact that the Ambassador arrived in Madrid with definite
prejudices regarding the Agency but was of quite another mind
upon his departure is testimony to subject's skill and tact.
6. Subject has conducted the Agency's liaison with the
Spanish services most competently, as evidenced by the rela-
tionship he established with Captain General Munoz Grandes, his
ability to persuade the AEM to undertake sensitive operations
in Cuba, and the fact that this liaison did not suffer following
the attack on the Spanish ship "Sierra Aranzazu". Marked
progress has been achieved in joint CE and CP operations, and
subject has developed QUANTUM/30 to the point wherein the
latter's collaboration far exceeds the cooperation normally
expected in an official liaison relationship.
7. In addition to his considerable executive and liaison
duties, subject has carried out the previously cited opera-
tional assignments with marked ability. He is a convincing and
persuasive agent handler, and his operational reporting is
prompt and thorough.
8. The only criticism I would make of subject is that I
believe the station should bemking a greater effort to develop
internal assets who will be able to report on and influence
developments in Spain following the departure of Franco.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chier, WE
SUBJECT
Mr. James A. Noel
Fitness Report Covering the Period-14 August 1961 to
31 March 1962
$
1.
•
Mr. Noel assured his duties as Chief of Station. Madrid on
23 September 1961. The Station, as constituted when Mr. Noel arrived,
included some 21 staffers plus numerous contract personnel, as well as
a two man base in Barcelona. The Madrid Station proper not only includes
the Embassy Installation but an outside operations section as well. Since
Mr. Noel arrived the Station has been launched into a Cuban operations
program of considerable scale and on a crash basis. In addition, in this
period, one State cover slot was withdrawn, and the experienced Chief of
Base, Barcelona had to be brought home due to a family emergency.
2. To date Mr. Noel has given every evidence of a particular ability
to cope with the crash program and the acute shortage of personnel with
Judiciousness and maturity. While it is too early, yet, to pass judgement,
there are indications that Mr. Noel has been preoccupied with Cuban
problems (an area of special interest to him) to the detriment of lower
priority but, nonetheless, necessary Spanish targets (for example, contact
with the local opposition and a budding effort against the Spanish Communist
Party).
3. As indicated above, Mr. Hoel has not been in place as Chief of
Station long enough to justify firm reservations concerning his management,
nor to permit meaningful criticism. Alco, as indicated above, his out-
standing noticeable strength to date has been his ability to cope with a

SUMMARY OF EMPLOYMENT
James A. Noel
:
From 1931 to 1944 I served as a Foreign Service Officer in
various posts in Mexico. In 1944 I joined OSS/SSU/CIG and from
that date until 1947, I worked in Europe and Latin America. In
1947 I again joined the Department of State, and served in many
posts in Latin America until 1966 when I returned to the United
States for a two (2) year detail with the Department of Army. In
1968 I retired from the Department of State and since then I have
been living in the San Francisco area doing occasional work on a
consultant basis for the Department of Defense.

1. This memorandum contains in paragraph 2 a recom-

"
2. Mr
Noel arrived in Madrid as the Chief of
Station on 21 September 1961. After home leave, he
returned to Madrid on 7 August 1964, for a second tour
of duty which would normally be completed on 6 August
1966. We have been advised that upon completion of his
current assignment, Mr. Noel will be assigned as Chief
of the DODS field office in San Francisco, California.
Since the officer now filling that position is required
to leave in early September for another assignment, it
is very desirable that Mr. Noel arrive in San Francisco
about 6 September. Therefore, it is requested that
Mr. Noel be permitted to leave Madrid on or about 1 July
1966. This will permit him to take some home leave and
arrive at his new post in sufficient time to settle his
family, which includes two school age children, and
report for his projected assignment on schedule.

Mr. John F. Blake
Director of Personnel
Central Intelligence Agenoy
Washington, D.C., 20505
Dear Mr. Blake:
I am writing to you personally and directly at the
suggestion of my old friend and new neighbor, Don
Marelius.
As the records will show I retired in the spring o
1971 after 40 years of Federal service 27 or which
with the Agency and predecessor organizations.
At the time of my retirement a small ceremony was
held presided over by Mr Tom K., and I was shown
various items attesting to my length of service,
dedication to duty, eto. However, I was not per-
mitted to take these items with me due to certain
cover considerations which I admit have never been
quite clear to me. I was told informally in the
division that perhaps after a year the items would
be forwarded to me. It will soon be three years
and I have not yet received them.
st
I am sure I don't need to tell you how much these
items mean to me and what they will mean to my sons
in later years. Therefore I would appreciate hearing
from you as to the status of these items. I am sure
there are many other fellows in the same boat.
Anxiously awaiting your reply, I am
Sincerely,
James A. Noel-

.
Chief, CAS is one of the ablest members of my Country Team. He
has a profound knowledge and understanding of the complex Spanish
political scene, and scores of valuable contacts. I have a healthy
respect for his judgment, and fréquently seek his advice and counsel.
He manages his staff effectively and enjoys their respect and
confidence. Popular and well liked by his colleagues in the Embassy
and the Spanish Government, Chief, CAS is an excellent representative
of our Government.
Chief, CAS is prudent and discreet, and I have complete confidence
in him. He is a man of few words but when he expresses himself, he
does so in a meaningful way.
A gifted analyst with an incredibly deep grasp of the complicated
Spanish mentality, Chier, CAS' assessment and opinions are highly
valued by me and the members of my Country Team.
Chief, CAS and his associates have been most cooperative at all
times, and have provided me with excellent support. I regard their
operation superior in every respect which is a compliment to Chief,
CAS' skillful leadership and direction.
Chief, CAS' wife is an attractive American lady who is an asset
to her husband. She takes an active part in community affairs.

I
Dear Tom
I am taking advantage of Gene's coming
visit to Washington to send you this little
note.
We will be moving to the San Diego area
the end of this month and hoped to be settled
into our new home there by the time mid-
September rolls around.
→
Tom, you will recall that at the time of
my retirement you presented me with a letter.
from Dick, a certificate of service, and (I
understood) a silver medallion. All of these
items were then returned to be safely stored
away until some future date- not specified.
I am sure you can appreciate that these items
mean an awful lot to me - and eventually will
mean a lot to my two sons. I realize and
appreciate the need, because of cover reasons
for discretion with respect to displaying these
items to friends, etc. At the same time I
realize that as the years pass the chances of
these items getting "lost" or falling between
the chairs back home is very good. I do not
want to lose them and it goes without saying
that I would honor any restrictions that might
be imposed in the event they are sent to me.
The outfit in past years has entrusted me with
top secrets, with the management of unvouchered
funds, with details of sensitive operations
Surely it can now trust me to use intelligent
discretion in the safeguarding of these items
I write about. I would appreciate it Tom ir
you would take this request into careful con-
sideration.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:
SA/ADDP
Mr. James A. Noel
14 September 1971
1. Mr. James Noel was uninterruptedly
employed by the Department of State from 1931
to 1968 From 1931 to 1944 Mr. Noel was a bona
fide Foreign Service Officer. Since 1944 his
7
15
Department of State employment was in cover status
while he was with OSS SSU, CIG and CIA. He
ostensibly retired from the Department of State
in 1968. Until his actual retirement from CIA
In 1971, he had cover as a consultant for the
Department of Army. Mr. Noel received a 35 year
certificate and service pin from the Department of
State in lieu of the usual CIA retirement documentation
and awards. Mr. Noel retired under cover and
"
' continues to be administered in this manner
2. Under current guidelines, personnel
retiring from CIA under cover do not receive any
CIA retirement documentation or awards since this
would be inconsistent with the retention of cover in
retirement status
