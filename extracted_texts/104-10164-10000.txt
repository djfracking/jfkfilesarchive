1.
AMSNAP-3 reported on 11 March 1971 that the charges.
of sale of narcotics levied on Jorge ALONSO, the son of
Guillermo ALONSO Pujol (AMECRU-1), were dropped (no exact
date given).
19776
Jorge was arrested. 21 June, along with forty
others and charged with being a top figure in the heroin
and cocaine distribution racket.
2. AMSNAP-3 stated that he had talked with a friend
of his, Ray BARKER, on the morning of 11 March, BARKER
told him that he had spoken to Attorney Miguel SUAREZ.
SUAREZ is a law partner of Fernando FREIRE. FREIRE told
SUAREZ that Jorge ALONSO had been released because all
charges Hemming from the 21 June arrest were dropped by,
the authorities. Therefore, there will be no trial,
3. CO Comment: It is a sad day when justice can be
bought by the likes of ALONSO. The little man loses again
because if he were charged with an offense 1/10th the
magnitude of Jorge ALONSO's, he would be behind bars for
a long time, and To make it worse, Jonge ALONSO can nov. KP.

In response to your letter of March 10, we wish to advise
we are unable to provide you with any information concerning
for employment of Mr. Bernard L. Barker.
With regard to your concern for the safety of your daughter-
in-law, we are unaware of any cases of a former resident being
kidnapped and returned to Cuba. Furthermore, since it is assumed
Mrs. Moffett is a U. S. citizen, such a possibility seem
appears
mother too remote to just the apprehension expressed by her family.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Limited Release from Secrecy Agreement--
Bernard L. Barker and Eugenio R. Martines and
24
1974
1. In preparing the letter of 18 April 1974 (copy attached)
from the General Counsel to Daniel E. Schultz in response to Mr.
Schultz's letter of 9 April, I obtained from Ms. Chris Hopkins,
WH/COG (x-1325), copies of (1) a secrecy agreement (in Spanish)
by Eugenio Rolando Martinez dated 3 April 1965, (2) an unexecuted
contract (an executed copy cannot be located) between the U.S.
Government and Mr. Spencer O. Terteling (Bernard L. Barker)
and (3) a termination secrecy oath signed by Bernard L. Barker
dated 12 August 1966. Copies of those documents are attached.
2. After discussing the matter with Mr. David Phillips,
C/WH Division, I prepared the 18 April letter adding the socond
sentence of the first paragraph at the request of Mr. Joe Skura,
AC/WH/CCG (x-1948). After completing the letter, I coordinated
it on 15 April 1974 with Mr. Skura and agreed to send him a copy
of the final.
3. On 18 April I met with Mr. Schults. I questioned him
as to his intentions regarding the information he was seeking as,
in the Agency's view, clearly there is no connection between the
Agency's association with Messrs. Darker and Martinen and the
subject case. Mr. Schults-explained that he, as the lawyer repre▪
senting them, fouis obligated to know what they did for the Agency
In order that he can make the dotormination as to whether it is
#elevant to the currunt trial--currently scheduled for 17 June.
He mentioned that to dinty both Messrs. Barker and Martinos had
bean completely unwilling to discuss any aspect of their dutius
with the Agency. They hard buen reluctant to uven aukamwladge

has been cautioned not to delve too deeply in this matter however
since he may become involved with local underworld elements who
may take drastic action against him in the belief that he is
working for either the local [ODENVY] or the police. Subject said
that he is well aware of this possibility and is making very
discreet inquiries with the assistance of certain friends (Cuban
ex-policemen) who are bolita runners and who know that he has no
interest in their bolita activities per se except to learn the
identities of the two Cuban mulatto women. Subject said that his
friends, in addition to possibly helping him, would like to know
the identities of the two women sincee they would then play the
same number as the two women and make some money on their own.

Cuba) and has his home telephone number. During the absence of
AMBLINK/1 from the area the CI case officer will meet directly

MICROFILM
1. OPERATIONAL CHRONOLOGY
A. During the period under review AMCLATTER/1 was transferred
from the PW Branch to the CI Branch for future handling. Subject's
files were turned over to CI on 27 January 1965 and he was informed
by his PW case officer of his proposed transfer at a meeting on
2 February A subsequent meeting was scheduled for 8 February with
AMCLATTER/1 and the PW case officer at which time the latter intro-
duced him to the CI case officer. Subject appeared to be pleased
with this turn of events expressing the wish that he could be put
to more frequent use and be given a heavier work load. He said that
he enjoyed his 2½ year association with his previous case officer
but looked forward to getting into a new line of activity, pre-
ferably some type of PM activity or investigative work which he
claims to enjoy as a result of his previous police experience in
Cuba,
Bubject was told by the CI case officer that his duties would
remain essentially the same as they had been and that he should
continue his coverage of exile activities with emphasis on any
rumors of impending exile raids on Cuba.
B. On 18 February Subject was introduced to AMBLINK/1] and was
told that AMBLINK/1] would keep in daily touch with him either by
telephone or by personal meeting. Subject and AMBLINK/1 know one
another from the time when they both were working in Cuba and both

something to appear in the paper some time after that.
As I told you, the NYT is convinced there are three
related events:
a) The Wetengate affaire.
(b) The break-in at the Chalear Embassy.
2) An attempt to "beat up" FAS.BERG or the

Summary. Fulgencio Batista Zaldivar has an organization in
Miami which is composed of a small group of his trusted
followers. The main function of this group is in the field
of propaganda, Between $5,000 and $7,000 per month of
Batista's money is channeled through this group, most of
which is spent in support of these activities. On Batista's
instructions, the newspaper Patria will adopt a more moderate
line, including a friendly attitude toward the United States
Government and its foreign policy. Attacks on agencies of
the Government and support for RECE, with which the Batista
group is making an agreement, will be published in a different
newspaper. A Batista confidant left the United States for
Spain in January on Batista's invitation.

their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
association. Mr. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus,
in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the
Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and
Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions.
+
4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that if, as a result of the
discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider
it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his
needs, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current
oporations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
dance of current and potential Agency relationships.

Rivero opined that when this newspaper is established,

Source Comment. Followers of Batista ("Batistianos")
fall into two categories: (1) those who are directly
associated with Batista, are employed by him, and re-
ceive instructions from him or his intermediaries; and
(2) those who were formerly connected with his admini-
stration and, even though they are no longer directly
associated, they remain loyal to him.

items in which he is mentioned. Nembers of the group recom-
mend items to be published, and Guerra is responsible for the
preparation of a weekly report to be released to the press and

3. The finances of BAR are handled by Fernandes, with the assis-
tance of Saif. Batista provides between $5,000 and $7,000 (U.S.)
per month, which is used for salaries, propaganda and other
expenses and contributions. Following is list of some of the

At a meeting on 8 December Ruben Batista and Fernandes relayed
Batista's instructions to a group of his followers who are
exployed ia the news mouia. The instructions included the
following:
The newspaper Patria must take a more moderate line.
Attacks on agencies of the United States Government and
on emigres who were formerly followers of Fidel Castro
Ruz will no longer be published. The newspaper must
adopt an attitude friendly toward the United States
Government and its foreign policy.
b. Batista is pleased with the news program broadcast by
Kramer and would like to increase the program from one
half to a full hour. The expansion of this program is
not for the purpose of enhancing Batista's stature,
because he no longer aspires to return to Cuba in a
position of power. He realizes that such aspirations
would be unrealistic. Batista feels that the time that
will be favorable for the liberation of Cuba is approaching,
and he wants Cuban emigres to ge-double their efforts in
working toward the liberation.
7. Among others who attended the 8 December meeting were Arnando
Garcia Sifredo, editor and publisher of Patria, Alberto
Rodriguez Rotger, also of Patria, Kramer, Miguel Angel Antonio
Flanco Cortina, a member of Krmer's editorial staff, Saif,

Batista feels that it is useless to attempt to finance
a war against Castro with personal funds. Such ventures
are costly and the results are negative. Therefore, he
refuses to consider plans for military action.

community, it was decided not to incorporate AMCLATTER/1 into
the AMSERVE Unit but rather continue running him as a singleton
agent. It was also felt that he responds more favorably under
the direction and guidance of one case officer rather than as
a team member. AMCLATTER/1 has performed very well in his new
duties as refugee debriefer, and his debriefing reports are
models of thoroughness, if not of organization.

3. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1
conducted a total of 16 refugee debriefings and prepared reports
on these. Some of the debriefings required as many as four
separate sessions. In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten
operational reports dealing with information concerning the
Cuban exile community, the majority of these stemming from
contacta with Identity A. Two of these were disseminated.

1. During the reporting period AMCLATTER/1 has continued
to serve as contact point for matters “pertaining to Cuban exile
activities and related affairs of possible CI interest. Ile has
maintained his large number of contacts within the Cuban exile
community, contacts representing such varied sectors as exile
political leaders, officials of exile organizations, former mem-
bers of the police force, as well as suspected underworld char-
acters. AMCLATTER/1's close relationship to Identity A has
resulted in a number of reports which were of interest to other
Station components and some of which were disseminated. AMCLATTER/
is at his best when asked to furnish information about individuals
in the WAVE area who may be of operational interest to the Station;
he pursues such assignments with the zeal of a trained bloodhound,
combing his many and various contacts for information and rarely
coming up with a negative report. AMCLATTER/1 works diligently
and likes to be kept busy. It is preferable to give AMCLATTER/1
highly specific and detailed instructions, which he will then
follow to the letter. When left to his own devices he will at
times not use the best operational judgment, which is usually
the result of over-zealousness and expediency rather than lack
of operational know-how or experience.
8. In November 1965, with the increase in the refugee
flow, the CI Branch began using the services of AMCLATTER/1
in interviewing refugees of interest to this Branch and pre-
paring debriefing reports. In this respect he is performing
the same kind of work as members of the AMBERVE Team.

1. On 7 January 1966 AMCLATTER-1 reported the following
information concerning recent activities of Roberto ALEJOS Arzu,
wealthy Guatemalan emigre in Miami. AMCLATTER-1 got the informa-
tion from his 19-year-old daughter, who in turn got it in
conversation with Cristina ALEJOS, 19-year-old daughter of
Roberto ALEJOS, during a visit to the ALEJOS residence on 5
January. The two young women are close friends.
Att:
a. Roberto ALEJOS has leased his house at 180
Palm Island Drive, Miami Beach, to an unknown person
effective 15 January, for a period of one year. The
ALEJOS family will move to another house owned by
ALEJOS and located at 2395 North Meridian Avenue,
Miami Beach, Telephone No. 538-3148. This house has
been used as a guest house for relatives and friends
from Guatemala visiting Miami. The house is currently
occupied by Rafael CASTILLO Menocal see copy of his
card, attached], who is related to the Cuban MENOCALS.
b. CASTILLO arrived in Miami from Guatemala on
17 December 1965 for a two-week visit, extended since.
A close friend or relative of ALEJOS, CASTILLO is

wealthy, in his early 50's, well educated, and speaks
Spanish, French, Italian, and English. He is deaf in
his left ear. His daughters, who attended schools in
Brussels, are also well educated and speak several
languages. CASTILLO plans to return to Guatemala on
12 January 1966.
c. Cristina ALEJOS plans to leave for Guatemala on
15 January. For the past month her father has been
training her on his properties in Guatemala about which
she is to give him a report after her arrival there.
Her father is particularly worried about "his large
farm which is losing money. ALEJOS has indicated to
Cristina that eventually she will take over control
of all his property in Guatemala. She will stay with
the CASTILLO Menocal family for three weeks, after
which she will stay with her father's brother Arturo
in Guatemala City.
•
d. Roberto ALEJOS does not plan to go to Europe
this year because of the uncertain status of his
financial affairs. He often speaks of his concern
about the tense political situation in Guatemala and
the danger of a Communist takeover. He is also con-
cerned about his daughter's American boy friend,
Arthur GORDICK (phonetic), who has had some problems
in Guatemala involving the police. ALEJOS has forbidden
Cristina to see GORDICK, but she is not complying with
:his order.
2. Station index files have no traces on Cristina ALEJOS
Arturo ALEJOS, or Arthur GORDICK; nor are there any traces
identifiable with Rafael CASTILLO Menocal.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Request from OGC for Signed Copy of Bernard
BARKER's Contract
1. On 18 April 1974 Mr. Dietal of OGC asked if I had
been able to locate a signed copy of Bernard Barker's contract
which we were unable to locate a few days ago. The answer
was no. I took advantage of Pete Palmer's presence at Hqs.
on TDY to ascertain whether a signed copy of BARKER's contract
be
Station WH/Miami. Pete said with
'could possibly/at
certainty there was no signed copy at Station WH/Miami since
much of the material at the Station had been destroyed. Also,
since BARKER was terminated in mid-1966, the Station file
should have been transferred to Hqs. back then.
a. I passed the foregoing informaton to Mr. Dietal
who simply asked that I double check with WH/Contracts and
the Contract Personnel Division for same which I promised to
do and advise.

PROMISED GARCERAN THAT IF THE COUP WERE SUCCESSFUL, ALEJOS WOULD
ESTABLISH A CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE IN GUATEMALA WITH GARCERAN

3. GARCERAN SAID THAT THE PLAN IS MERELY IN THE "TALKING STAGE"
AND STRESSED THAT THERE ARE AS YET NO SPECIFIC PLANS, LOCATIONS,
OR TIMETABLES IN EFFECT.
4. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO GUATEMALA,
AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED A MEETING HE HAD HAD WITH ROJAS MARROQUI

AT CAMPO DE MARTE IN FRONT OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GUARD OF HONOR.
HE SAID THAT DURING HIS ILLEGAL TRIPS TO GUATEMALA HE HAD STAYED
IN ABOUT 11 DIFFERENT HOUSES. .
5. ALEJOS TOLD GARCERAN THAT, IN ORDER FOR HIS COUP TO
HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR SUCCESS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE HAVE THE
FULL SUPPORT OF THE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE. HE ASSURED GARCERAN THAT
HE HAS SUCH SUPPORT.
6. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPLY THE NECESSARY ARMS AND
EQUIPMENT TO THE CUBAN EMIGRES. RECRUITED BY GARCERAN. HE REVEALED
THAT THE LOCATION OF THE TRAINING SITE WOULD BE IN NORTHERN
NICARAGUA, A NECESSARY CHOICE BECAUSE SOUTHERN NICARAGUA IS TO
BE USED BY THE SOMOZA SCHECK FORCES AS A LAUNCHING SITE FOR A COUP
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICA. (FIELD COMMENT: THIS PROBABLY
INVOLVES THE PLANS OF MIGUEL RUIZ HERRERA, A COSTA RICAN REVOLUTIONARY
AND LEADING ORGANIZER IN NICARAGUA OF A COUP EFFORT AGAINST COSTA
RICA, ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL REPORTING.)
7. (FIELD COMMENT: A NEW SOURCE, WHOSE ACCESS IS BELIEVED
TO BE GOOD, REPORTED IN LATE SEPTEMBER THAT ONE CARLOS ALEJOS,
RESIDENT OF MIAMI, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING A LARGE QUANTITY
OF ARMS INTO GUATEMALA VIA EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS AND THAT HE
HAS ALSO BEEN SUCCE33FUL IN ENLISTING THE SUPPORT OF QUATEMALAN
EXILES IN MEXICO FOR HIS COUP, ALEJOS IS PROBABLY IDENTICAL
WITH ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU.)

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
DOC. MICRO ECLATTER/1
;
1. AMCLATTER/1 reported on 19 April 1965 that he had received
that same evening a total of four phone calls from an unidentified
party threatening to kill both his wife and himself.
2.
The first three phone calls were received between 1800 and
1830 hours whereas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours. The
caller spoke fluent English and used extremely vile language insult-
ing to both A/1 and his wife. The conversation during each phone
call was short and made no sense to A/1 who said the caller at one
point identified himself as Jerry WALKER when A/1 asked who was
speaking. A/1 has never heard of anyone by this name and believes
it to be fictitious. The caller also said on one occasion, "Ive
been hearing the things you said about me up in Fort Lauderdale."
Again, this remark made no sense to A/1. Re: Threatening phone calls
received by Jel- 251689.
3. A/1, when offered by his JMWAVE C/O the use of a motel
they use of 2160161
room or safehouse for the evening, said that he appreciated our
offer but was armed with a 38 caliber revolver and could take care
of himself. He said that his wife and 18 year old daughter agreed
with him about staying in their own house since they had fled their
home once before in PBRUMEN and did not intend to run again.
is of the opinion that the caller is & crank but has not ruled
out the possibility that it may be PBRUMEN intel inspired. He
said that one of his friends (IDEN) also had recently received
number of threatening phone calls from someone who spoke fluent.
Spanish but refused to identify himself by name.
4. WAVE traces on WALKER are negative.

2. ON 8 JUNE 1965, ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, A FORMER CUBAN REBEL
ARMY CAPTAIN WHO RESIDES AT 752 SW 4TH STREET, MIAMI, FLORIDA,
SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN. ENGAGED IN THE RECRUITMENT OF 60 CUBAN EXILES
WHO ARE TO FIGHT IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
RECRUITED TO JOIN THE FORCES OF DOMINICAN GENERALS ELIAS WESSIN
Y WESSIN AND ANTONIO IMBERT BARRERAS IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE
REBEL FORCES OF FRANCISCO CAAMANO DENO, AND ARE TO BE PAID $50 A
DAY FOR THEIR SERVICES. ALL OF THE RECRUITS HAVE A REVOLUTIONARY
BACKGROUND BUT DO NOT INCLUDE FORMER MEMBERS OF THE FORCES OF
FULGENCIO BATISTA. CONSTANZO SAID THAT HE HAS BEEN RECRUITING THESE
MEN FOR A RICH DOMINICAN BUSINESSMAN WHO LIVES IN THE MIAMI AREA.
3. CONSTANZO SAID THAT IN ABOUT APRIL 1965 HE HAD RECRUITED
SEVERAL CUBAN EXILES FOR ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU, A GUATEMALAN
MILLIONAIRE LIVING IN MIAMI BEACH, WHO WERE TO BE USED BY ALEJOS
IN HIS ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF ENRIQUE PERALTA
AZURDIA. CONSTANZO STRESSED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL COMMITMENTS
INVOLVED IN ALEJOS' RECRUITMENT OPERATION, IN THAT THE CUBAN EXILES
WERE TO BE PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH AN ANTI-CASTRO BASE OF OPERATIONS
(FIELD
IN QUATEMALA IF THE ATTEMPTED OVERTHROW WERE SUCCESSFUL.
COMMENT: ALEJOS' ATTEMPTED OVERTHROW ABORTED IN EARLY MAY AND THE
CUBAN EXILES DISBANDED. CONSTANZO HAD BEEN RECRUITED FOR THE
OPERATION AS A TEAM LEADER.) IN THE PRESENT RECRUITMENT OPERATION,
HOWEVER, CONSTANZO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRIMARY ATTRACTION IS THE
$5Ø-A-DAY PAYMENT FOR SERVICES RENDERED.
