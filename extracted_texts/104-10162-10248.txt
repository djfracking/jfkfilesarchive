CONCLUSIONS
After studying eight patients with Sickiscaia, the most important
observation has been the enlargement of the electric systole shown by the
electrocardiograms. This is to be confirmed in subsequent studies. Other
observations are the presence of the Heglin syndrome in the two cases pre-
senting the lowest hmoglobin level, the evolution with normal cardiac,
shythe in most cases. This phenomenon is present in the evolution of
chronic anemic syndromes and has not been fully explained yet.
