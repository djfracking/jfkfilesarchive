2. According to the 1963 and 1964 Checklists of Soviet Officials Abroad,
one Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV (201-121531); born 14 July 1912; wife Yelena;
A number 04877, was present in Mexico City since August 1962 as an employee
of the Soviet Embassy. The Checklist for 1965 lists one Ivan Dmitriyevich
OBYEDKOV (201-779495); born 14 July 1912; wife Yelena; A number 41970, as an
employee of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City since August 1962. Apparently
these two OBYEDKOVs are one in the same and although Subject's birthdate is
different we believe he is identical with the OBYEDKOV who served in Mexico City.
Recently a conversation was recorded on ROARC during which Subject used several
Spanish words and expressions. It is possible Subject acquired a knowledge of
Spanish during a previous tour in a Spanish speaking country such as Mexico.
Please compare the attached photo of Subject with that of the OBYEDKOV who was
assigned to Mexico City to determine if they are identical.

Forwarded herewith are Suasary Traces in SPA format on
Ivan Unitriyevich DYBKOV (201-779495) who is suspect RIS.
Paragraph 30 of the Summary is for passage to liaison.
2. Subject is not identical to Ivan Ivanovich OBYLDKOV
(201-121531). When Subject first arrived in Mexico in August 1962,
he was reported as Ivan Ivanovich and this error was not corrected
until May 1905; therefore, two Checklists carried the wrong man
PCS in Mexico. When the records were corrected, the Subject's
birthdate was not, and the same date was listed for both parties.
Headquarters records do not list a wife or other dependents for
Ivan Ivanovich OBYBKOV and, as far as is known, he has not been
assigned abroad PCS prior to the date of this dispatch.

10. PERSONALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was
not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the
exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV.
(201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy
Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another,
Subject was asked about methods of producing metal wire,
a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of
his having once worked for a wire factory.
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he liked to
listen to. He also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets..
Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage,
because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also
asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the
apartment. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can
of paint to take back to Moscow with him to repaint "the
Moskvich". Subject and his wife were both buying watches
just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears
that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

12. INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Mexico City Station considers Subject suspect RIS because
he appears better educated that his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other
Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on
equal footing with Soviet RIS officers. DERYABIN in 1955
advised LNERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him
as the name of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of
the MVD in 1951.
In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they
neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject.
(Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Dmitriyevich were seen by the
defectors and they did not recognize either of them.)
13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
There was no intelligence activity noted on the Subject's
part while he was stationed in Mexico.
14. NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
Subject primarily handled the main Soviet telephone and
took guard duty at the gate. Subject took messages for other
Soviets, notified them of meetings, and contacted them for
appointments with each other. He occasionally drove one of

of the Soviet information Bulletin in Mexico from
October 1962 to August 1964, suspect KGB. Subject
and KUKHARENKO were the best of friends for a
time, but then KUKIARENKO began drinking too
much and getting into various scrapes. Subject
frequently commiserated with KUKHARENKO's wife
over her husband's drinking, automobile accidents,
money problems. Subject occasionally used
KUKHARENKO's car.

OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO
CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS
A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET
EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR BEBER
OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEN OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS.
HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS.
DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET
EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. 4
2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A
LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING
ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD
AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILÝ A
KGB OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN INTELLIGENCE
AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT RIS, PROBABLY KGB.

reportedly helped the VISKO's daughter with her
arithmetic homework on at least one occasion.

10. PERSONALITY¿ CHARACTER¿ HABITS:
11.
Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he
appeared to be fairly well educated and was not subservient to any of
the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich
KAZANTSEV (201-028975).
(201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO
with her arithmetic homework. On another, Subject was asked about methods
of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as
a result of his having once worked for a wire factory (1).
Subject had a tape recorder at home which he liked to listen to. He also
occasionally went fishing with other Soviets (1).
Subject told "Boris" _paragraph 7c above in Moscow to build a large
garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked
whether "Boris" had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On
another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to
Moscow with him to repaint "the Moskvich." Subject and his wife were
both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. (1). From the above it
appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard/.
CURRICULUM VITAE:

28 August 1962
· 22 July 1965
4 August 1965
INTELLIGENCE AFFILIATION:
Subject reportedly had worked at the Serp 1 Molot
wire factory in Leningrad (1).
Subject, accompanied by his wife and son,
arrived in Mexico as employee of the Soviet
Embassy. Subject replaced Vyacheslav
Aleksandrovich YEGOROV (201-273431, /suspect
GRU/. (2) In Mexico City Subject and his
family lived at Tacambaro 4, reportedly in
Apartment 5 in January 1963 and in Apartment 4
in July 1965. (1).
Subject's wife and son departed Mexico for
the USSR (5).
Subject departed Mexico for the USSR (3).
Subject is believed to have been replaced by
Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN (no Station traces.)
Suspect RIS.
The Station has no real evidence of Subject's intelligence affiliation;
however, because Subject appears better educated than his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other Soviet guards, and
because of his apparent association on an equal footing with Soviet officers,
he is considered suspect RIS. It is further noted that Subject's predecessor was
suspect GRU.
13.
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:.
Unknown.
14.
NON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY:
In Mexico City Subject primarily handled the main Soviet Embassy telephone (1)
and also took guard duty at the gate (3), Subject took messages for other Soviets,
notified them of meetings, and contacted them for appointments with each other.
He also occasionally drove one of the Embassy cars on errands. He kept a ledger
of the telegrams sent out by the Embassy and notified other Soviets when cables
came in for them (1).

On 17 August 1963 Subject stated that he had just returned from a trip
with Valentin Vasilyevich BAKULIN (201-261813) (1). /BAKULIN is an identified
GRU officer. The Station has no further information on the nature of this
trip, nor any reports of other trips taken by Subject./
"
From 6 to 19 November 1962 Subject was in the hospital (Sanitorio
Reforma) in Mexico City. On 11 November he underwent a three-hour operation of
an unspecified nature. The other Soviets had to take guard duty with him in the
hospital, and it was stressed that one of the Soviet men should be with him after
he came out of the operation. (1).
15.
CONTACTS:
Subject is not known to have had any contact with non-Soviets during his
tour in Mexico, with the exception of an occasional visit to one of the doctors
regularly consulted by the Soviets. Subject's closest Soviet contacts appeared
to be the following:
a. Valeriy Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV (201-293945), employee in the
Soviet Commercial Office in Mexico from February 1961 to May 1964, suspect RIS.
When the ANDRIANOVS left Mexico they were planning to get in touch with Subject's
family in Moscow (1).
b. Aleksandr Mikhaylovich DENISOV (201-726491), Second Secretary at
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since August 1962, known GRU. Subject appeared not
to like DENISOV. It also appeared that DENISOV was responsible for reimbursing
Subject for the gas Subject used in KUKHARENKO's (see below) car (1).
c. Aleksey Nikolayevich GANIN (201-757775), known GRU officer who visited
Mexico 31 July 14 August 1964. Subject, along with other Soviets who were known
GRU officers, met GANIN on his visit to Mexico (6).
-
d. Sergey Semenovich KUKHARENKO (201-260831), chief of the Soviet
information Bulletin in Mexico from October 1962 to August 1964, suspect KGB.
Subject and KUKHARENKO were the best of friends for a time, but then KUKHARENKO
began drinking too much and getting into various scrapes. Subject frequently
commiserated with KUKHARENKO's wife over her husband's drinking, automobile
accidents, money problems. Subject occasionally used KUKHARENKO's car. (1).
e.
Oleg Pavlovich MOSKVICHEV (201-285090), employee in the Soviet
Commercial Office in Mexico from March 1961 to July 1964, known KGB. Subject
gave MOSKVICHEV his home address in Moscow (1).
-
f. Vladimir Nikolayevich RADVANSKIY (201-298171), code clerk at the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico since September 1964, known KGB. Subject is not known to
have associated with RADVANSKIY; however, Subject's wife and RADVANSKAYA worked
together in the school and children's camp, and RADVANSKAYA took over the camp
after Subject's wife left Mexico. RADVANSKAYA asked Subject's wife to tell her
(RADVANSKAYA's) daughter to enter the institute when she saw her in Moscow (1).
g. Vladimir Aleksandrovich ROMANCHENKO (201-727109), Second Secretary
at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico since August 1963, no known RIS affiliation.
When ROMANCHENKO was in Moscow on leave in May 1964, Subject told "Boris" (believed
to be Subject's brother-in-law) to send letters to him through ROMANCHENKO when
he came back to Mexico. Subject said that ROMANCHENKO could be reached through
(fnu) MURAVYEV at, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1).

Reference A reported the departure of Subject from Mexico on 4 August
1965. The Station now believes that Subject departed PCS, and that he has possibly
been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN, whose arrival on 14 August 1965 was
reported in Reference B.
2. According to LIENVOY, KARCHIN has been answering the telephone at the
Soviet Embassy, a duty for which Subject was previously responsible. According
to LICALLA, KARCHIN has also been taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the
Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties.
3. In addition, LIENVOY reported that on 17 August 1965 that "a new school
director" had arrived at the Soviet Embassy. OBYEDKOVA' had previously been the
director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced
indicates that she will not return to Mexico. The identity of the new school
director has not been established, although it may be KARCHINA.
4.
The attached Soviet Personality Report (SPR) on Subject represents
ɗf summary of Station information on him. It is noted that Subject is listed as
suspect RIS, service unknown. his previous designation as suspect KGB was based
primarily on his presumed identity with the subject of 201-121531, which has now
been established as incorrect.

h. Georgiy Stepanovich VISKU (201-243602), Commercial Counselor in
Mexico since July 1962, suspect GRU. Subject's wife and Mrs. VISKO taught
together in the school and seemed to be good friends. Subject also seemed to be
friends with Mrs. VISKO, and he reportedly helped the VISKO daughter with her
arithmetic homework on at least one occasion. Mrs. VISKO was planning to send

A full Headquarters

trace under that name turned up no information other than that originating
from Mexico City Station, which has now been re-classified into the new
file. We are puzzled by the fact that MEXI-1850, dated 1 September 1962, the
first piece of correspondance from Mexico City Station on Subject, reported
him as Ivan Ivanovich.
2.
A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case is not
satisfactory proof that they am in fact two people because of the difference
in years and exposure in the photographs. The pre-Mexico City traces on
Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying data.
It is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic
data on Ivan Dmitriyevich in order to firmly resolve the matter.

1. Douglas J. FEINGLASS has reported that the OBYEDKOV who is in Mexico
City is definitely Ivan Dmitriyevich, not Ivan Ivanovich as previously recorded.
(Source: LIENVOY tapes.) It is impossible to check the original flight maniffest
listing OBYEDKOV's arrival in 1962, since this has been destroyed.
2. OBYEDKOV also appears to be much younger than the Ivan Ivanovich
OBYEDKOV (201-121531) who was born 14 July 1912 and with whom Subject was
assumed to be identical. No date of birth is available for the OBYEDKOV in
Mexico City.
7.3. Subject's wife is Yelena Lvovna OBYEDKOVA. They have a son Vladimir,
born roughly in 1953. LICALLA photographs of Subject and his wife are enclosed.
According to LIENVOY, Subject's home address in Moscow is Moscow E-143.
Metrogorodok, Otkrytoye Shosse 26, Building 7, Apt. 69, telephone G3-72-34.
In 1964 the apartment was occupied by Boris Lvovich DMITRIYEV and Mariya
Borisovna DMITRIYEVA..
4. Headquarters is requested to retrace Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV and
assign a new 201 number if Headquarters agrees that he is not identical with the
Subject of 201-121531.

begged if someone needs help (getting a vehicle or when asking for a favor), but when
he decides to help, OBYEDKOV will stay with the problem until he gets results.
Although OBYEDKOVA seems to be more cultured and better educated than her
husband, it is certain that only (BYEDKOV makes the final decisions. OBYEDKOV
could be very pleasant, helpful and even kind, but it usually depended on his mood.
5. The only Soviet we noted as being friendly with OBYEDKOV during his tour
here was Rafik Nazhaf-Ogly ABDULLAYEV (201-808524), Third Secretary, suspect
RIS, probable KGB. When speaking to one another they used the familiar "ty".
We do not know the extent of their relationship.
4. Forwarded herewith is a photograph, date unknown, received from ROGWEN.
We have destroyed the Station file.

1. For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV
(201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS. He was not listed
on ROGWEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list. We assume
he has departed PCS.
2. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife, Yelena, served as principal
at the Soviet school. His son was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother.
On 23 October 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to check with OBYEDKOV
regarding a tutor for the child. They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming
for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with
his wife, decided on two times a week. OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his
mother-in-law. According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that
could tell OBYEDKOV what to do.
3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV
on 8 July 1970:
He is very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people" or
superiors. He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name
when he knows that one of the superiors is calling, "this is the duty officer" OBYEDKOV
would say several times. He often lectures people when they violate security regulations
when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even
