Subject's refugee processing
has been delayed due to the
fact he is under 21 years of
age and thus necessitates
special consideration and
treatment. It is expected,
however, that he will have

It is still hoped that
Subject's parole processing
will be completed in time
to enable him and his wife

Subject seems to be getting

made to enroll him in a

insisted however, that no matter how heavy the pressure became all
any field officer could do was to make a denial, plausible or otherwise.
Mrs. Geory suggested that perhaps SR, since they had originally recruited
WIROGUE, should assume such responsibility. (She is hardly realistic but
anything is possible.)
A second suggestion made by Mr. Duffin is worth further consideration.
He stated that WH has had continual difficulty in establishing contract agents
in business throughout SA. However, these countries tended to be much more
receptive to people planning agricultural pursuits and he felt resettlement
and possibility for livlihood would be much greater should WIROGUE approach
the country or countries of his choice with some agricultural proposition.
I remember WIROGUE-mentioned
chicken farming in the Congo. Such an approach in SA might (a) make him more
acceptable as an immigrant to that country and (b) provide a long term basis
to make him self-supporting.
that he had investigated the possibility of
I did promise to keep Mr. Duffin and Mrs. Geery informed of any further
actions taken concerning WIROGUE which would affect their area. It was also
at least strongly implied that either Columbia or Brazil might be the best areas,
though the final choice essentially rests on what country WIROGUE can enter.

Action for this cable (FRAN 1467) assumed by this branch.
Mr. Phelps on German desk said the only restriction on action at
the moment is how much money we, AF/5, are willing to put out.
Next, called Mr. Kallander, TSD, ext 3391. I agreed to contact
him again if and when we got down to facts as to just what documentation
papers we would require. However, he pointed out that it would first.
be necessary for us to clear such action, ie., putting this characters.
into a country, with the area desk involved. Furthermore, he indicated
that this may not be too easy a task given IROGUE's background, etc.
Once we get clearance from an area desk, he says we should sit down
with the area desk, TSD, and AF/5 to determine the best documentation
and method of resettlement. OK? fol Seininger ₤-3137

1. A dispatch had been prepared outlining the various administrative
and operational details pertinent to the WIROGUE project. Receipt of re-
ference B negated its value and we prepared this one in its stead. Suffice
it to say that all steps outlined in reference A were accomplished and he
was dispatched with the specific instructions outlined in paragraph 2 of
reference C.
"
2. During WIROGUE/1's association with the undersigned, the subject of
vehicle was raised by him. He stated he needed one to accomplish his mis-
sion. It was suggested to him that under the present circumstances in the
Congo it would not be wise to consider such a purchase until he has discus-
sed it fully with you and received your concurrence. If he did purchase a
vehicle after receiving your approval, then he would have to do it from his
own funds and not use funds made available to him to establish his cover
business. Obviously he has violated the suggestions.
3. While WIROGUE/1 was in the employment of RRDWOOD, there was a
communication channel set up between him and his family. This was an ar-
rangement with a letter drop in Sao Paulo. He would write a letter, post
date it, and give it opened to the Case officer who would pouch it to the
COB, São Paulo for mailing. Letters to WIROGUE/1 would come to a post office
box in Sao Paulo where it would be serviced by ALLAMETER-2 and pouched to the
Case Officer. We leave it to your discretion, as to whether or not you vish
to continue this type of arrangement. Nonetheless, under separate cover,
attachment A is a letter for WIROCUR/1 which was received through this chan-
nel.
4. I am cure that WIROGUE/1 will undoubtedly want you to set up a
similar arrangement through Germany for him so that he may communicate with
a female acquaintance of his in PRPRIME. We are not adverse to the idea of
his having such a channel, but only on the condition you are able to censure

c. Documentation prepared with accompanying cover story
to show that WIROGUR/1 is an Austrian and who has never had ODYOKE
connections, nor ever been in FBPRIME. (See separate cover
attachment A).
4. It is planned at this time to take WIROGUE/1 "black" to Germany.
There he will be met by the undersigned, given his Austrian documentation
contact instructions and letter of credit, stripped of any FBINIME clothing
or personal effects, and dispatched. He is to proceed to Leopoldville on
his own and upon arrival make contact. The cover assigment for subject is
temporarily left open, although he has been told to look into the prospects
of opening a photo or general repair shop. He has actually done photographic
work but the decision on this we will leave to your on the spot judgment. The
letter of credit for three thousand dollars is to be used to finance this
venture There will also be a reserve of one thousand dollars in a Swiss
account should expenses necessitate a greater outlay. This money will consti-
tuto an non-interest bearing, operational loan which must be repaid by WIROGUE/1
from profits over a period of years. All other profits after the loan is paid
off will be WIROGUE/1's.
5. A word about the manner of man with whom we are dealing. He is a
smill, energetic individual, who has displayed shrewdness, cunning, ingenuity
and inventiveness. He has a peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarka-
bly to nofarious and extra-legal activities. Excitement and intrigue are
important factors in his life, he relishes it and as a result may be a little
delicate to handle. MIROGUS/1 likes ordor and clear cut chains of command.
He admires the Prussian approach and as a result will take orders even if he
may disagree. It is important to him to have the trust and confidence of his
case officer If in his own mind he feels assured of this and is confident
of the professional KUTUSE type competence of the 00, he will reciprocate in
kind. He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he is
given an assignment which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world," but
necessary because his case officer ordered him to carry it out, then it is
right and he will dutifully undertake appropriate action for its execution
without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all actions. Ons
last thought which may be useful. Best results will probably be gotten if,
when given an assignment, he be permitted to accomplish it in his own way.
The latter is connected with his idea of trust and confidence.

:
1. The plans and development of the WIROGUE project have reached a point
whereby a summation of the progress made and the plans for the future is in
order. At this writing it is anticipated that WIROGUE/1 will be on the
Leopoldville scene on the first of December.
2. WIROGUE/1 had originally been recruited in Europe for a REDSOX operation.
He was flown to BPRIME "black" and underwent an extensive training program.
This included survival, small arms and other similar type FM training. After a
PM
year of such training the project failed to materialize, as a result subject was
preparing for resettlement in
South America. The AF/Division took interest in
WIROGUE/1 and after an assessment decided that with his peculiar background,
talents and general makeup he could effectively be utilised along the lines
cited in reference A. On 21 October 1960 the case was transferred officially to
the Africa Division.
3. Since that date to the present, every effort has been made to paycho-
logically orient WIROGUE/1 for this assignment and to prepare him oporationally
for its fulfillment. To insure the security of the operation, prevent any
identification with ODYOKE and/or KUBARK, and to preclude any unexpected
uncovery of WIROGUE/1's past which would associate him with his pre-KUBARK life,
a number of basic steps were taken. Those were:
- a. WIROGUE/1 underwent plastic surgery, which changed the shape of
his nose.
This and the

plastic surgery have altered him sufficiently to obviate any
recognition.

1. WIROGUE has received political recognition from the West German
government and is fully documented in the name of Georg Frank Sanders.
This was accomplished with the cooperation of ODIBEX on the basis of the
fabricated story stating that Subject is a Georgian who defected from
East Berlin on 14 July 1962 while with a tourist group. It was necessary
•
-
to acquire political recognition for Subject because this was the only
sure means to backstop him if and when he applies for immigration to
South America. A Fremdenpass would not withstand the investigation
required by immigration authorities.
2. All the South American Consulates in West Germany were contacted
with the assistance of CAMANTILLA in an attempt to collect information
which would enable HARVARD to select the most likely country to which
Subject could immigrate based on his personal preference, opportunities for
emigrants, immigration requirements, etc.

Consulate and begin his processing. Prior to having Subject take this
step HARVARD will require Headquarters guidance and thinking regarding the

This is borne out by the details of his

Subject can satisfy any South American Consulate that he is
experienced enough in electrical and mechanical fields to be
of value to the economy of the South American country of his
choice. Once Subject is admitted to South America, HARVARD
has no doubt that he can find employment if he desires it.
The ideal solution, however, would be for Subject to have a
firm offer of employment prior to his immigration. If KUBARK
can arrange this, HARVARD feels that Subject's immigration
could be practically assured.

Subject could seek employment
HARVARD feels that no South American firm would take the
chance of hiring him sight unseen unless he were a highly
qualified specialist.

HARVARD has not considered processing Subject for immigration
through a bona fide refugee organization-in-order not to involve Subject
with the United States Escapee Program and to keep from making a refugee
organization a party to fraud with the possibility of embarrassing com-

custody.

Subject has been in HARVARD's hands since 22 May 1962 and has
been costing us 100 to 150 DM per week, plus many hours of case officer

1. Iden was born in 1918, in Georgia, USSR. He enigrated to France
with his family when he was three years old. He was a clever, precocious
child during his lycee education in France and was frequently dismissed by
school directors who did not appreciate his temperamental performance. He
also attended several engineering colleges but apparently never graduated.
In 1939, he volunteered for the French Foreign Legion and was sent to Tunisia.
The occupation of France in 1941 ended his military career. He was demobilized.
and returned to Paris.
-
2. Subject claimed that he wanted to fight for France, but he did not
wish to join a collective resistance organisation. He decided to act on his
own so he joined a labor force being recruited in Paris to go to Germancy.
For awhile he worked in a synthetic gasoline plant in Boelitz near Berlin.
Later he was employed as a driver for the NSK. During this time, he began
his career in black marketing and document forging. He claimed that he forged
passes into and out of Germany and did it to help imprisoned Franch officers
to get back to France. It is felt that the ulterior motives might still have
been love of excitement and wish to make money. He also claized that he did.
not work for the French Resistance, although it was possible and probably
that they gave him orders to fill. He did mention working through intermediaries
and cut-outs, so its possible that he did actually work with the Resistance but
did not want to tell us. Eventually Subject was arrested by the German regular
police for his activities, and later brought to Berlin where he was interrogated
for several months at Gestapo Headquarters. Ha ended up by spending time in
jails and concentration camps. He was finally liberated by the U.S. Army.
3. After the thrill and excitement of the war years was passed, Subject
could not settle down to a routine existence. So ho joined up with an
acquaintance who he says convinced him of the necessity to make more money.
They decided to commit robberies. One was successful. Unfortunately for
Subject, the other was not. His friend was apprehended and confessed. Subject
spent the next five years in various rather torious prisons in France.

Ee was then paroled to his brother and was living near Marscillos.
He attempted to go into business using some of the inventions that
he had conceived during his confinement in prisch. His personality
and intense drive and self-confidence quickly gained a business
partner with capital to invest in a cinemagraphic color reproduction
system that was patented and earned decent profits for the two of them.
Subject was still or parole and tied to his older brother'e "self-
righteous indulgence," however. It was shortly after this that Subject
was approached by a member of KUBARK who was following up on Subject
as an ops lead furnished by a cousingin PSP. Subject was favorably
assessed and removed black from Franco because of travel bestrictions
imposed by his parole status.
•
4. The rest of Subject's career has been generally summarized
in DUR 57443. We are also attaching a copy of ECOA-21573 for information
on 'Subject's most recent activities.
'
5. Subject has been described as being very ingenious, observant,
shrewd, glib, and one who relishes intrigue and daring. The latter
play a very important part in his character. He learns quickly and
carries out any assignment without regard for danger. His drawbacks,
as enumerated by his case officers, are that he is headstrong,
impulsive and constantly needs new interests, has an ego that feeds
on recognition and triumphs, a low frustration point at unpredictable
times, would probably "fall in love" with his CO which would make
agent turn over difficult, and that he would be difficult to dispose
of if he becase disenchanted, i.e. Subject is a handling problem.

1.
Informal Character Assessment of WIROGUE
During the Period July 59-Nov 1960
2. Suggested Considerations for WIROGUE Resettlement
'
Phase
1'
3. Damage Report Contribution
•
"
1. The following observations and comments are intended to
represent an informal personality assessment and factors in consid-
eration of resettlement for AESPIC, now WIROGUE. It is based on a
period of training and handling prior to anticipated dispatch--early
July 5through late November 1960. These thoughts are based on
personal daily extended contact as trainer/agent handler with Subject
as a member of prospective cross-border team for implementation of
REDSOX Operation. AESENTINEL. One member was re-assessed operationally
unsuitable, which left a team of 2 agents
team of 2 agents, both of which Undersigned
continued to handle. It is hoped that this assessment may be of
some benefit to the AF Desk Officer, who requested it the day of this
writing. It is intended that Subject's demonstrated suitability for
AESENTINEL, an infiltration-exfiltration operation into difficult
terrain in the Soviet Union, will serve as a mechanism rather than
an end in illustrating Subject's general abilities and limitations
for the task at hand. An attempt has been made to present this
material in subject categories considered operationally meaningful.
Quoted passages in Part I are Subjects own or the closest approx-
imation memory permits.
22.
"
It is my considered opinion that the Subject of this writing
has the highest personal and professional regard for Undersigned. I
do also consider that, although thoughtful handling and self assured-
ness were prerequisite agent control factors during this case, Subject
did not cause an uncomfortable amount of special handling problems.
The senior Project Officer was Mr. Perry Crookham, C/DOD/DOB during
the training and holding prior-to-dispatch phase of the operation.
3.
Subject Background and Chronological Association Factors
Deemed Operationally. Significant
A. Subject is an approximately 49 year old eithnic Georgian
fluent in Georgian, French, German and English. Subject emigrated to
France with the remains of his family during the pre-Lycée stage of
his life. His father, a TBILISI University academician and intellect-
ual of some note elected to stay in Soviet Georgia, during which
period Soviet dominance in the West Caucasus was fairly well
solidified. Subject considers that his fathers decision was made of

an automatic weapon, while "the people were frozen solid", gathered
up the money and was away quickly. Subject said the scheme failed
because his accomplice went to the cache-site to get some of the money.
to spend before it was safe to do so. His accomplice was apprehended
and in time broke down and implicated Subject. Subject said he was
not bitter at his betrayer, but rather professed a genuine admiration
for French interrogation techniqués. Subject served a difficult
confinement of 5 years, and was paroled to an older brother in
Marseilles, as I recall.
C. Subject said that he began at that point to appreciate the
futility of violent actions, while opposing the authority of society.
He therefore attempted to go into business using some of the inventions
that he had conceived during his confinement in prison. His winning
personality and intense drive and self-confidence quickly gained him a
business partner with capital to invest in a cinematographic color
reproduction system that was pattened and earned decent profits for the
venture. Subject was still on parole and tied to his older brother
"self-righteous indulgence", however. It was shortly after this that
Subject was approached by a member of the AIS who was following up on
Subject as an ops lead furnished by a cousin in the US who was a
moderately successful lawyer, and who had been long since recruited as
an agent spotter for eithnic Georgians. Subject was favorably assessed
and removed back from France, because of travel restrictions imposed
under his parole status. I believe that this opportunity rekindled
his old feelings of exhilaration and grateful enthusiasm for the
opportunity to perform his deeds of dring for an authority, sanctioned
by a national state, in this case the AIS.

It was during this period that Subject began to confide
regularly and in depth to Undersigned. Subject would often tell
Undersigned, "Fred, you must believe me, I want to do something.'
"I will do anything you tell me to do, only tell me. "You (meaning
the Agency) want me to kill somebody. Okay! I do it anyway you say,
I believe Subject was genuinely sincere, and that this was neither an
attempt to impress his C/O or a trust/assurance maneuver.

his own free will but which nevertheless disappointed Subject greatly,
as he greatly admired him, despite the fact that Subject's fathers
decision was responsible for the suicide of his mother, whom Subject
greatly loved. Undersigned believes that Subject's anguish in
memories of his parents was genuine. Subject was a clever though.
precocious child during his Lycée education, and frequently was
dismissed by school directors who did not appreciate his temperamental
though erratically brilliant performance. Subject, during this stage
of development, probably tried as hard as ever in his life to conform
to the rules of society, which during that stage of French national
education practices, would probably seem quite strict by American
middle school practices. Subject greatly desired academic/professional
'recognition in imitation of his father. These feelings were especially
frustrating because of his quick mind and seeming natural ability for
mechanical and electrical theory and principals. I do not believe he
ever has learned to consider conventions of living anything more than
a tiresome game to be played when there is no alternative. Subject's
quick mind, and early appreciation, recognition and adaptance of
guile did much to ensure the necessary understanding of French culture.
for moderate success in that country. Subject who is an unusual
looking man even by French standards, has no trouble in identifying
with the under-privileged elements of French society. Subject is
temporally bald, hooked nose, short, slender, bandy legged, wiry,
and of dark complexion but possessed of a dry, caustic wit eager to
laugh and contribute in the Caucasian spirit of comarderie to those
whom he considers worthy of friendship. Subject, however, makes real
friends cautiously, and has conciously established for himself
personality assessment criteria that would do justice to many success-
ful senior FI or CE C/O - agent handlers.
.
B.
World War II offered Subject the welcomed opportunity to
show his ability and ingenuity by engaging in black market affairs in
luxury items and travel documents in German-occupied France. Subject
would wistfully recount stories of his escapades during that period,
which, after really getting to know Subject, seemed to be entirely
nossible. Subject admired the Germans as "worthy apponents",
particularly their efficiency and ability to act decisively whether the
problem be tactical or strategic. An extended period of German
encarceration (until war's end) did nothing to alter his opinion.
Wars' end left Subject bored and unfulfilled. The excitement and thrill
of "the game" were gone and Subject's unsettled, numb confusion was
for quite another reason than most of Europes milling thousands of
displaced and shattered families. Therefore, it was not long before
Subject and a close friend from his black market days decided on a
daring daylight bank robbery in one of the suburban centers of France.
Subject contends he planned the robbery from start to finish, and
needed only someone to help. Subject and his accomplice carefully
cased a bank, stole a heavy truck and during the height of the business
day backed the truck full speed in reverse through the large street
level plate glass window. Subject said he hopped out of the truck with

really wants. To bet of my recollection, Subject thought highly
of Monty Love (T), the C/O that helped pitch him and who brought
him out Black from France.
Monty was to go to one of the German
Stations or bases the last time I saw him in late 1959.

Damage Report Contribution
A. The following constitutes Undersigned's contribution to a
damage report that may well be needed in view of Subject's posture in
the matter at hand. It covers only that time sequente during which
Undersigned actively handled Subject.
B. This span constitutes:
early July 59 - late Nov 1960
C. At that time Undersigned was a junior C/O on the
AESENTINEL Project which was to be prepared and launched from the ZI
by SR/DOB, a covert site ops base in formerly in the District of
Columbia.
D. In early July of 59, Undersigned as "Fred" and
George Fill (SR. Staffer) as "Mr. George" met Subject and his teammate
"Al" who arrived at Natl. Airport, D.C. with their agent handler and
trainers. The group had returned from several weeks of survival
training in Alaska, and consisted of:
Subject
"Little David" (A)
Gregg Ross (T)
Mr. Gregg (A)
"A1" (agent team mate)" Big Al" (A)
Bill Rohmer (T)
Bill (A)
E. We drove immediately to a Safehouse in the Virginia
countryside and conducted training, holding and orientations from
that site until the operation was placed on indefinite conservation:
and ultimately cancelled becasue of the Powers U-2 incident.
-
F. Safehouse keepers were an elderly married couple
"Geof and Janie." There were approximately 6 DOB QP vehicles exposed
to Subject.
G. During this holding period another C/O and several agent
handlers were there on regular occasions:
Perry Crookham (T)
Myron Toloczko (T)
"Mr. Pat" (A)
"Ski" (A)

B. However, Undersigned would like to suggest the following
interpretation for whatever value may be in it. I suggest that money,
per se, is not the primary end that Subject is striving for now, just
as it never seemed to be his primary concern throughout his life. I
believe that Subject genuinely enjoys clandestine operations, at least,
his conception of clandestine operations. Subject probably would...
prefer to work for the AIS or possibly the W. German Service because
he has a genuine fondness for the people and many aspects of the
culture of both countries. The idea of legalized, or at least
internationally tolerated, "Spying" offers the opportunity to
legitimize, and thereby rationalize, Subject's that he is
protecting his equity in an important, unique, "professional"
category.
C. Subject, during the period of Undersigneds exposure, always'
considered that if he had money-fine, if not, then enough would come
his way from someplace to sustain him from one venture to the next.
Subject felt that the acquisition of money would be a by-product of
his opportunist, schemes and technical inventions in pursuance of his
main goal;-personal recognition for personal achievements and triumphs.
D. I believe Subject does not expect to be accepted in his
offer of employment with the French. Service, but rather to let our
minds jump to the next logical step-the full meaning of the result
of such an attempt on his part. Subject knows very well that he has
violated his parole and would be encarcerated on his return. I believe
his pride and the probability of censure and ridicule of family and
friends in France would disuade him in the final analysis.
E.
Subject is a most excellent chess player. I have never
won from him, nor have I ever seen him lose a game. I consider that
Subject has thought this line of action out thoroughly. It. is
apparent that he is willing to gamble his quit claim settlement on
something that I believe he has specifically in mind--possibly the
offer of new documents and identity in some third country. He has
always had a great desire to "surprise" everyone back home (i.e. Paris):
with new documents, a new identity, plastic surgery, etc. I do not
believe that what he wants is necessarily more dollars, but rather
for the AIS to once again help hem (as co-partner) to achieve his aim
of acclaim, success and recognition, possibly this time to family and
friends in France.
F. I do not believe that. Subject could ever be physically
intimidated. He lost half his front teeth to German interrogators and
the other half to French prison guards. Additionally, he does possess
a defiant spirit that sometimes comes through as sheer obstinacy to
friends.
A
G. If it is considerd worthwhile, I believe an attempt should
be made to locate a C/O locally who has handled him in the past.
C/O for whom Subject has respect as a higher echelon and whom he
considers understands him. I suggest that this C/O interview Subject
in an uncontrolled environment to determine what it is that Subject

appreciation of the situation, in field situation.
I. Probably prove to "fall in love" with his C/O, which might
make agent turn over difficult. This probably would be mein basis
for successful relationship.

the French Service if resettlement negotiations do not proceed to
Subject's liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-
ing tactic to gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his
resettlement claim. Undersigned considers this a quite valid
assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject. Subject probably
views this threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming
political/economic conflect with the French, and appreciates by now
one of the differences between the AIS and the IS of a fascist and/or
totalitarian state.

CONTINUATION OF

S-E-C-R-E-T
EGO-21573
By summer 1963 detailed South American immigration data
had been acquired. This disclosed that Subject's language
deficiencies, background, knowledge of the Soviet Union, and work
history were insufficient to guarantee his smooth processing
through the INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR EUROPEAN MIGRATION
(ICEM). Our investigation also pointed up the fact that until
Subject was provided with a detailed life history containing the
information required by prospective employers and/or immigration
authorities, he was not in a position to be resettled anywhere,
let alone South America. As a result, HARVARD's plans to process
· Subject for immigration had to be cancelled, at least temporarily.
7. A CABEZONE Stage I C.O. was given the task of preparing a
life story containing the factual information needed for the filling
out of job applications, to stand up under detailed interviews and,
if South American immigration ever took place, to satisfy immigration
requirements. This legend was given to ODIBEX Camp King representa-
tives who prepared a new political recognition interview story,
arranged for the removal of copies of the old story from the various
FEDREP files and replaced them with the new.
8. For the first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's
Subject's
custody the way was clear for a final resettlement.
Reiseausweis was renewed and he was quitclaimed and advised to
work and establish himself in Germany. He was told that nothing
more could be done for him and that immigration to South America
at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance.
f
9.
HARVARD has done everything to insure Subject a successful
future free from problems resulting from his "black" association
with KUBARK. Therefore, there is good reason to believe that
KUBÁRK will not have to become involved with any of Subject's
future problems. It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce
KUBARK with threats to reveal all. With his criminal background
he is aware that he can be brought to the attention of the French
authorities. He also believes that KUBARK's position in the FEDREP
is such that we have nothing to fear from any action on his part.
-
10. At the time of this writing Subject has a position as
He allegedly

receives DM 1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive
a percentage of all profits realized from the sale of any devices
he develops. He expects to move to Munich permanently about the
end of May or June 1964.
11.
HARVARD has arranged with CSB Data Processing Branch to
publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's documented name so
that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the
attention of KUBARK and appropriate action can be taken.
12. It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise
HARVARD of any inquiries regarding Subject under his documented
name or any of the names listed in Attachment C.

1. WIROGUE, former REDSOX agent candidate and African Division
agent has been quitclaimed and resettled on the local economy.
This dispatch summarizes the WIROGUE case from May 1962 to March
1964.
17 27
Subject arrived in Frankfurt/Main from the Congo on 22 May
1962. KUBARK's reasons for establishing contact were dictated by
the need to relieve Subject of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian
passport, the need to institute or suggest a course of action
which would encourage him to establish himself as a contributing
member of society and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo.
3. Subject appeared to be primarily a resettlement problem,
therefore, Orme K. DARONNAT was assigned the Case Officer
responsibility.
4. Since adequate documentation was a primary consideration for
successful resettlement, Subject was briefed on the relative merits
of the types of FEDREP documentation available. Although Headquarters
had recommended a backstopped Fremdenpass, subsequent discussions
between DARONNAT and MKTOPAZ FRAN representatives indicated a
Reiseausweis to be the proper document for permanent resettlement.
With the cooperation of ODIBEX Camp King representatives, Subject
was interviewed and granted political recognition on the basis of
a fabricated story in which he claimed to be a Georgian who defected
from East Berlin while with a tourist group.
.
"
5. The WIROGUE case suffered a temporary setback when in December
1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV), the West German organization
responsible for the internal security of the FEDREP became interested
in Subject and requested all available information. HARVARD briefed
OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case
whose name, recognition interview story, etc were complete
fabrications to insure his receiving political recognition and a
Reiseausweis. OCA advised the BFV that Subject was of continuing AIS
interest and HARVARD resumed its resettlement efforts.

Ich versteckte mich wieder und wartete ble sur Afbond.
Ich ging schließlich wieder ins Foot und schwamm nun..
der Klinto entlang. Ich mühte mich wieder die ganze Nacht
ab, ohne daß ich genau wußte, wo ich mich befand. In Morgen-`
grauen ging ich wieder an Land. Ich hielt mich unlichot in
einer Höhle verstockt. Im Laufe der nachfolgenden Stunden trs
traf ich einen Knaben von etwa 11 oder 12 Jahren. Von ihm
erfuhr ich, daß ich mich auf türkischem Gebiet, in der
Nähe von Kemal-Pascha befand. Da ich immer noch nicht
Sicherheit hatte, versterkte ich nich weiterhin zwei Tage.
Der Hot gehorchend, näherte ich mich schließlich der Ort-
schaft Kemal-Tanoha. Hit meinen russischen Sprachkenntnis-
aen konnte ich mich den herbeigekommenen Personen nicht
verständlich machen. Man bedrohte mich mit Stöcken und
Axten, bis ich sie schlieblich überzeugen konnte, daß
ich aus dem run. Gebiet käme und um Hilfe bitte. Männer
der Ortschaft übergaben mich schließlich den militärischen
Behörden in Kemal-Paroha.
Dei meiner Flucht war ich lediglich mit einer Badehose
bekleidet. An den Fußon hatte ich Schwimmflossen. Weiter
trug loh oin Klappmesner bei mir, mit dem ich mich im Not-
falle vorteidigon wollte. -
Durch türkische Behörden kan ich nach Ersorua und von dort
nach Istanbul, in das Flüchtlingslager. Am 6.7.62 UÜbernahmen
mich U³-Behörden, die mich noch am gleichen ?ge nach
Deutschland brachten..
Das ist die Wahrheit. Ich bitte, mich als ausl. Flüchtling
anzuerkennen, weil ich aus politischen Gründen und aus
Angst vor Verfolgung meine Heimat verlasson habe.
Ich bin bisher noch nicht bestraft.
Wegen moiner Zukunftoabsichten befragt, erkläre ich, daß
ich auszuwandern gedenke, Be ist abor auch nicht ausge-
schlossen, daß ich mich in Europa niederlasse.

Neben der eigentlicon Pachausbildung erhielten wir auch eine
vormilitarische Ausbildung, in der Körperschule mit eingo-
schlossen war. Während der Sommerferien waren die Studenten
melot auf einer Kolchose beschäftigt, un so an der Borgung
der Ernte mitzuhelfen.
In Frühjahr 1938 hatte ich meine Abschlußprüfung. Ich bestand
diose und erhielt mein Diplom.
Schon von der Lehranstalt wurden und Arbeitsplätze zugewiesen.

in Reparatur-echnische Station undenant wurde. Hein Arbeits-
plats befand cich in Zschakaja.
Am 28. August 1941 wurde ich zur russischen Armee eingezogen.
Ich kam nach Baku. Es handelte sich um eine Flakeinheit, die
in der Daljanskiji Kaserne untergebracht war. Nach meinor
sweimonatigen Grundausbildung wurde ich als Kraftfahrer ausge
bildet.
Zum Schluß meiner Dienstseit war ich Fahrer des Divisionekoaman
dours, Oberstleutnant GURGENIDS8.

Dienstgrad habe ich auch 1946 die Arnice verlassen. Be w

plats surück, den ich bis su meiner Flucht innehatte.
Fun zu meinen Fluchtgründens
Trotsdem ich in einem kommunistischen Land geboren und erzogen
worden war, begann ich doch schon frühzeitig zu verstehen, daß
für die Einselperson keine persönliche Freiheit bestand.
Es war mir auch klar, daß persönlicher Aufstieg nicht von
dem Talent und der Rechtschaffenheit eines Monschen abhing,
sondern von dem Audanß der politischen Betätigung. Ich erkannte
die kommunistischen Lugen, da die Wirklichkeit co verschieden von
der offiziellen Propaganda war. Während und nach den Kriege traf i
ich Monnchen, die wentliche Länder besucht hatten und ich war
in der Ince, Bruchstücke der Fahrheit über den Unterwohled
in den Lebensarten aus diesen Erzählungen abzuleiten, obwohl
alle diese Berichte sohr vorsichtig vorgebracht wurden.

Ich hörte schließlich auch noch wentliche Sonder, un mich su
orientieren. Kino feindliche Einstellung zum Kommunismus
würde immer stärker und es wurde für mich immer schwieriger,
mich mit meinen Redonsarten zu kontrollieren und diesen
Gefühlen nicht offen Ausdruck su verleihen.
In Juni 1962 kan cohließlich der Sicherheitsdionst zu ir
an meinen Arbeitsplats. In der anschließenden Vernehmung
wurde ich beschuldigt, ein langjähriges Hitglied einer
georgischen Widerstandsgruppe zu sein und regierungofeind-
liche Äußerungen getan zu haben. Obwohl ich solche Außerungen
bei verschiedenen Velegenheiten gemacht hatte und deshald.
schuldig in Sinne des letzteren Teils der Anschuldigungen
war, konnte ich fühlon, daß der Sicherheitsdienst nicht
genügond Informationen bosal. Ich verneinte deshalb alle
Ansohuldigungen.
Each lan on Verhör wurde ich in meine Wohnung entlassen und
die Auflage, meinen Wohnsits nicht zu verlassen.

dienst noch hören würde. Alle diese Umstände ließen in mir
den Gedanken der Flucht kommen. Ich lebte fortan immor in
der Angot, von Bicherheitsdienst verhaftet zu werden, Nuch
reiflicher Überlegung setate ioh no 25.6.62, also drei Tage
nach dem Verhör, moine Fluchtabsichten in die Tat am.

platz zu gehen, verlies ich die Stadt in Richtung hamtredia.
Den Zug getraute ich mir nicht zu benutzen, weil ich der

Kilometer wurde ich auf der Lindstrasse von einem Lastwagen
aufgenommen, der mich nach Samtredia brachte. Dort beating

“Subject moved out of HARVARD housing
during the month after having located
appropriate employment with CAMANTILLA'S
assistance. The results of Subject's
T.B. tests were obtained on 24 September
and are negative. He will continue in
his current job and concentrate on
further English study until December
when he will again be considered for
immigration to the U.S. under P.L.
86-648.
Through the assistance of MKTOPAZ and
ODIBEX, Subject received his Fremdenpass
and was interviewed for FEDREP political
recognition. Shortly after being turned
over to CAMANTILLA, who is assisting him
in his efforts to obtain local employ-
ment, the need for additional interroga-
tion arose. While his job hunt was,
therefore, slightly delayed, it should
recommence shortly. Due to the sensitive
nature of Subject's documentation
problem (having been previously granted
refugee recognition by another country),
HARVARD will continue to maintain contact
with him until the Reiseausweis is issued.
.
Subject immigrated to the U.S. 19 September
1963 without HARVARD assistance or
CAMANTILLA sponsorhip.

Subject immigrated to the U.S. 5 September

The initial stages of FEDREP political
recognition have been completed. Subject's
position has been legalized to the extent
that he is now looking for employment on
the economy.
with the assistance of CAMANTILLA Subject
commenced his photographic training in
Hamburg on 10 September. Upon completion

At the request of FOB/SAT, HARVARD
has been in contact with AMCONGEN FRAN
to establish most expeditious way for
Subject to be processed for immigration
to the U.S. Immigration is complicated
by the fact that Subject and wife are
residing in another country and for
security reasons must not be processed
at the U.S. Consulate located in that
country.
HARVARD continues to maintain contact
with Subject through our local post
box and is cabling Headquarters and other
appropriate KUBARK elements the gist of
each letter received.
HARVARD maintains periodic contact with
this family and continues to pay the
widow of IDEN 238 a monthly subsistence
payment of DM 150.
HAPVARD arranged for a meeting between
the local representative of CAMANTILLA
and an FOB/SAT C. O. to discuss the
possibility for continued financial
assistance to Subjects through U.S.E.P.
The New York office of CAMANTILLA has
brought to HARVARD's attention the
recurring difficulties which it has had
with Subject. This problem was discussed
with FOB/SAT and a summary of the
situation forwarded to Headquarters in
FROB 5827.
Resettled during the reporting period. Subject will not appear
on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless and until
some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises requiring
additional HARVARD action. In this event the case will be listed

2 The problem of backstopping of resettlement and
disposal cases has been carefully reviewed by elements of CSB
concerned including CABEZONE, KTOPAZ and CATHINK. In this
connection there is attached a copy of a memorandum dated 27
August 1963 from Chief/MKTOPA which outlines the current
situation. As will be noted MKTOPAZ has and will expand its
capability for procurement of operational documents independent
of the 513th ICG. It is believed that the present procedures
for backstopping of resettlement and disposal cases should be
continued. In theory an independent capability is desirable
but not really practical at this time. Creation of an
independent capability for backstopping resettlement cases
would require duplication of the procedures and practices now -
followed by Mr. Willms of the 513th ICG. In addition, we would
not have the advantage of hiding our cases from the Germans among.
other Army disposal cases. Furthermore, USAREUR has requested
notification prior to contact with any German officials of any
sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military
assistance--see USAREUR letters dated 7 August 1961 and 25 March
1962, attached. with considerable effort it would be possible
to backstop some of our resettlement and disposal cases directly
with German officials. It would be quiet difficult, however, to
prevent the Army from learning of such action which is contrary
to the USAREUR request.
= .
3. It is possible that the FEDREP will enact new
legislation on the control of non-German refugees. Likewise,
new FEDREP emergency laws may affect this type of case. We will
keep this situation under review and in the event the circum-
stances change will initiate appropriate action.

HARVARD has been informed that Subject,
under no condition, should be allowed
to return to Austria. ODIBEX is ex-
ploring additional possibilities for
Subject to stay and work in the FEDREP
without restrictions.
Subject has been enrolled in a 3 month
photography school located in Hamburg.
It commences in early September and is
designed to prepare students for taking
the examination for the masters certificate
in photography, a must for someone working
in this field in the FEDREP. In the interim,
Subject is studying photography on his own,

At Subject's request HARVARD made

Subject's move from Frankfurt to
Neuss in July 1962.
Subject and family are being assisted
in obtaining West German citizenship.
Subject's Communist Party membership
was discussed informally but at some
length with the local ODURGE chief...
Since the latter believed that Subject's
membership would, according to the strict
interpretation of the law, be ruled
voluntary, processing for immigration to
the U.S. under Public Law 110 has been
requested.

Subject has begun to look for an apart-
ment on the local economy. In the mean-
time he will continue to occupy HARVARD
housing.
Subject's legend is being rewritten
and when finished will provide the
basis for a more plausible political
recognition story. HARVARD hopes that
with the substitution of the new story
for the old, positive steps can be taken
for Subject's resettlement.
It.
The morale problem created by the slow
moving quota under which Subject is
registered for U.S. immigration has
required HARVARD to register her for
immigration under the Parolee Act.
is expected that Subject will receive
her visa in August or September but the
Parolee Act will be used in the event the
quota continues to remain unchanged.

:
Subject's processing for immigra-

continuing and it is expected that
he will depart in the near future.
Subject immigrated to CANADA 8 July'
1963 on ICEM ship MS ARCADIA. Case
closed.
Subject continues to study English
while his processing for immigration
to the U.S. under the Parolee Act
is completed. He will give up his
job in Ruesselsheim early next month
and return to Frankfurt..
Subject's processing for immigration
to the U.S. under the Parolee Act
has been deferred until December 1963.
Due to a change in the right lung,
discovered while comparing recent and
earlier x-rays, the U.S.P.H.S. has
requested the deferment until sputum
tests and future x-rays indicate the
condition stabilized or eliminated.
Arrangements are being made through
ODIBEX for Subject to receive FEDREP
political recognition. CAMANTILLA
will then assist in finding a job
and housing on the local economy
In the meantime Subject is taking
German language lessons.
Subject's life story has been
prepared with appropriate changes
regarding his defection in Ireland.
The story will be presented to FEDREP
authorities for political recognition
and Subject will be found work and
housing on the local economy.

Aims: German Economy
While Subject aspires.
to be a U.S. military
jet pilot, this is
from many angles
unrealistic. It is
believed that Subject
may, in time, be able
to obtain an aircraft
mechanic's job in West.
Germany and possibly a
commercial pilot's
license. This will
probably have to be
preceded by work as an
automobile mechanic
while learning the

HARVARD, at the request
of FOB, contacted AMCONGEN
Frankfurt to determine
the status of Subject's
visa application. It was
learned that the case can
not be written up until

Action Taken
Subject and family were
forwarded application
forms for filling out
and return in connection
with their obtaining West
German citizenship. Sub-
ject's new address was
pcuched BOB in response
to the latter's request.
Subject visited the
Canadian Consulate in
Cologne on. 30 May to
initiate arrangements
for his immigration.
HARVARD had briefed him
on this trip beforehand
in accordance with the
information contained
in OTTA 0710. He was
treated extremely well
and all went very smoothly.
It appears that he will be
able to immigrate shortly
after completion of his
Stage II debriefing..
At the request of Subject,
HARVARD returned several
of his original documents
providing proof of school-
ing.
While Subject's limited
handling by CABEZOVE is
being completed, BARVARD
has initiated the pro-
curement of the necessary
West German documentation
to allow him to remain and
work in West Germany. fie

CAMANTILLA who will assist
him in obtaining employ-
ment.

to the U.S. under PL-110
in January 1956. Since
all of Subject's records
were transferred with him,

MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITY:
A.
B.
Effective 10 May 1963, Arthur A. LIFALL, Chief,
HARVARD, became the Station Case Officer for
Project CAMANTILLA (See EGOA-19737).
A request for a provisional and full covert security
approval on the local ODURGE officer who does the
actual interviewing of HARVARD's candidates for
immigration has been initiated. CSA has already
been obtained on the local ODURGE chief. The
additional clearance should allow us to develop
an even better working relationship with these
officers than has existed heretofore, When received,
it is planned to brief both individuals in greater
detail on CABEZONE/HARVARD operations.
