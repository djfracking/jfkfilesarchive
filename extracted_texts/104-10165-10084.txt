US citizen, executive of an import/export company with extensive business
connections in Central America and the Caribbean. He makes frequent trips
to these areas, and has contact with high ranking military and political
leaders. He speaks Spanish fluently.
1.
The Government of Honduras (GOH) recently obtained a US$12 million loan
from the Central American Bank of Economic Integration for the expansion
of the Azucarera del Sur sugar mill located in Choluteca, Honduras. In
addition, the GOH has purchased two sugar mills, one in Brazil and the
other in Puerto Rico. The mills, bought at a cost of US$15 million e
will be dismantled and shipped to Honduras, where they will be reassembled
with the aid of foreign tecmicians. Also, another sugar mill is to be
built in the comtry at a cost of US$20 million; however, the Japanese
Mitsubishi enterprise will be the major stockholder, while Honduran private
businessmen will hold a minority interest. This is part of an expansion
and modernization program by the GOH with hopes of obtaining a larger
share of the world's sugar market.
The GCE is somewhat concerned with the infiltration through Mexico and
Guatemala of Communist agitators and guerrilla training personnel. These
guerrillas, mostly Cubans who remained in the country after they had
arrived allegedly to assist the GOH following Hurricane Fifi, are causing
growing concern as a result of several uprisings and invasion of private
lands by peasants in several parts of the country. The Cubans, who stayed
in the country following Hurricane Fifi and others who have arrived
clandestinely since that time, reportedly are training leftist militants
and sympathizers among the Honduran peasants. The agitators and guerrilla
instructors are taking advantage of growing unemployment and the overall
poor national economic situation to stir the peasants into activity against
the government.

The new military regime in Honduras currently is holding talks with
Venezuela and hopes to sign an economic agreement in the very near
future. With that in mind, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recently
sent a high level commission to Venezuela headed by Captain Armando
San Martin, Secretary of State for Economy and Commerce and by Attorney
Antonio Jose Cuello to bold discussions with high ranking Venezuelan
Goverment officials. Prior to the talks, the GOH recently sold to
Venezuela 25 million linear feet of lumber at a total cost of US$5
million. The GOH hopes to reach an agreement by which Venezuela would
buy Honduran agricultural products for an unspecified mix of cash and
petroleum products. In addition, Venezuela would support a new agri-
cultural production plan to be implemented in the very near future by
Fernando Montes, Honduran Secretary of State for Agriculture.
Despite reports that Chief Executive Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar Castro
has unquestioned authority, Honduran military sources have indicated
that Mario Maldonado, Agrarian Reform Chief; Lieutenant Colonel Mario
Fonseca, Director of the Military Academy, and Lieutenant Colonel Juan
Ramon Molina Cisneros, Commander of the First Artillery Battalion are
the real "power behind the throne." These officers, who profess a
strong nationalist ideology, are interested simply in the general welfare
of the Honduran people, and they are maintaining a "watchdog" attitude
to insure that no one, especially people in positions of power, uses
such positions for his own personal benefit. These officers are members
of the National Defense Council (NDC), which also includes the commanders
of all major military units in the country. Maldonado, Fonseca, and
Molina appear to be the "first among equals" in the 15 member NDC.

Businessmen in Honduras have reported that the economic and political
situation in the country, currently in a sad state of affairs, is bound
to become worse as a result of the indifference being exhibited by
President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano. On the economic side, the private
business sector is quite concerned about an expected government move
to nationalize the fishing industry. Some foreim firms already are
pulling out of the country and moving to nearby countries like
Nicaragua and El Salvador. Un the political side, President Lopez
has failed to name a permanent foreign minister since November 1974,
when Cesar Batres occupied that post. Ricardo A. Pineda is performing
those duties on an interim basis. The President also has undermined
Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of the leftist-controlled
labor unions. He gives businessmen the impression that he does not
know much about government; consequently, the situation in the country
has become very unstable.
Apparently, the regime in Honduras wants to emulate the current
Peruvian Government in failing to even consider elections at all.
In fact, the government, which is controlled by the military, has
three pro-left ministers in the cabinet. They are Manuel Acosta
Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga,
Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez
Cantor, Executive Secretary, Planning Board. At one time, Acosta was
the private secretary of the Mexican leftist leader Vicente Lombardo
Toledano, so he has been thoroughly indoctrinated along Marxist lines.

Naturalized US citizen who has worked and lived in Honduras for a number
of years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with
officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the business community.
[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
Horacio Moya Posas is the present director of Agrarian Reform in Honduras.
He is inefficient and lacks some of the necessary qualifications for that
position. In spite of his being a lawyer by profession, he is not astute,
is only of average intelligence, is far from decisive, and frequently
vacillates when called upon to make decisions. He is, however, extremely
anti-Communist. His deputy director is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset.
He has no outgoing personality whatsoever, and in fact, he is rather
innocuous. One thing that can be said in his favor is that he is reported:
to be a good engineer,
The previoss Agrarian Reform director was Rigoberto Sandoval. He is an
extremely capable lawyer, very sagacious, intelligent and he displayed
great foresight in that position. His present and future course of life
is worth observing closely because a possibility does exist that he may
be a candidate for an important political position in the not too distant
future. To date Sandoval has not mentioned which political position he
plans to seek. Another reason for observing his is that he is exceedingly
anti-US.
8. If Sandoval does decide to seek a political office, it would most probably
be General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who would sponsor him.
Early in October 1972 a US importer-exporter received a very pleasant
personal letter from Rigoberto Sandoval. By the tone of the letter one
would judge that a close relationship has existed between them for some
time. Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and that for the present
his stay there was for an indefinite period. He enclosed a long list of
items which he requested the US importer-exporter to send to him immediately:
if at all possible. The list consisted mostly of furniture, household
furnishings, electrical appliances, etc.

Labor is better organized in the northern part of Honduras than anywhere
else in that country. It has a headquarters in every city where adminis-
trative activities are conducted and where meetings of union leaders are
held. So far meetings have not taken place at work centers.
13. Transactions between labor and the government are carried out by labor
delegates Celio Gonzalez, through the Ministry of Labor, never directly.
6. Labor, as such, does not subscribe to any one particular political party.
The Marxist theories do not appear to appeal to Labor Unions. However,
many of their members do seem to be leaning towards the Liberal Party.
7. On the surface Labor Unions' actions in Honduras appear to be demagogic
at times. They make demands on the government, industry and businesses
in spite of their knowing that their demands may prove to be harmful to
the economy of their country. It would be rather unfair to always hold
the Honduran Union Leaders responsible for this demagogism, because
frequently the union members themselves are guilty of pressuring their
leaders to execute some specific demand, even though they had already
been warned of the possible baraful effects.

Honduran merchants, industrialists and some of the people have been urging
the revival of the Central American Common Market (CACM). To all intents.
and purposes it has been practically non-existent. Salvadorians and
Guatemalans have also expressed the same desire.

In early October 1972, these urgings were taken into consideration by the
Secretaryship of Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) (Secretaria
Permanente de Integracion Economica Centro Americana). SIECA appointed a
president, and a board of directors was selected. Eduardo Ortes Colindres,
a Honduran lawyer was named president. General Somoza of Nicaragua and
General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano approved the appointment of Eduardo Ortes
Colindres so much that they offered to aid him in revitalizing the CACM.
The board is composed of members from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica and Honduras. They are authorized to represent their countries
in all matters pertaining to the CACM.
It is interesting to note that in spite of Honduras having informally re-
tired from the CACM, not only is the president a Honduran, but so is the
president of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE),
with headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The fact that General Samoza
of Nicaragua and General Lopez Arellano of Honduras have volunteered their
assistance to Eduardo Ortes Colindres has led most of the Central Americans
to believe that the CACM can once again be made active. If this does occur,
it would indeed be most beneficial to the Central American countries
concerned.

Xaturalized US citizen, an engineer who has worked and lived in Honduras.
He maintains contact with high ranking Honduran Government and business
Leaders and travels frequently to that country.
[This report was developed by an Arty representative assigned to the
office of preparation.j
1. I have recently had the opportunity to spend an evening with Rigoberto
Sandoval, who as the General Secretary, Planification Board, is respon-
sible for agrarian reform within the Republic of Honduras. He told me
the following information:
2. Sandoval is making a trip to West Germany and possibly other zon-Communist
European countries in on attempt to procure technical assistance, credit
and other unspecified help for the Enduran agrarian reform program. He
feels it is in the best interests of Honduras to turn to countries other
than the US for assistance. He claimed the US is now in decline; that
she is both unable and unwilling to fulfill her international obligations,
particularly within Latin America, and that she is slow to react and
bogged down with bureaucratic red tape. Sandoval also suspicions that
the Peace Corps, initially very beneficial to Hor.duras, is a tool of the
CIA.
3. Sandoval considers himself to be the enemy of foreign businesses, particularly
American, as they are holding large amounts of property which should figure
in the agrarian reforn movement. He did not mention plans tɔ appropriate
foreign land holdings however.
4.
Sandoval has not heard President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano personally claim
interest in another term. The feeling inside government circles is that
Lopez will request a constitutional amendment permitting him to remain in
office for six more years without benefit of election. If this happens
Sandoval will resign. Although Lopez is behind the agrarian reform program.
his remaining in office would not be beneficial to the country.

An excellent report. I am sure OCI will
find it useful. It answers their questions.
Another reason that it appears that Lopez
plans to continue in office after 1971
is that he keeps the threat from El
Salvador on a high key.

years. He has numerous social contacts and business connections with officials.
of the government, the armed forces and the business community.
(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office
of preparation.]
1. President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano is interested in a second term. This opin-
ion is based on a growing consensus among Congressmen, Honduran business
leaders and the military that Lopez desires to remain in office for another
term. The thinking in these Honduran circles is that the lack of disclaimers
by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication of his "continuismo" plans. Ap-
proximately ten days ago Herman Pascua, manager of the National Railroad,
headquartered in San Pedro Sula, had a discussion with the President during
which Pascua passed the remark that he would like to remain with the railroad
as long as Lopez remained in office. Lopez made no specific rejoinder to
this but Pascua left the President's office with the distinct impression that
Lopez would run for reelection.
:
2. Lopez would probably be reelected with relative ease. He opposition Liberal
Party is divided internally and lacks both an effective ca didate and the
capital necessary to offer a serious challenge.
The power and influence of Ricardo Zuniga has declined drastically in recent
months. This is not due to any specific act but more to a growing realization
by President Lopez of Zuniga's dishonesty, ambition for power and his in-
ability to get along with some government officials and prominent military
officers. President Lopez was particularly dismayed at Zuniga's handling of
Honduran propaganda during the recent Honduran/El Salvadoran border war.
Lopez allegedly felt that the invective against El Salvador often mirrored
the type used by Cuban Communism.
4. Miguel Andonie Fernandez, a self-appointed presidential candidate, is an
honest, sincere and well respected man. There is a small group of roughly
ten Arab and Jewish businessmen in San Pedro Sula known as the "economic
mafia" because they control so much of Honduran business activity. This
group has taken note of the candidacy of Fernandez and has been impressed
by his honesty and sincerity. They will not support him however, because
they feel he lacks the political experience and popular base for a successful
campaign.

Naturalized US citizen who worked and lived in Honduras for a number

(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned

For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurans of
Never before have I seen the
different backgrounds and social position.
anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.
The feeling is not only evident among student and labor organizations,
but among sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and
educated individuals in the country. Most of them are convinced
that the US has the influence to exert diplomatic pressures on El Sal-
vador in order to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed
to do so. They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.
12. During conversations with several government officials they emphatically
stated that Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to
Selvadoran traffic. This is the attitude of almost everybody that I
talked with. This single issue has served to unite the country like
never before. There is a new feeling of patriotism which was lacking
before the conflict with El Salvador.
3.
•
The campaign against Salvadoran products has resulted in an incentive
for Honduran investors. I have had several inquiries from Honduran
businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for
consumer articles which were normally imported from El Salvador.
These individuals are eager to invest and establish factories in order
to fill the demand for products which were imported from El Salvador.
Honduras has been purchasing arms and ammunition from Portuguese and
Belgian sources. Some of this armament has arrived in the country.
According to a military informant most of the armament has not been
delivered, but is expected in the country before the end of the year.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Naturalized US citizen who worked and lived in Honduras for a number of years.
He has social and business contacts with officials of the government, the
armed forces, and the business community.
"This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of
preparation.]
"During early August 1969 a close business associate met with Colonel (fnu)
Coreccolli (phonetic) and members of the Honduran Army General Staff. Colonel
Coreccolli and members of the Staff were alarmed by the continuing reports of
arms and ammunition stockpiling by El Salvador. These individuals were of the
opinion that the armament of the Honduran Armed Forces was inferior to that of
El Salvador.
2. During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal
or illegal purchase of approximately 2500 M-1 rifles and an undetermined amount
of .30 caliber ammunition from US sources. He explained that the weapons were
needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of
hostilities with El Salvador. These individuals were considered to be a re-
-serve for the Honduran Armed Forces.
My associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the
US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments. As for il-
legal sources my associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered
the transportation problem. Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired the
weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an-
chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli
closed the meeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities.
4. Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval,
a member of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval
warned my associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreccolli, since
he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that:
this was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec-
colli. A few days later my associate learned that Ricardo Zuniga, Minister of
the Presidency, has been given the task of purchasing arms and ammunition for
Honduras.
15. Mauricio Hernandez, wealthy owner of a lumber mill in Honduras, visited the US
during the first part of August 1969. He told me that he was going to purchase -
two "combat aircraft" for the Honduran Government. He did not specify the type
nor the source of the aircraft. About a week later I had a telephone conver-
sation with Hernandez, during which he told me that he had been "successful” in

Cuban national, an engineer who has vorked and lived in Honduras for
several years. During this time he has developed social and business
contacts with officials of the government, the Armed Forces and the
business community.
[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
1. During the ridäle of January 1968 I had a lengthy conversation with
Moises Lopez Maldonado, Honduran Consul in Costa Rica and a leading
personality in the Partido Nacional (FJ). He is a very close friend
of Martin Aguero, leader of the Pl. Lopez spends about half of his
time in Honduras. He is an intelligent and cunning politician with a
lot of common sense. He is critical of the soft lines used by the US
in internal and foreign affairs.
During our conversation he stated that the next President of the country
would be a civilian. He doubted very much if the Armed Forces could.
come up with a suitable candidate. He gave his opinions about several
individuals with presidential aspirations.
"Armando Velazquez Cerrato has completely disregarded the
Party machinery. He is ambitious, but too individualistic.
He has no political future in the country.
"Manuel Acosta Bonilla present Minister of Economy, is capable,
a hard worker and a good man. His Presidential ambitions at
the present time are very subtle.
"Ricardo Zuniga is well qualified and would have support from
most of the influential people in the government who would
like to see him as a Presidential candidate. A hard working
individual, he is the right hand of President Lopez Arellano.
I consider him the best qualified to run for the Presidential
office."

1. I have known Rigoberto Sandoval for approximately eight months. As the

higher political aspirations. At least he does not show any outward

3. Armando Velasquez Cerrato is being handled by the government very
carefully. He is considered to be a dangerous individual. Sowever,

enough popular support to intervene in the goverment successfully.
4. Ricardo Zuniga, Minister of Presidency, remains as an influential figure
with President Lopez Arellano. Zuniga provides financial support to the
non-Communist student organizations who support his claims that the US
is intervening in Honduran internal affairs. In a recent confrontation
with an official of the US Embassy, President Lopez Arellano openly

the last two years. During this period he has developed social and
business contacts with officials in the government, the armed forces
and the business community.
[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
1. Negotiations are going on with Mexico for the establishment of a steel
plant in Honduras. The principal force behind the establishment of this.
industry is (fnu) Alduvin, an engineer with the "Banco Central". Alduvin
studied in Mexico, anis a very intelligent and capable person. Alduvia
was Minister of Public Works during the regime of Villeda Morales. At
that time he was a supporter of Brown and Root, a US company with offices
in the country. Though Alduvin was instrumental in granting several
important projects to the company he now criticizes it as another exten-
sion of "Yankee Imperialism".
.
A US firm, International Paper Company, has been selected as one of the
major stockholders, with participation of ADELA and the Government of
Honduras, for the establishment of the paper and pulp plant and for the
exploitation of lumber reserves in the country. The paper and pulp plant
is tentatively to be established at the junction of the Aguan and Mame
rivers. The area selected by the government for the exploitation of
lumber reserves covers approximately 15 thousand square kilometers in the
departments of Olancho and Yoro. The government is going to face a prob-
lem trying to determine the ownership of property in the area. I estimate
that it will take three years to survey the boundaries and to set land-
marks in the area.
Two access roads will be constructed to serve the area. One, "Carretera
del Projecto Forestal de Olancho", will connect the paper plant with the
forest reserves, extending from Mame to Salama, a total of 130 kilometers.
The other road will connect the plant to the coast, from Mane to the port
of La Ceiba, a total of 100 kilometers.

Americana Cristiana", CLAC, with central offices in Caracas.
viduals travel through Latin America with the purpose of familiarizing
groups with Communist methods of operation and spreading democracy. I
talked several times with them, and with people who had attended their
meetings. It is my impression, as well as that of others, that they
tended to create the wrong impression. feveral times they justified the
actions of Fidel Castro, and seemed to be anti-American in their line of
propagands. Certainly they did not do anything worthwhile to aid democ-
racy. These individuals claimed not to have any association with the U3,
and to receive financial support from Germany.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Cuban national, an engineer, who has worked and lived in Honduras for the
last two years. During this period he has developed social and business
contacts with officials in government, the armed forces and the business
commmmity.
[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
The armed forces are doing a splendid job in their civic action projects.
Their primary interest seems to be the construction and repair of roads
In conversation with a liaison officer between
throughout the Republic.
the army and other government agencies he mentioned that the only diffi-
culties they are facing in their programs is the lack of adequate equipment,
and the lack of cooperation by the Public Works Office. He told me that
in most instances the requests made by the army for the use of additional
transportation or utilization of existing equipment are disregarded by
minor officials. This creates problems requiring the action of higher
officials, who are given the impression that the army is the originator of
these problems.
2. Considering the available resources and facilities of the country the
armed forces are well trained and disciplined. During the latter part of
1967 President Anastacio Somoza and a group of other Nicaraguan dignitaries
visited Konduras. Several groups under Communist influence demonstrated
against the visit. I had the opportunity to observe the development of
the demonstration, from a meeting to a riot, from a vantage point. Despite
the fact that the army riot control troops were stoned and abused they
were disciplined enough to prevent what could have been a serious incident.
They did not attack or fire at the cob, as would have been the desire of
'the leaders, who incidentally always remained behind the mob and utilized
other people to direct and incite the demonstrators. The troops and junior
officers who were present during the demonstration were highly praised by
the responsible elements of the society.
If a guerrilla movement started I believe the armed forces would act
swiftly. A special counter-guerrilla unit is well trained and equipped
to prevent development of small units into large and organized guerrilla
bands.

2. During the same private conversation, General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was
quoted as having stated that it would be futile for him to lead a coup
d'etat unless there was hope of improving the welfare of the masses and
the general economy of the country as well; he firmly believes it would
be impossible to accomplish that goal until a charge in most of the above
conditions were met prior to any coup d'etat in which he would be interested.
13. Selected Honduran army officers have attended special courses at an army
facility in Peru since approximately 1967. Actording to an army officer
the number of candidates sent since early 1972 has not only been increased
but also each has been ordered to specialize in any one of the br..ches of
their choice. They previously attended the various courses given at that
facility.
4. The army gives an outward appearance of being in sympathy with the present
regime, but in reality not all the members sympathize with President Cruz.
In private conversations some speak of him in a derogatory manner, espec-
ially young officers.
3. A man who continues to wield a great deal of power in Honduras is Ricardo
Zuniga Augustinus, Minister of Government and Justice, also leader of the
Nationalist Party. Zuniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to
his being a very clever, astute, wealthy man. He always knows exactly
what he wants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character-
istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.
6. Zuniga's present ambition for continued power has forced him to feign
being a firm constitutionalist. That is, he is claiming loud and clear
that commitments made between the government and political parties must
not only be respected but must also be adhered to. Zuniga does not claim
this because he really believes this to be a moral obligation, or because
he is a fervent democrat. The fundamental reason is that he knows he is
the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, as well as having become
influential in the Liberal Party. He believes these parties are the ones
sustaining the present regime of President Ramon Ernesto Cruz in power.
Therefore, he calculates that through these two parties he can protract
the power he has today.
7. Today relations betwen General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not
as cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be-
lieve that this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez
Arellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant r'ationship would

d'etat
led by General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano should take place, and be successful,
Zuniga would make a great effort to settle any differences existing between
them. This might not please some of the army officers who dislike Zuniga
due to his character and the procedures used by him to obtain power.
8. Up to the present time the Armed Forces do not appear to be leaning towards
the "left". They are naturally desirous of improving their way of life.
The Air Force has recently organized a company whose entire net profits
will go to the Air Force for the benefit of its members. General Oswaldo
Lopez Arellano is investing in various industries and small private
industries. He has very recently established a company called Empacadora
de Carnes (meat packing firm) whose net profits will be for himself alone.
The Armed Forces hold General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano in the highest
esteem. This knowledge is based on his observations and personal contact
with officers and enlisted men.

1. The Honduran economy is in a deplorable state. Some young army officers
are urging General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano to lead a coup d'etat to dis-
place President Ramon Ernesto Cruz, and have offered to help him. Early
in October 1972 a government official and several young aray officers
stated in a private conversation that Lopez Arellano did not believe it
"advisable for him to lead a coup d'etat until most of the following
events took place:
A rally in the general economy of the country.
b. Improved diplomatic and commercial relations between Honduras
and El Salvador. This improvement would further a better function-

(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the

1. My work takes me to the rural areas in Honduras where I have opportunity
to talk with the peasants. It is my considered opinion, based on per-
sonal observations, that the peasants in the rural areas are bitter and
disgusted with their lot. They have little or no faith left in anyone.
Economically, their condition is second only to Haiti, in comparison with
the countries in the Caribbean. The prices of staples compare with
aprices: in the US, but Honduran wages are far below US wages. Unemploy-
ment is a very grave problem. My company hires unskilled labor but does
*not need more than 200. We have had to refuse hundreds who applied
because we had no need for them. A small fraction of those turned back
will be able to find work, the rest will remain unemployed.
:
There is little economic development in the country and almost complete
lack of initiative and vigor. Seldom is a ran found in Government or
industry who is not afflicted with the two major vices among this cement.
of the population: vine and women. The economic inactivity at times
appears to be the result of indifference, other times the result of
intentional delays by Communist infiltrators in Government. As an ex-
ample of this "lack of initiative" I will make reference to the road in
the Olancho area. The loan for this 110 kilometers of road was approved
in October 1963. The road is badly needed to move agricultural products
from this region, to provide employment for hundreds of needy people;
and to provide the only access for the construction of a US$ 20 million
pulp and paper plant in the area. Until the summer of 1967, these funds
remnined” idle. Preliminary studies were not even made. With luck,
construction may commence in 1963, but by this time payments on the
"principal and interest are due to start.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
Cuban national, an engineer, who has worked and lived in Honduras for the
past two years. During this period he has developed social and business
contacts with officials in government, the Armed Forces and the business
community.
(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the
office of preparation.]
1. Ricardo Zuniga, Ministry of Presidency, is the hardest working man in the
Hondurm Government. He enjoys his liquor as well as any other official
in government, and when he goes on a drinking spree it may last for days.
However, he has a great capacity for work and lately he has cut down on
his drinking. He is too intent in his presidential aspirations. Presi-
dent Lopez Arellano has left the administration of government to Ricardo
Zuniga. Zuniga's trusted man is lucas Lozano Zelaya, Procurador General
(Attorney General).
There are two others who have designs on the presidency, Mario Rivera
Lopez, President of Congress, and Colonel Armando Velesquez Cerrato,
Hondurɛ Ambassador to Mexico. Rivera Lopez' chances are very small,
but Colonel Velasquez is a very serious contender. Both Zuniga and
Lopez Arellano are fully aware of his strength. Even though Colonel
Cerrato has publicly denied that be is behind the pro-Cerrato committees
being formed within the National Party, I am informed that he is in fact
supporting them.

Luis---I attempted to get a reaction
from the analyst regarding the
information in paragraph 2. Unfortur els
there is a new analyst for Honduras
who is now a way on vacation and he
left no second who understands the
situation in Honduras. So rather than
hold on to this report--I am returning
*- with no response from the analyst.
