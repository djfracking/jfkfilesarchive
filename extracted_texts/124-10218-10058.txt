The relationship was discontinued in July

says the relationship was "amicably terminated." Though he
was not paid thereafter, CIA continued to have accasional

agreement of termination was signed. The latest contact

Orlando Bosch
a.
Involvement in Crash: As noted above, Bosch was
arrested in Venezuela for alleged involvement in the Cubana
crash. In late June, a CIA source reported that an exile
group headed by Bosch planned to bomb a Cubana flight between
Panama and Havana. An FBI source has alleged that one attempt
was made but the bomb did not detonate. A second try occurred
in Jamaica on July 9, but the bomb exploded before the suit-
case in which it was carried was put aboard the plane

with the understanding that Venezuela would not be used as a
base of operations or place of refuge. Bosch reportedly promised
not to engage in terrorist activity while in Venezuela and
received a token $500 contribution from Perez. _ Another CIA
source reported that after Bosch's arrival in Caracas in September
he stated during a fund raising dinner that "Now that our
organization has come out of the Letelier job looking good, we
are going to try something else." A few days later, Posada
allegedly said, "We are going to hita Cuban airliner" and
"Orlando (Bosch) has the details.".
