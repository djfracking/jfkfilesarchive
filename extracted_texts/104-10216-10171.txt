S. It is recommended that the scope and mount be discarded
as unícasiblo. The Williams sight is acceptable although the
number of clicks per revolution of the knob should be reduced.
Purther testing of the underloaded ammunition should be con-
ducted to determine the reasons for the erratic performance.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Tosts of Modified Sights for 7.62 Bolgium (FAL) Rifle
REFERENCE: Namo for Red. dated 23 Kay 64, Subject FAL Silencers/
Sights, from C/E/SA/HOB/PH
1. On 2 June 1964, Hr. Donald R. Dunn, TSD/ED and the
undersigned went to Isolation to test a modified sight and a
telescopic sight developed for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) Rifle in
answer to reference a). The tests were performed with the assistance
of Mr. James Earb and Mr. Glen Winstead, Isolation.
2. The first tests were conducted with a Williams Peep sight
modified to fit an aluminum block which was mounted in place of the
standard FAL rear sight. The Williams sight has a larger diameter
poop than the FAL sight and has a wider range of elovation settings
as well as more positive control over both olevation and windage.
The main purpose of the test was to establish a point of reference
on the aluminum block to match the graduations on the Williams
sight and allow the sight to be set visually for the desired range
once the weapon was zeroed,
3. Firing commenced from 100 yards at a silhouette target
using the hood of a jeep as a rost. Eoth underloaded and full load
rounds were used. Light rain which gradually increased in intensity
during the day served to complicate the procedure. The test
[results at ranges from 25 yds. to 130 yds. using the Williams
sight are summarized in Attachment I. Exceedingly erratic results
were obtained throughout the tests and one attempt to duplicate
the 100 yd. zoro resulted in a different setting later in the day.

4. 1. 2x scope of Japaneso manufacturo equipped with aluminum
mounting rings front and rear to fit the rear gas port and rear
sight mount respectively then tested. The scope was attached to
the rifle with difficulty and attempts to zero it were frustrated
by the inability to determine where the rifle was shooting. The
mounting moved while attempti. to adjust the olovation knob and it
was determined that the mount could not be attached firmly enough
to insure in retaining a proper zero. The test with the scope
was aborted.

I
shooting in scope, found it moved.
At 100 yds., full loads
Raise sight 4 clicks from bottom
At 150 yds., full loads
Raise sight 8 clicks from bottom.
Intermittant vain throughout tests.
Cases with reduced loads were noted to be blackened at nect
after firing. Suspected to be low pressures not causing
sufficient case expansion to obtain proper seal. This can
contribute to erratic performance. Recommend gas port be turned
to off position to prevent action from opening and allowing
gas leak. Also investigate soft annealing case necks.
