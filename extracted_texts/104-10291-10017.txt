BRUCE BERKMANS
MAINWARING/FRENCH TELECON OF 9 SEPTEMBER 1976, SAME SUBJECT
FOR THE RECORD, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR BRUCE BERK ANS
REQUEST THAT I SEE HIM WAS TO ENABLE HIM TO REFER A POSSIBLE
APPLICANT FOR STAFF EMPLOYMENT TO THE AGENCY WILL INFORMALLY
F
RAISE THIS MATTER WITH THE PERSONNEL RECRUITER WHEN HE IS NEXT
IN THE MIAMI FIELD OFFICE BERKMANS HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST
IN THIS MATTER AND WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PLAY THE ROLLE OF A HELPFUL
INDIVIDUAL.
2. HE ALSO REVIEWED SOME PROJECTS THAT. HIS ORGNIZATION WILL
BE INVOLVED IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS 05
THIS DATE IT IS TO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE MIGHT HAVE ANY
INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO REPORTABLE INTEL
OR OPERATIONAL MATERIALS.
1.3. BERKMANS ALSO DISCUSSED HIS COMPANY'S APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE
PROTECTION AGAINST THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS
MAY BE STILL ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTEER
À USEFUL ITEM.
MY
4. AS NOTED EARLIER, SINCE HIS DECISION TO REFRAIN FROM ANY
LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AGENCY, HE SEEMS TOTALLY RELAXED
PERSONAL APPRAISAL NOW IS THAT HE WILL POSE NO PROBLEMS FOR US
IN THE FUTURE DESPITE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF A FEW YEARS AGO.

1. This will confirm our green line telephone
conversation of 22 June 1976 concerning a recommendation
that DCD contact Mr. Bruce Berckmans Jr. (201 309117)
a former staff agent under the LPGLOBE program Mr.
Berchmans recently telephoned an Agency staff officer with
whom he is acquainted, indicating that he had information
of interest and needed to talk with some one from the
Agency. Mr. Berckmans is currently employed by the
Wackenhut Corporation in the Miami area.
-
2. We discussed this case with Mr. Anthony Goldin,
Assistant General Counsel/DDO, who felt that a representa
tive of the Agency should meet with Mr. Berckmans to see
what he had on his mind. Mr. Coldin said we would not
be in violation of any Agency regulations or guidelines.
since Mr. Berckmans was the one requesting the meeting.
Mr. Goldin recommended that contact be made through an
overt employée (DCD) rather than through the LA/Miami
Station..
3. Upon learning of your two immediate intel reports
on 22 June, from private investigator sources, concerning
plans for possible assassination of Caribbean leaders, we
felt there may be a connection between these reports and
Mr. Berckmans' information. It is for that reason that
we suggested that DCD might want to, move rapidly on this
matter.
4. As mentioned on the green line, Mr. Berckmans'
address is 3941 Midway St., Miami, Florida; his telephone
number is (area code 305) 443-2260.
