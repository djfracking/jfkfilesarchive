PETER COHEN
SF T-5 has reported that on December 7, 1965, PETER
COHEN made the following statement in Berkeley:
"The struggle to build the American re-
volution is as much a struggle to save
the human race from nuclear destruction
as it is one for socialism. America is
not a healthy society. I defend terrorism.
Bank robbery is fine, but it does little
to weaken the government: it only outs
money into hands of revolutionaries. As
for the killing of President KENNEDY, shoot-
ing the President is a legitimate, left-
wing act of terror.

ACTIVITIES
SF T-2 on September 20, 1965, furnished a copy of a
printed leaflet issued by the VDC captioned, "The War in Vietnam
is Acainst our National Interest". The leaflet commented the
war in Vietnan was against our national interest because:
"1.
The policy of our government is now to send large
numbers of American GIs to fight in Vietnam. A hundred thousand
of our men died in the Korean War. We don't want this to happen
again.
#2. The war in Vietnam is destroving our democracy. The
American people rejected Goldwater's policies of war, but
President Johnson has defied his mandate for peace and has
escalated the war in Vietnam. Even though Congress has not
debated American involvement in Vietnam, it has automatically
supported all of the government's actions.
"3.
It is in our interest to have a strong United Nations.
Eut our country violates the UII Charter and weakens the UN when
we intervene in South Vietnam and the Dominican Republic.
"4.
Our nation's attention should be on ending poverty,
providing jobs for all, fighting Jim Crow, and guaranteeing the
right to vote. Our government cannot accomplish this if it
devotes its time, energy, and money to interfering in the affairs
of other countries."
The leaflet informed that to end the war, President
JOHNSON could do any or all of the following things:
"
11.
"12.
Stop bombing North Vietnam.
Call for negotiations with everybody involved in
the war, including the Viet Cong.
" 3.
"4.
Ask the United Nations to try to solve the problem.
Call for free elections in South Vietnam and let the
people there make up their own minds."

ATTENTION ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL
You may soon be sent to Vietnam. You have heard about the war in the news;
your officers will give you pep talks about it. But you probably feel as confused and
uncertain as most Americans do. Many people will tell you to just follow orders.
and leave the thinking to others. But you have the right to know as much about this
war as anyone. After all, it's you-not your congressman-who might get killed.
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING IN VIETNAM?
We are supposed to be fighting to protect
democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own gov‐
ernment admits that South Vietnam is run by
a dictatorship. General Ky, the latest mili-
tary dictator, is as bad as they come. In a
recent interview he said: "People ask me
who my heroes are. I have only one Hit-
ler. I admire Hitler because he pulled his
country together when it was in a terrible
state." (London Sunday Mirror, July 4, 1965).
--
General Ky doesn't mean much to us; we're
not even sure how to pronounce his name, but
the South Vietnamese have lived under men
like him for years. As far as the Vietnamese
are concerned, we are fighting on the side of
Hitlerism; and they hope we lose..
'WHO IS THE ENEMY?
U.S. military spokesmen have often said
that their greatest problem is finding the ene-
my. The enemy, they say, is everywhere.
The old woman feeding her chickens may have
a stock of hand grenades in her hut. The lit-
tle boy who trails after the American sol-
diers during the day slips out to give informa-
tion to the guerillas at night. The washer-
woman at the American air base brings a bomb
to work one day. It is impossible, say the
military, to tell which are the Viet Cong and
which are the civilians.
--
--
a
And so, because the whole Vietnamese peo-
ple seem to be the enemy, the military is
taking no chances. They use tear gas
weapon designed for use against civilians.
They order American troops to fire at women
and children. because women and children,
after all, are firing at American troops. Am-
erican fighter planes destroy civilian villages
with napalm; American B-52's are flattening
whole regions. That is why the war in Viet-
nam is so often called a "dirty war.
"
When the South Vietnamese people see you
in your foreign uniform, they will think of
27
you as their enemy. You are the ones bomb-
ing their towns. They don't know whether
you're a draftee or a volunteer, whether
you're for the war or against it; but they're
not taking any chances either.
FREE ELECTIONS
The Vietnamese would like to vote the for-
eigners out of their country, but they have
been denied the chance. According to the
Geneva Agreement of 1954, there were sup-
posed to be elections throughout Vietnam in
1956. But the U.S, government was certain
that our man in Vietnam, Premier Diem,
would lose. So we decided not to allow any
election until we were sure we could win.
Diem set up a political police force and put
all political opposition Communist and
anti-Communist in jail. By 1959, it was
clear there weren't going to be any elections,
and the guerillas known as the Viet Cong be-
gan to fight back. By 1963 our government
was fed up with Diem, but still wasn't willing
to risk elections. Our CIA helped a group of
Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and
kill him. Since then there have been a series
of "better" military dictators. General Ky -
the man who admires Hitler is the latest
one.

FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY
--
-->
Your job as a soldier is supposed to be "to
win the people of South Vietnam." Win them
to what democracy? No, we keep military
dictators in power. What then? The Ameri-
can way of life? But why should they care
any more about our way of life than we care
about theirs? We can't speak their language
or even pronounce their names. We don't
know anything about their religion or even
what it is. We never even heard of Vietnam
until Washington decided to run it.
"
You are supposed to be fighting "to save
the Vietnamese people from Communism.'
Certainly Communist influence is very strong

SF T-5 on December 17, 1865, Furnished a copy of a
"Dear Friend" letter, dated December 14, 1965, issued by the
International Committee of the VDC. The letter informed the
recipient there was "now" a serious dancer that soon the JOHNSON
Administration would further escalate the war in Vietnam by
extending the bombing to the population centers of North Vietnar,
Haiphong and possibly Hanoi.
The letter informed that should escalation of the war
effort in Vietnam take place, the peace groups everywhere, as well
as all organizations and individuals opposed to the war, should
respond immediately by demonstrating their horror at this outrage.
The letter related the committee was urging the demon-
strations should take place within hours or days at American
embassies, consulates, information centers and military establish-
ments throughout the world.

The letter commented if such a response were made
immediately, it would represent a significant acceleration of
the movement to stop the war.

The statement related the Harlem rebellion during the.
summer of 1964 was the result of high rents, police brutality,
crowded housing, unemployment and countless other indignities.
The statement remarked that the black people of Harlem and
other ghettos throughout the U.S. had been subjected to these
conditions for many years. According to the statement, BILL
EPTON was the scapegoat of the corrunt establishment that created
and intensified these brutal conditions of dehumanization.
The statement went on to say that BILL EPTON strongly
opposed the war in Vietnam and had urged his brothers not to
fight against the people of Vietnam stating that, "the ficht for
freedom and liberty is right here in this country."
The statement said the VDC was demanding the charges
against BILL EPTON be dropped and the conviction be immediately
reversed.

International Days of Protest."
Among other things, the leaflet informed that the VDC
had set October 15-16, 1965, as dates of International Days of
Protest against military intevention, and had sent a call for
support throughout the world. The leaflet added the VDC office
at Berkeley would be the international headquarters for the

in the National Liberation Front, the rebel
government. Yet most of the people support
the NLF. Why? Many of the sa people who
now lead the NLF led the Vietnamese inde-
pendence movement against the Japanese dur-
ing World War II, and then went on to fight
against French colonial rule. Most Vietnam-
ese think of the NLF leaders as their coun-
try's outstanding patriots. Infact, many anti-
Communists have joined the guerrilla forces
in the belief that the most important thing is
to get rid of foreign domination and military
dictators. On the other hand, very few Viet-
namese support the official government of
General Ky. His army has low morale and a
high desertion rate.
THE GUERRILLAS
The newspapers and television have told
us again and again what a tough fighter the
Vietnamese guerrilla is. Short of ammuni-
tion and without any air cover, he can beat
forces that outnumber him five or ten to one.
Why do they have such high morale? They
are not draftees; no draftees ever fight like
that. They are not high-paid, professional
soldiers. Most of them are peasants who work
their fields; they can't even spare the ammu-
nition for target practice.
-
Their secret is that they know why they
are fighting. They didn't hear about Vietnam
in the newspapers; they've lived there all their.
lives. While we were in high school, they
were living under the Diem regime and hating
it. Now American planes are bombing their
towns and strafing their fields; American
troops have occupied their country; and if
they complain out loud, an American-sup-
ported dictator sentences them to jail or the
firing squad. Is it any wonder that they fight
so fiercely?
CRUSHING THE RESISTANCE
The war in Vietnam is not being fought ac-
cording to the rules. Prisoners are tortured.
Our planes drop incendiary bombs on civilian
villages. Our soldiers shoot at women and
children. Your officers will tell you that it is
all necessary, that we couldn't win the war
any other way. And they are right. Ameri-
cans are no more cruel than any other peo-
ple; American soldiers don't enjoy this kind
of war. But if you are going to wage war
against an entire people, you have to become
cruel.
But
The ordinary German soldier in occupied
Europe wasn't especially cruel, either.
as the resistance movements grew, he be-
came cruel. He shot at women and children
because they were shooting at him; he never
395
asked himself why they were shooting at him.
When a certain became a center of re-
sistance activity, e followed his orders and
destroyed the whole town. He knew that SS
men were torturing captured resistance fight-
ers, but it wasn't his business to interfere.
FOLLOWING ORDERS
As a soldier you have been trained to obey
orders, but as a human being you must take
responsibility for your own acts. Interna-
tional and American law recognize that an in-
dividual soldier, even if acting under orders,
must bear final legal and moral responsibility
for what he does. This principle became a
part of law after World War II, when the Al-
lied nations, meeting in London, decided that
German war criminals must be punished even
if they committed war crimes under orders.
This principle was the basis of the Nurem-
berg trials. We believe that the entire war
in Vietnam is criminal and immoral. We be-
lieve that the atrocities which are necessary
to wage this war against the people of Vietnam
are inexcusable.
OPPOSE THE WAR
We hope that you too find yourself, as a
human being, unable to tolerate this night-
mare war, and we hope that you will oppose
it. We don't know what kind of risks we are
taking in giving you this leaflet; you won't
know what risk you will be taking in opposing
the war. A growing number of GIs have al-
_ ready refused to fight in Vietnam and have
been court-martialed. They have shown great
courage. We believe that they, together with
other courageous men who will join them, will
have influence far out of proportion to their
numbers.
There may be many other things you can
do; since you are in the service, you know
better than civilians what sorts of opposition
are possible. But whatever you do, keep your
eyes open. Draw your own conclusions from
the things you see, read and hear. At orien-
tation sessions, don't be afraid to ask ques-
tions, and if you're not satisfied with the
answers, keep asking. Take every chance
you get to talk to your fellow soldiers about
the war.
You may feel the war is wrong, and still
decide not to face a court-martial. You may
then find yourself in Vietnam under orders.
You might be forced to do some fighting
-
3 but don't do any more than you have to. Good
luck.

At approximately 11:30 AM, October 15, 1985, the VDC
held a press briefing on the UCP campus, and announced that in
spite of the fact that the Oakland City authorities had refused
to issue a parade permit, the march from the UCB campus to OAT,
7 miles away, would begin as scheduled at 7:30 PM.
At 12 noon, October 15, 1965, the crowd had grown to
approximately 1,000. At 12 noon, the rally began. From 12 noon
to 5:00 PM, five speakers were presented and their remarks were
directed primarily towards criticizing U.S. foreign policy in
Vietnam.
At approximately 5:00 PM, JERRY RUBIN announced that
all means to appeal for a pernit for the VDC march through the
streets of Oakland and the City of Oakland, had been denied to
them. JERRY RUBIN was followed by PAUL JACOBS, who was
three speakers who continued to protest U.S. foreign policy in
Vietnam.
PAUL JACOPS informed Special Agents of the
FBI on August 18, 1949 that in 1933 and
1934, he was active in the Young Communist
League (YCL), but was a member for less
than one year. He stated he was expelled
from the YCL for engaging in Trotskyite
activities. According to JACOBS, he
remained a Trotskyite for about one year.
The YCL has been designated by the Attorney
General of the U.S. pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

police officers. The marchers, whose ranks were estimated from
4,000 to 12,000, then proceeded to the Civic Center Plaza,
Berkeley. At approximately 11:55 PM, October 15, 1965, the crowd
began to break up. An unknown person threw a tear gas bomb which
disrupted the crowd in the plaza. An 18 year old -irl was

Sergeant DAHL informed on October 14, 1965 that on
October 14, 1965, the Acting City Manager of Oakland denied the
VDC permit to march through Oakland on October 15, 1965. This
refusal was appealed to the Oakland City Council, who also
denied the permit.
Inspector O'MEARA informed on October 15, 1965, that
he had received information that on October 14, 1955, the VDC
held a meeting and discussed detailed plans for the October 15-16,
1965 march. At the meeting, BETTINA APTHEKER, who made her
first appearance at a VDC meeting, cautioned those in attendance
on how to make arrests more difficult.
Special Agents of the FBI observed that the two-day
demonstration began on October 15, 1965 at Sproul Hall Plaza,
UCB, shortly after 9:00 AM. The classes at the University had
already commenced and the crowd which was small and gathered
subsequently, was entertained by folk singers during the morning
hours.

October 16, 1965, movies were shown. At 3:15 AM, the crowd had
dwindled to approximately 150 persons.
An agreement had been reached with the Berkeley Police
Department by the marchers that they would not return to the Civic
Center Plaza, Berkeley, because of traffic resulting for a
football game at UCB stadium on October 16, 1965.
At approximately 11:45 AM, October 16, 1965, the protest
commenced with a rally in the vicinity of the Civic Center Plaza.
At the rally, MORT SCHEER was introduced as a representative of
PLP.
SCHEER addressed a crowd which now numbered about 350
as "comrades". SCHEER criticized the imperialistic agression
of the U.S. in Vietnam and remarked that in order to win, "we
must get rid of the ruling class in the United States." SCHEER
added that the working class and the Negroes must be united to
achieve this end.
MORT SCHEER has been publicly identified as
a Vice President of PLP.
PAUL MONTAUK also spoke at the rally on October 16, 1965.
He was also critical of U.S. foreign policy and action in Vietnam.
on
MIKE MYERSON also spoke at the rally on October 16, 1965.
He claimed the U.S. military forces were bombing and murdering
thousands of innocent Vietnamese women and children and were
the verge of bombing dikes and dams which would cause starvation
to millions of defenseless peasants.
SF T-26 reported on January 13, 1965, that
MIKE MYERSON, at a meeting of the National
Coordinating Committee of the U.E.B. Du
Bois Clubs of America (DCA) in San Francisco,
reported to the committee members, he was
serving as International Secretary of the DCA.
This meeting was held December 31, 1964 to

march on November 13, 1966 from Berkeley through Oakland.
STEVE WEISSMAN then spoke at the rally and called for
a mobilization of all the Negro communities in West Berkeley,
West Oakland and East Oakland, to support the November 13, , 1965
march. WEISSMAN Commented there would be an intensive campaign
of leafletting, speeches and rallies to nobilize the Negro
community in support of the march and peace rally on November 13,
1965.
WEISSMAN added the planned march for November 6, 1965
was changed to November 13, 1965, because of a civil rights
meeting being held somewhere in the South on November 6, 1965,
where support would be garnered for the November 13, 1965 rally
and march.
The planned march of November 13, 1965 was subsequently
changed to November 20, 1965.
At the rally on October 18, 1965, APTIEKER and
WEISSMAN emphasized the fact that the Oakland Police Department
had denied individual's liberties and rights in stopping the
VDC march. They implied that "now" was the time for all of the
radical left to organize and crush the Oakland Police Department
and the Oakland power structure.
A Special Agent of the FBI observed on October 27,
1965, that at a VDC press conference on October 27, 1965, at the
Sir Francis Drake Hotel, San Francisco, mention was made that on
the "previous night" (October 26, 1965) the general membership
of the VDC had radified the following plans for the march on
October 20, 1965:
12 noon to 1:00 PM, pre-march rally at Sproul
Hall Plaza, UCB.
1:00 PM, march will depart from UCE to the
OAT.
After picketing at the base, the marchers will
return to 7th and Peralta Streets, Oakland, for
a rally.

demonstrators moved out of Berkeley and commenced marching south
on Grove Street towards Oakland. In the meantime, the Oakland
Police Department had formed a double wedge of policemen on
the Oakland side of the city limits and were waiting for the
arrival of the marchers. At 2:30 PM, 16 black-leather-jacketed
motorcyclists, known as the "Hell's Angels" arrived at the Grove-
Adeline and 62nd Street intersection. Some of the members began
wrapping their hands with leather belts. The members of the
"Hell's Angels" began mingling with the spectators, but were
forced behind the line of Oakland policeren. At 3:37 PM, the
marchers arrived at the above-mentioned intersection. Upon
reaching the intersection, a member of the "Hell's Angels" broke
through the police lines and grabbed the lead banner of the VDC.
marchers. Both police departments moved in and broke up the
fight. One member of the "Hell's Angels" was injured on the
head and a Berkeley police officer suffered a broken leg.
The demonstrators then sat down in the intersection
on the Berkeley side of the city boundary. Things remained
impasse until the demonstration began breaking up at 5:05 PM.
There were no further incidents although five more
members of the "Hell's Angels", which has been publicly described
as a notorious outlaw motorcycle group, were arrested and
charged with assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the
injury to the Berkeley officer. They were later released after
questioning.

C. Protest March, November 20, 1965
A Special Agent of the FBI observed on October 18, 1965
that at 12 noon, October 13, 1965, a rally was held at Sproul
Hall Plaza, UCB. The rally was co-sponsored by the VDC and
the master of ceremonies and one of the main speakers was "ETTINA
APTHEKER. During her speech, she condemned U.S. Attorney General
(ATŻENBACH, the Federal Government in runeral, and damned the
Dakland, California Police Department for its part in stopping
the VDC marches on October 15-16, 1965.
BETTINA APTHEKER called for a national mobilization to
be held in Berkeley of all groups interested in civil rights,
individual rights and all peace movements opposed to the war in
Vietnam, to unite and form a unit of solidarity for a national

Announcement was also made at the press conference that
the purpose of the march was to oppose American intervention in
Vietnam, and demand an end to Federal and local suppression of
the protest movement. Mention was also made that a team of
lawyers would take every possible legal step to force the City of
Oakland to permit the march.
U.S.
Records of the U.S. District Court, San Francisco,
revealed that on November 1, 1965, a petition was filed by the
VDC which asked for an injunction against the City of Oakland,
the Mayor, the Chief of Folice and the Acting City Manager.
District Judge WILLIAM T. SUEIGERT filed an order for the
defendants to show cause by November 12, 1965, why they should
not permit a parade through the City of Oakland on November 20,
1965, by the VDC.
In the November 12, 1965, issue of the "San Francisco
Examiner", there appeared an article captioned, "Berkeley OKs
VDC March, but Oakland Sticks to Ean."
The article informed that the City of Berkeley had
approved a parade permit, however, the City of Oakland was
denying the parade permit on the crounds it could cause violence.
Oakland City Manager JOHN A. MORIN denied the permit for several
reasons.
1. "The proposed 7-1/2 mile march to a point
near CAT starting at 1:00 PM would still be
going on after dark."
2.
The fact he had received 3 parade appli-
cations and one amended petition, all signed
by different individuals in the VDC. This
led him to believe the VDC was a "loosely-knit
organization which might not be able to
control itself."
3. "It is not reasonable to expect local
taxpayers to suffer inconvenience and
exposure to possible violence, as well as
having to pay the high cost of protection.'

On November 17, 1965, U.S. District Judge SWEIGERT
issued a preliminary injunction asked by the plaintiff (VDC)

with the following restrictions.
The parade must enter Oakland no later than 11:00 AM
November 20, 1965, and must terminate at 7th and Peralta
Streets no later than 4:00 PM. If permission from the owners
of the property at 7th and Peralta (U.S. Post Office) can not
be obtained, alternate points of dispersement will be De
Fremery Park or Bushrod Park, Oakland. Both of these alternate
locations were offered by the defendant, City of Oakland and
Alameda County, as dispersal points.
Permission for the use of the vacant lot at 7th and
Peralta was subsequently denied by the owners.
The injunction prevented the plaintiff from sending
any persons to the OAT.
The rally following the parade must terminate no
later than 5:00 PM.
Law enforcement officers in Oakland and Alameda County
were restricted from arresting plaintiff; however, individuals
who might commit acts of violence or break possible laws, were
subject to arrest. Defendant and their agents must protect the
plaintiff and thus sanctioned from attacks by any group, such
as the "Hell's Angels". The parade must consist of no more
than 1,000 persons in each group and each group must maintain
a distance of 60 feet or more from groups, so as not to interfere
with east-west traffic. The marchers must march no more than
7 abreast and not occupy more than 1/2 of the street. In
addition, the injunction provided that the plaintiff must file
by noon, November 18, 1965, the names and addreses of all the
monitors of the parade. If reasonable emergency arises, law
enforcement agents of the defendant must change the parade route
in a reasonable manner consistent with the parade route.
On November 20, 1965, a Special Agent of the FBI was
furnished with a printed leaflet captioned, "Why We March ..
Against the War in Vietnam."
The leaflet stated that every day young Americans were
daily in a war they didn't understand. The leaflet further
stated that American soldiers were daily "dying" because they

article identified ROBERT SCHEER as
research director for the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee and stated that SCHEER had
visited Cuba in the summer of 1964, in
defiance of a U.S. Department of State
travel ban.

The leaflet was issued by the VDC and invited the
recipient to join the march from Berkeley to Oakland on
November 20, 1965.
A Special Agent of the FBI observed on November 19,
1965, that a leaflet captioned, "VDC Bulletin" was being distributed
in Berkeley. A copy of the leaflet, which was furnished to the
Special Agent, informed that "everything is 'go' for the march"
on November 20, 1965. The leaflet explained that the purpose of
the march was to "protest American intervention in Vietnam and to
affirm our right to peacefully protest, even in Oakland, when
we feel our government is wrong.
A Special Agent of the FBI observed on November 20,
1965 that the march on November 20, 1965, was led by the sheriff's
van and patroled by police and the California Highway Patrol.
The march began at 9:50 AM from the UCB campus. The marchers
were divided into groups of approximately 1,000 with some 50 feet
between groups. There were 10 groups and the groups wended their
way through the cities of Oakland and Berkeley and were joined
by people on the sidelines. The 3 lead groups had sound trucks
and monitors for the parade and were equipped with 2-way radios.
The first group reached its destination, De Fremery Park, 18th
and Adeline Streets, Oakland, at approximately 12 noon, and the
last marchers reached the park at approximately 1:50 PM.
During the above march, counter-demonstrators were on
the scene with signs reading, "in the War in Vietnam" and
"Let's Get the Viet Con- out of California."
A second Special Agent of the FBI observed on
November 20, 1965 that the rally at De Fremery Park began at
approximately 1:15 PM with some 7,000 people in attendance...
Among the speakers was one DANIEL HEALY, who stated that on
November 10, 1965, he refused induction into the U.S. Armed
Forces. HEALY stated the U.S. Government forced him to choose
between being a criminal or losing his self-respect.

Demonstration Against Vice-President
HUBERT HUMPHREY, Fairmont Hotel,
San Francisco, December 3, 1965
On December 3, 1965, a Special Agent of the FBI was
furnished a copy of a printed leaflet captioned, "Humphrey!
What Does your Liberalism mean in Vietnam?“, The leaflet which.
was issued by the VDC was distributed during a demonstration
against Vice President HUMPHREY on December 3, 1965, at the
Fairmont Hotel, San Francisco, by the VDC.
Special Agents of the FBI observed on December 3, 1965
that the VDC commenced picketing at the Fairmont Hotel at
approximately 5:45 PM on December 3, 1965. This picketing took
place across the street from the main entrance to the Fairmont
Hotel, Mason Street, San Francisco, where Vice President HUMPHREY
was residing and was to be featured guest at a $100-a-plate
Democratic Party fund-raising banquet.
Subsequently, some of the demonstrators who were
protesting U.S. intervention in Vietnam, proceeded to march on
the California Street entrance to the hotel. A maximum number
of pickets at one time reached approximately 250 on the Mason
Street side and 150 on the California Street side, considerably
below the 1500 to 3000 participants the VDC expected in the
lemonstration.
The demonstrators carried signs reading, "repent" and
"Make Love, Not War." They chanted, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many
kids did you kill today?" and "2, 4, 6, 8, when you gonna
negotiate?".

ROBERT SCHEER is the foreign news editor
for "Ramparts" magazine.
"Ramparts" is self-described as the
Catholic journal of political opinion.
The February 23, 1366 issue of the "Berkeley

that "SCHEER, an outspoken critic of the
JOHNSON Administration policies in Vietnam was

A Special Agent of the FBI observed on December 10, 1965,
that at approximately 10:30 AM, U.S. Secretary of State DEAN RUSK
arrived at the San Francisco International Airport, San Mateo
County, California. At the airport, there were approximately 50
individuals, some of whom were there on behalf of the VDC.
During the demonstration, a leaflet issued by the
VDC, Berkeley, was distributed.
The leaflet asked Secretary of State RUSK if he would
be willing to participate in a nationally televised debate and
if he could honestly defend-"U.S. financing of French efforts
to retain colonial control of Vietnam between 1943-1954?
"The breaking of the implementation of the Geneva
Accords of 1954, with its provision for free election?
"The creation of the republic of South Vietnam under
the leadership of DIEM, and subsequent leaders who were even
less popular?
"Consistently ignoring the call of the 'enemy' during
the past 10 years for a reconvening of the Geneva conference
and a return to the essential provisions of the document?"

STRUCTURE OF THE VDC
SF T-2 on September 20, 1965 furnished a copy of
a mimeographed leaflet captioned, SUGGESTION FOR THE
. STRUCTURE OF THE V.D.C." The leaflet set forth the follow-
ing information:
The Steering Committee of 30 will meet every Sun-
day night at open meetings, with the following purposes:
#1.
:2.
to make proposals to the Tuesday night
general membership meeting.
to carry out decisions of the membership."
The leaflet informed that all actions by the Steering Committee
would be announced at the opening of the Tuesday night meeting
of the general membership. According to the leaflet, the
general membership is the final authority on all policy deci-
sions.
The leaflet went on to inform that the basic working
arrangement of the VDC is that individual committees work
autonomously and make their own decisions within the general
framework of philosophy and allocation of resources as de-
cided by the Steering Committee and the general membership.

Continuing, the leaflet related that individual
committees must bring their actions to the Steering Com-
mittee and the membership when their actions are a matter
of political or organizational principle and large allocation
of resources. Voting in the Tuesday VDC meeting is based
exclusively on membership in the VDC, which is defined as
possession of a membership card and active work. According
to the leaflet, the Steering Committee is also empowered
to make and carry out day-to-day decisions of the VDC and to
choose a smaller committee or committees to do the same.
The leaflet commented that the general membership will set
the next date for election of a new Steering Committee.

at the University, but at a political system which influenced
it. The leaflet remarked the protest was a political protest
and would be successful if a sizeable minority of students and
faculty committed themselves to building a peace movement.
"For 3 days we plan to transfer the work we would
normally do in class to a discussion of the war and of the
development of programs to stop it. The leaflet went on to say,

transfer your work during the demonstration. We urge the entire
university community to join together in this action."

whether they would actually advise young men to avoid the draft.
RUBIN remarked, "We will acquaint them with the facts on the war,
encourage them to study it and allow them to make up their own
minds. Information about the war equals a campaign against the
draft." SMITH stated the Committee would take its campaign of
"information" into high schools and Armed Service Induction

CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
LIBERTIES (NEW YORK CITY)
The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 42
concerning "Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties
(New York City)":
1.
"On the basis of its investigations and
hearings to date, the committee concludes that the
National Assembly for Democratic Rights and a co-
ordinating and organizing group in support thereof,
titled the 'Citizens Committee for Constitutional
Liberties, are communist fronts. Created, dominated
and controlled by members and officials of the Communist
Party, the National Assembly for Democratic Rights and
the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties were
organized as propaganda devices for the conduct of
'mass activity' in support of the avowed objectives
of 'reversal or nonapplication' of the Supreme Court
decisions of June 5, 1961, which upheld the constitution-
ality of the registration and disclosure provisions of
the Internal Security Act of 1950 as applied to the
Communist Party, and the Smith Act membership clause
making punishable active and purposive membership in
the Communist Party."
* The long-range objective of the Citizens
Committee for Constitutional Liberties is to serve as
the vehicle for concealed communist participation in,
and direction of, propaganda and agitational activities
aimed to nullify the Internal Security and Smith Acts."

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (cont'd.)
The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the
FPCC.
The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
1 of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which-disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
LEE H. OSWALD.
On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.
On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that
the FPCC had been dissolved.

NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO ABOLISH THE HOUSE
UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE
The "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications"
issued December 1, 1961, by the House Committee on Un-American
Activities, page 115, contains the following citation regarding
the National Committee to Abolish the Un-American Activities
Committee (NCAUAC).
"Cited as a 'new organization' set up in the Summer of
1960 to lead and direct the Communist Party's 'Operation Abolition'
campaign. Seven of the national leaders of this group have
been identified as Communists."
A source has advised that the NCAUAC changed its name
on March 3, 1962, to include the word "House" in its name,
thereby becoming known as the National Committee to Abolish
the House Un-American Activities Committee (NCAHUAC).
A second source advised on June 28, 1965, that as of that
date the NCAHUAC continued to function with the headquarters
at 555 North Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California.

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
4
The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.
"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,
Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.
On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

as he passed his bar exams.
A fifth source advised March 1, 1963,
that HERBERT APTHEKER, a member of the
CP, USA, National Committee, advised in
February, 1963, that he was to be the
East Coast Chairman and JOSEPH P. MORRAY
the West Coast Director of a new organi-
zation being promoted by the CP, USA, to
teach and propagate Marxist theories.
The third source further advised on January 26, 1966,
that due to the failure of the SFSSS during its Spring, 1965,
term to raise support sufficient to continue all of its scheduled
classes, no classes were organized for a Fall, 1965, term. The
SFSSS no longer exists.

W. E. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)
A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new
national Marxist-oriented youth organization which would hunt
for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates
to this meeting were cautioned against the germ of anti-Soviet
and anti-CP ideologies. These delegates were also told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the voung socialists
attracted into this new organization would eventually pass into
the CP itself.
A second conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago
on December 28-29, 1963, for the purpose of initiating a "call"
to the new youth organization and planning for a founding
convention to be held in June, 1964.
A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which
time the name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention. The aims of this organization, as set
forth in the preamble to the constitution, are, "It is our
belief that this nation can best solve its problems in an
atmosphere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament and true
freedom for all peoples of the world, and that these solutions
will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic
elements in our country, composed essentially of the working people
allied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites.
We further fully recognize that the greatest threat to American
democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in
coalition with the most reactionary sections of the economic power
structure, using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy
the unified struggle of the working people. As young people in
the forces struggling for democracy, we shall actively strive to.
defeat these reactionary and neo-fascist elements and to achieve
complete freedom and democracy for all Americans, thus enabling
each individual to freely choose and build the society he would
wish to live in. Through these struggles we feel the American
people will realize the viability of the socialist alternative.'

who stated that as students they would like a chance to see and
evaluate the situation in Cuba for themselves and had received an
offer of transportation and two weeks stay in Cuba from the
Federation of University Students in Havana, as guests of the
Federation. The Committee accepted the offer and applied to the
State Department of the United States for passport validation
which was refused%3B however, over fifty students planned to defy
the State Department ban and go to Cuba.

New York, New York, as its mailing address.
On March 12, 1965, Philip Abbott Luce, 504 West 55th Street,
New York, New York, a self-admitted member of the Student Committee
for Travel to Cuba Executive Committee and the Progressive Labor
Movement National Coordinating Committee, advised as follows:
The Student Committee for Travel to Cuba (SCTC) was formerly

Permanent Student Committee for Travel to Cuba.
Luce was a leader and participant of the 1963 trip to Cuba
and an organizer of the 1964 trip to Cuba and both trips were
sponsored by the SCTC.
By the Spring of 1964 the Executive Committee of the SCIO
was considered to be members of the Progressive Labor Movement.
No trip to Cuba or China was being planned by the SCTC
for 1965.

the San Francisco Bay area as the
Bay Area Young Socialist Alliance, aka
the Bay Area Committee of the Young
Socialist Alliance, Bay Area Committee
for the Young Socialist)
A source advised on May 16, 1960, that the Bay Area
Young Socialist Alliance (BAYSA) was formed in February, 1958,
as the Bay Area Committee for the Young Socialist (BACYS). At
a later stage in its development prior to adoption of the name

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE
The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist" ("YS"),
page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a
national organization entitled "Young Socialist Alliance" (YSA)
was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This issue stated
this organization was formed by the nationwide supporter clubs
of the publication "YS."
.
The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding Declaration
of YSA. This declaration stated YSA recognizes the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing political leadership
on class struggle principles, and that the supporters of the "YS"
have come into basic political solidarity with the SWP on the
principles of revolutionary socialism.
A source advised on May 7, 1965, that the original
YSA was an organization formed during October, 1957, in New York
City, by youth of various left-socialist tendencies, particularly
members and followers of the SWP. The leaders of this group were
the guiding forces in the establishment of the national organization.
The source further advised on May 7, 1965, YSA is dominated
and controlled on a national basis by the SWP through having SWP
members comprise exclusively the National Executive Committee (NEC)
and through an official SWP representative at all YSA NEC meetings.
The YSA, in reality, is the youth and training section of the SWP.
and the main source of new SWP members.
The headquarters of the YSA is located in Room 631,
41 Union Square West, New York City.
The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive Order
10450.

SOCIALIST LEAGUE (YSL
The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist Challenge,'
published as page three of "Labor Action," an official publication
of the Indpendent Socialist League (ISL), contained an article
concerning the creation of the YSL, which pointed out that at a
unity conference occurring February 12-14, 1954, at Labor Action
Hall, New York, New York, a merger occurred between the Young
People's Socialist League (YPSL) and the Socialist Youth League
(SYL). The new organization was named the YSL.
A source on June 15, 1954, made available the minutes of
the YSL's National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954,
which reflected that one S. SITEMAN, "Chairman of SP (Socialist
Party) Youth Committee," had objected to a statement appearing in.
"Commerce," a New York University journal, which indicated that
the YPSL merged with the SYL to form the YSL. He explained that
the YPSL did not merge with anyone%3B that it continued to exist as
the youth section of the Socialist Party. He explained that a
small group of the YPSL was dropped, expelled, or suspended from
that organization and joined the SYL, which he characterized as the
youth group of the "Trotskyite ISL." He explained that after these
few former members of the YPSL joined the SYL, the SYL then pro-
ceeded to change its name for its own purposes.
On April 9, 1956, a source advised as follows: The YSL
has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the
ISL toward similar objectives, although each major issue given
mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations
individudally. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the ISL,
but the ISL selection of members from YSL ranks is made man
individual and personal basis. In many instances YSL members are
also members of the ISL. The YSL and the ISL utilize the same
printing house in New York City and the YSL publication is printed
as an insert in "Labor Action. Frequently, lecturers before the
YSL are ISL members.
11
The September 22, 1958, issue of "Young Socialist
Challenge," which appeared as page five of "Labor Action," contain-
ed an undated statement from the National Committee of the YSL :
which indicated that the YSL had been dissolved. The statement
appeared under the caption "Join the Young Peoples Socialist League.
The YPSL is publicly known as the youth affiliate of the
Socialist Party - Social Democratic Federation.
A source advised on June 12, 1958, that the Berkeley,
California, unit of the YSL was formed in 1954, following the unity
convention held in New York in February 1954, which combined the
forces of the SYL and the YPSL. The source stated that the YSL
in the San Francisco Bay Area continued to operate under the
leadership and guidance of ISL members.
A source advised on October 9, 1958, that the YSL Branch
dissolved itself in line with the YSL national organization, and
the branch members joined the YPSL.

YOUTH FOR JOBS (YFJ), aka
Youth for Jobs Committee
A source advised in July 1963, that several recent
graduates and dropouts of high schools in Oakland and Berkeley,
California, had on April 17, 1963, attended the organizing meeting
of Youth for Jobs (YFJ) in Oakland, California, in response to:
letters prepared by ROSCOE PROCTOR and DOUGLAS WACHTER. At this
meeting, WACHTER gave reports on the unemployment problem among
youth and the need for an organization of this type. FROCTOR also
spoke at this meeting.
In May 1963, a second source advised that
ROSCOE PROCTOR attended meetings of the
National Executive Committee of the Communist
Party (CP), USA, during May 1963, in New
York City.
In January 1963, a third source identified
DOUGLAS WACHTER as the Chairman of a CP re-
cruiting class held in January 1963, in
Berkeley, California.
In May 1963, the first source advised that in May 1963,
a 12-page pamphlet entitled "Youth for Jobs Aims and Purposes"
was distributed. This pamphlet described YFJ as an independent
organization of young people working together to find solutions to
current vocational, social and recreational problems; it specified
that YFJ is not affiliated with any other organizations, but would
fully support the labor movement and any other organizations striv-
ing to combat unemployment and to increase job security for all
employees.
In June 1963, the third source advised that at a meeting of
the Political Committee of the CP of the East Bay Region (Alameda
and Contra Costa Counties, California) held in June 1963, VIRGINIA
PROCTOR, member of that Committee, gave a report on a draft docu-
ment read before the National Committee, CP, USA, by GUS HALL, mem-
ber of the National Committee, CP, USA. In connection with the
portion of the report dealing with youth, PROCTOR said "A report
from this area on the activity around Youth for Jobs organized by
ROSCOE PROCTOR will be included in the final document, as one of
the signs of the Party work in organizing the unemployed.'
"
On May 3, 1965, a fourth source advised that ROSCOE
PROCTOR has promoted and guided YFJ since its inception and contin-
ues to do so. The source stated that meetings of YFJ are held at
the YFJ Club House, 1095 - 59th Street, Oakland, California, and
at homes of individual members.

INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST LEAGUE (ISL),
FORMERLY WORKERS PARTY (WP)
The May 4, 1942, issue of "Labor Action", then an official
publication of the Workers Party (WP), carried an article which
reflected that the WP was formed in April 1940, as a result
.
of a split within the leadership of the Socialist Workers Party (SMP).
The article stated that when the Hitler-Stalin Pact was signed and
Poland invaded, the minority group within the SWP, in proclaiming
the formation of the WP, condemned the pact as being imperialistic
in nature and stated it would not support either imperialist camp.
The April 25, 1949, issue of "Labor Action" contained
an account of the Fifth National Convention of the WP, held March
24-27, 1949, in New York City, which reflected the change of name
of the organization from the WP to the Independent Socialist League
(ISL) in order to emphasize the character of the group as a
›ropaganda group for the spreading of socialist ideas and not as a
full-fledged political party.
The July 14, 1958, issue of "Labor Action", an official
publication of the ISL, contained an article captioned "The ISL
Program in Brief." The article indicated: "The ISL stands for
Socialist democracy and against the two systems of exploitation
which now divide the world: capitalism and Stalinism. The ISL,
as a Marxist movement, looks to the working class and its ever-present
struggle as the basic progressive force in society. The ISL is
organized to spread the ideas of socialism in the labor movement and
among all other sections of the people. There can be no lasting and
genuine democracy without socialism and there can be no socialism
Without democracy."
The September 22, 1958, issue of "Labor Action" contained
an undated statement signed by the Political Committee of the ISL
which indicated that the ISL had been dissolved. The statement
urged former ISL members to join the Socialist Party Social
Democratic Federation.
-
The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General
of the United States pursuant to Executive Order
10450.
