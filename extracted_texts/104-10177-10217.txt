There have been no phone calls-or

Then a call comes through, but it is not
the contact Branch awaits. ItÌs Inclán,
who has been denied a room at the Hil-
-ton (even though she had a reserva.
tion) and she can't reach anybody at
the U.S. Embassy. She wonders what
the hell is going on. Branch tells her
the situation at the Avila, but she de-
cides to come over; there are lots of
rooms and at least the reporters can
show some solidarity.
It takes a long time, too long, for
Inclán to show up. Branch wanders
downstairs; Rothchild waits by the
phone for calls that never come. There
is an uproar at the desk. The clerk is
telling Inclän there are no rooms avail-
able even though the bank of keys is
(. behind him in full view. He holds that
(
position for about five minutes, then
retreats to "there is some problem with
you people. I can't give you a room."
He seems scared. Everybody. seems
scared. Denying a woman a roora át
three am in Venezuela is a serious
violation of the chivalric code. The
three reporters talk about it, but they
can't sit down or move around without
being followed, almost mimicked, by
cops. There are now at least six of

After va.nly scouring the lobby for

they have to make a move for the rooni
so they can talk near a phone. The
three make their way up the stairs like
Cary Grant tiptoeing between bed-
rooms. To their relief, no one stops

Branch offers Inclán his bed, saying
he will sleep on the floor. Rothchild
doesn't say anything, but lis paranoia
tells him it is foolish to give the Vene-
zuelans a chance to arrest them under
the pretext of immoral conduct. Koth-
child keeps opening the door because
of his paranoia; Branch keeps closing

are not communicating much with each

A
d out, from her visit to the
.0 Huston, what floor Ricardo
Morales is staying on ɔnd she thinka
she knows what his ruum number is.
Her plan is to call him directly. It is
clearly a desperation move. Inclán
tings up Morales at the Anauco Hilton,
apologizes for the hour and begins to
explain her predicament, but it is clear
things are not going well. Morales ap-
parently is denying that he is Morales.
"You aren't Rica.do Morales?" Inclin
asks incredulously. "You know me and
I know you. I talked to your nephew
in Miami yesterday. His family is fine
and he sends his warmest regards."
There is a pause and Incián begins
to sound like a panelist on What's My
Line?. "You've never heard of a Blo
rales? Who are you then? Your voice
sounds familiar. You're not a Venezuɛ.
Jan. You sound Cubaa. Are you R
Cuban?" Morales says he is tired of
being interrupted in his sleep; he hangs
up the phone.
a
An air of resignation has settled
over the room. It is almost morning
and the goons are still standing by the
bushes. The reporters are under soms
kind of house arrest and they feel
caged. They wonder why Morales has
just denied being himself. Maybe all
this is happening because they know
who he is and Blorales fears they will
ruin his cover identity. Or maybe
Morales doesn't want Branch to reveal
his background to anybody in Vene
zuela. The reporters kick this notion
around, but it doesn't fit. It seems pre-
posterous that the Venezuelans don't
know about Morales' previous lives,
which are talked about all the time in
the Miami rumor mill.
Inclán tries to phone her editor in
Miami, but it becomes clear after about
an hour of excuses that the desk clerk
isn't going to put through her call.
Local lines still seem to be available,
but whom to call? Branch has his list
of connections, but these people are in
their own delicate
delicate situations and
Branch doesn't want to blow their cov-
ers by calling at four a.m. on what is
certainly a tapped line. Inclán can't get
an answer at the U.S. Embassy. Roth:
child has nobody to call, and that is one
of his problems. Since he is so un-
connected with the story, he is sure
that the police will figure he is the
heavy-a deep-cover C.I.A. man out of have caused the trouble. Inclán says no

Branch paces. around the room, try-
ing to make his mind catch up with his
fears. He even asks. Inclán-whether she
is guarding some secret that might
and politely doesn't return the question.
The reporters already trust each other
instinctively, but the spy world threat
ens to swallow them up, too. They de
cide there is nothing to do except try
anything to reach the outside world in
the morning before getting shuttled off
to the DISIP.
Inclán goes off to the lobby for some
sleep on her couch, Branch tells Poth-
child the rumor about the rapproche-
ment between Morales and Bosch, say.
ing he'd even heard Bosch had been
staying in Morales' apartment. But it
doesn't make any sense. Nothing does.
Branch babbles on until he finally runs
out of nervous energy." "Well, John,”
he says, smiling thinly as he sinks onto
the bed, "I was right about one thing.
I told you it wouldn't be a boring week-
end."
Morales Takes Over

It is five-thirty a.m. and somebody is
pounding on the door. Rothchild, a light
sleeper, jumps out of bed. He opens the
door just a crack, and then the door is J

1 "Pack!" he yel's in half a second he is
all the way across the room. "Pack!'
Branch sits up straight in bed and in
the most plaintive voice Rothchild has
ever heard him use, a mixture of recog.
nition, terror, disappointment, confu-
sion and pleading, says just one word:
"Ricardo?"
It is Morales all right. Branch
watches him snatch back the curtains
to check the balcony, then dart around
the chairs. "Pack!" There is a rhythm
to his order. He is moving like a cat,
frenzied but in total control. Rothchild
feels the energy coming off him in
waves. He ships into the bathroom to
piss just to get away from Morales,
but he is so scared that nothing comes.
More orders come out in staccato
bursts"Get those bags closed! Give
me your passports! Give me your air-
line tickets!" Branch and Rothchild
are convinced that he wants to destroy
the documents before he kills them.
Morales leaves the room within two
minutes, but his performance leaves so
much afterlife that Rothchild and
-Branch don't do anything once he has
left. They don't call anybody, they don't
sneak off the balcony, they don't even
say a word to each other.
Both of them jump off the floor when
the phone rings, then look dumbly at
each other. Branch picks up the re-
ceiver, grunts, and puts it down. "All
the guy said was, 'He is waiting,'" he
tells Rothchild. Branch's own voice
sounds far off to him.
Inclán has had rough going down-
stairs, maybe rougher than the other
( two because she is alone and also be
cause she is not yet a. U.S. citizen.
Morales wakes her up with the same
staccato commands. She thinks maybe
he is going to take her away and have
her deported back to Havana. She is so
scared that she locks herself in the
bathroom and doesn't come out until
she hears the other two reporters stum-
bling downstairs with their bags,
1.
Morales twists the knife with a little
humiliation. "Pay your bill!" he yells.
Branch doesn't think he should have to
pay for the hospitality he has received,
but he pulls out his wallet without a
second's hesitation. "Pick up your
bags! Let's go!" The reporters are
hustled out of the lobby, past a squad-
ron of sunglasses. Morales is already
ahead of them, barking orders on his
walkie-talkiè. It is still dark.
The reporters are put into the back
of a car. Morales and a driver are up
front. Nobody is talking much. Branch
is wearing his best suit, which he does
not remember putting on during Mo-
rales brutal prodding. Now he thinks
maybe something deep in his uncon-
scious had ordered him to look his best
Rothchild is terrified that they are
traveling in a private car instead of
an official police car. His fear of being
officially detained is rapidiy, being re-
placed by a fear of being unofficially
bumped off." He keeps looking back at
the car full of goons that is following
close behind as they careen down the
mountain at one hundred twenty ki-
lometers an hour.
The car is heading out of town now,

knows néere the reporters are, and the
only thing on their side, beskies some
vestigial compassion that might reside
somewhere even in poors, is the zenso
that world opinion would be on Mo-
rales' back if they did get tortured or
killed. But that's just the point-world
opinion was on the terrorists' bachs
about the Cuban airline crash and
about Letelier and Mothtt. They killed
them anyway. They didn't give a damn.
t the populated areas and into those Cara whether they will ever get to
esta where executions and accidents, find o…. what it is Nobody, after all,
take place, Branch is desperately try
ing to make contact with Murales. He
mentions some people from Miami that
he and Morales had once talked to to-
gether. But every tinio Branch drops a
name, Morales turns the volume up on
the radio. He leaves it that way, blar.
ing, until the questioner gives up and
sits back in his seat. But desperation
creates another question, another try,
which ends in another mambo blast.
Branch gives up on the name-dɩopping
and even tries some spy-world guilt
production. "Rip would not like what
you are doing to us," he says. "Rip
would be ashamed.” Rip Robertson was
Morales' gun-toting case officer in the
Congo operations. Rothchild thinks
Branch is foolish to bring up the Congo
and remind Morales how little he cares
for human life, Morales says nothing.
He just gives the radio knob another
twist.
Inclán is taking the personal route
again, talking about this nephew she
has seen, mentioning other relatives of
Morales who live in Miami. Morales
isn't answering her, either. He is get-
ting tired of the radio. Now he just
leans his head over against the door to
get some steep.-Watching Morales nod,
the fury turned off like a light,
Branch's mind is filled with memories
of Miami Cubans telling stories of
legendary agents who would drop off
to sleep just before landing in Cuba on
a C.I.A. commando raid. He never quite
believed the stories, but he thinks
Morales' nap is very effective theater.
Rothchild is also watching the nap.
Every time Morales neds, Rothchild
thinks he is ducking so that the bullets
from the car behind won't hit him.
Rothchild ducks, too.
.
After about twenty minutes of driv-
ing, the road flattens out and the re-
porters can see the airport in the dis-
tance. Morales mentioned "airport"
once back in the hotel lobby, but the
reporters were never sure he intended
to take them there. If he were just.
planning to expel them, it would seem
that he could afford to be more com-
municative, more curious about what
the reporters were doing, more worried
about the kind of story they might
write about him. But, Moralés asked,
no questions. Rothchild knew from
Braneh's incessant briefings. that Mo-
rales wore a lot of hats: terrorist as
well as informant, mercenary as well
as cop, bomber as well as representa-
tive of a government. It might be more
paranoia to think he would kill them,
but all last night's paranoia-had come
true.
The reporters know one thing: they
have stumbled onto a story that is
big enough and sensitive enough that
top people in the Venezuelan DISIP
äre interrupting their sleep and risk-
ing diplomatic reprisals to scare the
hell out of them. It isn't routine in
Venezuela, one of the few South Ameri-
can countries left with any sense of
freedom of the press. There is some
thing big going on, and the reporters
don't know, as they speed through
"
.
•
The car pulls up at the airport. It is
less than eight hours since the report-
era entered the country, and they have
talked to nobody except Morales, the
goons and each other. Their best guess
is that Morales plans to keep it that
.
way.
Breakfast at Ricardo's
Morales marches the group through
part of the airport lobby and then up
some back stairs, past the meteorology
room and into the tower section. They
arrive at a locked, knobless door with
a small pass-through window, and
Morales has to knock before it is
opened from the inside. They have
arrived at the goon control center.
There is a four-drawer cabinet where
the DISIP police file their guns and
bullet clips like memos. There is an
old couch, a few desks, and in an ad-
joining room some bunk beds. All the
people from the night shift are still
there, including Rómulo, in the same.
turtleneck and the same leather jacket.
The most impressive new lurker is a
Character they call "El Largo," or "The
Long One."
It is clear now that the plan is not
torture, it is deportation, but the re-
porters sense that the plan could easily
be changed. Morales is stalking be
tween rooms, giving orders and mak-
ing calls, and when he looks at the re-
porters he seethes with anger. Inclán)
and Branch are directing more ques-
tions at him from the couch. He an-
swers only with contemptuous looks.
No one is prepared for what happens
next. Morales walks out with a wide
grin on his face. He clasps his hands
together like a waiter and cheerfully
addresses the reporters: "Is anybody.
hungry? Are you ready for some break-
fast?"
The reporters follow Morales dumbly
down the maze of corridors. They de
cide there is something oriental about
recent developments, and they are con-
vinced Morales could show them great
courtesy one moment and yank ont
their toenails "the next. They follow
Morales down the corridors until they
come to a small dining room that ap-
pears to be reserved for airport per-
sonnel. Branch gives fleeting thought
to the idea of making a scene, but
he decides Morales would not have,
brought them here unless he controlled:
the area. Besides, Branch realizes, he
does not have the courage to make a
scene in front of Morales, who still has
the reporters nearly paralyzed; with
fright
Morales lays his big walkie-talkie
down on the table and snaps for a

child follows suit, Morales looks disap-
pointed and urges them to eat more
heartily Inclin orders eggs and Ma
rales looks pleased. He orders a sump-
tuous breakfast for himself. It arrives
promptly.
"Well," he asks grandly, "who do you
think will win your election, Carter or
Ford?"
The reporters exchange the look,
familiar by now, that signals their
agreement that absurdity has reached
new heights. They mumble offhand an
swers as Morales listens intently.
"You don't really have much choice,"
do you?" he asks. "I mean, you have
two guys who don't have any ideas and
don't have any backbone, right? And
neither one of them can command any-
thing or stop anything, so it doesn't
make any difference, right? At least
that's what I get from Time maga-
zinė."
Inclán tries to change the subject.
She asks Morales about his position in
the DISIP and gets no response. She
mentions Morales' nephew, whom she
knows in Miami, and Morales parries the
remark. Suddenly a cloud comes acrosa
his face.
"What's the matter with you?" he
demands. “Why aren't you eating?" Ife
· peints down at the dry toast, which

"I don't know what I understand,”
says Inclán, "I know something about
you. Taylor says he talked to you about
your background in Miami and you
talked to him like a friend. He says
you were nice and now you are …….
"
"I am not nice," snaps Morales.
"You know what I used to do in Cuba
when I was a kid? I sent anonymous
death wreaths to my friends. All the
time. Is that nice?”
Branch does not like this subject or
the faintly homicidal look he sees be-
fore him. He decides to make another
stab at levity. "Look, Ricardo," he says,
"I'm upset that you and your men have
kept me from seeing anything about
the last game of the World Series last
night."
"The World Series," he says, his eyes
opening wide. "Let me tell you about
the World Series. It is just like the
world everywhere: the Reds are win-
Wing and the Yanks are losing!" Mo-
rales breaks into laughter. Something
snaps in the reporters and they laugh,
too, uncontrollably. Fear floats out of
their mouths and they feel better,
"
.
Branch wades in to reestablish con-
tact. "Look, Ricardo," he says gamely,
“I can't help thinking this is some kind
of mistake. I want to be straight with i
you. All I'm interested in is the mur-
der of Orlando Letelier. That's what I

"Aren't you hungry?"
•
Branch nods yes; Rothchild nods no.
"You told me you hadn't gotten any
breakfast, so I give you breakfast," "
Morales declares angrily, waving his
arms. "If you are not hungry, you are
hars! What's the matter with you?"
. The reporters are exasperated. “We
are afraid and confused," says. Inclán,
"because nobody will tell us why this is
happening to us. I am a reporter like
all the other reporters down here. I
want to interview Orlando Bosch like
I did once before..." :
"Never heard of him," interrupts
Morales. He gives us an exaggerated
sùrug and a quizzical look.
Inclán shakes her head in despair.
"Oh, come on. You testified against him
eight years ago in Miami and now he's
the most famous prisoner in Latin
America. He's in your jail."
"Did he make Time magazine?" asks
Morales.
"Yes," says Branch.
"I guess I missed it," says Morales.
He pauses, then turns to Inclán. "You
should not be running around asking so
many questions," he says sternly. "You
are a woman, Women should be at
home having babies and making their
men happy. Nothing else.”
Inclán is ruffled. "I can work as well
as most other reporters," she says.
Morales shakes his head vigorously.
“No you can't. You are a hundred miles
"He's the guy who got blown up in
Washington, right?" Morales breaks in.
“I think I saw that in Time."

"Well what are you doing in Veno-

Morales demands.
"Because I think the people who
conspired to kill him are here. That's
what my sources say, and it has even
been in some of the Venezuelan news-
papers."
Morales Juuhs disgusted. "You
shouldn't read the newspapers," he says.
tightly. "They lie. And you should in-
vestigate that murder in Washington
instead of coming halfway around the-
world."
Branch tries another tack. "I don't.

ber? It was at night in Miami Beach,
and you brought your girl friend over
to the house I was staying in. And
Fotingo Silva was there. And Tamayo
was there. We talked almost all night
about the Congo. Why have you
changed? Is there something.
Branch stops because of what he sees
on Morales' face.
"You are lying!” he explodes. “I have
never heard of Ricardo Morales! This
is the first time I have ever met you,
and it is the first time you have met
mel Understand? I have never seen
you before in my life! If you say dif- .
ferent you are lying! And bad things
happen to liars!"
Inclán comes to Branch's rescue. “I
have seen your picture," she says, “and
I'm sure who you are. If you're not
Morales, then what is your name?"
"I don't answer personal questions,"
Morales says, smiling, trying to look
shy.
i “I think maybe you figure there's a
little spy conspiracy here," Branch ob-
serves, stabbing in the dark. "But there
isn't. John and I are old friends, but
we just met Hilda yesterday. She is
interested in Bosch and his friends be-
cause of the bombings in Miami and
the Cuban plane. We are interested in
them because of Letelier. The three of
us just happened to come down here
on the same plane.”
"Oh, really?" says Morales dubious-
ly. "I guess you are good friends now."
"I guess we've gone through some-
thing together," says Rothchild.
"Now you have something in com-
mon," he nods, "feigning tenderness.
"Let's see, what else is there? Have
you all been married?" The reporters
nod. "How about divorced?" The re-
porters nod again. “Once?” They nod
again.
Morales holds up three fingers. "I
have been divorced' three times," he
says, "after four kids. I haven't seen
thêm in seven years." This hangs in the
air.
"Do you miss them?" asks Inclán.
"Not the children," Morales says
- softly. "Just the wives sometimes. I
don't miss much. You know I haven't
slept in two years." The reporters give
each other significant looks, like shrinks
attending a primal-therapy session.
"If you are going to kick us out of
the country, you should at least let us
call our families," Inclán says. "My
editors are going to be worried. We

don't have any idea where we are. Why
can't you let us make at least one
phone call?”
Morales has shed his melancholy and
slipped into a new persona. 11. is
eager. "You're right," he says. “I'll call
them. Anyoudy you want. Tell me who
your appointments are with." He pulls
out a pen in flash. Branch blinks. He-
is startled by how fast Morales moves
and how fiercely he snaps the point
down.
The reporters glance knowingly at
- each other. They share a vision of
Morales hauling their contacts down to
DISIP's welcome wagon. We're not that
dumb, they think.
.
Inclán tells Morales to call her editor
at The Miami News, a safe, serious
call. Morces speils out the name letter
by letter as he writes on his napkin
like a schoolboy taking down his home
work. He is putting on a show. He
looks at Branch.
"Tell Orlando Bosch it doesn't look':
(as if I'll be able to make it this trip,”"
Branch says. "He's in the DISIP pris-
on." :
The reporters giggle, but Morales
deadpans. "T-e-1-1 0-r-l-a-n-d-o
B-o-s-he
"You've spelled Bosch wrong," says
Inclán. "It's B-o-s-c-h."
"I'm sorry," says Morales.
• Morales keeps writing. "You are a
funny one," he says jovially. He looks
up. "Anybody else?"
"Yes," says Branch. He has been
trying to think of one of his contacts
in Venezuela who would not be vul-
nerable to Morales but whose clout
might impress him. Any name is a risk,
but he decides to take one.. "Tell the
governor of Caracas that I won't be
able to see him. His name is Diego
Arias. Do you know him?”.
Branch studies Morales for a reac-
tion, but there is none.
After breakfast, as the procession goes
by a pay phone, Inclán suddenly an-
-nounces, “I'd like to make one call to
the American Embassy." She breaks
step and marches toward it, the first
sign of overt resistance. Morales
freezes Branch and Rothchild with a
malicious glance and walks with her,
shaking his head. Support goons appear
from around corners: They seem re-
Jaxed. Morales fingers his walkie-talkie.
Inclán gets to the phone and starts
fumbling for Venezuelan change and
her phone numbers. Morales leans up
against the wall near the phone. He
looks amused. His body seems to twitch
a little under his suit, as if he might
need some exercise.
Branch and Rothchild keep telling
themselves that Inclán is making a
futile gesture, but they admire her.
"She's got more guts than we do̟,”
whispers Rothchild.

Branch and Rothchild watch her lift
the phone from the cradle, but they
don't think she has the change or the

Morales in the face, which is probably
: a mistake. He stares at her, shakes his

An hour later, Morales suddenly
mobilizes his entire office. Some of his
men grab the reporters' suitcases and
vanish. Others take off for unknown
destinations. The rest fall in around
the vowrters and Morales leads them
briskly out the door.
Rothchild figures they have just
enough time to make the ten a.m. flight
to Miami that he had seen posted on a
board some time earlier. He senses an
end coming and feels some relief. But
when the entourage emerges on the air-
port's main concourse, Morales turns
toward the exit into Caracas, not
toward the planes.

If we ever get out of his clutches,”
says Branch. "I think maybe it's the
fact that this terrorism is organized
internationally. Hosch moves around on
illegal passports and has fancy ‘und-
raising dinners with supposedly respect-
able people in lots of countries. He's
supported by at least part of a lot of
governments. And this stuff looks cross-
national-Cubans killing Chileans and
so forth. Now look at how Venezuela
fits in. It's kind of an entrepôt for ev-
erybody on all sides. The povernment is
in a real pickle. It has to get along
with the military juntas that have tak-
en over most of Latin America, and it
also has to get along with Castro. This
country is filled with left-wing Chilean
exiles and right-wing Cuban exles

"I thought you were putting us on
the plane," says Branch. "Where are
we going?"
"To the other, airport," says Mó-
rales. His mind is elsewhere.

Morales' face is tant but breaks into
a tour-guide smile. "You will either
leave Venezuela nice and happy,
or..." He pauses. "Or you will leave
nice and happy." He delivers the last
line with a lilt, as if making a rhyme.
The reporters absorb the menacing
smile and fall silent. .
Several cars screech up to the curb.
Once loaded, they take off at the usual
torrid pace. Branch feels panic open-
ing trapdoors under his lungs and he
Jeans over to Rothchild. "Holy shit,
John," he whispers. "I don't think there
is another airport in Caracas.”

After racing a quarter mile down
the road, the cars turn abruptly into a
parking lot. The reporters are baffled
by the rush and the short trip but re-
lieved to be staying near the airport.
They figure they are headed for a
plane from a different direction, but
Morales leads them through another
maze of corridors and into a new hold-
ing room. It has a big waiting area.
with, two rooms partitioned off on the
side. The doors are metal with no
handles. They lock from both sides.
- Morales vanishes, leaving Rómulo
and El Largo in charge. Rómulo's
fingertips do push-ups on his desk
while he looks on, stone-faced. Roth-·
child gets the impression that Rómulo
likes to stare at blank walls more than
at people. El Largo, who seems to be a
notch above Rómulo in the pecking
order, moves into one of the partitioned
offices and stays almost continuously on
the phone. He reminds the reporters of
his presence from time to time by
loudly sucking phlegm up his long
spiny nose.
After about ten minutes, Branch
starts pacing away from Rómulo.
"Goddamn it," Branch spurts, "I don't
think we know enough about Morales
to make him do all this. He's going to
a lot of trouble to seal us off from
Venezuela, but it doesn't make sense
that he would do it just because we
know who he is."
"Why not?” asks Inclán.
"Because," says Rothchild, “what we
already know is going to come out any-
way if he kicks us out of the country."
"I think maybe Morales is more

government is tangled up with both
the terrorists and the anti-terrorists.
This whole country is like a tinderbox.
The government is making little ges-
tures to both sides, trying to keep the
lid on. `-
"Okay," Branch continues. "Let's
assume that Morales is not bootlegging
us out of the country on his own. That :
seems stupid to me. Let's assume that
at least the people in the interior
ministry know what's going on. And
let's assume they're afraid we'll get

goes something like INTERNATIONAL

the C.L.A. Now, what I'm saying is that
a story like that would really screw up
the Venezuelans, especially if it's fleshed
oạt. It's the last thing the government
here needs right now.”
"So what side is Morales on?" asks
Rothchild.
"I think he's on both sides," says
Inclán.
"I think so, too," says Branch, “just
like the government. Morales is in the
underworld of both sides.”
Inclán thinks for a moment. "There's
only one big problem," she says. "If
they're so afraid of a story like that,
why do they let other reporters stay
and just throw us out? Why do ther
pick on us?”
“I don't know," Branch sighs. “I
don't know much about the correspon-
dents here. They're getting some stuff
out, but my impression is that they
cover nine countries and just dy in for
the coups and earthquakes. That still

enough to kill each other." Branch hesi
tates and then decides not to tell Koth-
child that some of the old C.L.A. Cubans
in Miami believe Bosch and Morales
have patched things up. Branch does not
believe it and it would make things too

A Greeting from Rómulo
Rothchild and Inclán notice a huddle
of shady five-footers lurking in a dark
corner beside the airport entrance.
They must be a Venezuelan tour group,
Rothchild thinks, waiting for a bargain
Right out of the country. I'm not going
to get paranoid about-everything I see.
But the group stares at the passen
gers; their suits blend so well into the
shadows that all you see are their mir-

play of Foster Grants at the back of
an unlighted drugstore.

back and forth from one room to the
other
In about ten minutes, Turtleneck ro
turns anal hands each of the reporters a
citación-in triphcate. Rothchild, trans-
lating for Branch, doesn't remember
the legal definition of the word cita-
ción. He does, however, recognize a
word farther down in the document-
edreel, Carest means jail. The reporters
are being sammoned to attend some
kind of inerting in a sinister-sounding
room, D-034, in a building somewhera
in Caracas at nine a.m. the following
day. The letterhead belongs to DISIP.
Turtleneck keeps saying it is all rou-
tine just sign the citación and every-
body can get a good night's sleep. While
Rothchild struggles to understand the
fine print, Inclán tells him she thinks it
might be a mistake to acknowledge the

strued as an admission of something,

“That's all there is to it?”
"Yeah. Just Rômulo.”
"Who ordered you to do this?”
"I don't know, I can't say. It's just a
procedure."
“Why is this happening to us?”
"It is so because it is so."
Inclán writes that down.
Branch, whose rudimentary knowl.
edge of Spanish often led him to offend
the Cuban community in Miami-where
he would mean to say "what a grand
wedding this is" and end up saying
"what tremendous tits you have"-is
getting a headache trying to keep up
with the conversation. "Isn't there
somebody who speaks English here?"
he keeps asking.
"That's all right," says Rothchild.
“The guy`isn't saying a damn thing in
Spanish, either." Inclán agrees.
They stop looking only when the
Miami assistant state's attorneys and
cops; the same ones who have been
bugging Branch on the plane, go over
and give some of the men in the shad-
ows warm, Latin embraces. Inclán
thinks it is a meeting between the Mi-
Aami Jaw-enforcement contingent and
the Venezuelan secret police. She
catches up in the line and says she has
recognized one of the people in the´po-
lice huddle as Ricardo Morales, the
mysterious Cuban who is supposed to
be Branch's fallback contact in Carazine subscriptions. Inclán asks him if

the Cubans and cops start fingering
him on the airplane. Now Morales.

nothing to do but hand over the pais

ogical explanation is that some-
one on the plane tipped off the Vené
zuelans. But why?
Branch thrushes around in his spr
world for answers, Nothing seems to
fit. The three of them thmorize all the
vay to the hotel, and they can only
nettle, like Alexander Haig, on a sinis-
ter force. Branch is still sure that the
summons will be lifted as soon as he
can talk te his friendly contacts in
Venezuela. Rothchild keeps looking out
the window for a tail.
A Visit to a Small Hotel
The taxi drops them off at the Anauco
Hilton, where Inclán is staying. Branch
offers to carry Inclán's bags. The lobby,
amazingly, is filled with the same
DISIP lukers; they have managed to
move their whole scene intact. They
are leaning against walls and sitting
on the couches. Branch looks toward
the elevator in time to see the Miami
attorneys, and cops scurrying to get in-
side, frantically pushing buttons to get
the door to close. They are as jittery
about seeing the reporters as the re-
porters are about seeing the Venezue-
lan goons. And the most jittery of all,
in the middle of the elevator, is Ricar-
do Morales himself. Morales is staring
at the ceiling, trying to avoid eye con-
tact, and Branch has the feeling that
Morales is scared. It is the first time
he has seen fear on the face of this
hardened veteran of Congo wars and
Castro plots and murders. Seeing
Morales scared makes Branch scared.
He warns Inclán not to go anywhere or
do anything—just to call him when he
arrives at his hotel, the Avila.
Back in a taxi Branch is going
through another run of Cuban polities.
"I don't know, John," he says. "Maybe
Morales is behind all this, but I can't
· figure out why he's doing it. He sure
looked as if he's in trouble. He could
have been making some secret deal with
those cops. Something he knows about
one of these bombings in Miami.
Morales might not know that we were
on the flight by accident. He might
think we were tailing the cops."
Rothchild is trying not to listen. The
only sure contact he thought Branch
had has suddenly turned into a poten-
tial enemy. Rothchild is petrified by
the thought that Branch has gotten in
over his head. "I think we are in more
trouble,” he says. "Look behind you.”
This time there is a tail. The other
car is right on their bumper as they
wind up the back streets of Caracas.
"They aren't even pretending not to be
following," Rothchild
following," Rothchild says. "I don't
think that's a good sign."
Branch, overwhelmed, keeps looking
at the car behind them. “You know,”
he says with a smile, “this is the first
time I've ever been tailed." Rothchild
feels as if he is being cranked through
the roller of Graham Greene's type-
writer.
They reach the Hotel Avila, a Casa
blanca-type place at the top of a hill.

El Largo picks up the three passports

walks. "We can't just get on this
plane," he says to Kothchild. "We have
to at least do something." He and Roth-

☐ into a stall-not a complete stop, but
they are slowing it way down. Morales
might have clamped down on this little
insurrection in a second, but El Largo
seems merely agitated. He is getting in
front of the reporters, pleading and
begging, pulling with his arms as if
they are all connected by an invisible
· rope.
In complete exasperation, he starts
sputtering threats. "If you don't move
through here, I am going to use the
force!" Two guards go running down
to the end of the room, apparently to go
find the fores, which turns out to be

wrong thing. So he starts running after

Rothchild hit the double glass door with
Inclán and El Largo and the army just
behind. They all pour out onto the run-
way to the curious looks of hundreds
who are lined up to get on the plane.

that she is a woman reporter whose

deal with this. The passengers don't
know whether to accept her as a lunatic
traveler whom they don't want with
them on the plane, or to believe, what
she is saying, which would be unpleas
ant. Most of them pretend that nothing
is happening and go on up the ramp.

Branch, nieanwhile, has planted him-
self on the stairs that lead to the front
cabin of the plane. He is sitting down
and his hands are clenched to the rails
like a Quaker chained to "the White

steps just below Branch, and they are
being surrounded by a brigade of rein-
forcements; the sword company. The
men in brown uniforms have circled
them, and they pull the swords a few
inches out of their long scabbards ready
to hog-stick Rothchild and Branch into
the airplane, Behind them officials and
police seem to be pouring out of the
doors and official jeeps are screeching

There .ce now dozens of DISIP men
in plain clothes, a few representatives
from about four different military do
tachments, frantic jeep drivers, airline
authorities, pilots and ground-crew per-
sonnel, ali crowding around to watch
or take part in the action. Camargo
looks skyward, thinking under pressure,
and gets his idea. "Why don't you let
me go with these people?” he asks the
pilot. "If I take then to Miami, I guar-
antre there won't be any funny stuff
on your plane." Rothchild thinks this is
a little ironic. The reporters come down
to investigate one plane bombing and
return under guard: so that they can't
pull one-off themselves.
The pilot doesn't think too much of
Camargo's idéa. "Do you have a U.S.
visa?" he asks Camargo. "No." "Then,
do you know what they will do to
when you get to Miami? Much worse
than whatever you have done to them
here" Camargo doesn't like the way
that sounds. He scraps the plan, and
the captain returns to the plane.
The reporters aren't sure of what
they have just done. They have scored
a theatrical victory-just look around
at all these cars and soldiers and dis-
tressed officials-but they don't like the
prospect of lunch with Ricardo Morales.
Nobody seems to be running to call the
American Embassy or any other out-
side help, so the plan is a qualified
failure.
The three of them head back to the
passenger line, where people are still
loading, and start writing phone num-
bers on little scraps of paper—the num-
bers are of editors in Miami, friends,
and even mothers. They try handing
them out to boarding passengers. The
reporters are received in this effort like
Salvation Army collectors at the race-
track. Only a few of the passengers ac-
tually take the notes, but just to make
sure, the DISIP people are picking
them off at the higher end of the line.
Some passengers even go out of their
way to hand over the notes, with an
air of having done their civic duty. It

to the huddle of secret police, where the

and El Largo, are standing. The cap-
tain proceeds to chew them out, tell

best Spanish and seems the most adept
at handling inspectors and bureaucrats.

to leave. Branch reminds him, in front
of the sword brigade, that he is an “ex-

Halfway up the ramp. Rothchild
senses that the pressure has somehow
* been reversed, that now the DISIP
wants to keep him on the ground. Sev--
eral cops are following him as if they
: want to get ahead and stop him at the
door. He scurries inside the plane and
rushes back to a seat; they are still fol-.
lowing him. He has his seat belt buckled
almost before his ass hits the cushion,
and the two cops reach out as if to grab
him, then change their minds and
abruptly leave the aircraft. But they
quickly return. They tell. Rothchild in a
very friendly tone that his friends

far as the plane entrance, the top of
the stairs, when he hears Branch yell-
ing, "Get back." He bowls over a stew
ardess on the way to his seat.

The cops are not through yet. They
return with another ploy: Rothchild has
not filled out the necessary papers and
he must return to an office in the air-
port. "Are you sure this isn't a trick?"
Rothchild asks. “No, no trick. Just,

the front seat. They peel off down the
runway with other cars following.

'say a prayer, refuse to move and wave
ostentatiously at the airplane. The
goons shove and menace but then go off
again. Rómulo comes back with his gun
palléd, looking, like a crazed assassin.
Camargo soor. yanks him back to the
goon huddle. The plane starts taxiing
.

"How long will it take the plane to
get to Miami?" Inclán asks Camargo.
"A little more than three hours," says
Camargo. "It has to stop in Mara-
caibo."
Branch shivers and asks Inclán to
translate the Spanish to viake sure he
heard right.
"I thought you said it was a direct
flight to Miami," Incian says in dis-
bélief.
"It is going direct to Miami, señora,"
replies Camargo, "but it is stopping in
Maracaibo."
The reporters discuss with renewed
horror the fact that Maracaibo is still
in Venezuela; they envision the DISIP
people paying a call on Rothchild. Ca-

mai rins at them. His liņa slant in
one direction, and the upper row of his
front teeth slants in the other, making
an X. Branch thinks Camargo, must
file his teeth. He inches away from
Rómulo until he is almost in inclán's
lap.
Three hours later, Camargo summons
the two reporters to his office after
more consultation with Central Ca-
racas.:Only one thing has changed, he
says graciously. Both their visas have
been officially revoked; they are or-
dered to leave at three-thirty. The re-
porters ask why, and Camargo shrugs.
Without warning, the session is in-
terrupted when one of the younger
goons strolls in and hands Camargo a
brand-new Jim Palmer baseball glove
and a box of six baseballs. The report-
ers are astonished.
"Excuse me," says Camargo, who
begins to pound his fist in the new
glove. He is beaming. He and Branch
start talking baseball, with a bewil-
dered Inclán translating. A bond is
formed: Camargo lets Branch pound his
fist into the glove.
Camargo is now expansive, as if the:
reporters were guests in his home. He
says he knows a lot about the United
States and walks over to a corner where
there is a stack of framed diplomas ca
the floor. He flips through them and
hands Branch a diploma from the U.S.
Army School of Special Warfare. It is
signed by General Joseph W. Stilwell,
Commandant. Then he hands Branch a
certificate from the International Police:
Academy, a training school for the
world's policemen. It has closed after a
dose of scandal. Branch wonders if all
the DISIP goons have been trained by
the Agency; he would like to meet their
American contacts:

The woman went on to say, in so
many words, that State was holding
steady at an expression of concern.
That afternoon, Branch met with
Propper and the senior F.B.I. agent an
the Letelier case. The agent was con-
vincingly determined to solve the mur-
ders. Branch sketched out what he knew
again. The agent 'advised him strongly
not to return to Venezuela, observing
that the DISIP was perfectly capable
of chopping off his hands and assem-
bling a dozen Venezuelans within thirty
minutes to swear it was an accident. He
felt the F.B.I had to put away the kill
ers, who had come to Washington-in
order to check the terrorists, boldness.
Otherwise Washington could gradually
turn into Miami, and Miami could turn
into Beirut..
Branch agreed and asked if the F.B.I.
was planning a trip to Venezuela. The
agent replied that he was not sure
of the Bureau's own physical safety.
there, and that furthermore the F.B.L
did not have jurisdiction for such a
trip. He outlined the restrictions on
the F.B.I. and CIA as they apply to
eases that are both domestic and inter
national, criminal and related to the
national security. It added up to catch-
22, but it did not destroy the agent's
confidence..
Branch's confidence, however, was
low. He was just offering to do what be
could again when a call came throngà
for Propper. The agent became excited
and asked Branch to excuse him. Oa
the way out the door, Branch overheard
the salutation: "Is that you, Jo
asked Propper. "Listen, are you call
from a pay phone? Okay. Give me the
number of another pay phone
there and I'll call you back.

racas and lifts it off the ground with
rage. The embassy promises to investi-
gale immediately. Rothchild begins to
reconsider his views on newspaper edi-
tors.
Camargo comes into the holding room
wearing the look of a man who has just
accomplished something.
"Your visas have been officially con
fiscated," he announces.
The reporters look at him blankly.
"What's new about that?” asks Inclán.
“You have had them all day.”
"Now they are permanently confis.
cated," says Camargo. He shows them
a new Venezuelan seal stamped on each
ora Over the seals, someone has
scrawled, “Visa fue revocada.”
Before the reporters have time to fig
ure out what this signifies, Camargo
gives the order to move out. He says the
plane is late. The goon squads ma-
terialize.
"
Inclán explains to Branch that they
are in big trouble. Even if Camargo
lets them go, she says, they could be
stopped ten feet outside the airport and
asked for their papers: They could be
slapped in prison for the "revocauta” on
their passports. For the first time they,
are not on solid legal ground. Branch
shakes his head wearily and tells Inclán
they have lost a round of hardball.
They follow a triumphant Camargo
to the plane.
Epilogue: More Pay Phones
On October 24, two days after the re-
porters left Caracas, Deputy Interior
1. Minister Marco Tulio Brunicelli talked
with the press to clear up the matter.
Brunicelli. said Hilda Inclán bad ar-
rived carrying documents that "did not
conform with national norms" and
that "she was cordially asked to leave
the country because it is necessary to
comply with our laws." As for Branch
and Rothchild, he declared that they
"expressed solidarity with their col-
league and decided to leave the coun-
try."
•
"
That same day, Branch was checking
with Cuban sources In Miami to End
out why Morales, had turned on him.
He received worse than a cold shoulder,
and some of his best Cuban friends told
him to stay out of Miami. The most
loyal veterans of the C.I.A.-people
who had spent years denouncing and
exposing terrorists as a detriment to
the anti-Castro cause--now supported
_ the terrorists and expected nothing but
opposition from the Agency. "If you
don't help the good people fight Castro,"
said one old C.I.A. Cuban, "then we have
to help the bad ones do it. There's noth-
- ing left but terrorism." Branch, was
stunned by how rapidly the anti-C.I.A.,
pro-terrorist trend had progressed in
even the two years since he had left
Miami. C.I.A. loyalists were now in very
short supply. The last defectors were
Cubans whose secret histories stretched
back to the Fifties and Sixties, when
their anti-Communist movement was in
the American mainstream. The C.I.A.
trained the Cubans to work by stealth-
to lie, smuggle weapons, move illegally
in and out of countries, make bombs

to
strike secretly against Castro tar-
8. Some of them were "official" ter-
rorists, who would stoically accept lung
jail sentences rather than reveal, a
C.I.A. secret. Now they were no longer
official.
Rothchild was back home in the Er-
erglades. On Monday he received the
first of several phone calls from a man
identifying himself as a "consultant to
the government of Venezuela." He
wanted to give Rothchild some money,
to write about Rothchild's background,
Very weird, thought-Rothchild. He be
gan to worry, that his trip to Caracas
would follow him.
Press reports from Venezuela quoted
interior ministry officials in Venezuela
as saying that Ricardo Morales "did
not cause the expulsion of the Ameri-
can journalista." In an official state-
ment on October 26 the ministry said
Morales "does not even work for the
DISIP
A few days later, Branch received a
A few days later, Branch received a
letter from someone in Venezuela who
was working on the terrorist network.
It came by messenger and read like
Sherlock Holmes: "The key to this
thing—whatever it is is Morales, and
the key to him is something you already
know. It seems that something he once
told you or knows you know will click
with something you would be likely to
hear here, or would reveal something
here, that he didn't want out. Think.”
ME
Branch went to see Eugene Propper,
the assistant U.S. attorney in charge
of the Letelier investigation. Propper
wanted to know about the Venezuela
trip because he was thinking of going
there himself. The leads pointed there,
he said. He asked questions about the
Cuban terrorists. Branch outlined what
he knew. He took a reading of Propper
and was satisfied that he wanted bädly
to solve the case, Branch only worried
that they were both way over their
heads. His worries skyrocketed when
Propper asked to see a copy of The
Miami News, which contained articles
about Morales and the Venezuela trip.
Propper knitted his eyebrows and
scrutinized the News as if it were a
moon rock. Something gave Branch a
sinking feeling. "The News and the
Herald in Bliami have an awful lot of
stuff about terrorists" he said. "You
have all that, don't you?”
"I don't think we get them," said
Propper.
"You have to have them," Branch
pleaded. Propper made a couple of un-
successful phone calls around the Jus-
tice Department and said he would get
these newspapers from the Library of
Congress as soon as possible.
✓ Branch knew what it must be like to
call the police station in the middle of a
robbery and find its phone disconnected.
He recovered and offered to do: any
thing he could to help, even to go back
to Venezuela.
"I've only got one major reservation,"
he said, "and that is the informant
problem. You have to rely on the F.B.I.
and the C.I.A. to investigate, and the
fact is that most of the suspects and
likely witnesses are old CIA. and
F.B.I. men of some sort.”
-
-
Pr `r said it could be handled. The
F.B:I. ople on the case would arrest
their own mothers if they had tụ. Thế -
terrorists had threatened to kill an
F.B.I. agent. The Bureau had two hun- -
dred agents on the case. It was the
biggest thing in the P.B.!.
"What about the Agency?” asked
Branch. "Look, I don't think the C.LA.
had anything to do with these murders,
but the terrorists are using their old
C.I.A. connections in more ways than
one. The Agency is in a bind. It has
created a monster. The whole world of
secrets in Miami has turned upside
down. But I'll bet those old pros over
at the Agency aren't about to sacrifice
their security and secrecy to help solve
a murder."
Propper said he was getting coopera-.
tion, reains of stuff in fact, Branch
asked him to test it. "Ask them for
their file on Luis Posada,” he said. “I
know they've got one on him. He came
into the Agency through the M.R.P:
before the Bay of Pigs. Ask the Agency
what it has about Põsada's involvement
with a bootleg assassination attempt
against Castro in 1965 involving a guy
named Herminio Diaz. Díaz was caught
and killed in Cuba. Now, if the Agency
doesn't have anything on that, they're
just giving you a lot of smoke." (Po-
sada is the Cuban detective from the
DISIP now held by the DISIP for the
Cubanà de Aviación bombing.)
2
Propper agreed. (On a later visit,
Propper would say he was getting
Agency cooperation but declined to give
Branch any details.)
On November 4, the State Depart
ment responded to Branch's request for
a position statement on the Venezuelan
expulsion, which the U.S. Embassy in
Caracas had been investigating. A
State Department representative read a :
portion of a press briefing as follows:
Q: What did he (Branch) say and
what's the State Department going to
do about it?
A: He described the dealings he and
two others had with the Venezuelan
authorities at Maiquetía Airport when
they arrived there last week. I'm not
going to discuss details of what he said.
That would be for him to do, if he
wishes. Our Embassy has expressed our
concern over this incident to the appro-
priate Government of Venezuela offi-
cials.
An hour later, an agitated woman
from the State Department called back.
"Mr. Branch," she said, "I'm afraid
there's been a big mistake. That brief-
ing that was just read to you does not
constitute the department's public posi-
tion. It is a guideline."
"What is a guideline?"
"It is a policy draft setting out what
the people here are authorized to say in
response to inquiries. What you have
there is what we would have said had
we been asked. But it is not what we
have said publicly. We have no record
of being asked on the record, although
some reporters may have inquired pri
vately, in which case we would have
responded according to the guideline."
"So what is the State Department's
position, then?”
continua.

1. The information provided below is taken from a Santo
Domingo Station liaison report transmitted to Headquarters under
HDCA-11074, dated 29 November 1976. The information dated 29
August 1976 was received by the liaison service from one of its
agents assigned to Miami, Florida. It is being sent to you for
information only. All information below was reportedly stated
in testimony at the trial of the Cuban terrorist Rolando Otero
in Jacksonville, Florida, and Antonio Gonzalez had obtained
immunity from prosecution. The declarations he made were cor-
roborated by Cubans Ciro Orizondo and Manuel Revuelta, former
comrades of Otero in the Frente de Liberacion Nacional Cubano
(FLNC).
2. According to Antonio Gonzalez, there have to be in
Miami up to 500 pro-Castro agents operating; that in a supposed
plot to kill Fidel Castro in Venezuela, there had been with him
and Rolando Otero, a Cuban named Ricardo Morales and infiltrating
into the affair, he tried to frustrate the plan. Gonzalez also
said that Morales, supposedly worked for the "CIAin the Congo"
and actually is an agent of the Government of Venezuela, used
to investigate those Cubans who enter and exit from Venezuela.
Gonzalez also said that in reality, Morales is a Castro agent.

guess." It is Hilda 1
11, a reporter for The Miami
News, standing in the aisle, looking down at us. She
is a specialist on Latin terrorism in Miami.
"Looks like it," says Branch, shrugging. So much for
the secret trip. Yet he is inclined to trust Inclán, even
though he and Rothchild had met her only that day,
while going through clips at the morgue of the News.
The three work out a way to make contact in Caracas.
Branch is embarrassed at being a little reserved.
Inclan is candid, her face cheerful and open.
☐☐ Inclán leans over and whispers, "Listen, I think you
should be careful. There's something strange going on.
This fight is crawling with cops and prosecutors from,
Miami."
Branch and Rothchild' turn their heads in unison,
and their necks sink down into their shoulders. There
are two young Latin men in the back with neatly
trimmed beards, unisex hairdos and brightly colored
shirts. There are several men in the front who do not
look like ordinary passengers. Rothchild decides there
might not be any ordinary passengers.
"What are they doing here?" Branch asks bluntly.
"Who knows?" says Inclán. "I know these guys from
Miami. They give me tips-sometimes. But now they
aren't giving me the time of day. I don't understand
them, so I'm going to act just like they are. I don't
think you should let them in on what you're up to,
either."
"Those cops are Cubans, aren't they?" Branch asks.
Inclán nods. Branch worries. Cubans on the Miami
police force are a strange lot, he has heard. The cops
want to infiltrate Cuban terrorist groups and drug-
· running organizations, but soinetimes it turns out that
the terrorists and drug runners are infiltrating the
cops.
Branch looks out the airplane window and pictures
Orlando Letelier lying in the middle of Massachusetts
Avenue, his legs blown off at the thigh, his torso pul-
verized, detectives all around. On the curb nearby sat
his passenger Ronni Moffitt, her eyes frozen, holding
her throat. The bomb in Letelier's car had blown a
sliver of metal through Ronni Moffitt's carotid artery,
and she was drowning in her own blood. Her husband
sat nearby, suffering from shock, watching his wife
die. She was twenty-five. The killers were the kind of
people who would machine-gun a whole crowd of people
in a public square just to hit their mark. They
wouldn't care about the others. Ronni Moffitt could just
as easily have been half the people Branch knew in
Washington. The next day Jerry Ford rode right over
the bloody spots in the road on his way to a reception
for the president of Liberia; he never said a word
about Washington's first gangland-style political as
sassination. Unwise to talk about it, especially if the
Branch and Rothchild exchange signs of bewilder
I force behind the murders is most likely the government as Inclán drifts back to her seat. "Jesus Christ,
ment of Chile. The military junta there overthrew
Salvador Allende with a big boost from the CIA,
which is still thick as thieves with the generals. Le-
telier was ambassador to the United States under Al-
lende, then foreign affairs minister, interior minister
Fand defense minister. He had been jailed and tortured-
by the generals after the coup, then, a year later, de-
ported, and in September of last year he was stripped
of his citizenship.
From the day of the murder, Branch had been-pon-
dering the bomb he thought was used on Letelier-
C4, a white, odorless dough resembling Silly Putty.
Branch had heard many Cubans tell tales about C-4
and its predecessor, C-3. It was the C.L.A.'s favorite
substance for sabotage in the war against Castro, and
thousands of Cubans were trained in its use. Branch
had not been surprised when evidence came out that::
Cuban exiles might have pulled the Letelier job, but
he was surprised by tips he received that they had also
killed hundreds of others on a big spree in the Carib--
bean. God, there is something big going on, he had
thought. And all his sources and his instincts told him
the answers were in Venezuela, of all places.
It was now October 21, one month to the day since
'the Letelier murder.
"So you decided to take a little trip to Caracas too, I.

The
Incident
by Taylor Branch and John Rothchild
How two mild-mannered reporters, on the
trail of a Washington bomber,
landed in Caracas and ran afoul of the
Venezuelan secret service, warring
Cuban terrorists, the Miami police, the State
Department, the C.I.A., the F.B.I.
and the most dangerous man alive—all
this, and their mothers didn't know
•
a damn thing about it

"Are There Pay Phones in Caracas?
"Well, it's true that all those people are down there,”
Branch says, "but I don't think they would be after
They are on the Pan Am night fight to Caracas; three
hours away from at least a hundred murder stories us.".
a:
and a lot of steaming intrigue.
"What are our chances of getting through this
'alive?" asks Rothchild.
.
Well, that all depends on who you talk to and how
paranoid they are," says Branch. "Our friends in
Washington used to be simple journalists and policy
analysts. Now they are three-pay-phone men. That
means you can't call them without using three pay
phones. You call them up and all they'll say is 'phone
number ore. Then they go to pay phone number one
and you call them again. Then they ask you for the
• number of another pay phone near yours, and they call
you on that one."
"What do you talk about?".
"Things like pay phones and letter bombs and wheth-
..er the Feds can be trusted. The last time I called they
told me we would be walking into four nests of known
killers: the Cuban exiles in Venezuela, the Venezuelan
secret police, the C.I.A. and the Chilean-secret police."
"Is that true?"
Rothchild does not look reassured. He does not like
the way Branch reels off the life histories of all the
- C.LA. Cubans he has known, especially since the point
is always that the situation is too complicated for
words. "Tell me," Rothchild says gravely, "did you tell
your mother you were going to Venezuela?"
Branch squirms at the cruel question. He wants to
appear as knowledgeable and confident as possible, be-
cause he has dragged Rothchild into this adventure on
less than a day's notice. "No, I didn't teil her," he ad-
mits. "It's too complicated. But I think we'll only have
one point of danger.”.
"When's the point of danger?"
“Well, we may get into the prison and get our an-
swers," Branch replies, "or we may get them from peo-
ple in the Venezuelan government. Either way, we'll
know who did the murders and who paid the killers
and what other murders they've done. That's what we
hope, anyway. If we get that information, we'll be hot
cntil we get rid of it. We'll have to phone it out of

John," Branch mutters. "I figured we'd be in for some
scrapes, but I never thought it would start before we
even got there." Then he's all business. "I've got to
give you a quick briefing on our main man while we
have the chance. We may not have as much leisure
time as we expected."
Branch pulls down their dinner trays and spreads out
a pile of notes and news clippings. Then he pulls out a
police mug shot. "Meet Orlando Bosch,” he says.
th
Rothchild stares incredulously at a porcine Cuban
man with a thin moustache and thick lips. "He looks
like the headmaster of a military school.”
"I know," Branch says, "but he's a killer. He's also
a pediatrician. This whole thing's like that—yin and
yang, Boston Strangler and Mad Hatter all mixed up."
Branch eyes the mass of clippings and notes, wonder-
ing where to begin. "It would take all night to go
through what I've heard about Bosch, so I'll get you.
up to Letelier as quick as I can for now. The back
ground is simple: Bosch has been a political terrorist
what they call an action man-ever since the late For-
ties in Cuba. He worked for Castro, then for the C.I.A.,
and then he denounced the C.I.A. He has been an anti-
Castro outlaw since the mid-Sixties, always telling the
Miami Cubans not to trust the C.I.A. in their war
against Castro. Now most of the hard-line Cubans be-
lieve him. Bosch is the patriarch of Cuban terrorism."
Branch pauses, then flips briskly through the clip-
pings. “Bosch got arrested and indicted pretty regular-
ly all through the Sixties. He usually got of. The wit-
nesses against him tended to sweat a lot and forget
things on the stand, if they even showed up. In gen-
eral, Bosch had a threefold operation: first, political
terror against Castro sympathizers; second, ordinary
crimes like extortion from rich people and companies
to finance the political terror; and third, all kinds of
wars and feuds with his terrorist rivals. Finally, Bosch

Miami harbor. He got ten years, but he was paroled
in 1972. That brings us to his international period.”
Branch picks up one particular clip and holds it in
readiness. "Bosch went underground two years after
his parole and the pace of Miami bombings escalated.
So did terrorist bombings against Castro's embassies ·
all over the world. Then, in 1974, important Cubans
started getting knocked off in gangland-style murders.`
A lot of groups, including Bosch's, took credit for
them. The word was that C.I.A. stooges were being
eliminated. Bosch became a phantom. Mysterious fig-
ures with names like Ernesto would pop up in the Mi-
ami press to speak for him. Here's a Miami News clip
from this period. It's headlined 'Bosch Declares War
on Castro.' Hilda wrote it. She's the last American re-
porter to interview Bosch. Shortly after it came out,
Bosch slipped out of the country.”
While Rothchild studies the clips, Branch continues.
"He got arrested in Venezuela about two years ago,
The Justice Department decided not to ask for his re-
turn to the United States despite all he's wanted for.
That's weird. Then the Venezuelans turned him loose
and he left with a bunch of Chilean bodyguards and a
big pile of money. I heard all kinds of stories about
Bosch being down in Chile with the Pinochet, junta
there, bargaining. Now the stories jump to February
of last year, when Bosch got arrested in Costa Rica
right before Kissinger visited.. The rumor is that he.
was plotting to assassinate Kissinger. Bosch got out
of Costa Rica somehow, and pretty soon there was a
secret meeting in the Dominican Republic of all the
major Cuban terrorist groups, which the Dominicans
allowed, of course. There was a negotiated truce, and
the terrorists united under Bosch in an umbrella group
called CORU, supposedly with the support of several
juntas in Latin Americà.
"Now in the last month there has been the Letelier ·
murder," Branch continues grimly. "The terrorists
showed that they were not afraid to kill in the United.
States, right in the capital. They have even thrëstened
. to kill one of the F.R.I. agents on the Letelier case.
And his fiancée. The anonymous threats show they
´have collected a lot of intelligence about the agent's
life. The F.B.I. is upset. Then, two weeks after Letelier
· was killed, terrorista blew up a Cuban plane near Rar-
bados, killing seventy-three people. Castro blamed the
C.I.A. and canceled the anti-skyjacking treaty. The
terrorists loved it: Castro and the Americans getting

“And you're Raúl.” Er. à gives him a limp hand-
shake and stumps down in his seat, Hilda lasian shakes
her head and walks off.
"Who's Raul" asks Rothchild.
“He's Rolando Martinez" son-in-law. One of the Was

Stories have been seeping out in the Venezuelan press

men, F.B.I. informants and a few veterans of the Ven-
ezuelan secret police, the DISIP. Some people say
DISIP has tortured the hell out of these guys, but
other people say DISIP is in bed with them-holding
them under protective custody till the heat blows over.
It's the biggest damn mess you ever saw."
"You folks wouldn't mind telling me who you are and
what you're up to, would you?”.
Rothchild and Branch look up at the man standing
in the aisle. He wears a leisure suit with a flashy shirt
opened to his sternum, showing a lot of tan and some
tufted chest hair. §.
:."Well” says Branch, “I'm not sure. What are you
doing? We're just thinking about racetracks and Cu-
bans and stuff like that.”
"Corse on now. You can tell me,” the man urgės.
"Don't tell him anything," says Hilda Inclán from
behind. She is laughing as if it were a game, but her
eyes signal a warning.
* Branch is way off-balance. "I'll take the fifth. Why
'don't we start with you?”
"Okay,” says the man, smiling. “I'll play it your way,
friend. My name's George Yoss. I'm an assistant
state's attorney out of Miami." He flashes an ID card.
• Branch and Rothchild can't believe it. He seems more
1 like a condominium salesman who wishes he could be a
golf pro. "Is that right, Hilda?" Branch asks.
"Yeah, but he's being a bad boy tonight," she re-
plies. “Tell him to mind his own business, whatever
that is.".
"Okay," says Yoss, "I'm going to give you one more
chance. I know you're a journalist. Why don't we start
- with who you work for?”
Branch looks down and notices that his hands have
been covering up the news clippings unconsciously.
These gave me away, eh?” he says weakly. "I'll tell
you what, You've got me a little paranoid. Why don't
you give me the name of your hotel and I'll call you
when we get our feet on the ground? We can talk this
over.
"Why don't we start with who you work for?" Yoss
persists. He is still kidding, but there is an edge to it.
"You may need me down here. You never know. This
is a strange country and you guys could find yourselves
on the next pläne out. I'll give you one more chance."
"I think I'll lay low for the moment," Branch says:
Yoss makes a few more thrusts, then saunters off: "
Maybe I was too set on getting into the country on
the sly.” Bränch says. "That sure didn't work out. This
figer's like a goddamn convention! Tell me, Hilda.
None of the Cuban cops is named Raúl Diaz, I hope?”
:“That's Diaz right behind you,” she replies.
Oh shit!" says Branch. He turns slowly in his seat
and ends himself staring at one of the handsome'
Cubans
„You must be Taylor Branch," Raúl Diaz says with

"What's so bad about that?" asks Rothchild.
"I don't know. It's just that he probably knows who
my Cuban contacts are, and I don't know what the hell
he's up to. You see, sonic of the people who have been
telling me about the terrorists are right-wingers and
some of them are left-wingers. I don't care about any.
thing except the Letelier murder, but I think it would
be healthy for us if we could keep the two groups
separate. The only way we can do that is to stay kind
of incognito."
"You're doing great so far," Rothchild saya. His
mind has been wandering over the Rosch briefing.
“What makes you think we can get into the prison to
see Bosch and his friends?" he asks. "And why would
they want to talk to us?”.
"It's a long shot," Branch answers. "But Bosch is in
a tough spot. The Castro government wants him, and
Bosch knows that would mean curtains for him. He
also knows that he could get killed any day in Vene-
zuela by either his friends or his enemies. He may fig-
ure that his best chance to survive is to come to the
United States. What we hope is that he wants to get
some of his story out in the American press to forcs
the government to turn the screws and get him back in
the States. That's what I hear from some of our Vene-
zuelan contacts. I don't know if it's true, but they are
pretty high up. Now even if we can't talk to Bosch and
the other prisoners directly, we might get stuf iadi-
rectly from the Venezuelans."
•
"What happens if all the Venezuelan contacts turn
out to be flaky?”
"Then we'll just have to poke around," says Branch.
"I have a lot of names. There's only one guy I know
down here personally. He's a Cuban named Ricardo
Morales. I interviewed him back in 1971, just before
he came to Venezuela. People in Miami tell me he's
way up high in the DISIP, the secret police. I don't.
know what he's doing now, but he might be a good
fallback if nothing else works out."
Rothchild is encouraged. At least Branch knows one
real person. "What's he like?"
--"He's one of the most cynical people I've ever met,
Branch replies, "but I liked him anyway. He doesn't
have any illusions about the business he's in, and he
makes fun of all the people who do. Ricardo is an old
operator, even though he's only in his late thirties. He
worked for Castro's secret police. Then he worked for-
the C.I.A. as an explosives expert. He fought for the
Agency in the Congo in the mid-Sixties, and then be
cainé an F.B.I; informant. He's the guy who got Bosch
convicted in: 1969. Small world, isn't it? He surfaced
in court with everything on tape. Then all hell broke
´loose. Morales' car was blown up. He survived but
blamed Rosch for trying to kill him. Morales himself
'was indicted for first-degree murder, but he got off
. He's a survivor if there ever was one."
"So he must hate Bosch, then," says Rothchild.
"Well, yes," says Branch. continued
