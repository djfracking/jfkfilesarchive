MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE OF:
KENT, William
FROM: Office of the Personnel Director
511
1. On 6 June 1952
Selective Service Headquarters
this office arranged with
National
to have the above-named subject's active
duty orders cancelled. This action was taken because, due to his train-
ing and experience, it was felt that the subject would be of more service
to the United States as an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency
than he would be as a member of the Armed Forces.
2. Should the subject resign or otherwise be separated from CIA,
please notify this office immediately in order that this cancellation
action may be revoked and the subject will be made a free agent.
George & Melon
GEORGE E. MELCON
Acting Personnel Director
For the Use of PD(C) or PD(0)
Office of the Personnel Director notified on
the subject has resigned or otherwise been separated from CE.

I am aware of the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency,
by reason of the sensitive nature of its work, must observe very
strict security measures. I agree to honor the requests of CIA
relative to my application whether it be accepted or rejected. I
agree not to inform anyone that I am being considered for a posi-
tion in CIA. If questioned directly, I will say that I have applied
for positions in various government agencies, and if pressed for an
answor will acknowledge that CIA is one of them but will attach no
particular significance to such application. I agree not to dis-
