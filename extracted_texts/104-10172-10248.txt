CAN ANGE PAOLAING
DURING A HEETING WITH WEYDE] ON 21 MAY 63 HE REFERRED
HE STATED THAT ON
TO HIS VISIT TO WASHINGTON TO DEBRIEF AELADLE .
ONE OCCASION, WHILE HE AND DR. NEIER WERE RIDING IN A CAR WITH AELA LE
AELADLE CASUALLY REFERRED BY NAME TO A KGB CFFICER PRESENTLY ASSIGNED
IN GERMANY, COMMENTING THAT HE KNEW THE INDIVIDUAL VERY WELL AND
KNEW THAT HIS FOLITICAL VIEWS WERE THE SAME AS HIS OWN, BUT THAT
WESTERN INTELLIGENCE SHOULD LEAVE THE INDIVIDUAL ALONE AS HE WOULD
PROBABLY ONE DAY MAKE THE SAME DECISION AS AELADLE ON HIS OWN.
AFTES
2. BY THE TIME WEYDE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT
AELADLE WAS SAYING THE NAME HAD SLIPPED BY AND NEITHER HE NOR
06 DR. MEIER WAS ABLE, OR FELT HE COULD ASK FOR THE NAME AGAIN.
LEAVING AELADLE BOTH (WEYDE AND MEIER TRIED TO RECALL THE NAME OF THE
INDIVIDUAL BUT COULD ONLY AGREE THAT THE NAME BEGAN WITH AN A
IN REVIEWING THE PRESENT SOVIETS ASSIGNED IN THE GFR WHOSE NAMES
BEGIN WITH "A WEYDE TENDS TO THINK THE NAME MENTIONED MIGHT HAVE
BEEN AKHLUYEN (LOT-294340), ALTHOUGH HE IS FAR FROM CERTAIN ON THIS
POINT.
3. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION IN OUR FILES ON AKHLUYE
AND NUNE INDICATING KGB AFFILIATION. HE ARRIVED AT THE SIM ON
16 FEBRUARY 61 ALONG WITH HIS WIFE, IS CARRIED BY THE BFV] AS AN
EMPLOYEE OF THE TRADE MISSION, AND RESIDES WITHIN THE 20TRADE MISSION
BUILDING.
4. THE ABOVE LEAD, ALTHOUGH VERY SKETCHY, APFEARS DEFINITED
WORTH PURSUING AND WE WONDER IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO QUERY AELADUE
SOME MANNER.06[WEYDE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT AELABLE DESIRED TO PROTECT
THE INDIVIDUAL FROM ANY INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES BASED ON HIS INFORMATI
SO HE HAS PROBABLY NOT SUBMITTED ANY DETAILS. IT MAY, HOWEVER, PROYE
PROFITABLE TO REVIEW WITH AELADLE AGAIN SOME OF THE SOVIETS ASSIGNED IN
WEST GERMANY AND WORK IN ALL THE HA'' NAMES. AELADLE MIGHT THUS GIVE
SOME INFORMATION WHICH WOULD HELP US TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF THE
INDIVIDUAL HE MENTIONED IN THE CAR. PLS ADVISE IF THIS IS POSSIBLE
