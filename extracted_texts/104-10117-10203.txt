In April 1967 a discussion von held between an Agency representative
and Kim TAEPS and May BS of the NCOMP (World Confederation of
Organizations of the Tesabing Profession) concerning future funding for
WCUTP. Baaause of publicity concerning the funding of WOOP by the Vernica Find,
MCOTP leadership promised its membership that no further Vernon Fund money
would be necepted until the status of the Vernon Fund was clarified. John
THOMPSON felt that the best solution would be a one-time only infusion of
money by sterile check into the HCOTP bank account to be backstopped by a
Letter from the attorney for the Vernon Find, Bryce KEA, who would attribute
the money to members of the Vernon Fund Board who anonymously wished to
provide HCUTP with sufficient funds to cover expenses until other smITONS
stuld be found.
