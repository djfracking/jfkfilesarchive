|| 13 February 1952
1. When Rose of OPC was in New York on 23 January 1952 to discuss
cover with Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secy. of the Research Institute of:
America, Mr. Cherne requested additional information as to what was to
be expected of him in his role as a backstop to the cover being established
for the OPC man. The following information has been forwarded by OPC,
and is quoted below. Mr. Rose requests that you pass this information
on to Mr. Cherne.
a. "Mr. Acon, who has his MA in International Economic Relations
from the University of Chicago, has been working for ECA. He has
been hired by the Research Institute of America to do economic
research and writing for their weekly newsletter, on economic
subjects having to do with Western Europe. (Mr. Acon mows Dutch,
German, French and Italian.) It could be admitted that he would
like eventually to do such writing abroad, but has not yet found
a way.
b. "His hiring may be delayed for some time. Mr. Leo Cherne will
be informed when the story is to be used. By that time, Mr. (Acon
will have called on Mr. Cherne."
2. We are closing this case. Should further action be required,
we will reopen.

1. This will confirm Mr. Rose's verbal request that the
Contact Division/00 ask its Boston field office to arrange
appointments for Mr. (Edward Rose of Cover Division, PLANS/OSO,
to see Mr. William A. Barron, Chairman of the Board, Gillette
Safety Razor Company, and Mr. John E. Toulmin Senior Vice
President of the First National Bank of Boston, at their con-
venience on Wednesday May 21, 1952. The purpose of the isit
is to explore the willingness of these gentlemen to act as
ostensible donors of funds to support a current operation.
2. This will also confirm Mr. Rose's request that the
New York City field office of the Contact Division/00 arrange
an appointment for Mr. Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, President
of the Research Institute of America at Mr. Cherne's conven-
ience on Thursday May 22, 1952.
May 22, 1952. Mr. Cherne, who has for some
time been backstopping the activities of an agent in this
country, has apparently expressed willingness to provide
cover for this agent abroad. The purpose of the interview is
to discuss more fully Mr. Cherne's proposal. Cover Division
would be happy to have an 00 field office representative
present to insure continuity.
J
3. As a result of the above requests, Mr. Barron found
to his regret that he was unable to cooperate with the Agency
at the present time. Mr. Toulmin, on the other hand, was
most cooperative. Mr. Cherne, unfortunately, was out of town.
The New York field office has been asked to try to arrange a
meeting with Mr. Cherne, as outlined above, for Wednesday
afternoon, June 4, 1962.

MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD
SUBJECT
Backstopping of Cover by the Research Institute
of America
:
1. Pursuant to conversations between Mr. Rose and Mr. Engels of
CIA/ope and Mr. Travis of 00/Contacts, an appointment was made for Mr.
Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secretary of the Research Insti-
tute of America, 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, to explore the
willingness of Mr. Cherne to backstop the cover story of a proposed
agent in training. The appointment was made, and kept, for Wednesday.
morning, 23 January 1952 in New York City in the presence of Mr. Clark
of the New York branch of the Contacts Division.
The proposed story of the agent in question, who had bɩin em-
ployed on the economic research side of ECA specializing in Italy, was
that he wished to resign from ECA and take up an offer to be extended
to him in civilian employment. Since the Research Institute of America
seamed to fit in naturally with his background and activities in ECA,
Mr. Cherne was asked:
&. If he would backstop the agent's story that he was
quitting ECA to take employment with the Research Institute of
America during his three months period of training with CIA,
and
b. Whether he would in fact employ the agent) and send
him as a representative of the Institute to Italy at the con-
clusion of his period of training.
Mr. Cherne replied that unfortunately the latter was impossible
inasmuch as his company did not send personnel overseas in any capacity.
As regards the immediate backstopping of the agent's story, however,
Mr. Cherne said that he would be happy to oblige for a period of train-
ing only, to wit, three months, after which other cover would have to
be sought. Mr. Cherne requested that he be furnished at an early date
with more complete information as to what was to be expected of him
in his role as a backstop and further stated that he would like to
meet the agent personally as soon as could be arranged. This has been
communicated to Mr. Engela, the case officer, who will oblige at the
earliest opportunity.
