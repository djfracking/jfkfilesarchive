SUMMARY OF AGENCY. EMPLOYMENT
JOSEPH B. SMITH
:
September 1951 to January 1954
January 1954 to August 1956
-
Began employment with the Depart-
ment of the Army as a Civil Service
employee in grade GS-11, assigned
to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.
as a research analyst of economics
and political affairs concerning
Korea. Because of my wartime
experience and some post war grad-
uate work on Korea, I was contacted
by the Army for this position during
the Korean War.
In 1954 I applied for employment..
with the United States Information
Service as an Information Officer
with the Grade of Foreign Service
Staff S. I served on the U.S.I.S.
Mission in the Far East area. My
duties included design execution
-
and supervision of the U.S.I.S.
media operations in the Far East.
Also I was special liaison repre-
sentative with the British Infor-
mation Officer for the British High
Commissioner for that area.

alluded to above, means that Subject is not able fully to
use and to demonstrate his great oporational talent and
flair in this field. What wo have here to do is done well
under his able management.
For one reason or another, I think largely because of
his having been in more or less specialized jobs, although
sonior ones, rather than having been in a command position,
Subject has lost ground in promotions, having been in grade
since December, 1962. I should like to see him promo tod
in this position or, if this is difficult, to see him given
a chance in a command job which might qualify him for
promotion.

I agree with all of the above. Concerning his performance here
and his delay in getting a promotion, I made a special point of
bringing these matters to the attention of Deputy Chief, WOMACE,
while I was in Washington in October of 1971. Our pending re-
organization would find him with considerably increased responsibility,
which is a good indicator of how wo feel about him.

I agree with all of the above. Subject does a marvelous job in

reduced (in number and cost) propaganda apparatus. He has a good
sense of politics, and wo have a few oporations which are devoted
to finding out what the GOM won't tell us and what the political
section probably can't get at. He has a good way with people and has
made some interesting acquaintances which, in themselves, greatly
increase the sensitivity of the station.

Concur fully with above and would add that Subject is one of the
Station's most aggressive and effective development/contact officers.
In what has been an almost complete reorganization of the Station and
the termination or redirection of most of its assets, Subject has
probably moved faster and more effectively than any other section.
Perhaps even more notable, his development of new assets and potential
assets has more than kept pace with the termination of those who have
outlived their usefulness. While he is very thorough and effective
in all of his undertakings, a tendency to go off on tangents has a
slight effect on his overall efficiency. This is probably due in large

Mr. Smith lives covert action. his imaginative and disciplined/
mind comes forth with many operational concepts and ideas ranging
from simple, quite routine matters to complicated and, carefully
shaded activities. It is to be expected that within this enthusiastic
outpouring, practical details of implementation are sometimes buried.
In these instances, Mr. Smith quickly trims his sails and comes forth
with the needed realistic approach. In short, he is a fine operations
officer, more competent and at ease in real as against planning or
policy situations.

As indicated in the last Fitness Report, Mr. Smith assumed responsibility for
Covert Action training presented by this Branch in the wall of compromise of a wide
range of Agency CA activities. Quite apart from all the operational consequences of
these public disclosures, there were also, of course, concomitant ramifications in
the training field. Following careful study and examination of the new situation, Mr.
Smith devised, in closest coordination with the CA Staff, a radically new and different
Covert Action curriculum. The existing comprehensive courses on youth and labor
operations were discontinued for obvious reasons. In place of these and the part-time
Covert Action Operations Course, Mr. Smith developed a new, full-time, three-day
Covert. Action Operations Seminar for middle and senior grade officers. This inten-
sive seminar, stressing the integrated nature of CS operations, was designed as a
basic core around which skills-oriented seminars or workshops could be built to deal
with such topics as propaganda operations, election operations, use of agents of
influence, etc. To date, in line with this concept, a Politics Workshop has been
created to provide training in the assessment, recruitment, and handling of assets
among key interest groups; including political parties..
The resonance which these new courses has evoked confirms the soundness of
Mr. Smith's creative efforts in completely revamping Covert Action training in the

Concur. Mr. Smith has done his job with distinction and with credit to himself
and his career service. His assignment to OTR is a first-rate example of quality
in rotational tours. At the same time he has given a good deal to the training
mission, I think it also fair to say he has gained professionally from the rather wide
exposure to disciplines other than CA which he has handled extremely well,

In summary, Mr. Smith is a niature and responsible officer, keeps
things nicely in perspective, and has a good sense of priorities. In
tackling problems he strives to make molchills out of mountains, which
is a refreshing change; in short, a dedicated and intelligent officer and,
withal, unfailingly cordial and cooperative.

Agency. In design and content the new courses reflect thoughtfulness,
imagination, and realism--a combination of traits only too seldom
encountered.
As a corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr. Smith has also
successfully run, in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological Warfare
Operations Course for military officers being assigned to MACV/SOG in
Saigon. Finally, in the CA field, Mr. Smith has provided tutorials, as
requested by various area Divisions, to a number of Staff and Contract
Agents and to foreign liaison representatives in such fields as black radio,
youth and student operations, veterans organizations, and methods of
countering Communist propaganda.
In February 1968 Mr. Smith was asked to assume responsibility as
Tradecraft Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations Support Course, a
critical block of instruction for (primarily young and inexperienced) CS
clerical's headed for overseas assignments where they may be called upon
to assist case officers in operational support tasks. Although, strictly
speaking, this teaching and coordination task was outside Mr. Smith's
normal purview and main area of expertise, he accepted this additional
responsibility with exemplary willingness, and then proceeded to discharge
it smoothly, energetically, and effectively. In addition to managing an
extensive live problem, the Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that prosen-
tations by a number of instructors result in a balanced and coherent coverage
of all'operational subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of
efforts of several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal
aegis of the course's Chief Instructor, and; thus, demands a great deal of
finesse and tact. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in a
highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long Field experience.
for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course.
Mr. Smith occasionally handles Branch-wide administrative tasks
and in my absence functions as Acting Chief, Headquarters Training
Branch, to my complete satisfaction. At such times he has exercised
supervisory responsibilities well. He is cost conscious and makes effective.

AFR 21 9 27 AH '67.
Since his assignment to Headquarters Training Branch of the Operations
School, Mr. Smith has been principally engaged in a thorough study and review.
of all courses in Covert Action previously given in OTR. This has been a long
and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been compounded by the necessity,
at least in part through public events, to plan and project a total revision of
instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity
to teach. This will come shortly, however, when a new course begins on 8 May.
The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly
professional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under-
taken. He has been eminently successful in establishing useful new relationships
and in maintaining his old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of
laying a solid groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsi-
bilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted by the CA Staff in a survey of
one of its activities. This is fine testimony for the regard in which he is held
outside the confines of his present job. The prognosis for a very effective
performance in all of his teaching assignments is excellent. He has no super-
visory responsibilities and is average in cost consciousness.

Subject has been under the direct
supervision of this
rating officer for a period of 14 months. This report is being submit-
ted because of the transfer of the employee. For the last 6 weeks
of the period covered by this report Subject was under the direct
supervision of the COS because of the absence from the Station of this
rating officer. Any differences of opinion with respect to the caliber
of Subject's performance during the last six weeks will be reflected
in the reviewing officer's comments..

During this period, as in the preceding period, Subject carried
out all of his assigned duties and responsibilities in a highly pro-
fessional and thoroughly competent manner. He continued to show a
good deal of initiative and imagination in dealing with the liaison
services on day to day matters. He demonstrated a keen sense of the
internal political situation and he made maximum use of his contacts
to elicit a large amount of disseminable information. Subject look
over one new operational project during this period and he was able,
because of his deep knowledge and understanding of the operational
techniques employed in the CA field, to improve on the quality of the
agent's product. Subject is an able and fully qualified officer who
acquired a good deal of expertise about local operating conditions
and then proceeded to apply his specialized knowledge and past exper-

that the goal in large measure has been achieved, 1.0., a substantial

a not inconsiderable achievement in that this is a joint undertaking
with the local service. Specific Duty No. 2 lists three unilateral

business and living in Argentina, Subject's political action project
was reactivated during this period with the return to Buenos Aires of
the principal agent. This activity shows promise of making an important
contribution to understanding the political tides at work in Argentina.
Subject has developed a long-time agent in the linison service (and
recruited his wife) to a point where the "take" has been considerably
improved. Subject's project management remains good and his reporting
is both timely and in depth.
Subject supervises an American Staff Agent under deep cover in
which effort Subject exhibits a high degree of competence. This officer
continues to show an admirable cost consciousness which can be demon-
strated in his management of a large and important CA liaison project;
the costs to the Agency of this project have been reduced about 65%
since subject assumed direction while at the same time improving the
end result. Subject's Spanish continues to improve and he has no
difficulty in understanding and in speaking with Argentines who have
no English.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
Operations Officer
BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL
Frederick Larkin, Jr. /n/
From fairly close observation of his work I agree generally with
ratings and comments of supervisor. The rating of "outstanding" on
his work with liaison was justified in his last report because of the
exceptional job he had done in developing this relationship. While
he has continued to maintain it at a high level, there is some question
in my mind whether a rating of "outstanding" is still justified. He
is definitely a strong and active officer, handling a heavy load of 11-
aison and independent operations. A well-rounded judgement of this
officer should, however, include the statement that he sometimes rushs
ahead a bit too precipitously and enthusiastically, and is inclined to
gloss over operational details which can be important. He is effective

Subject's rapport with his agents and other
contacts appears to be excellent, which is doubtless
an important element in his continuing success with his
projects. Subject is responsive to guidance and
direction and when after full discussion a. course of
action is agreed upon, he can be counted upon to take

wants to do with and where to take his projects. In the case of the project Aun
with the local service, Subject inherited an expensive project of which little
control had been exercised in either effective utilization of funds or the actual
operations. After analyzing the project to determine the state of assets,
capabilities, etc., Subject ingratiated himself in a highly commendatory way with
the Argentines concerned to the end that Subject's ideas and positive cooperation
are now sought on a daily basis. This has resulted in greatly improved project
management and, better, more demonstrable results for the money spent.
Also, during this period Subject developed and recruited one new agent, a
leading political scientist with access to important political leaders. In addition
Subject inherited a project in the motion picture field which he has developed into
an effective mechanism which now promises to reach into the newspaper field.
In addition to the above three projects, Subject is case officer for two staff
agents who between them handle four projects." Subject has had these responsibilities
for less than three months and during this period he has handled these assignments
proficiently..
Subject's language competence (Spanish) is proficient; he is able to converse
meaningfully in Spanish with persons of intelligence interest who have no English.

I am in general agreement with the supervisor's assessment of this
individual, whom I have seen fairly frequently. He is extremely active and
aggressive and has moved ahead rapidly into new activities in both the liaison
and unilateral field, He has only recently taken over the direction and
supervision of two other case officers so it is too early to know what his
abilities in this area are, but it is in this direction that he should work for
broadening his career potential.

Continuation of Section C, Fitness Report, attachment to HABT-2308, 24 May 1963
Subject has no important weaknesses. His aggressiveness and eagerness
have at times led to hasty action that might have resulted in professionally
embarrassing results. On the other hand, these very qualities resulted in a
recent and important recruitment. Subject is responsive to guidance and
direction. He reports fully and within time limits. Subject's rapport with
those with whom he is in professional contact appears excellent.

Mr. Smith was head of the Venezuela Desk at the beginning of the reporting
period. He left this position shortly thereafter in preparation for an overseas
assignment, with another much of WHD. During his duty with WH/1, Mr. Smith
was a strong asset. with his previous operational experience and his innate good
sense, he supervised the Venezuela Desk in a most effective fashion. This was
particularly evident during the Presidential visit to Venezuela and Colombia in
December 1961. The effective management of the Headquarters aspects of the visit
called for a well-coordinated, efficient and intensive effort by all concerned.
Mr. Smith and the personnel under his supervision reasured up quite well in this
situation.

of the undersigned. He brought wide experience and background in CA work to the
Branch due to his past experience in other components of KUBARK. Ho was applying
himself industriously to the task of learning about the WH area and specifically
Venezuela, for which country he was the desk officer responsible for FI as well as
CA work. His performance was excellent and can be expected to improve with more

resssigned to another Branch in Feb 1962 in preparation for an overseas assigument, he
demonstrated high competence is all of his duties, thereby confiring the rating

determining
Mr. Smith has demonstrated both competence and versatility since his
assignment to CA/PROP. With no prior experience in the area, he was assigned
to WH affairs and has quickly developed both a surprising knowledge of the problem a
of that volatile group of countries and an excellent rapport with members of the
Division (which, on several occasions has indicated a strong interest in securing his
services when his release from the staff can be arranged). Assignments are com -
pleted with dispatch and in good order. .
The rating of 3 with regard to the proposed campaign on Neutralism-
Nationalism reflects only that we have not yet got underway in this admittedly
difficult and controversial field. The sum of research which Mr. Smith has done
in this field leads him to the present conclusion (in which undersigned concurs) that
unlike most of our other campaigns this will have to be conducted on a selected
country basis and differently tailored for each.

During the absence of the rating official Mr. Smith has acted as Branch Chief.

Strass strengths and monknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicato suggestions made to employee for improvement of his
work. Give recommandations for his training, Doscribe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater ro.
sponsibilities, Amolity or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining
future personnal ections.
Subject is an exceptionally able political action officer.
His capacity
for grasping a rapidly developing political situation quickly and for making
on-the-spot decisions is quite unique, and he would be a powerful addition to
any station with a challenging political program. He is not always able to
separate the significant from the insignificant and therefore tends to over-
report. He is also inclined to operate more as a singleton than as an inte-.
grated member of an operations team. He has been quite successful in
exploiting PP contacts for FI by-product. Additional training does not
appear necessary at this time.
.
In preparing this report, careful consideration was given to the guidance
in FS Field Dispatch No. 20-40 which recognizes the principle of rating the
individual against the group, and establishes an "average" rating as being an
entirely satisfactory performance. The supervisor, however, considers this
fitness report to be in keeping with that guidance.

Bubject has a well developed background applied to PP operations in the Far East.
He has continually demonstrated initiative and imagination in obtaining the maximum
production from his projects, and has developed new assets of definite value to the
Station. He is a capable handler of agents, and has particular potential in the
political action field. He has proven especially effective in a special election
project in which he handled and developed numerous high level contacts. No particular
weaknesses were observed. Subject is well qualified for senior operational assignments,
in either PP or FI, and is recommended for promotion. Bince subject is planning to
return for a second tour, no additional training is recommended at this time.

COMMENT OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:
9 November 1959
HALSEY, ROCHON and I have carefully reviewed this Fitness
Report in order to comply with division policy of avoiding
overrating. We are satisfied that TOOHILL, who has been given a
high rating with respect to specific performance characteristics,.
fully merits such rating. During the fourteen years I have been
with the Agency, I have had the opportunity to observe personally.
a good number of political action operation officers. Addition-
ally, I have worked closely with TCOHILL during the current
1959 Philippine election. I have no hesitation in stating that
I regard him as an unusually qualified officer for political
action in the field. I believe also that he should be promoted
as soon as practicable from GS-13 to GS-14.

Mr. Joseph B. Smith has made an outstanding contribution to CIA opera-
tions for the past 21 years. He has consistently received strong/outstand-
ing efficiency reports in a wide variety of assignments, including two in
the Far East (Singapore/Malaya and Manila) and two in Latin America (Buenos
Aires and Mexico City). At Headquarters he served as Chief of the Malaya/
Australia Branch in FE Division, on the CA Staff, in WH Division on the Ven
ezuelan Desk and the Division CA Staff, and in OTR on a rotational tour.
Mr. Smith is a recognized authority on Covert Action. While with OTR
he was commended for his efforts in completely revamping the CA curriculum.
In close coordination with the CA Staff he organized two totally new CA
seminars, both of which evoked a very positive response. He also received
praise for organizing and conducting a training course for military officers
destined for Saigon where they were to conduct psychological warfare opera-
tions. In Argentina he worked in liaison with local services on Covert Ac-
tion operations. This work with liaison was rated as outstanding. He de-
veloped a long-time agent in one of the services to a point where the pro-
duct was considerably improved. Political contacts at all levels developed
by: Mr. Smith in Mexico City have been instrumental in developing dissemin-
Jable intelligence. In all his assignments his rating officers have consis-
tly praised his imagination, flexibility, enthusiasm, perception and
professionalism.
:
Mr. Smith's career has been one of exceptional achievement and he has
made an outstanding contribution to the Agency's Covert Action program and
to Agency training. His record of commendations and sustained superior per
formance of duty of value to the Agency throughout his career make it fitting
that he be awarded the Career Intelligence Medal upon

⠀ MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services Career
Service Board (Panel A)
SUBJECT
: Joseph B. Smith
->>
Recommendation for
J
Promotion from GS-14 to GS-15
1. Mr. Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the
OTR Operations School in October 1966 specifically to assume respon-
sibility for Covert Action training. He spent the first few months in
a thorough study and review of all CA courses previously given in OTR.
This was a long and complicated job, compounded in part by the public
compromise of a wide range of Agency CA activities. In closest coordi-
nation with the CA Staff, Mr. Smith devised a totally new and different..
CA curriculum, consisting of two short seminars for middle and senior
grade officers one called a Covert Action Operations Seminar and
one a Politics Workshop. These seminars, emphasizing the integrated
nature of CS operations, have evoked a very positive response, con-
firming the soundness of Mr. Smith's creative efforts in revamping
CA training in this fashion.
--
2. As a corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr. Smith has
also successfully run, in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological
Warfare Operations Course for military officers being assigned to
MACV/SOG in Saigon. Finally, in the CA field, Mr. Smith has pro-
vided tutorials, as requested by various area Divisions, to a number
of Staff and Contract Agents and to foreign liaison representatives; in
such fields aa black radio, youth and student operations, veterans
organizations, and methods of countering Communist propaganda.
3. In February 1968 Mr. Smith was asked to assume respon-
sibility as Tradecraft Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations
Support Course, a critical block of instruction for (primarily young

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA

FROM

F. W. M. Janney
SUBJECT
-
Director of Personnel
: Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith
:
1
1. (U) Action Requested: None; this memorandum is in response
to your request of 15 May 1978 to provide you with a very brief rundown
on Mr. Joseph Burkholder Smith.
2. (C) Mr. Smith was born in 1921, holds B.A. and M.A. degrees in
History and has studied at the Ph.D. level in this field. He served
as a Corporal in the U.S. Army (1943-46) and from 1946-51 he was an
Assistant Professor of History at Dickinson College. He entered on duty
with the Agency in September 1951 as a CS-09 and reached the GS-14 level
before his retirement in June 1973. At the time of his retirement, he
was assigned to the DDO/Western Hemisphere Division. He received the
Career Intelligence Medal. Overseas assignments included Singapore
1954-56; Manila 1958-60; Buenos Aires 1962-66; and his last assignment,
Mexico City 1969-73.
3.
(S) Apparently after retirement, he wrote a book, Portrait of
a Cold Warrior, which he did not submit for security review or for ECT
approval. This book was already printed in advance uncorrected proofs
when the Agency first learned of its publication. It contained classified
information; however, the Office of General Counsel advised us that it was
the final decision of this Agency and the Department of Justice that we
would not pursue civil action against Mr. Smith. In this sort of action
you must prove damages. The Operations Directorate was reluctant for
security and sensitivity reasons to point up those areas wherein we
had been damaged.
4. (U) In the event you wish to read further on this subject,
we have attached papers furnished us by Mr. John Greaney of the Office of
General Counsel.

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments
where they may be called upon to assist case officers in operational
support tasks. Although, strictly speaking, this teaching and coordi-.
nation task was outside Mr. Smith's normal purview and main area
of expertise, he accepted this additional responsibility with exemplary
willingness, and then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically,
and effectively. In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the
Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of
instructors result in a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational
subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of efforts of
several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal aegis
of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of
finesse and tact. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in
a highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long field
experience for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course.
".
4. During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, he was requested to
participate as a member of a Survey Team in a review of the effective -
ness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff. In a 30 June 1967
memorandum of appreciation to the Director of Training, Chief, CA
Staff commented as follows on Mr. Smith's work:
"Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most
effective professional manner bringing to bear
his extensive background in the Clandestine
Services. His direct and objective approach
to the problems considered in the course of
the survey made his contribution to the over-
all Team effort.invaluable. The Team report,
which I am still in the process of discussing
within the Staff, will be of considerable value
not only to this Staff in our future planning, but
also, I feel, to the future posture of the covert
propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services;
thus, I heartily commend Mr. Smith for his
effective participation with the Survey Team
in this effort."

C. All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at
the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility.
While integrated you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home
leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of
your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization.
Upon termination of your integration, your unused annual leave, sick
leave, and home leave will be transferred to your credit with this
organization and your leave record will be reconstructed as of the
beginning of the leave year in which you return to this organization,
as explained in the Handbook on Leave for Special Situations. Serving
in an integrated capacity does not permit the carryover from one leave
year to another of an annual leave balance which exceeds the ceilings
authorized by regulations of this organization and the Federal leave
law. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a
lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, upon your "resignation" you
will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization,
including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility in order
to receive credit for such annual leave.
You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all
information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released
in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such
secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the espionage laws,

5. In his last two fitness reports Mr. Smith has received a
"Strong" rating and the Chief of the Operations School as reviewing
official has added his opinion that Mr. Smith has done his job with
distinction and with credit to himself and his career service, citing
the assignment to OTR as a first-rate example of quality in rotational
tours. While Mr. Smith passed on his expertise through the training
process, he also enhanced his own versatility through involvement
in the various training activities cited above.
6. In recognition of the foregoing, it is felt that Mr. Smith
is qualified to carry out the duties of the GS-15 grade for which he
is recommended. Mr. Smith has been in grade 5 1/2 years.

Smith has worked under my supervision on two occasions,
once in the Philippines and most recently in the Office of Training.
Both jobs were in the CA field where Smith is, I believe, one of the
: Agency's most experienced officers. My own view is that Smith
made an outstanding contribution to Agency training, particularly
in CA, during his recent tour with OTR.

Appreciation: Joseph Smith
1
_
-
With your approval Mr. Joseph Smith, of OTR partici-
pated as a member of the Survey Team which during January
March 1967 reviewed the effectiveness of the Propaganda Group
of tho CA Staff. This involved 30 full Team meetings, int
inter
views with 57 CS officers, various specific inquiries, and
numerous drafting sossions.
=
2. Throughout, Mr. Smith participated in a most effec
tive professional manner bringing to bear his extensive back-
ground in the Clandestine Services. His direct and objective
approach to the problems considered in the course of the sur-
vey made his contribution to the overall Team effort invalu-
able. The Team report, which I am still in process of discuss-
ing within the Staff will be of considerable value not only
to this Staff in our future planning but also, I feel, to the
futuro posture of the covert propaganda mission of the Clan-
destine Services; thus I heartily commend Mr. Smith for his
effective participation with the Survey Team in this effort.
3. I would appreciate your conveying my thanks to
Mr. Smith.

Statement of Appreciation Mr. Joseph B.
Smith
1.
-
We wish to take this means and opportunity to
express formally and for the record the appreciation of the
Covert Action Staff for the work of Mr. Joseph B. Smith as
Chief Instructor for Covert Action of the Headquarters Opera-
tions School in the Office of Training during the past two
years.
2.
As you know, Mr. Smith worked closely with the
Covert Action Staff in totally revamping the Headquarters
covert action training program. It was through his efforts
that the new intensive Covert Action Operations Seminar was
introduced as a technique of instruction to replace the out-
He
dated Covert Action Operations (Familiarization) Course.
carried his basic concept one good step further in intro-
ducing the Political Action Workshop as an advanced forum for.
studying and applying covert action operational and planning
techniques. Mr. Smith's work has also laid the groundwork
for more specialized follow-up in covert action training.
3. The enthusiastic reception and endorsement of these
two courses, the quality attendance by Division officers, and
the participation by senior Division officers as speakers,
attest to the need for new courses and the success of these
endeavors.
4. Those of us who had the opportunity to work closely
with "Little Joo" learned to appreciate his vitality, flexi-
bility and personal commitment to the success of these
training innovations. The contribution they have already
made, and will continue to make, to the Agency's training
program are testimony to the role that he played in devising
and implementing them.

Covert Psychological Warfare Conferences Attended by
Mr. Joseph Smith
420
:
t
}
1. Between 18 January and 26 May 1952 your consultant held a
group of sixteen Secret conferences on specialized techniques in
covert psychological warfare with particular reference to the Far
Eastern area. These conferences amounted to a series of reorientation
and developmental meetings in which persons actually on the job at CIA
in OPC capacities could review their own doctrine, talents, and
opportunities for serving the Government and the Agency in this field.
2. The topics covered included: a survey of the goals sought
through covert activities of the U.S. Government; the basic bibliog-
raphy on covert operations; the action response of targot groupsj
media vehicles and the cultural terrain; specific covert paychological
warfare techniques; the intelligence need for CPW; the operational
vocabulary of Marxism; psychiatry and CPW; propaganda analysis; content
analysis; press techniques of the Chinese Communists; covert, economic
warfare and CPW; personality problems in covert operations; basic
doctrine on passive resistance; and a review meeting.
3. In difficulty and in seriousness of approach, this series of
conferences corresponded to an advanced praduate course in an American
university. It was a mixture of the seminar and lecture techniques.
4. Mr. Joseph Smith immediately made himself one of the outstanding
participants of the group. He brought the capacity of a reflective
and richly educated mind to this new field and demonstrated a real
talent for seeing the opportunities presented by novel and unconventional
methods of attack upon Communism. Not only did Mr. Smith learn a
great deal himself; he contributed substantially to the intellectual
participation of the other members of the conferences in the common
tasks.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL
In writing a comment on his Fitness Report in January 1973, I spoke
of what a loss he will be to the Station. Because of overlap problems,
he will have retired soon after the new COS arrives and before the new
DCOS has come. It is typical of him that he has offered to perform
introductions to some of his contacts even after retirement. He will be
in Mexico and, while the Station must be careful to protect him in his
new status, he probably will think of the Station first when he runs on
to things of interest.

II. Research and Publication
A. See pp. 2 and 3, Work Project #1
B. Work Project #2
1. Sponsored by Dickinson College.
2. Scope- to investigate the relation of Dickinson College to
the frontier community in which it was established in 1783.
3. I was the sole researcher.
4. Principal sources were: the large letter collection, Dickinson
College Library, Church records at Carlisle and Philadelphia
(Presbyterian Historical Society), early Carlisle newspapers,
(American Antiquarian Society, Wocester, Massachusetts), contem-
porary writings, local histories.
5. This study was made from Oct.1947 until June 1948.
6. Methods were historical
7. Findings and Conclusions
a. Dickinson College, founded 1783, had numerous problems in-
cident to the establishment of any such institution, butinten-.
sified by the hostility of frontier society; e.g.financial,
disciplinary, recruitment.
b. Frontier society rejects higher education as unnecessary
and even hostile to its social goals.
c. That under-devel ped areas need so-called practical educa-
4
tion first.
.

of materials on early America published by the college under
title of Bulwark of Liberty, June, 1950.

Education", Pennsylvania History, Fennsylvania Historical Ass-
ociation, January, 1949.

Work Project #1
A. Project Synopsis
1. The strength and vulnerability of Korea as an independent
nation.
2.Location
-
Johns Hopkins University, Paltimore, Md.
3. I was the sole worker employed-
4. The political geography seminar was concerned in 1847-18
with areas of maximum change. Members of the seminar conduct-
ed studies of ingiu,Ioland, Newfoundland, Ceylon, Sinkiang, Korea.
a. Each member made a deep-level study of the area of his
choice. I chose Korea.
5.
Principal sources used by me were: USAMG Reports, all avail-
atle background studies, interviews with Koreans stationed at
Carlisle, (Carlisle Barracks AMG School) and with Miss Phyllis
Johnson, reporter who was in Korea 1945-46.
6. The material covered mostly the years 1945-46-47, und was
fairly complets for Bouth Korea. I was unable to get informa-
tion on North Kors, nor would the Army give me political in-
formation other than that officially published.
7. Methods used were historical and political because of my
previous training, Statistics were used wherever possibla.
3. Length of study-Sept. 1947-Sept. 1948.
9. Findingo and conclusions
a. I made an analysis of Korean physiographic features; in-
cluding edaphic well as usual climatic and topographical
factory.
1) I attempted to find the physical potential for the suc-
cessful maintaining of Korean independent national existence,
2) Conclusion; such obviously favorable factors ac Korean
peninsular situation were nullified by other space relations
which made Korea vulnerable to Ruucian and Chinese attack.
I found also that the soil was not adaptable through-
gut Koreu for the practise of the nation's moat thoroughly
learned economic technique-rice culture.
b. Secondly, I made complete check on the resources of the
Korean economy, for a 1 could. The limitations imposed by
censorship mudo insible for me to correlate North Korean
Andustrial activity with Youth Korean agricultural activity
as completely as I could have otherwise done.
1) Conclusions: The country would have to be Industrialized
to overcome the problem of overpopulation.
The hopead people had not shown in the past any signi-
ficant evidence of the ability to operate a democratic govern-
ment.
10. My study was not used by any government agency.
11. My study was published, in part, under the title "The Koreans
and their Living Space" in the Korean Review, Korean-"merica
Cultural Association,Sept.1949.

WENTY-FIFTII college reunions are great occasions
for letting the world know how well you're done, and

of General Motors or had acquired some equally impressive

haps) in the people who heard it.
Not being able to impress my old classmates was a small
wound, but it symbolizes an important problem for CLA
agents. We live in a society where lots of people plan their
lives so as to accumulate the greatest possible number of
credentials of the sort that will wow their peers at reunions
and similar moments. These credentials are many Ameri

no means immune to the desire to impress people with
credentials, but their jobs are directly at odds with that

with how our agency has (and hasn't done its job.
It wasn't just our status among our peers that suffered aa

Of course, many men also discovered quickly what an bu

marital problems came not from philandeng but from the
unspectacular, bitter toll that living inter coveć takea oa

in general terms what kind of work keeps them out at night,
but they have to init that the wives give to hint. The first
thing a CIA wife learm is never to ask another woman what
her husband does, for fear she will be used the same ques

Talking to Yourselves
F A CIA AGENT 1s stationed la Washington, he has to get
used to being asked at every party, by every stranger do

women were ralised to channel their ambitions toward the

Important that they've made their secret jote obvious
which has not only drought them eary, Jealousy, and dis
trust, but has made it very hard for them to do their job of
Intelligence gathering property.
"Do you know that CIA people are paid double salaries to
serve abroad? the new political officer in Singapore said to
me when I showed him and his family around the Singapore
Swimming Club oa the Sunday after he arrived. "They get
paid twice as much as you or I do. They get paid for their
cover jobs and then paid a rain for their hanky panky work.
That's why they live better than we da
I felt flattered that I was holding my cover well enough to
be told his secret, and I only wished what he was saying
.were trun
But it was an Impression that was understandable, if erro.
neous. CIA officers did serve la covers that were lower
rank than their real jobs and both on the job and off, they
didn't live lives consistent with the rank they were pretend-
Ing to have. For reasons of their jota, agents cultivate con
facts in the local government and other diplomatie misions
In circles far higher than people of their cover rank eTET
hava a chance to meet And they lesist on reating the kind
of houses to which their CIA rank entities them, as well as
demanding and receiving a lot of speelal perqubites.
My new friend was wrong about the double salaries, but
all the CIA officers he bad seen abroad would certainly
have given him the imprrenden that he had about that rab
of compensation.
;
In particular, most CIA station chiefs are not content to
Uve in quarters much less grand than the ambassador's offh
clal residence. In many countries, this makes sense - the
CIA has liaison responsibilities that are officially recognized
by the ambassador and the State Department But this is not
appreciated by the lower level employers of the embasy, if
it's told to them at all. Resentment of the chief of station's!
We style bubbles op
In the past, many chiefs of state made no attempt to hide
their preference for dealing with the CLA station chiet
to attempt to hide
Father
than the ambassador-ouetures buse Urey
owed a great debt to the CIA which may have stolen the
election for them or financed the coup that put them la
power: In any case, CIA station chiefs have always felt they
could not entertain Mess mea in hovels. It would be detri
menual to the prestige and luterests of the United States,
they argue, if they did not have the autrements
of the forces with whom they deal One station chiefl
know in the 19009 got to grada promotions by this gambit.
It has served many a CIA elftal well in regard to a bous.
Ing.
Frank Saeyn, La hhi book "Deerent laterval,” gives a vivid
account of the pergates agency personnel enjoyed. In
Vietnam. They had their own bowel club, swimming prel,
and can lathe 15 in Asia it was customary for CIA eff
cers to baro chauffeurs, to the rationals that you
needed somebody around to guard CLA cara against looting:
Since the cars went property, the gas and oil
and maintenance costs, as well as the chauffeur, were paid
for out of the station's housekeeping funds. People who
were listed as lowly attaches were often seen driving
around in big, unmarked, chauffeured cars, which drove
the Foreign Service Officers into freades of envy.
"We'll Entertain Ourselves”.
und in bie
VEN WORSE, perhaps, than using perquisites to fend
E off the man of state andlety is CLA prople's tenden
53
to huddle together. If the rest of the world thought we were
nondescript Army officers and the like; well, we knew who
was and wasn't who and could play the game with cach
other. The other embassy personnel won't invite us to their
parties? We're too low on the diplomate list to get invited to
the important functious given by other embassies and by of
ficials of the local government? Well entertain ourselves.
Conscientious CIA officers try hard to curb this practica
which after all is a breach of nearly every tenet of good
curity, but they fall moro often than they succeed.
3-1
In the days when our national purpose was more clearly
defmed, when we would, la the words of John F. Kennady,
pay any price and bear any burden in defense of the free
world, it didn't matter so much if the cover of CIA person-
nel was a little thin in some countries, the prestige of the
agency was even higher than it was at home, enormou.
higher than it has been at home for the last three years. In
the Philippines in the late 1960s, the CLA was so well regar
ded that members of the Army Counter Intelligence Corps
used to try to recruit Filipinos by passing themselves off as
CLA agents. Today, the open life style of a station chief can
lead to his death, as it did for fchard Welch in Athéus
Welch was killed by the gun of an anth-American assista,
but the gun was put into the in's bad by all the defen
sep against the dilemma of covert life that I've described
Welch lived in a house Inherited from past station chiefs,
everyons in the embassy knew his true position, and his
blography appeared in the Biographic Register, which could
be found in any library.
nily
Alter Welch died the register was melly classified,
but that doesn't mean an end to the problem. CIA personael
will always feel a strain from having to piztend to da much
Jess successful than they really are even if they love their
work and believe in it deeply, they still feel pangs. That's
human nature, and walle we ought to curb the obviousness
of CIA agen Identides, to some gilent we've just got to
deal with it
On way to do that is to treat CIA agents sympathetically.
These are obviously people who have sacrificed something
to work for the agency, and who depend to an inordinate
extent on having stable relationships with their coworkers,
since they can't have stable relationships with anyons else.
The main thing in agents life practically the caly
sa
thing, for many how he's treated at Langley, whare te
stands there.

CLA Director Adm. Stansfield Turner.
So when Adm Sunsfield Turner quickly tired, 800 Cland
destine Services officers last year, my initial approval (some'
of these fired, I thought, must have been the people who.
male e decide to leave the CIA in 1/3) gave way to miski.
inga. It's true that the greatest physical hazard many spooks;
have ever faced in the danger of choking on the fit of the
olive in their martinis fut the greatest hard we all face in
De not phymal danger, it's having something eat away at
our soul No one has to be a clandestine operator, of course,
but once ha 11, he is deprived of the normal means of su
taining his self-image that prevails in our society.
I don't in Turner should have kept on incompetents.
But I'm sure that after thom 600 (tring overybody elza at
Langley fit bitter and frightened These are not, after all,
people who have anything else to fall back on, and they
need a lot of rapport from their organization. Turner has to
wo thrạo people, and if he wants to use them effectively to
ought to fod a way of letting some go while making the rest
feel secure

As you bring to a close your active career of
service to your country, I want to join your friends.

May I express to you my appreciation and
exteral iry best wishes for the years ahead.
