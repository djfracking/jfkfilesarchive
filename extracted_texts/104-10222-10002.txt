Evaluation of Contract Management Institute
Course
a
I
1. I attended the Contract Management Institute on 28 to
31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted ex-
tensive comments to Mr. Arthur Leach, DD/S&T coordinator for the
course, and I understand that those comments were included in
the overall recommendations for future changes.
2. Since three and one-half months have transpired sinco
completion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
and subject material are a bit hazy but I will repeat my overall
reaction to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course
material was good although it could have been oriented much more
toward technical project managers rather than administrative
officers, to the ultimate benefit of DD/S&T. Two of the speakers
were excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently
Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to his
understanding of the material and his presentation. Dr. Kennedy
of Notre Dame and the lawyer, whose name I do not recall, were
excollent.
3.
This was primarily a sales pitch for CPIF contracts.
My personal impression was that U.S. Government contracting agen-
cies have just about completed the circle of a great procurement
finaco. In depurting from fixed-price and CPFF contracts to CPIF's
with various award arrangemonts, the contract negotiators were
unable to really ever define cost and endod up invariably in
giving away additional roes to the contractors for nothing received.
Definitive costs were always a function of experienced and sound

Evaluation of Contract Management Institute
Course
-L
tochnical investigation and management of a contract and when-
ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates became
almost completely unpredictable. NASA and the DoD generally have,
therefore, gone from CPIP types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAY
type ends up being simply another CPFF but with the contractor
having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and
with the Government having no recourse to redetermination. My
reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms my
own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for
a well-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

2. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING STRENGTHST
Mr. Christ is particularily cooperative and dependable.
He can accurately report
events observed or reproduce, in writing, the facts associated with monitored con-
tracts, Agency briefings, general liaison, etc.
He has been very helpful in organ-
ising the administrative procedures, the files and the engineering project procedures
for the division.
B. NAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING WEAKNESSES?
Mr. Christ's outstanding weakness results from his limited formal technical training
which in several cases is not as extensive as is the training of men that he is
aupervising. He has off-set this short-coming to some extent by experience, good
Judgement, and his interest in and his response to the opinions of others.

Recommendation for Quality Step Increase

1. It is recommended that Mr. David L. Christ, Chief of the
Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be
granted a Quality Step Increase from CS-16, step 6, to GS-16, step 7.
2. Mr. Christ entered on duty with the Agency on 16 November
1950. He transferred to ORD from the DD/P as a GS-16 in September,
1963. During the past four and one-half years he has assumed
increasing responsibilities and has expertly implemented and fulfilled
the objectives for which his Division was formed in the carly growth
period of the Office. Although he has performed equally as well, and
perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the
Office, the supergrade T.O. limitation within the Office has prevented
a raise other than the Legislative pay raises.
3. Mr. Christ is considered to be a key individual in ORD.
His energy, initiative, and enthusiasm in developing concepts and
applying managerial talents make his services to this Office invaluable.
In particular, his development of audio surveillance, micropower-

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE
1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding
employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate
data on all personnel. The new system will.aid in implementing Agency
policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel
with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It
is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics
for planning and management purposes.
2. The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those
factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in
a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it
is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize
those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves
to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.
3.
Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as
thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative
Officer within the time allotted.

Mr. Christ continues to lead the Applied Physics Division
in a progressive, responsive and aggressive manner. Some
turbulence is occasionally generated by this vigorous leadership;
however, the record of solid and potential accomplishments by
his group continues to be impressive. On balance, his creative,
forward-looking leadership continues to be a talent suited for
the goals and missions of this Office.
The technological innovations established in his Division
are continuing to lead to a variety of items of great potential

Mr. Christ will be retiring 30 November 1970,
30 November 1970. Prior to 1970
he has generally been considered a capable officer and the list of
his accomplishments during his Agency career is not unimpressive.
Christ's performance, particularly in the last six months, however,
has revealed critical weakness in judgment, discretion and self-
evaluation. These flaws have been called to Christ's attention by
me personally, and I deem them sufficiently serious that were it not
for his proposed retirement I would be constrained to seek other
means to separate him from Agency employment.

MAY 3 1 54 PM '67
During the past year, Mr. Christ has expanded his responsibilities
for his Applied Physics Division, which now encompasses effort in positive
audiosurveillance, countermeasures, micropower-microtechnology, and
emplacement problems. He continues to be conscientious, responsive, and
aggressive in the management and development of the technical programs
under his direction and supervision.
-
His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities, and it
must be acknowledged that they are responsible, in large measure, for the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction.
His cost consciousness is best exemplified by his detailed planning and
charting of cost, time, and technical details in a variety of complex areas.
He has taken the lead in solving many involved, detailed and intricate interface
and coordination problems with virtually all other technical groups within the
Agency.
I expect a high degree of intelligence pay-off as a result of programs
under his supervision.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or wooknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performers. Give recommand offers for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or listings give IA Station B to provide best

in the use of social wore, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete
Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.
During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large
areas of responsibility in his Applied Physics Division which now encompasses
effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro-
technology, and emplacement. He continues to be conscientious, responsive,
and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs.
Further, during the past year giant strides have been taken in the coordination
of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers. This coordination has
been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.
1
His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must
be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction. On occasion
his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration
in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However,
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in
truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot
yet be determined. His judicious application of other-agency funds has directly
saved this Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for 2-1/2 36: "Gring the
continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and Development,
in which he played a major role. During the past year, Mr Malm has given up his
responsibilities in the Radio-Physics-area and has devoted himself to expansion and
growth problems of the Audio-Physics Division, which encompasses effort in positive
audiosurveillance, countermeasures, and emplacement problems.
Mr. Christ continues to be conscientious, responsive, and alert to the needs of
the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his direc-
tion and supervision. He couples this with a vigorous managerial attitude that
encompasses the recruiting, programming, coordination, and other factors necessary
to implement these programs in an effective manner. His cost-consciousness is a
continuing effort throughout the year and is best exemplified by his careful over-all
planning and charting of total program efforts in order that projects lead directly
to productive intelligence efforts.
Mr. Christ has had an unusually difficult position in one respect, in that his
technical surveillance effort was a major interface area with the DD/P in a realm
where political and bureaucratic considerations could have deleteriously affected the
content of his programs. He handled these problems in a manner that was favorable
for the over-all good of the Agency in terms of technical progress in numerous areas
and which far exceeded what might be called "par" for the course,

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to

on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best
bosis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if
applicable.
Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about eighteen months,
during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and
Development. During most of the past year Mr. Christ has doubled as group leader
of the Radio-Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of
a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of
the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. Mr. Christ has performed
these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both
groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining
basis.
Mr. Christ is extremely conscientious, receptive, and alert to the needs of
the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his
direction and supervision. His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout
the year, and is best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed
funds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts. Also, he is not one
to "rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them
to task this year for what he considered efforts below what he felt their capabilities
should be.

"
Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during
a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and
Development. During the process of reorganization of the Office, Mr. Christ has
emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio-Physics and Audio-Physics areas
of effort, which comprise about 40% of the effort in the Physical Sciences portion of
the Office.
Considering his geographical location for the previous three years, Mr. Christ-
has done a remarkable job in organizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a
new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the
Office. All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in
the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and
organization of new projects with an extremely under-manned staff.
Mr. Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive
in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear
ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new
objectives. In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these
programs, Mr. Christ has demonstrated a high degree of cost consciousness by.
organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could operate
in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrac-
tors to implement the program and to seek advice as to appropriate sources for such
procurement.

I am quite familiar with Mr. Christ's performance during the rating period and am
in complete agreement with the supervisor's rating and analysis. He has done the
tremendous job of organizing our research in the brand new area of audio physics.
This program has a very high priority, and he has done a superior job of launching
it in a very short time and with very modest resources.

Mr. Christ is an excellent Chief of our Audio Support Division. He is a leader
of men, is loyal to his superiors, and is technically professional in his work.
Mr. Christ has one short coming, which is not of his own making--he lacks
field experience--only because his superiors have felt his services were more
needed at Headquarters. It is some times hard for him to understand the
operational aspects of things as outlined by his assistants. To his credit it must
be said he realizes this lack of field experience and uses the advice of his men
to best advantage.
As soon as feasable he should be assigned to a responsible position at one
of our overseas bases,

SEP 16
Puitles
Subject is a technical man who combines a taste for action with/1 ional
competence, producing excellent leadership for the specialized branch heels.
His treatment of personnel is direct, frank, unusually honest and just. He
helps the mẹn and their families in times of trouble and personal diffilities and
has carned their respect for his technical competence.” He is imaginative and
bold in his approach to the responsibilities of his branch and is a fertile source
of ideas. He has driven hard towards raising professional standards.
Although he is a good innovator, he sometimes pushes harder on new
approaches than on completion of programs in being, and on occasion his
devotion to a program leads him to heavy emphasis on it and too little on other
aspects equally as important, However, this was in the earlier part of the
rated period rather than recently. I believe he will continue to grow with his
job and that he can undertake more responsible and broader assignments.
