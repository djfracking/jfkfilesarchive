Mr. Wides. And so that's when you first set up the
proprietary for the smaller debriefing component of AMUTS?
Mr. Sarno. Well, I set up the proprietaries, the notionary
company for a small debriefing office, and at the same time,
we rented a building, a larger building, and they used to
operate in Coral Gables, received some publicity and we moved

them out of Coral Gables to near the airport in a building where
the main office was, where this main office was, where these
reports from the debriefers or any other information was
collected would be processed, typed in finished form, translated
and provided to us.
Mr. Wides. About how many people did you have in AMUTS,
Cubans at that time?
Mr. Sarno. Well, that's difficult to say.

in the component on debriefing?
Mr. Sarno. As I recall, at one time
as I recall it,

we had about 22, 23 people working in debriefing.
Mr. Wides. And apart from those Cubans, you had a staff
under you of assistants and secretaries who were Agency
assigned personnel?

Mr. Sarno. It could have been '62, late '62 or '63. And
before, we used to send our debriefers, they were within the
AMOTS group, specialists in debriefing, area specialists is
the kind we used. And we would go out to the reception center
and check around and see who had come out of the particular

And our debriefers would go out and check around with the
people who came in and try to spot somebody who would be..
interesting to interview, debrief, concerning the particular
area.
And so they usually picked them up in a car and either
took them to a restaurant or took them to a motel or something
21

and would debrief them. And then we found that it would be

better to get a building for them to be in where we located
them altogether, where they could prepare their reports and

Mr. Wides. And what was the mission and purpose of
AMUTS when you first started out, as indicated in the project
outline?
Mr. Sarno. They were to collect intelligence on Cuba,
debrief refugees and provide bodies for any possible operations
required by the station.

Mr. Wides.
They were to debrief refugees?

Was there a division of the AMUTS members into
two groups, with only a small group involving the debriefing
of Cuban refugees?
Mr. Sarno. Well, it wasn't too small a group, but if you
would speak of the whole organization overall, yes, it was a
small group.
Mr. Wides. And at what point did you set up any cover:
apart from the station as a proprietary or notional company;
in between the AMUTS people and the Miami station? In other
words, were the companies prior to the Latin America social
and economic research company that preceeded it, in time?
$
Mr. Sarno. In the time that I handled them, which is
up to the LASER, I think there were three, three covers all
told, or perhaps four. I think we had our debriefing, you
know, under one cover.

Then we had what we called our reports section which may have
had about fifteen people, twenty people, who wrote reports,
checked them out, cross-referenced, and everything else that
was involved in that.
Mr. Wides. What kind of reports did they write? What
were they writing reports about?

Mr. Wides. Were you getting reports of any sort, whether
you would characterize it as surveillance or not; on people
who had already come and were in Miami as distinct from the
interview reports when the refugees first came?
Isn't it correct that the AMUTS personnel were providing
you with reports on Cubans who were already in Miami?

of any surveillances or efforts to penetrate groups for
counterintelligence purposes by Cubans under your supervision?

Mr. Sarno. Alpha-66, there were many of them.
And we usually had one of our outside types, either
recruit or get next to an individual of the group and he would
penetrate the group himself to report to us what they were
doing.
Mr. Wides. Do you recall the flights of the Diaz, or one
of the Diz brothers, over Havana dropping leaflets?
Mr. Sarno. What date was it?
Mr. Wides. I believe it was quite early, and it was not

Mr. Sarno. I know the Diaz brothers.

Mr. Sarno. They also went out, if our station was going
to run an operation and they needed X amount of bodies, certain
specialized personnel, the AMUTS would go and locate the
personnel, talk to them, spot them, get their personal history
from them, send it in, and the people would be traced out and
checked and cleared and eventually introduced to the station
case officer who would use them in our operations.

Mr. Sarno. The counterintelligence program consisted of
15
very capable Cubans who knew of the former
the set-up of

one of the individuals would go out and debrief the fellow
and collect names, and prepare reports on it, and they maintained
files, and that is what it is.
They never got under a surveillance of any of them, because
once a report was written they suspected somebody. They maintain-

penetrated, they would sit at the table and report on the

To me, surveillance is to put two men on the street
following somebody from one place to another.

was suspicious as to whether Cubans in Miami might be Castro
agents that you were aware of?
Mr. Sarno. Many.
Mr. Wides. Did they ever ask for any assistance in the
AMUTS group in trying to keep tabs on those individuals or
to test their suspicions?

Mr. Sarno. It could be spread over. Reports writing,
for instance, when the Agency, or when the station was being
cut back in personnel, this group used to produce tons of
reports, and when our station was being cut, the staff was
being cut, I convinced the Chief of Station into having the
reports officers, for instance, trained to prepare reports
which would require very little editing or preparation once
it arrived in the station, which would take a load off the
station, and it was agreed to.

after.

basic tradecraft training?

Mr. Wides. And to your knowledge it was only report
writing?
Mr. Sarno.
Well, they trained them in each one of the
sections, and I didn't train the debriefers, so if a new man
was hired and he was put in a debriefing, he was trained u
usually by the Chief of the Debriefing Group, he was put in

them in the use of radio equipment. These individuals had
worked in this work in Cuba before they came out

would come around and discuss perhaps the budget or perhaps
get them to report in a different manner. I recall on one
occasion discussing the set-up of how the AMUTS group prepared
the debriefing reports, that they could remove the names from
it, instead of filing them inside the report, they put the
names on cards so they could be put into a computer machine
here.

Mr. Sarno. New York and San Juan are the only two I ever
recall they ever had any MUTS or ex-AMUTS or people that had
been in the organization went.
Mr. Wides. Now when they went and they recruited other
people, was that San Jenis suggestion or under his supervision?

Mr. Sarno. They usually collected a group around people
that they trusted.
Mr. Wides. Sán
Was that up to San Jenis supervision and

Mr. Sarno. He directed them to do it, yes. I didn't even
know the individual, I never met him. It's one individual.
Mr. Wides. Did he speak to you about the fact that he
was going to do this, Mr. San Jenis?

Mr. Wides. With regard to the information received from
the former AMUT in New York about the plot to shoot a bazooka
at the UN, was Mr. Shackley the Station Chief at the time you
received that information?
Mr. Sarno. I don't recall the date, but the date was
between early '62, which it had to have been, and
because
9 Shackley left which I think was in July of '64 and that would
have meant he was the Chief of Station.
Mr. Wides. Well, didn't he just indicate before while we
were taking a rbreak that you had recalled that Shackley was
the Station Chief?
Mr. Sarno. I don't recall whether he was exactly the
Station Chief or not. I can't place the date with what had
happened, so I know I went back to the Station and I reported

origins of the picketing?
How would it come about?
Mr. Sarno. Well, I don't believe it was started, I know
it wasn't started in AMUTS because one individual cannot start
it, but the groups, the Cuban exile groups who were located in
New York decided to picket it because, I believe, of Mexico's
relations with Cuba.
Mr. Wides. At this time, wasn't the Agency carrying on
a wide variety of operations to try and isolate Cuba economically
and commercially?

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. DeMarco. For the record, I think I should explain to
you that we are highly interested in the sort of activities
that you were involved in in Cuba in 1960 and '61, but our
investigation has to a certain point been slowed down by the
inability to obtain the right kinds of documents and that
being the case, and your insistence here on not answering
certain questions, will require us to simply have you come
back once we have cleared this up with your superiors at the
Agency and once they have been more forthcoming with documents
that were long ago requested about your activities.
I don't want to pursue just suspicions with you, I'd
rather talk to you about specific dates and facts.
We are going to pursue this very vigorously, and the
reason I'm interested in it is the gambling background, and
I would like to know your training in that area, your experience

Mr. DeMarco. At any time while you were in Cuba, for that
matter, at any time, did you become aware of any Agency

Mr. DeMarco. I see.
Were any of those Americans?
Mr. Sarno. No, I never spotted any Americans. There
were two Americans over there who were already working, and they
were given to me to use as, to handle some of the other ones
that were involved.
Mr. DeMarco. Were they also involved in the same type of
cover you were, gambling?
Mr. Sarno. No.
They were not in the same cover. As I
say, it was a cover provided by the Agency. It was a cover I
just naturally stumbled into since I was going to the
different casinos and I was winning money there and I could
pass myself off as a tourist-gambler.
Mr. DeMarco. These other two Americans you were talking
about, can you name them?

the guy he's talking to that Juan used to work for the Internal

Administratively, and in terms of reporting, when
you first went down there.
Mr. Sarno.
When I first went down there, I was outside.
I believe it was concerning clearances to get me into the
station, because I had never been working in a station before,
so there were special clearances. So at that time, those two
months you're speaking of, I attended a course and I may have
been sent out once or twice to interview a Cuban refugee or
one of our agents who had left Cuba.

Mr. Sarno. If the AMUT were to come up with the informa-
tion, if the AMUT were to come up with the information, he
would come in and report it and I would authorize him to go
into that city and find him, because the information could
come in many ways.
See, they were known as the Cuban municipalities and
operations in the city of Miami, and everybody that came out
from like a province or a state would register in it, and
as soon as they got information, the word would get around that
Joe Blow came in or something like that, and the word would get
back to the AMUTS and the AMUTS would say, well, we should
discuss with this fellow, and that's it.
Mr. Wides. You never got any requests for AMUTS personnel
to be made available for that kind of task from Washington?
Mr. Şarno.
To debrief an individual?
Mr. Wides. Or to travel in general.
