#CROFUN
1. In December 1966 Raymond H. GERENDE, Principal Agent for the LIEMPTY
Project, was asked to prepare a security resume, including his opinions, on
the security of the LILYRIC, LIMITED and LICALLA Basehouses vis-a-vis Soviet
knowledge of their existence. The following paragraphs contain a slightly
edited version of GERENDE's report, which was received on 28 Decembər 1966.
Station comments follow GERENDE's and are so noted.
LILYRIC
2. In its present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases
under my control. According to LIEMPTY-13, there has been no indication of
interest of any sort by the Soviets in the family's move to the new apartment
nor was there in the past any show of interest or peculiar behavior on their
(Soviet's) part with regard to the old base and the possibility that they might
be under photo surveillance.
3. The cover for the work carried on by this base is good since the
wife, LIEMPTY-14, who does most of the work has no trouble in justifying
her presence at home all of the time. The son, LIEMPTY-27 is a medical
student and attends his classes regularly and can justify his hours as
study hours. (He continues to be an excellent student and was exempted from
examinations at the end of this, his second year in medical school. Actually,
he studies most of the night). LIEMPTY-13 requires no cover as he has a
full-time job as production manager for a large concern and he usually makes
his meetings with GERENDE on his way to or from work.

11. LIEMPTY-10 and -11 were afforded a SGSWIRL interview on 8 December
1966. There were no outstanding problems indicated in the results of the
interview of LIEMPTY-11. The results of LIEMPTỶ -10's interview were discussed
in Reference B.
12. A general security review of the LIEMPTY Project was forwarded in
Reference R
13. There were no known security problems or incidents during this
period which may have jeopardized the operation or the assets involved in the
Project. RISTEAL interest in`LIEFTY-6/LIMITED was discussed in Reference D
and apparently is a continuing matter.
PLANS
14. During the coming period no significant operational or administrative
changes are planned, since the Project is producing in a timely and satisfactory
manner.

4. The set-up in the old as well as the new base is the following:
The equipment – camera, scope and tripod - is mounted in one bedroom behind
venetian blinds with one slat removed. This room is locked to keep servants
or any chance intruder from entering. The operators do not spend all their
time behind the camera, but go to the adjoining bedroom where a table and
typewriter are set up and where the daily logs are transcribed, knitting done,
or some other activity that does not require full concentration is carried out.
The curtains and blinds in this room are kept partially or fully open to allow
good visibility and provide a normal appearance. Most of the daily movement of
the Soviet personnel is followed from this room and when it is necessary to
take pictures of visitors, unknown persons or newly arrived Soviets, the
operators go to the other room and use the pre-set equipment.
.5. GERENDE's Comment. It seems to me that any careful observation by
the Soviets would have revealed the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds
in both the old and the new bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize
they are under photo surveillance. The move by the family from the old to the
new building must surely have been noted by the Soviets. Possibly the Soviets
think the family is working with the local authorities due to LIEMPTY-13's
former association with the Mexican Army.
6. Station Comments. The Station agrees with GERENDE that careful
observation by the Soviets would have revealed the missing slat in the venetian
blinds and also the fact that these blinis are seldom open. The Station also
agrees that the Soviets realize that they are under photo surveillance.
This was pointed out recently when a Soviet shielded an LNERGO walk-in when
they passed the front gate of the Embassy and made a sign to the walk-in
indicating that they could be seen by someone watching with a telescope
from the buildings across the street. Also, as Headquarters is aware, there
have been numerous comments by residents of Mexico City to the effect that
anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photographed; however, seldom has it
been rumored that the "Americans" are doing it, which might indicate most people
believe the Mexican Government is doing any such photographing and thereby
reaffirming GERENDE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican
Government runs the base.
7. Given the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at
this point does not plan to terminate or revamp the LILYRIC installation.
Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and
if the Base were closed the Soviets would start looking for a new installation.
The LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that it
will continue to do so. The Soviets have had opportunities to complain to
the Mexican Government about being monitored photographically and have not
seen fit to do so and it is believed that they probably will not do so unless
there is a radical change in Soviet and/or Mexican policy. The Station has
instructed GERENDE to take every precaution during his meetings with LIFMPTY-13
to assure that LIEMPTY-13 does not lead the Soviets to him and thereby
jeopardizing other operations, especially LICALLA.
LIMITED
8. The operator of the LIMITED Base, LIEMPTY-6, is, to my knowledge,
the oldest hand in the photo surveillance of the Soviet target and possibly
the most likely to be "burned". His residence for years at the former Base
(now the site of the new LILYRIC building) and his move to the present base
could not have gone unnoticed by the Soviets. His cover is that of an
insurance salesman, but he actually does not work at the cover and is at
a disadvantage in trying to explain his source of income. At times, in years
past, he had to afford full-time coverage from the base, which allowed him
no time to engage in credible cover activities.
9. GERENDE Comments. I do not believe that LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED is a
security risk; however, his present means of working from an open door leading
to his balcony probably can be spotted by the Soviets. LIEMPTY-6 is extremely
cautious about checking himself for surveillance when making meetings.

CONTACT AND COMMUNICATIONS
3. During the period under review, 30 meetings were held with GERENDE by
the Project Case Officer. Meeting sites and times were varied to avoid
establishing a pattern and most meetings were scheduled at the previous meeting.
Several unscheduled meetings were held during this period and were arranged by
the Case Officer telephoning GERENDE to establish the meeting time and site.
Times and sites are coded when discussed by telephone and are arranged in such
a way as to appear to be a normal conversation. Telephone calls to GERENDE are
I made from pay booths located away from the LNPURE installation.
4. GERENDE held twice weekly, clandestine meetings with LIEMPTY-4, -6,
-9, -10, -11 and -13. These regular meetings are all prearranged and are held
at various sites and at various times of the day so that meetings correspond
with the regular habits and movements of the basehousekeepers and LIENTRAP
operators.
5. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY project performed in a most
satisfactory manner during the period under review. LIFEUD-4 has been extremely
efficient in developing and printing negatives provided by the other assets.
PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES
6. LICALLA. During this period LIEMPTY -9, operator of the LICALLA
basehouse, provided 1,239 frames of operational photographs covering the patio
and garden of the FJSTEAL installation, the area where many of the officers,
family members and visitors congregate. This coverage is especially valuable
because the officers are usually at their leisure and often gather into
functional groupings. LIEMPTY-9 is very observant and his comments and notes
are considered of great value to the Station. All photos provided by LIEMPTY-9
are accompanied by a fixed-surveillance report.
7 LILYRIC. This basehouse is staffed by LLEPTY-13, -14, and -27 with
LIEMPTY-1 and -27 providing most of the coverage because of the full-time
outside employment of LIEMPTY-13. During this period the LILYRIC basehouse
provisted 2,716 frames of operational photographs covering the only vehicle and
pedestrian entrance into the target installation. All photographs were
accompanied by fixed-surveillance reports on individual members of the staff of
the target installation. The operators are often able to provide the license
plate numbers of vehicles used by visitors to the target installation, which
in many cases help to identify the visitor.
8. LIMITED. The operator of the LIMITED basehouse is LIEMPTY-6. The
LIMITED basohouse also provides coverage of the only vehicle and pedestrian
entrance to the FJSTEAL installation, but from a different angle, and the
comments made relative to coverage in the section on LILYRIC also pertain to
LIMITED. The LIMITED basehouse provided 557 frames of operational photographs
during this period. LIMITED also serves as the radio alert for the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team, although the practice of using a radio alert is being de-
creased. On two occasions during this period LIEMPTY-6 was alerting for the
team in a deception exercise, since the team was not working the FJSTFAL
target. This was done on instructions from the Station and LIEMPTY-6 was not
told that these were deception exercises.
9. LIENTRAP. During this period as in the last reporting period, the
LISTRAP mobile surveillance unit was targetted mainly against the local
Communist parties as well as members of other Hemisphere parties who are
living or are in exile in Mexico. The IIENTRAP operators are LIEMPTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11 and during this period they produced 564 frames of operational
photographs. LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11 also service over 20 postal boxes
which are used as accomodation addresses by the Mexico City Station, Head-
quarters and other field stations.
10. Raymond H. GERENDE. Aside from his regular duties as the Frincipal
Agent for the LIEMPTY Project, GERENDE also provided valuable assistance in the
furtherance of objectives involved in the JMROD operation. In this regard,
Thomas G. URQUHART, Headquarters officer, held approximately seven operational
meetings with GERENDE during this reporting period.

With the exception of the color prints, all of the above
cited operational film provided by the basehouses and the LIENTRAP unit was
developed and printed by LIEMPTY-4 at the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory.
In order to alleviate some of the pressure caused by recent adjustments in
the Station's WOACRE section, LIEMPTY-4 also processed approximately 200
photographic enlargements which normally would not fall within the scope
of this project.

10. Station Comments. The same Station comments mndo in reference to
LILYRIC also apply to LIMITED. Also, the use of LIMITED no the radio alert
tase for the LIEMBRACE surveillance teen has weakened the security of this
tase. In regard to LIMITED, LICOWL-1 has reported that the Soviets are very
interested in LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED and that so many Soviets have talked to him
(LICCWL-1) about LIEMPTY-6 that he is convinced that the Soviets have a "fear"
and an "obsession" about LIEMPTY-6. LICOWL-1 reported on 3 January 1967
that the Subject of 201-744341 and the. Subject of 201-756168 asked him on
19 December 1966 for full details known to him about LIHMPTY-6 and Subject of
201-756168 went so far as to say that he believes that LIEMPTY-6 is "watching
the Soviets".

not do this, it would seem to indicate that they are not aware that their
activities are being monitored from this point. On the other hand, in recent
months LIEMPTY-9, the operator, has reported that activities in the back
yard have been curtailed more and more. For example, the women no longer

he has never noticed any undue interest in his house or his activities by
the Soviets. Access to the operating room can be seen from the window which
LIEMPTY-9 believes to be the commo room in the target installation.
12. The cover for this base is that of a normal residence. LIEMPTY-9's
cover work is that of a car and insurance salesman in a local automobile
agency in the afternoon only. LIEMPTY-9 does work in his cover. LIEMPTY-9's
cover for the use of the operating room is that he does accounting work for
client firms. The door is kept locked at all times and LIEMPTY-9 never allows
the servant to enter, even for cleaning purposes. The equipment is kept
locked in a trunk within the room when not in use and all logs and photos
are kept in a safe located in LIEMPTY-9's bedroom closet.
13. GERENDE Comment. I believe the Soviets are aware of the photo
surveillance being carried out by this base due to the position of the window
and the curtains during the hours when LIEMPTY-9 is operating.
14. Station Comment. The Station does not believe that this photo base
is known to the Soviets. This belief is based on the fact that the LICALLA
coverage is excellent and there, has been no indication that the Soviets act

to note that the Soviets made no effort to "protect" the LNERGO walk-in mentioned
in paragraph 6 above during a visit to the backyard and LICALLA did obtain
photographs of the walk-in. The school children no longer pass through the
backyard because the location of the school was recently changed and the children
now go by another route. The Station has instructed GERENDE to take every pre-
caution in order to protect the security of the LICALLA base.
15. As a general comment pertaining to the security of the bases in-
volved in Project LIEMPTY, it should be noted that the Soviets are aware of
the fact that LIMOUSINE is the owner/builder of the new LILYRIC building.
LIMOUSINE is also the owner of the LIMESA complex, through a holding company.
16. The Station realizes that most of the details reported in this
dispatch are known to Headquarters; however, the Station wanted to make the
opinions of the Principal Agent and the Station a matter of record in a
consolidated form.

AGENT COMMUNICATIONS, CONTACT AND PERFORMANCE
During the period under review, Raymond H. GERENDS was seen 20 times in
regular- operational meetings by the LIEMPTY Project case officer. No basic
changes other than the regular preplanned variations in meeting sites and
times were made in the Project communication channels. The up-dated and
revised emergency communication system for contact with GERENDS (see
HMMA-28333, dated 21 February 1966) remains in effect. All regular contact
with the active LIEMPTY agents (LIKETYS -4, -6, -9, -10, -11, -13, -14,
and -26) was maintained via Raymond H. GERENDE. GERENDE met each of the
“above cited agents, with the exception of LIEMPTYs -14, and -26, two times
each week in clandestine meetings. The operational performance of all active
LIEMPTY agents, including GERENDE was most satisfactory. The performance
of LIEMPTY-4 in assisting the local WUACRE section with its photographic
processing was outstanding.
. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
A.
SUMMARY
-
Throughout the reporting period, the LIEMPTY Project continued
to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and surveillance
reports used by the Station in its planning and operations against the
LIMERICK installation and personnel. The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to de
a particularly reliable tool for: following the daily comings and goings
of the LIMERICK personnel; providing leads to and confirming the identi-
fications of new LIMERICK staffers and also visitors to the LIMERICK installa-
tion; providing leads to the relative rank and the specific intelligence
service affiliation of various LIMERICK officers; keeping the Station abreast
of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and
providing a reliable check on various Station and LNERGO access agents.
During the quarter under review, Project LIEMPTY basehouses provided 5,003
frames of operational photographs (169 rolls) as well as 1,290 pages of
fixed surveillance reports covering the movements of the LIMERICK staffers.
Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mobile unit was again
targetted heavily against leaders and meeting sites of the local Communist
parties as well as other targets of opportunity, particularly Haitian,
Guatemalan and Honduran Communist exile leaders now resident in Mexico.
LIENTRAP provided up-dated and/or new identification photographs which
are of value to both the JMTIGER and the Station recruitment/penetration
program. This apparat provided a total of 237 operational photographs,
while the personnel attached to this LIENTRAP unit regularly serviced 23
postal accommodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Headquarters and
other field Stations.

LIENTRAP
-
c. LIMITED -> During this quarter, the LIMITED basehouse provided 724 frames
of operational film as well as daily physical surveillance reports covering
the arrival and departure of all LIMERICK personnel and visitors at the
front gate of that installation during the evening and week-end hours. In
addition, LIEMPTY-6, the LIMITED basehousekeeper, working from his excellent
visual vantage point, dispatched the LIEMBRACE surveillance team via radio on
several LIEMBRACE surveillance operations.
D. LILYRIC
->>>
During this reporting period, the LILYRIC basehouse provided
2,859 frames of operational photographs covering the same area and targets
noted in the LIMITED section above, out during the morning and afternoon
hours. In October the LILYRIC personnel (LIEMPTY8 -15, -14, -26 and -27)
successfully completed the move into the new LIMOUSINE building.
photographic coverage was lost during the move, LILYRIC coverage at present
is back to normal (see also paragraph 4 of Reference A.).
LICALLA
-
While some
E.
Throughout this period, the LICALLA basehouse provided both
physical observation and photographic coverage of the garden and patio of the
LIMERICK installation, an area where many of the officers, their families and
visitors congregate. In providing this coverage LICALLA produced 1,183
individual photographs (of which 80 were color prints used in the Station's
"mig book") as well as regular daily reports on the salient activities in this
area.

The last regularly scheduled LIEMPTY Progress Report, covering the period
1 February through 30 April 1966, was forwarded to Headquarters as reference
A. Salient interim project activities and levied requirements were
contained in references B. through D. Throughout the period under re-
view, Project LIEMPTY continued to collect operational information on
the LIMERICK installation, the LIMERICK personnel and their visitors,
as well as various targets of opportunity. This activity was in consonance
with and represented partial fulfillment of various sections of the RMD
as approved for Station Mexico City. The above cited program was
achieved through the daily photographic and fixed surveillance coverage
provided by the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, as well as
the LIENTRAP mobil photo unit. In addition the LIEMPTY Project pro-
vided essential support to various other Headquarters (i.e. AMROD and
AECUTLET) activities and other Station operations through the regular
exploitation of the LIEMPTY principal agent, Raymond H. GERENDE.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in other channels. This will be the last of the opera-
tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date.
OPERATIONS
2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the
MHHARSH installation. Operations from the KDLITERAL surveillance
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7 July,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date. Operations
from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his
family accomplished the same date.
ADMINISTRATION
3. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.
PERSONNEL
4.
The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operated the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-5 operated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in
their photo specialty since 1957.

AGENT COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT
During the period under review, OFRENDE was seen 33 times in regular
operational meetings by the undersigned, and on 2 occasions by the local
KURIOT representative, Hugh T. FRANCOTTE. The meetings between FRANCOTTE
and GERENDE were attended by the LIEMPTY Project Case Officer and dealt
with the installation of a new PAKO print dryer in the LIEMPTY photo
laboratory. In addition, GERENDE met four times, for extended periods,
with LCFLUTTER examiner Daniel R. HOSKIER when he served as the inter-
preter for the LCFLUTTER examinations afforded LIEMPTYs, -6,-9,-14,-13,
-26, and -27. No basic departures, other than the regular preplanned
changes in meeting sites and times, were made in the regular and alternate
communications channels to GERENDE. It should be noted that an up-dated
and revised emergency communication system for contact with GERENDE was
forwarded to Headquarters as HMMA-28333, dated 21 February 1966. This plan
includes both verbal and physical bona fides and supercedes previous
arrangements.
3. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS, ACHIEVEMENTS
a)
SUMMARY Throughout the reporting period, Project LIEMPTY continued
to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and physical
surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations against the
LIMERICK installation and personnel. The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to
be a most reliable tool for: following the daily movements of LIMERICK
personnel; providing leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERICK
staffers and their visitors; verifying or providing leads to the relative
rank and specific intelligence service connection of various LIMERICK
officers; keeping the Station abreast of construction changes in the LIMERICK
physical plants providing a check on reports of Station and ODEVY access
agents. During the three month period under review, Project LIEMPTY's
basehouses provided 3,967 frames of operational photographs (146 rolls)
as well as 650 pages of fixed surveillance reports covering this target.
-
b) LIENTRAP Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mobile unit was
targetted against leaders and meeting-sites of the local Communist parties
as well as other targets of opportunity, specifically the leaders of the
strike group at the National University. LIENTRAP provided up-to-date
photographs of numerous Communist officials, which are of value to both
the JMTIGER program and the Station's recruitment/penetration program.
This unit provided 330 operational photographs, while the personnel attached
to this unit also regularly serviced 21 postal accommodation addresses used
by Mexico City Station, Headquarters, and other field Stations.
c) LIMITED
-O
During this period, the LIMITED basehouse provided 1,147
frames (45 rolls) of operational film and daily observation reports covering
the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel and visitors at the front
gate of that installation during the afternoon and rush-hours. In
addition, LIEMPTY-6, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served as the radio
dispatcher for several LIEMBRACE surveillance operations.
a) LILYRIC
-
During this period, the LILYRIC basehouse provided 1,660
frames (56 rolls) of operational photographs, covering the same area and
targets noted in the LIMITED section, but during the morning and early
afternoon hours. In addition, the LILYRIC personnel prepared a detailed
report on the daily comings and goings of each LIMERICK staffer and
contributed the majority of this Project's physical surveillance reports.

4. SECURITY
There have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security
of Project LIEMPTY. During the period under review, LIEMPTYB -6, -9, -13,
-14, -26, and -27 were afforded LCFLUTTER examinations, all with satisfactory
results.
5. CHANGES AND PLANNING
As noted in paragraph 5 of reference A, Station is in the process of
increasing the hours of both the photographic and physical surveillance
coverage provided by the LILYRIC operations during the week-days. At
present, the LILYRIC personnel are providing coverage from early morning
to late afternoon, while LIMITED is providing week-end coverage. After
the LILYRICS have moved into the new LIMOUSINE building, it is anticipated
that they will be able to provide complete dawn to dusk coverage, the
Station's ultimate goal.

SUMMARY OF PROJECT ACTIVITY AND REPORTING
MICROFILM
The last regularly scheduled LIEMPTY Progress Report covering the
period 1 August through 31 October 1965 was forwarded to Headquarters as
reference A Salient interim activities and developments were included in
references B. through 5. Throughout the period under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to collect operational information on the LIMERICK Installation,
the LIMERICK personnal and their visitors, as well as various targets
of opportunity. This was achieved through the daily photographic and fixed
surveillance coverage provided by the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALLA
basehouses and the LIENTRAP mobile unit. In addition, the LIEMPTY project
provided essential support to various other Headquarters (particularly the
AROD operation) and Station activities through the exploitation of the
LEMPTY Principal Agent, Raymond H. GERENDE.

AGENT CONTACT AND COMUNICATIONS
During the reporting period, GERADE was seen 34 times in regular
operational meetings by the undersimed and on 5 occasions by the Headquarters'
AMROD operations officer, Thomas G. URQUHART. All meetings vere regularly
rotated among eight selected sites. No basic departures were made fron
the standard meeting; modus operanil; however, new contact arrangements,
for meetings under emergency conditions, are being worked out with: GERENDE.
3. ACCOMPLISHNETS, PROGRESS, ACHIEVEMENTS
-
a) SUBARY Throughout the reporting period, Project LINETY
continued to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and
physical surveillance reports used in Mexico City Station's operations
targetted against the LIMERICK installation and personnel. This activity
is in direct support of, and in consonance with, the current NC as approved
for the Station. The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to be a most reliable
tool for: following the daily movements of LIMERICK personnel; providing
leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERICK staffers and their
visitors; verifying the relative rank and specific intelligence service
connection of various LIMERICK officers; keeping the Station abreast of
construction changes of the LIMERICK physical plant; and veri:ying reports
of Station access agents. During the period under review, the LINFTY
basehouses produced 4,212 photographs (149 rolls) as well as 30 pages of
fixed surveillance reports covering this target.
b) LIENTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mobile unit was
targetted against leaders and meeting-sites of the local communist parties
as well as other targets of opportunity. Specifically, LIENTRAP provided
up-to-date photographs of numerous communist officials, which are of value
to both the JMTIGER program and the Station's penetration/recruitment
program. The LIENTRAP unit and personnel also regularly serviced 21 postal
accommodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Headquarters, and other
field Stations. The LIENTRAP unit provided a total of 404 operational
photographs.
c) LIMITED - During the reporting period, the LIMITED basehouse
provided 1,412 frames (54 rolls) or operational film and daily observation
reports covering the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel and
visitors at the front gate of the installation during the afternoon and early
evening hours. In addition, LIENFTY-6, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served
as the radio dispatcher on several LIEMBRACE surveillance operations. The
value and need of the LIMITED fixed-radio dispatching base has been explained
in detail in previous LIEMPTY Progress Reports.
->
d) LILYRIC During this period, the LILYRIC basehouse produced 1,542
frames (54 rolls) of operational photographs, covering the same area and
targets noted in the LIMITED section, but during the morning and early.
afternoon hours. In addition, LILYRIC prepared a weekly report on the
comings and goings of each LIMERICK staffer and contributed the majority of
this project's physical surveillance reports.
e) LICALLA
->
Throughout this period, the LICALLA basehouse provided
photographic coverage of the garden and patio area of the LIVERI in-
stallation, an area where many of the officers, their families, and visitors
congregate. In covering this area, LICALLA produced 1,258 indivinal
photographs as well as regular reports on the activities of various officials
of special interest to the Station.
-
f) LIEMPTY-4 All the above noted operational film (155 rolls, 4,616.
frames) provided by the basehouses and the LIENTRAP unit was developed an
printed by LISPY-4 at the LIEMPTY photo processing base. As noted in
reference A., much of the LIEPTY photographic lab equipment was scheduled to
be replaced during this period. With the advice of the local KURRA
representative, both the LIEPTY lab's film washing system and strip
printer were replaced. In addition, a new semi-automatic drum-type print
dryer was ordered by the Station for installation in this base during
February 1966.

6) Raymond H. GERENDE During the reporting period, GERENDE served
as the full-time LIEVITY F/A, operating as the cutout to the LIMITED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA basehouses and bearing the agent handling responsibility
for the operators of the LIEMTRAP mobile unit as well as LIEMPTY-4 and
LIEMPTY-19, a Station asset (translator) carried under Project LIFEAT.
overall assignment involved at least twelve clandestine agent meetings per
week (in addition the 34 meetings held with the Project Case Officer).
GERENDE also made minerous and essential contributions to the sensitive
AMROD operation. It should be noted that GERENDE's alertness in spotting
the PERUMEN surveillance of one of the AMROD accommodation addresses,
undoubtedly saved this sensitive deception operation from exposure by the
opposition.
4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS
Other than the attempted PERUMEN surveillance of the AMROD accommodation
address noted above (which was neutralized by GERENDE's alertness), there
have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security of the
LIFMPTY project or the related agent personnel. While several minor ad-
ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.
5. CHANGES AND PLANNING
a) One major operational change is planned for the ensuing period.
Upon completion of the new LIMOUSINE structure (see HMMA-25352, dated 10
February 1965), the Station will move the present. LILYRIC basehouse
personnel (LIEMPTYS 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the
LIMITED (LIEMPTYs 6 and 7) personnel as originally planned. Ancillary
modifications are: 1) To increase the hours of both the photographic and
physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to
dusk) during the week days and 2) have LIMITED provide photographic and
physical surveillance coverage on week-ends only, while remaining on daily
stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments. These changes were dictated by
the following considerations:
1) The new LIMOUSINE building will offer a much better vantage point
for both photographic and physical surveillance than does the present
the
complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases. Therefore,
Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be
those possessing the highest technical skills and also those able to
provide the most thorough and complete coverage. Since the LIMITED base
now has only one trained operator while the LILYRIC basehouse has three,
the LILYRIC group is indicated.
2)
Because it appears that the coverage of the LIMERICK installation
will be a long-range and continuing requirement, the Station desires
to staff the new hase with personnel of long-range potential. Since
LIEMPTY-6 is now almost 60 years old, it is obvious that he does not
possess this potential; however, the LILYRIC agent complex happily
combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.
3) Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC personnel is
much more compatible and consistent with the environment of the new
building than is that of the LIMITED family.
While it is anticipated that these modifications and changes will initially
cause varicus administrative and operational problems, it is believed that
all such adjustments can be handled locally.
b) The requisite copies of the PRO Part II pertinent to LIEPTY-26
were forwarded to Headquarters with mai-27503, dated 3 November 1965 along
with a request for a full Operational Approval for Subject for use as a cut-out
to the LILYRIC basehouse. LIEMPTY-27 was granted a Provisional Operational
Approval on 26 January 1966 for use as a part-time basehouse keeper/operator
at the LILYRIC installation.

KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the NDLITERAL building,
as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT complex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels. If this
occurs before December, KDFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.
6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDABSINTHE apart-
ment o/a 31 August. KDABSINTHE is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to dispose of his equity in the property in the
near future.
PRODUCTION
7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover-
age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his
visual observation of the target area.
8.
KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source for
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially
"WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles. This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates
and automobiles.
9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned
to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with empha-
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-
tions made to the communications antenna system.
SECURITY
10. We were gratified to receive the very favorable Headquarters
KDFACTOR security review which was forwarded as HMMW-19,061, 28 June
1972. There is no need for further comment.
PROBLEMS
11. Only the developments reported in other channels.
FINANCES
12. KDFACTOR Project termination costs have been charged to
FY 1972 with the exception of rent payments and utility costs which
are being charged to FY 1973. The breakdown of agent termination
costs is as follows:"

The last regularly scheduled LIETTY progress report covering the period
1 February through 30 April 1965 was founded as reference A. Significant
interiz developments and activities were included in references 5 through D.
Throughout the period under review, Project [ITY continued to collect oper-
ational information on the LIMERICK installation, the LIMERICK personnel and
their visitors, as well as various targets of opportunity, through the dolly
photographic and fixed surveillance coverage provided by the LIFTED, LILYRIC,
and LI ALLA photographic baschouses and the frequent use of the DTRAP mobile

AGINT CONTACT AND COMMUNICATIONS.
&) On 22 May 1965, the Principal Agent for Project LIEKONT,
Raymond H. GERENDS, deported Mexico for a two month period of well-deserved
vacation. As per pre-planned arrangements, G's operational, adminis-
trative, and agent-handling tasks were turned over as follows:
To Oliver C. SCANTLING (P): Avent handling and funding the LIMITED,
LILYRIC, and LICALLA baschouses and the LITRAP mobile unit;
To the LIMPPY Case Officer
-
agent handling and funding of the LISPTY
photo-leb/dark room; and the local responsibility.
SCANTLING was choser. for this turn-over and the recomports workload since he
had previously handled all but one of the agents involved because he was
Familiar with the objectives and overall moms operande LIEMPTY
project. The above noted operational assignments will again be levied on
GD upon his return to Mexico in early August 1965.

included in references C. through E. The Project Outline for LITRAZOR, which when
approved, will provide for the maintenance of long-term contract agent Oliver G.
SCANTLING who is now carried under Project LIFY, was submitted for headquarters
approval with reference B. Throughout the period under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to collect operational information on the LIMERICK installation, the
LIMERICK personnel and their visitors, as well as various targets of opportunity,
through the daily photographic coverute provided by the LDMITED, LILYRIC, and
LICALIA photographic basehouses and the frequent use of the LIENTRAP mobile photo-
graphic unit. In addition, this project provided other essential operational support
to various Station and Headquarters activities through the utilization of the
services of long-time contract agents Raymond H. GEREDE and Oliver G. SCANTLING.
2. AGENT CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION CHANNELS.
During the reporting period, the primary LIENTTY principal agent, Raymond H.
GERENDE was seen forty-two (42) times in operational meetings by the undersigned,
while principal agent Oliver G. SCANTLIN was seen twelve (12) times. Other than
frequent and intentional variations in meeting times and sites, no changes were
made in the Project's communication systems. All operational contact with the

There have been no known incidents during the reporting period which have ad-
versely éffected the security of the LIENFTY project. Various refinements have been
made in the cover story to be used (if necessary) to explain the relationship between
the case officer and G‘RENDE. (See also paragraph 2 ret meeting times and sites.)
5. PLANS AND CHANGES.
As noted in reference A. it had become obvious that many of the operational
assignments levied on Oliver G. SCANTLING were falling outside the proper

changes planned for the ensuing period.

Throughout the reporting periol, Project LIQETY cortinued to previis the
majority of the operational photographs and surveillance reports used in Mexico
City Station's operations against the LIMERICK installation and personal. This
following the
coverage has proved to be a most reliable and viable tool for:
daily movements of the LIMFRICK personel; providing and confining the
of LIMERICK staffers and their visitors; and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as the specific intelligence rorvies soruwection of various
IMERICK officers. During the poriol under review, Project LIMTY procal 160
rolls (3,833 frames) of operational photographs as well as approximately 700 pages
In addition,
of fixed, physical surveillance reports dealing with this target.
LIEMPTY produced 203 operational photographs of other targets of interest to
Station Mexico City. Specific examples of the contributions made by each component
of Project LIARTY to the fulfillment of the relevant portions of the Station's
Related Missions Directive, follow:
-
a) LIENTRAP Throughout this period, the LIENAP mobile photo unit was
targeted against leaders and lustallations of the Partido Comunista Mexicano
(PCM), visiting communist lowders, and other targets of special operational
interest. Specifically, the LITRAP unit verified the current addresses
and provided up-to-date photographs of two prominent Micromists
exiled in Mexico; photographic coverage of an arbassy of interest to NUTUBE/D
for use in operational planning; and provided photos of the Individuals ond
I TRAP

b) LIMITED During the period covered by this report, LIMITED profiteed
fifty-seven rolls (1,072 Pr) of operational photographs and regular sur-
ture
veillance reports covering the daily arrived re of LICK personnel
and their visitors at the front gate of the installation in question, luring the
afternoon and evening hours. In addition, LINFTY-6, the LIMITED basehouse
keeper served as the fixed radio-dispatcher for three LIEMERACE surveillance
operations targeted against LIMERICK IS officers as well as serving as the
spotter and dispatcher for five LIPMBRACS surveillances directed against
PBPRIME nationals who visited the LIMERICK installation (see MEXT-4247,
MEXI-4248, and MEXI-4250, all dated 26 July, for details).
-
c) LILYRIC During the reporting period, the LILYRIC base produced sixty-
three rolls (1,652 frames) of operational film, for the same purposes as
noted above in the LIMITED section, during the forming and early sternoon
hours. In addition, LILYTIC prepared a weekly report on the comings and goings
of each LIMERICK staffer and contributed the injority of the project's
physical surveillance reports. Finally, LILYRIC provided special reports on
commercial deliveries made to the LIMERICK installation.
a) LICALLA - During this period, the LICALIA lace provided photographic
coverage of the garden and patio area of the IDRICK Installation, al area

3. ACCOLISEMENTS, PROGRES, AND ACHIDUPANTS.
Throughout the reporting period, Project LIEMPTY contirriol to produce the
majority of the operational photographs used in Station Mexico City's KUDISK
operations against the LIMERICK target. This coverage has proved to be a reliablo
and viable tool for: following the daily movements of the LIMERICK personnel;
providing and confirming identities of LIMERICK staffers and their visitors; and
verifying the relative rank and positions as well as the intelligence service
connections of various LIMERICK officers. Specific oxamples of the contributions of
each LIENITY Project component to the fulfillment of the Related Mission Mrective,
as approved for Mexico City Station, follows
->
a) LIENTRAP Throughout the reporting period, the LIESTRAP mobile photo-
graphic unit was targeted extensively against the leaders and installations
of the Partido Comunista Mexicano, the Partido Popular Socialista, and
other exile or visiting communist leaders. In mid-April 1965, the
LIENTRAP unit provided an up-to-date photograph of ESLIME-1 which was
passed to a visiting KUBARK staffer for hic use in the recruitment attempt
of ESLIME-1. Not only did this photograph serve as a means of identifying
the target for the recruiter, but also served as bona fides for the
recruiter during the successful recruitment of this commmunist/exile
guerrilla. (See reference C. for details.) Overall, the LIENTRAP urit
produced 49 rolls of 35 mm film which will be or have been used in support
of planned recruitment attempts, and in providing Identifications, locations
or contacts of various targota of interest.

LIEMPTY-2, the LICALLA basehouse keeper provided 52 rolls of 35mm still
photographs which were most useful to the Station in determining or con-
firming the intelligence service affiliation of various LIMERICK staffers
by their constant association and conversations with other known intelli-
gence officers. In addition, LICALIA provided special physical surveillance
reports on all deliveries made to the LIMERICK installation, the presence of
suspect audio technicians, and the changes in the patterns of activity of
various LIMERICK personnel. On 23 March, Dudley R. GHASTER, KURIOT specialist:
entered LICALLA for an on-site survey in support of a sensitive technical
operation being planned by the Station and Headquarters. (See reference A,

be impossible to provide LIEMBRACE surveillance of LIMERICK staffers without

MEMORANDUM FOR:

REFERENCE:
Director of Logistics |
Mr. Edward Deaison
LIEMPTY, LIMOUSIN E
Mexi 2159
14 JAN 1965
1. In conversation with the Headquarters officer concerned
with LIEMPTY LIMOUSINE affairs, this Office was apprised of the
fact that the proposed transaction, outlined in reference cable, would
be executed without recourse to advice on the legal aspects of the
sale under Mexican law and with no intenna to make LIMOUSINE',
commitment to this Agency legally binding. It le further intended
that LIMOUSINE's "promissory notes" be unsecured.
2. Should the proposed transaction be carried out in this
manner, this Agency would be unable to enforce LIMOUSINE's
promise to pay his debt, and would have no legally cognizable instru-
ment to present to an executor of his estate should he die before
meeting his obligations to us. In addition, our right to continued
possession of the apartment would be tenuous at best,
3. Thus it is planned to convey real estate appraised at
$14,448 in exchange for $7,200 and a collection of unenforceable,
unsecured promises. It is hard to believe that in this case, opera-
tional security precludes closer protection of Agency assets.

1. It would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2h of reference that
KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have not been completely informed of the back-
ground of the LIEMPTY Project and its agent-requirements. At the time
HMMA-14093 (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it
was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process.
L
2. In answer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G. SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement.
He visited her as an architect interested in viewing the LIMERICK installation
from the building where she lives. He was socially acquainted with her brother,
a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist.
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING's part to
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect that some anti-LIMERICK
intelligence service is involved. PARADA suggested during SCANTLING's
initial visit that he could return at any time for further observations. This
was reported by SCANTLING on 21 March 1957 and it does not seem appropriate
to query him again on the pretext for his recent visits.
3. While HMMA-14093 correctly referred to LIMITED, LILYRIC and
LICALLA as "photographic basehouses," the Station would like to emphasize
that photographic coverage is only one of their functions (please see HMMA-12095,
4 February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for automobile
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering
the front gate. Their photography is negligible compared to their other duties.
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the pictures is from the
second floor and above the street traffic which partially blocks LIMITED
photographs. LILYRIC also does individual reports on LIMERICK personnel
entering and leaving the main gate. - LICALLA is used almost exclusively to
identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in
connection with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project. As an indication of the effect-
iveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, the Mexico Station has all the
LIMERICK officials identified. Before this base was activated more than two-
thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. In order to support other
operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK
officials. In this respect, LICALLA has provided most of the necessary infor-
mation. The retention of this base is also considered vital to the security of
the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project.
4. The Station does not agree that the color photography and moving
pictures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification purposes
and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin
coloring. The motion pictures were made at Headquarters suggestion (Please
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HMMW-8438, 26 January 1960).

5. In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-
graphic basehouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counterespionage effort against the LIMERICK installation. These bases do
not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered in such a light.

1. On 13 October 1959 it was learned from source that the local ODENVY
chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the
Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re-
ported to the U. S. Ambassador locally. The statement was made that "such
matters as this should be immediately reported to the Ambassador."
2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on
the incident from the knowledge they had as reported in reference.
3. The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did not
agree that matters concerning KUBARK operations should be reported by ODENVY
to the Ambassador.
4. Source stated that the cable was obviously a result of the KUBARK/
ODENVY headquarters "ill feeling" which presently exists and which source
believes is primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magazinė
of September 1959.
5. Source is LIMEW.
6. It is requested that under no circumstances should the information
contained herein be disseminated in any form whatsoever outside KUBARK.

1. At 1110 hrs., 20 September 1959, while on an operational assignment,
LIEMPTY-10 and the LIENTRAP vehicle were temporarily detained by the Servicio
Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret Service). LIEMPTY-10 was held under
unofficial custody for approximately 20 hours before his release was obtained.
follows below an account of the more important details pertaining to this incident.
There
2. LIEMPTY-10 was instructed on 17 September to case the area surrounding
the Theatre Iris, located at Donceles 36, preliminary to undertaking a photographic
surveillance of all persons entering and leaving the theatre between the hours ef
0930 and 1200 hrs., 20 September. In this instance, the Station's target was a pro-
Cuban rally sponsored by the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (CEM). The Station
had received information that many of the leading Mexican and Central American
Communists would attend this rally and that this was an opportune time to establish
which ones did attend and to collect their photographs. The Station did not know that
the Mexican Secret Service would also be covering this meeting for the purpose of
preventing a Communist-inspired demonstration,
3. The Station was advised at 1730 hrs., 20 September. by Raymond H.
GERENDE (ps), the Principal Agent who handles LIEMPTY-10, that L-10 was being
held by the Secret Service. Immediately following this notification, Allen W. WARE
(ps) was requested to contact Philip K. TESSAROLO (pa) and request him to implement '
TESSAROLO
procedures through a criminal lawyer to effect the release of L-10.
was contacted and briefed at 2200 hours and immediately began attempts to locate
a reliable criminal lawyer. However, as sometimes happens in an emergency
It was not until the
situation, his two most appropriate contacts were out of tewn.
following morning at 0700 hrs. that TESSAROLO located another reliable lawyer
who agreed to handle the case.
4.
Since GERENDE was known to L-10 and since the Station could not be
sure how much L-10 might be forced to tell the Secret Service, GERENDE was
given the following instructions:
A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lines in the base
where he and his wife were living and to move all equipment to another safe
location. It was believed appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10
did not know the location of the LIVERY base, the telephone number of the
base, or even that GERENDE was living at a place other than his mother's
residence in another part of the city.
B. To collect and deposit with his Case Officer any compromising papers
presently in his possession.
C.
To make a security inspection of the outside photographic lab at his
mother's house.
D. To phone L-10's wife and inform her that procedures were underway
to obtain L-10's release and for her not to become upset and talkative.
E. To suspend all operational contacts until L-10 was released and the
extent of compromise was determined.

5. During the evening of 20 September the Station LIFEAT Case Officer
was advised that GERENDE had been directed to disconnect the LIVERY lines
and to transfer all LIFEAT equipment to a safe location. To further insure the
security of LIVERY, all LIVERY lines were pulled externally during the early
morning of 21 September.
"
6. At approximately 1000 hrs., 21 September, LIMEW informed the Chief
of Station that a contact of his (LIMEW's) had just informed him that L-10 (true
name) and the LIENTRAP vehicle were being held by the Secret Service. LIMEW
stated that if L-10 was one of KUBARK's agents he would attempt to have his
contact in the Secret Service obtain his immediate, release. LIMEW was told
that L-10 was, in fact, a KUBARK agent and that the Station would very much
appreciate his efforts to effect his release. A short while later LIMEW again
contacted the Chief of Station and informed him that it would be necessary for
documented ODACID official personally to contact a Commandante fnu LIMON
of the Secret Service and that L-10 would then be released. According to LIMEW,
L-10 had told the Secret Service that he was carrying out his operational photo-
graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; therefore, an ODACID
official would have to establish L-10's bona fides.
7. As the Station learned later, the Secret Service agents were roughing up
some of the individuals attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavoring
to make sure that no photographs were taken which could be used against them by
the Communists. L-10 and L-11, the LIENTRAP driver who left the scene before he
was detained, were just preparing to leave the area after taking five rolls of film
when a Secret Service agent demanded a search of the vehicle on the suspicion that
it contained Communist propaganda. L-10, his camera with telephoto lens and
the film were then discovered in the rear of LIENTRAP. It was at this time that
L-10 was accused orally by the police officers of being a Soviet agent and later of
being a local Communist agent. After being taken to Secret Service Headquarters,
L-10 told LIMON, in private, about his association with ODACID and emphasized
that he certainly was not a Communist agent, LIMEW's source (possibly Com-
mandante LIMON), believing that there may be some truth in L-10's statement,
contacted LIMEW. Based in part on assumption and in part on fact, this is the
Station's opinion as to how ODENVY became involved in the case.
8. The Station, realizing that LIEMPTY-10 had not committed an illegal
act by taking photographs, decided that WARE should personally visit LIMON
and request L-10's release. WARE contacted LIMON and the sub-jefe of the
Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLEA Cerecero, about 1230 hrs., 21 September,
identified himself as an ODACID official and told them that L-10 did from time
to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the
field of local Communist activities. WARE also told LIMON and MENDICLEA
that L-10 was never permitted to do any task which was illegal under Mexican
law and that if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,
but on his own volition. They implied that L-10 had not done anything illegal and
that all they wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent, L-
10 was immediately released and the LIENTRAP vehicle returned to him with all
equipment intact, including the five rolls of undeveloped film.
9. While WARE was on his way to see LIMON at the Secret Service Head-
quarters, the Chief of Station was advised by the ODACID Security Office that
L-10 was being detained by the Secret Service, The Security Office was told that
WARE was presently investigating the matter and should be at the Secret Service
Headquarters at that time. By coincidence, WARE was talking to MENDIOLEA
when the OQACID Security Office phoned to inform him that WARE was taking care
of the matter. It was learned later that MENDIOLEA is a brother-in-law of the
local investigator employed full time by the ODACID Security Office. This was how
ODACID became involved in the incident. To the best of the Station's knowledge, the
ODACID Security Officer has said nothing more about the incident and, at the time,
did not attach any particular significance to it or seem especially concerned about

L-10's statement that he did some photographic work for ODACID. There was no
newspaper or other publicity pertaining to L-10 or LIENTRAP.
10. During his visit to Secret Service Headquarters WARE discovered that
L-10 had not been booked or formally charged with an illegal act and that neither
LIMON nor MENDIOLEA could recall L-10's name. L-10 was not placed in jail
during the 26 hours he was at Secret Service Headquarters but, rather, was permitted
to remain in the Secret Service agents' duty room. No bribes were necessary to
obtain his release; however, per LIMEW's request, $500.00 pesos were given to
LIMEW to give to his source. LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about
L-10's detention, the source was also responsible for all equipment and film being
returned intact to L-10.
11. TESSAROLO was advised, as soon as LIMEW became involved in the case,
that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further. Two bottles of
scotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through TESSAROLO for the few tasks he
had already performed.
12. After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interrogated and that he
did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give the
names of anybody connected with operational activities. Based on the developments
in the case, the Station has no reason to doubt the veracity of L-10's statement. L-
10 was reprimanded for his use of statements to the Secret Service about being
employed by ODACID. He was told that the revelation of such employment was to
be made only by the Station and that henceforth he is never to use such a cover
story. L-10 was also reprimanded for his lack of judgment in remaining in an area
where there was a strong concentration of police; it is believed safe to assume that
L-10 will never make this same mistake again.
13. In retrospect, it is interesting to note that L-10's use of the ODACID
employment story is possibly responsible for his not being interrogated and thus
compromising other operations and individuals. This case has pointed out to the
Station the desireability of having casual contacts in the Secret Service and other
local police-type organizations so that the Station, rather than ODACID and ODENVY
in the first to learn of incidents of this type. Considering the multifarious activities
handled by the Station, it must be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-
hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to handle such emergencies.
14. The Station is allowing a one month's cooling off period for the LIEN-
TRAP vehicle and LIEMPTY-10. The vehicle will then be painted another standard
color and re-registered in the State of Mexico. After these security precautions
are observed, the Station sees no reason why carefully selected photographic sur-
veillance operations should not continue with L-10 as a wiser and more prudent
LIENTRAP operator.

1. During the period covered by this report,a new Case Officer, Quinton
N. OUSLER, assumed operational direction of several LIPSTICK Tssets (Oliver
G. SCANTLING, Raymond H. GERENDE, LIMITED; LICALLA, LIENTRAP and
several support agents), the LIJERSEY surveillance team and the LILYRIC Base,
The Station has continued to use SCANTLING, primarily, to follow up LIMESA
leads obtained from LIFEAT and the photographic bases; however, no positive
returns have been realized from his prodigious efforts except the collection of a
considerable amount of operational information. GERENDE performed his princi-
pal a gent responsibilities for the photographic bases, LIENTRAP, LIJERSEY
and until 10 December 1958 handled the LIFEAT/BGMORNING and LIFEAT/
Cuban Exile operations. The LIJERSEY surveillance team has been used sparingly
for pretext investigations' and routine static surveillances; however, a principal agent,
Simon D. CLACKETT, is currently being trained in Head quarters to assume the
full-time direction, control, training and development of the LIJERSEY team. The
new project, LIEMPTY, combining all the assets discussed in this report was
submitted to Headquarters on 8 October 1958 with requested project year app roval
period from 1 December 1958 through 30 November 1959. An operational security
review of Raymond H. GERENDE's activities was forwarded to Head quarters as an
at tachment to HMMA-11368, 22 October 1958.
ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS OLIVER G. SCANTLING SEGMENT
2. Agent Information - Oliver G. SCANTLING has continued to perform his
assigned tasks in an outstanding manner. SCANTLING's poise, common sense,
education, ideology and native ability for the pursuit of clandestine activities
make him one of the most valuable support assets available to the Mexico City
Station. The fact that SCANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief
Engineer and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to
his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent. On two occasions during the past
six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to
resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK ope rational
duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this on the
basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate,
Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time for the
Station, but not sufficiently so to warrant his resignation from his overt job (his
monthly salary in his overt job is in excess of $800.00 U. S.). The only
significant limitation that SCANTLING has evidenced to his present Ca se Officer
Is his occasional delay in preparing writt en reports of investigations and other
matters requiring reports for the files. However, this limitation gradually is
being overcome and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to
be factual, comprehensive and soon will be promptly submit ted,

3. Security Developments SCANTLING is constantly under a consider able
amount of exposure and pressure when following up LIMESA leads obtained from
LIFEAT and the photographic bases. Since time is always of the essence when
using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches
to individuals performing services for the LIME RICK target after routine, and
sometimes only cursory, investigation. The refore, the possibility always exists
of his entanglement in an undesirable security incident. This neces sarily

accurate drawing of the type door installed at LIME RICK. This drawing was
forwarded to Headquarters via HMMA-11926, 21 January 1959.
-
E. Casing Report on West German Embassy During June, July and
August 1958, SCANTLING prepared a detailed casing report on the new
West German Embassy. SCANTLING's engineering ability enables him to
prepare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data. Also,
his personality and gregarious manner permit him to visit the inside of such
establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details
which later he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehensive floor
plan and important construction data.
F. 'LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long association with th is
target from the casing standpoint provides the Station with an unparalleled
source of in formation about LIMERICK construction activities, modifications
and reasons for same. All of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on file in Head-
quarters are the product of SCANTLING's unusual a bility and knowledge.
Consultations with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been
of benefit to the Stationdiring this reporting period and they will continue to
be of worthwhile importance,
-
G. Routine Investigations and Surve illances Although the Station has
several assets capable of performing investigations and surveillances,
SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and
clandestinity. His activities in this connection are too numerous to list
here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Stat ion's
collection of operational information through his investigative efforts.
SCANTLING's interview of Paul Frederick Kirschhoff (201-43645) of LCMAY-
FOWL interest is an example of SCANTLING's use on-investigations (see
HM MA-11749, 17 December 1958).
H. ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM-15 during
the latter's December 1958 trip to Mexico City. In this connection
SCANTLING is a support asset which is trustworthy and dependable.
SCANTLING never displays undue curiosity in operations such as the ES GEM-15
one; he accepts the minimum amount of information given and per forms his
duties in a professional and sincere manner.
I. LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administrative matters connected
with L/3. Doris M. KILLGO provides operational direction to L/3. During
this reporting period, the Station had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the
ope rational super vision of L/3's.activities. However, after a four-month
trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLCO meeting with L/3, it was
decided that it would be desirable for KIIGO to continue handling L/3. L/3's
unu sual personality and intellect indicated that he could best be directed by
a PBPRIME citizen. Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KILLGO's
and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's
administrative problems.

Mexico City in December 1958 and January 1959, it was considered app ropriate
for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Although this
procedure defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner
in which the Station could maintain efficiency with the three operations listed
above. SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA
and LIENTRAP for several years. In fact, he was at one time the agent in
charge of these three operations.
5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation
(see paragraph + (C) above) indicated to the Station the necessity for thorough
briefings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target. This can
hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to illustrate
th e min im um efforts that should be followed. The forthcoming LINIMENT IV
operation wherein SCANTLING must recruit the landlord of the target's building
is offering SCANTLING and the Station the opportunity to prepare thoroughly for
SCANTLING's recruitment pit ch. The excellent documentation prepared by
KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase
the batting average on SCANTLING's cold approaches. (See HMMA-11366, 22
October 1958, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on
this Subject).
-
In a general sense, one other conclusion can be made about any Station's
support apparatus where technical and photographic operations are possible,
the utility of the information obtained is enhanced considerably by accurate,
comprehensive and timely casing reports. SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,
is an excellent asset for this type of support.
6. Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959.
As of that date SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600. 00 U. S.
for two years. The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4,000.00
U.S. No other significant administrative problems exist.
It
7. Outlook for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued
utilization of SCANTLING in the same manner as he is presently being used.
The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, it is hoped, resist
the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents.
is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be worthwh ile
to the Station for many years to come and that every effort should be made to protect
his security and value to KUBA RK.

8. Agent in formation Aside from the agent information given in HMMA-11368
22 October 1958, the only significant development was GERENDE's December 1958
marriage to a U. S. educated girl of Dutch citizenship. The $ 500,00 U. S. for the
purchase of two plane tickets as a wedding gift to GERENDE was designed to
impress GERENDE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an individual
and that KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligence career. GERENDE is at
the age and stage in life where he is beginning to wonder just what the future holds
for him. In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

is a calculated risk which both SCANTLING and the Station must take if penetration
of the primary target is achieved, whether technically or by a recruitment in place.
It is to SCANTLING's credit that he has not yet become involved in an incident which
the Station feels has compromised him and/or alerted the target of KUBA RK's many
operational efforts against them. The closest SCANTLING has come to being compro-
mised and to being identified as a PBPR IME agent stems directly from the LIPSTICK
surveillance team flap of June 1958. The off ice used by the surveillance team was
rented by SCANTLING in his true name at the time that he was leader of the team,
Not the slightest indication, however, has been uncovered which points to SCANTLING
as a target of investigation by a local police service. SCANTLING and the Station
have been alert and will continue to watch closely for any sign of local police and other
opposition interest in his activities,

of the many operational activities in which SCANTLING participated during the period
covered by this report:

A. Juan CASTRO (201) SCANTLING continued seeing CASTRO through
September 1958 following the last faint glimers of mounting the original LIME SA
MK LIGHTING ope ration through CASTRO. As late as September 1958 possibilities
still existed, or appear ed to exist, that CASTRO would complete his work in the
primary LIMERICK office and that it might be possible to install MKLIGHTING,
While CAST RO, through SCANTLING, was the principal source of this informa-
tion, portions were also confirmed by LIFEAT. During July, August and September
1958, SCANTLING had approximately eight meetings with CASTRO. In late
September 1958 LIFEAT indicated that the LIMERICK target was using personnel
under the supervision of one of their regular local employees, Antonio ZEPEDA
(201-239821), to complete some of the work CASTRO was supposed to finish and
that other contractors were doing jobs around the target area which CASTRO,
would normally Inve been expected to do had he still been in the employ of the
target. Also, LIMIT ED and LIF EAT confirmed that the LIMERICK target had.
lost interest in CASTRO - he was not seen visiting the target in stallation nor did
the target people attempt to get in touch with him. In view of this, SCANTLING
was instructed to cease all contact with CAST RO as of 1 November 1958,
÷
B. Pablo MON Rosas (2013) During the period covered by this report
SCANTLING had two interviews with MON Rosas. SCANTLING's most recent
report was forwarded to Headquarters as an attachment to HMMA-11143, 1
October 1958. Unquestionably the Station has identified Mon Rosas as the tech-
nician who services LIMERICK safes and locks. SCANTLING will continue his
development of MỌN Rosas (please see HMMA-11711, 10 December 1958).

perhaps similar to the Civil Service Reti rement program for KUBARK employees.
9. Security Developments - Again, the information on this subject was covered
adequately in FIMMA-11368. GERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING
and LIF EAT/Cuban Exiles duties on 10 December 1958. This, of course, was
in line with recommendations contained in HMMA-11368 and represents a definite
security improvement. GERENDE was told that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was being
terminated because it had not been productive of enough significant information and
that LIFEAT/Cuban Exiles was being terminated because the occupants of the target
apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned.)
Additional security improvements will be made when Simon D. CLACKETT returns
to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance
team.
-
10. Operational Success and Effectiveness& Briefly reviewed below are the
separate operational activities which GERENDE managed during the period covered
by this report:
A. LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, securely and efficiently
during the period July through December 1958. The base operator, LIEMPTY/
demonstrated his usual competence and devotion to duty. In addition to the
primary objective of taking photographs of individuals of interest, L/6 also
prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target
personnel, weekly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK installation,
per formed three one-man surveillances of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in
an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING
with information on LIMERICK construction. During this six-month period,
LIEMPTY/6 took approximately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base.
-
B. LILYRIC This base is operated by LIEMPTYS/13 and 14, with LIEMPTY/
12 serving as a cutout between the base and GERENDE. LIEMPTY/14 does most
of the photography and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular
job and is not on the premises during regular daytime working hours. L/14
devotes approximately six hours (0800-1400) each day to photography and the
remaining time is spent preparing reports. The Base person nel compile
individual logs on each target personality indicating their arrivals and departures
from the LIME RICK installation (Note: These reports are filed in the
app ropriate Station 201 file and are available to Station officers in analyzing a
target personality's pattern of daily activity). LILYRIC also prepared a
weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the license plate
numbers of all vehicles discharging or picking up individuals at LIMERICK.
(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked out through LIV FS TOCK/2
for the owners names and add resses - in case of immediate or later operational
interest.) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER met
directly with LIEMPTY/12. Dur ing this period approximately 2,000 photographs
were taken from the LILYRIC base.
C. LICALLA - While LILYRI C and LIMITED are excellent bases for
photographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK installation,
the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of LIMERICK

occurred in relation to L/4 except that OUSLER met directly with him during
the December 1958 period that GERENDE was away from Mexico City.

tent manner.
11. Administration
-
Other than the fact that LIJERSEY and the above-
mentioned portions of the LIPSTICK projects were combined into this new project,
LIEMPTY, "there is nothing of significance to report to Hea‍dquarters.
12. Outlook for Future Development - Although not meaning to be repetitive
by discussing again those recommendations made above, a summary of the Station's
outlook on the future of the LIEMPTY GERENDE Segment is believed to be appropriate.
With the arrival of CLACKETT in April, GERENDE will be free to devote full
time to photographic base house operations. GERENDE can do a lot to professionalizo
these operations by preparing written communications procedures, by thorough ly
debriefing base house operators on their methods of operation, by preparing detailed
security reviews on each base and by supervising the trial of new photographic
techniques. GERENDE will continue to be used on occasional sensitive investigations
to rent operational hotel rooms and to perform other services for the Station which
will not impair the security of his primary responsibilities. It is planned that
CLACKETT will put some life into the LIJERSEY surveillance team and that the
Station will soon have another first rate investigative group to support other Station
operations.

employees. LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of target
per sonnel in the garden area of LIME RICK. LIEMPTY/9 is the base operator
for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his job in an outstanding
manner. As reported in HMMA -11368, LIEMPTY/9 is the brother of former
LIPSTICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in
June 1958). No repercussions, or indications of any impending ones, have
_ resulted in this family relationship. This, certainly, is the major security
problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period. L/9 and his family soon
will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period of time required to remodel
it. The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer
owns the LICALLA base and the three adjoining houses and every effort is
being made to preserve this secret from L/9. (See HMMA-12032, 28 January
1959, for a more detailed explanation.) Of course, during the remodeling of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs. In addition
to taking approximately 2, 500 photographs during this six-month period, the
LICALLA base also prepared weekly reports on LIMERICK garden activities,
These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are seen together each day,
which vehicles different employees are accustomed to using, construction activities
and other matters which appear of significance to L/9.
D. LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtie Station asset.
Approximately 1,400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous
targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubtedly
remain one of the Station's best investigative asses. As explained in the Field
Project Outline, forwarded to Head quarters on 8 October 1958, the Station is
of the opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible.
Nearly four months have elapsed without receiving Headquarters authority to
replace the vehicle. The security situation is even more acute now than at the
time of the request. LIEMPTYS 10 and 11 do an excellent job on LIENTRAP
ope rations.
E. LIJERSEY - This operation can be characterized as somewhat dormant
for the July - December 1958 period. Because of GERENDE's other important
activities, he did not have the time to train and work with the surveillance team,
Also, the Station considered that it would be stretching security just a bit too far
to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling
the photographic base houses and performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/
BGMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles. The expected arrival of Simon D.
CLACKETT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable
the Station to train, within a year, an efficient mobile surveillance team.
At present, LIEMPTYs/15, 16 and 17 compose the LEERSEY team.
-
F. LIFEAT – Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monitor
in the base house containing LIF EAT/BG MORNING and LIFEAT/Cuban
Exiles. In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also transcribed
the majority of the BGMORNING and Cuban Exile tapes. He performed
these jobs satisfactorily even though his efficiency was handicapped by numerous
other duties. Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devote
more time to his other operations with a corresponding increase in the security
of all his activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CWH
SUBJECT
Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico
REFERENCE • WH/FI Memorandum of 14 October 1958
1. The subject of the recruitment of a physical surveillance team in
the United States for use in Mexico as well as other areas within WH has
long been a topic of discussion at Headquarters. While it is palpably ri-
diculous to consider the use of a surveillance team recruited and trained
in the United States and based in Mexico, operationally in other areas in
Latin America, there is some merit, at least in theory, to the proposal in
2a of reference. Although one of the basic factors in the make-up of any
surveillance team is that its members must be indigenous to the area of op-
eration, it would be possible to recruit such a team as suggested in 2a and
use this team in Mexico. However, I believe this would be time-consuming and
very expensive for the following reasons:
a. Machine runs have already been made to spot candidates within
the Agency of the Mexican/American type for the LIMESA/LIMUST project, with
negative results.
b. In order to make it attractive to young men of the caliber
desired, we would have to offer some kind of a career with a starting salary
of somewhere between the GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances.
Without attempting to even estimate this cost one can see that the figures for
a team of fifteen would run into six digits.
C. It would take a minimum of three months for a recruiter to move
into the southwest area and spot, contact, develop and recruit a team of
fifteen.
and cleard
d. Once a team of suitable candidates was recruited, it would
then take a minimum of another three months to train these candidates in
basic trade craft and surveillance techniques.
Upon completion of the training period, the candidates would
have to be moved individually into the area of operation to become familiar
with this area, the language, people, and atmosphere in general, etc. This
would take another three months minimum.
1. After completion of the area familiarization period, the team
would have to be assembled and put through various surveillance exercises as
a unit to check them out prior to actual operation

g. There would be other problems confronting such a team from a
security standpoint, such as cover credentials, which would always pose a
threat to the operation.
cover,
2. To sum up, it would appear that the proposal in 2a of reference
is not feasible because of the time and expense involved plus the always
latent security hazard.
3. I agree with paragraph 2 b of reference. Not only should the
personnel of the surveillance team be recruited at the station, but as out-
lined in paragraph 3 it should be relatively easy to find suitable candidates.
For example it is proposed under the new LIEMPTY project (this consists of
the remainder of the non-blown LIPSTICKS and the LIJERSEYs) to recruit a
physical surveillance team. Two of the station's outstanding indigenous
agents. Scantling and Gerende, are under this project and both are capable
of spotting, developing, and recruiting agents.
4. I agree with paragraph 3b, c, and d, and believe that Headquarters
should make every effort to find an experienced and competent case officer
to fill Clower's slot as the outside surveillance case officer.

d. In brief, a replacement of the former physical surveillance
leader is indicated, but a more mature and competent case officer is
needed.
4. Plan a, recruitment in the U. S., should not be dismissed from
consideration. It would take longer than the other plan but might be
beneficial in enabling the new agents to be trained in the U. S. They
would then have to spend time getting into Mexico and familiarize themselves
with operations and operational climate there. This plan, however, presents
a problem as to who is to do the recruiting and training in the U. S.
SR Division has offered to be of whatever assistance they can, but there
is no indication they could do any better at this than WID.
5. It may be of interest to you to know that the SR representatives
said the best work done anywhere in the world on the BGMORNING case, which
has wide international ramifications, was done by LIKAYAK-2 in Mexico.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico
1. On 8 October 1958 a meeting of representatives of SR Division
and CI Staff was held, attended by the undersigned, to discuss means for
building up physical surveillance assets in Mexico. The SR and CI repre-
sentatives pointed out that their current and projected work on BOMORNING
and their cases requires a considerable strengthening of physical surveil–
lance assets, and it was the consensus that these assets would be used
far into the future on Soviet targets. It was further agreed that since
the LIPSTICK operation has encountered difficulties this year, new assets
should be sought.
Į
2. Various approaches to the problem were discussed, the most viable
of which were as follows:
a. Recruiting of teams or basic elements for teams in the Mexican
colonies of the southwestern U. S.
b. Dispatch of a new case officer to Mexico with the sole and
specific duty of developing and running the new teams.
c. A combination of a and b.
3. Initially, it is believed the dispatch of a new case officer to
Mexico would be the most successful and give the best immediate results,
for the following reasons:
a.
Headquarters and Station records contain the names of numerous
cleared contacts or contacts who could be cleared and through whom
introductions could be made to persons suitable for surveillance work.
Hitherto these have not been fully exploited owing to the heavy workload
on Station personnel and the unimpaired functioning till recently of
the LIPSTICK group.
Some of these contacts were felt out as recruiters
and spotters in years past but the matter was never pushed since the
need was not so great as now,
b. A now case officer is needed because the present Station staff
is still too busy to devote the amount of time needed to build carefully
and train thoroughly the new assets.
C. The new assets will require the full time direction and
coordination of a case officer who has no other responsibilities. In
this connection, it would be advisable to try to select, train and
utilize at least twelve new agents as soon as possible.

OPERATIONS
1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.
ADMINISTRATION
2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up.
PERSONNEL
3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since
1957.
PRODUCTION
4. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound photo-
graphic coverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He produced 55 rolls of

reasons and coordinate
if appropriate.
1. On 16 December 1955 the daily check of property which this Station
may desire to use for operational purposes (LICOOL run) showed that a
house adjacent to the LIMERICK target installation was vacant. LIPSTICK-19
was contacted immediately to investigate the property. He reported that
it was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition which was being
repaired by the owner for rental. He furtner reported that from the
maid's room on the roof a clear view of the entire LIMERICK compound was
possible and, if he had understood the LIMERICK language, he would have
been able to understand several conversations which were going on between
LIMERICK officers in the game area of the compound. LIPSTICK-19 also re-
ported that from the roof of this house it was a distance of only approxi-
mately fifty feet to the LIMERICK building across flat roofs with no
obstructing partitions except for a small wall and several strands of
barbed wire, all totalling about four or five feet high between the last
roof and the LIMERICK building.
Con-
2.
Based upon this favorable report, reference A was sent immediately
to Headquarters requesting authorization to rent the house. Two days
later reference B was received granting approval to rent the house.
sequently, LIPSTICK-2 (the only cleared married man available to the
Station, with the exception of LIBERTY, who would fit into the area) was
approached and requested to rent the house. This posed a considerable
problem to LIPSTICK-21, since the house has only two cedrooms and he already
had two children, and at that very time his wife was in the hospital
giving birth to a third child. Further, he had a very comfortable house
a duplex which he shared with his brother-in-law at a pre-devaluation
rent) which he would never be able to again acquire after this operation
was terminated. He did, however, agree to take the house and it was

f. Prelimina by investigation reveals that the possibility does
exist that physical access may be obtained to the LIMERICK target
from LIPSTICK/LICALIA. This investigation will be intensified and
a full report, together with available photographs, will be sent to
Headquarters for study by FEARSON and NILES as to the feasibility
of this type of operation.
7. As stated in paragraphs two and three above, LIPSTICK-21 has undergone
considerable personal sacrifice to accommodate this Station in this opera-
tion. It has always been the practice to pay a base house operator a
starting salary of approximately $120.00 U.S. per month, since the work
of operating a base house is almost full-time. LIPSTICK-21 now earns
364.00 U.S. for work of approximately four hours per day. It is therefore
requested that this Station be authorized by cable to increase the salary
of LIPSTICK-21 to $120.00 U.S. per month.

apparent to all concerned that his decision was based upon loyalty to
this Station and dedication to the fight against Communism. It is hoped
that this unselfish and devoted act of LIPSTICK-21's will be made a
matter of permanent record.
3. The reason for LIPSTICK-21 to move from very comfortable quarters
at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher rental needed some explana-
tion for his friends and relatives. There is a very fine private school
approximately one block from this house which LIPSTICK-21 had often men-
tioned as the best in the city for his children, and consequently he told
everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possible to this
school so that his children could attend. It should be noted in this
respect that, in reality, LIPSTICK-21 had been sending his children to
one of the best public schools in Mexico City at no cost. Under the present
circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because
it is the only decent school in the area and it provides excellent cover
for his residence in the area. It is requested that Headquarters authorize
this Station to assist LIPSTICK-21 in the payment of his children's tuition
for the above stated reasons. Approximate cost of the tuition would be
$20.00 U.S. per child per month, or a total for LIPSTICK-21 of $10.00 US
per month.
Authorization is requested to assist LIPSTICK-21 by payment
of $30.00 U.S. per month.
40 The house is ore of a series of one-story houses that extend from
the LIMERICK building to a four-story apartment building on the far
corner. The fronts of the houses are all directly on the sidewalk with
the doors opening onto a one-step stoop. The backs of the houses and the
walls of the back patios all abut the compound of the LIMERICK installa-
tion. The rear windows of the house face a patio which ends in a brick
wall.
This brick wall is not as high as the roof of the house, anding
about four feet below the level of the roof. There are stairs which
ascend from this patio to the roof where the maid's quarters are situated.
About halfway up these stairs one can turn and obtain an unrestricted
view of the LIMERICK compound. However, the maid's room offers the best
operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer
and his equipment, plus a more advantageous view. LIPSTICK-21 told his
maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since he needed
her room for his radio experiments. This is a plausible story since
LIPSTICK-21 is known to be an enthusiastic radio amateur.
5. The maid's room has a door that faces across the roofs in the direction
of the LIMERICK installation and one window which faces across the house
roof toward the street. A view of the LIMERICK compound is obtained
by
an observer who is back in the room looking through the partly opened door.
Some better method of observation will be worked out which will eliminate
the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation.

6. At present we plan to allow LIPSTICK-21 considerable time to get
settled securely into his new quarters before starting any operational
efforts. After this waiting period is over and we feel that we can
securely commence ope: "ations, we plan on using the base for the following
efforts:
a.
A supplementary photographic base. In this connection the
request for additional Exactas and spotting scopes previously made
should be expedited. It is anticipated that much operation informa-
tion will be developed by this photographic work showing the various
associations between the people when they are at play in the compound
which can never be determined from the LIPSTICK-LIMITED coverage.
Visitors who seldom leave the compound do engage in social activity
within the compound and can be photographed for possible identifica-
tion by the AEDIPPERS. Items which are loaded into the automobiles
for transportation to unknown points may be identified through this
coverage. Further, should LIPSTICK/LIMITED be terminated for any
reason, we would be able to continue some coverage from this base.
b. Observation by LIPSTICK-21 of the buildings and the activities
in the compound will furnish valuable information on the daily living
habits of the residents and their guests.
C. The LIPSTICK/LIDOMINO base, presently being occupied by LINCH-
FIN, is about 75 yards away from the LIMERICK target while LIPSTICK,
LICALLA is only about fifty feet. This base may assist the Head-
quarters technicians, who periodically use the LIPSTICK/LIDOMINO
base, for reasons of proximity and the use of their equipment from
a different direction. The exact use of the LIPSTICK/LICALIA base
in this respect must be determined by the Headquarters technicians
who are familiar with the equipment used.
d. Conversations in the LIMERICK compound are audible to someone
who is listening from the maid's roon. Naturally street noises and
extraneous sounds interfere considerably with this eavesdropping so
that the employment of some parabolic microphone and recorder must
´be used for optimum results.
1
Should future operations provide the opportunity to install a
transmitter microphone (resonant cavity) in some item carried into
thə LIMERICK target, LIPSTICK/LICALLA would serve as an excellent
base since it has direct line of sight to the back of the LIMERICK
target.

becomes untenable. We are also exploring alternate locations for
KDLÌTERAL to solve the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR
coverage (see below).
PROBLEMS
11. The only known problem connected with the project is a
product of mother nature which is threatening the effectiveness of
KDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel
planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to
the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the
point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only
has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch
to Headquarters on the topic in the near future.

OPERATIONS
: HMMA-40,227, 8 March 1971 (Previous Ops Report)
1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.
ADMINISTRATION
2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of the project
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the
Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section. At that time Timothy
H. ARCHSOLD assumed the inside administrative chores, and agent
meetings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.
FERNALD who had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-
bilities. MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left
on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project
assets in the future.
3.
Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU. KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all
the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility
was turned over to CHAUVEAU. The new arrangement has proven to be
more than satisfactory. Agent meetings have now been cut to a
minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery to the con-
sumer has been speeded up considerably.

The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this
capacity since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABS INTHE base house

PLANS
12. No changes in the project are contemplated.
EVALUATION
13. The support provided by the KDFACTOR Project to the
Station REDTOP Program is indispensable. We believe the project
represents a professional collection effort being run securely
and successfully against a sensitive target with a minimal
expenditure of funds and case officer time.
*Reflects anticipated salary raises and higher rent on MEXI-132
based on projected cost of living increase over two year period.

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.
5. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
100 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.
6. KDLITERAĻ and XDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MIHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic
photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with emphasis on
* coverage of any construction changes and any modification or additions
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required. During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.
SECURITY REVIEW
7. There were no known problems of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are
extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets
derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their *KTRUSTŃ
employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.
8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access
agents. KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of
friends, and on a number of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background
information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
product was always accomplished by an outside case officer.
9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick-
Meetings with
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs.
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at
the Station and have been forwarded to Headquarters on both KDFACTOR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-5's imme-
diate family and could be contacted through him using his emergency
plan.

with the assistance of his wife, KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served JKLANCE in. this
capacity since 1957.
PRODUCTION
5. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL,
through KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound
photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He produced 76
rolls of film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily
visual observation of the target area.
6. KDABS INTHE:
Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
167 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atton-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of

SECURITY
-
8. There were no known problems of security relating to the
project.
The termination of KDFACTOR-1 should pose no security
problem: Contact was broken amicably, and it is highly probable
that he would be more than willing to help out again if his services
are needed. Of the remaining assets, all five have been SGSWIRLED
in the past. They derive a substantial portion of their livelihood
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus lose a great deal if
security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for
us. As an additional safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE opera-
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never been
any indication that either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's
existence.
9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets,
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation
of their respective base houses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met
weekly to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely
processing and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs.
Meetings with KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the
morning along his route of travel to his overt job.
These meetings
last only long enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies,

quarters on both KDFACTOR-2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are

PROBLEMS
10.
There were no known problems connected with the project
during the reporting period.
FINANCES
11.
The termination of KDFACTOR-1 and the subsequent elimina-
tion of outside photo processing costs accounts for the drop in
anticipated project expenses shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973.

1. Upon reviewing Station's Obligation Status Reports from
Headquarters, it has been noted that there apparently have been
Lo credits entered for KDABBEY's not rent refunds on MEXI-03
2.
MEXI-03 is owned by JKLANCH, with KDABLEY as the oston-
sible owner. Each mouth the Station gives the occupant of Units
$11, 13, 35 and 17 of MGXI-03 their rent for the month in advance,
which they then pay to KDADDAY's agent. Originally this agent
was KDVAULT/2, who was witting of the rental arrangement and
neither received nor paid rent on Unit #11, which he occupied.

Since his termination in April 71, Unit 211 has been occupied by
KDVAULT/9, who is not witting of the arrangement. The current

At the end of each quarter, EDABDAY submits to the
Station an accounting recording the rents received on the four
units of MEXI-03, and the expenses incurred for property taxes,
rent receipt stamp taxes, municipal water charges, maintenance
and repairs, and similar items during the quarter. The differ-
ence between the rents paid to and the expenses incurred by
KDABBEY as ostensible owner of MEXI-03, is refunded to the Station
by KDABBEY with the quarterly accounting.

REFERENCE:
ALICROFILM
28 February 1971
HMMA-39679, 28 October 1970 (Previous Operational Report)
GENERAL
1. The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to
support two visual and photographic surveillance points (KDLITERAL
and KDABSINTH) directed against the MHHARSH installation and to
support the related photo processing of the product.. -
2.
The Station is presently taking steps to terminate
KDFACTOR-1 the photo processor and move this phase of the operation
into the Station.
3. Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-
tive handling of Project KDFACTOR was transferred on 1 December 1970
to the Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR
personnel was turned over to Howard T. BAGAUS on 2 December 1970.
MEETING ARRANGEMENTS
4. KDFACTOR-5: This agent is met by BAGALS at 0800 each
Tuesday morning at one of four different sites near the Anillo
Periferico in Polanco, some three miles from the Station. The modus
operandi used with this agent is basically the same as previously
used by Bruce H. FERNALD. All meetings are held in the case officer
car, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-5 resumes his trip to work.

OPERATIONS
1. The LIEMPTY Project continued throughout the period
to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
directed against the MHHARSH installation and to support the
related photo processing of the product.
a, LICALLA is the designation of that portion of
the Project that covers surveillance of the rear and
garden area of the MHHARSH installation. It operates
from one of the units (MEXI-03) of the LIMESA, Station-
owned properties, and it includes only one agent:
LIEMPTY-9.
b.
LILYRIC is the designation of that portion of
the Project covering surveillance of the front entrance
of the MHHARSH installation. It includes LIEMPTY-13
as the key member of the baschouse team, supported by
his wife, LIEMPTY-14, who is the main photographer,
observer and log-keeper, and their two sons,
and their two sons, LIEMPTY-26
and -27 who assist in photography, maintenance of arrival
and departure logs on target personalities, and preparation

of the Project; the Station proposes to report semi-annually
hereafter, on 31 October and 30 April, including sufficient
financial and other data in April to assist in preparing project
renewals. The value of the Project for both REDTOP and other
Station operations has been well documented over a long period
of time. There have been no recent additions or changes in
either personnel or basehouse properties and none is contemplated.
Any significant events which might affect the Project's operation,
such as the GERENDE divorce, will, of course, be reported
separately.
13. The basic operation of the Project remains the same with
only spot requirements in support of specific objectives
changing from time to time.

The basehouse (MEXI-132) is located near the front of
the MHHARSHI installation and it is owned by LIMOUSINE.
(Contrary to Reference B Project Renewal, LIMOUSINE
is the actual, not "ostensible"

property. Please see HMM3814, 8 January 1968, for
full details of the various property transfers,

C.. Photo processing is accomplished by LIEMPTY-4
except in special cases when prints are required
quickly and are processed within the Station. LIEMPTY-4
has a darkroom located in the rear of his medical
office and he handles the work after normal office
hours with patients.
2. Outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD handles the three
key agents of the Project (LIEMPTY-9, -13, and -:4). He meets
with each once a week for passing requirements, paying agent
and sub-agent salaries, rents and other experses, providing
supplies; and retrieving the product. Inside case officer
Timothy M. ARCHBOLD handles the internal administration of the
Project and is the Station contact with FERNALD.
MEETING ARRANGEMENTS
3.
LIEMPTY-13: He is met by FERNALD in the early hours
of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from
the basehouse. LIEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a
central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within
a ten-block distance by FERNALD, driving his car. During a
drive together, instructions and product are passed between them
and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the
salaries for LIEMPTY-14, -26 and -27. After drop-off LIEMPTY-13
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-time job, thus
avoiding any direct route back to the basehouse operation.
4. LIEMPTY-9: After completing his surveillance workday
from 0800 to 1500 hours, he completes his written reports and
drives to meet FERNALD at around 1630 hours, also on Tuesdays.
The location of car meetings varies but remains within a quiet,
fairly secluded section. After leaving FERNALD, LIEMPTY-9
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership
for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route
from FERNALD back to the basehouse.
1
5. LIEMPTY-4: After receiving the unprocessed take from
LIEMPTY-9 and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested
by log entries that accompany the take, and goes to LIEMPTY- 4's
medical office waiting room in the late afternoon. For these
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical salesman or
a patient and gets to see LIEMPTY-4 only after all other visitors
have departed. At each meeting, FERNALD delivers films from
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing and retrieves the
processed take that he had left the week before. While this
arrangement means that some of the product (those photos taken
soon after meeting with LIEMPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks
old when received at the Station, we have not found this to be
unacceptable. When speed is of the essence in special
circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the
processing.

"
With the termination of Raymond H. GERENDE, effected on
26 June 1970 and described in HMMA-39129, 29 June 1970, the
LIEPTY Froject now consists of the operations of the LICALLA and
LILYRIC photo base houses and the photo processing of LIEMPTY-4.
Outside case officer Bruce H. FERNALD handles all agents, normally
on a once per week basis, and passes the take to his Station
contact. Operational funds are passed to FERNALD by his Station
contact, and FERNAID pays all agent salaries, rents, and other
expenses. The elimination of GERENDE has resulted in some loss
of efficiency, since base house personnel cannot regularly be met
as frequently as in the past. This can mean a delay of up to two
weeks in receipt by the Station of photos. However, LILYRIC and
LICALLA personnel have standing requirements to report by telephone
visits of Americans, and they are also alerted in advance whenever
possible to forthcoming TDYS of MHHARSH visitors, so that arrangements
can be made for special meetings and speedy processing of photos.
Normally, all photos are developed and printed by LIEMPTY-4.
When speed is of the essence, however, negatives are seat into
the Station for processing by the WOACRE technician.
Thus, while
GERENDE's loss is a serious one in certain respects (he was,
the local scene, talented, knowledgeable, and experienced), LIEMPTY
production has not suffered greatly.

DISPATCH SYMQUL AND NUMBER
HMMA-39188
As far as the security problem is concerned, the generous
termination settlement awarded to GERENDE has probably removed
whatever small temptation there may have been on his part to be
indiscreet about his former association. Although GERENDE has
certain character weaknesses which emerged as a lack of dedication
and a feeling that he could get by with as little work as possible,
the Station believes that he is basically not an irresponsible
person, and that he realizes not only that he has an obligation to
respect security, but that he also realizes that he has been treated
fairly and with great patience. He has offered his services for
the future, and he was told that we appreciated the offer and did
not want to lose completo touch with him, but for now he should
devote himself to getting a good job.
3. As for GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY-19, she also appeared to
be grateful for the termination bonus which she had been granted
(and which she was told had not been carved out of what was due
GERENDE). On the other hand, she has less reason to be loyal to
JKLANCE, and her mental stability is somewhat open to question.
Therefore, she poses a greater threat to LIEMPTY security than
does GERENDE. At the same time, she knows much less about Station
operations and personnel than does GERENDE. Furthermore, it is
not likely that she would (a la Mrs. LIROCKET-1) go directly to
the MHHARSHers with her information. What she might do is reveal
to her lawyer that GERENDE had worked for LNPURE and therefore had
Since
income to which she might feel that she is entitled.
GERENDE is no longer employed and therefore no longer has regular
income (except for monthly payments of the termination bonus,
which she has agreed in writing not to claim), this threat has
also been lessened. Theoretically, however, she could expose
LIEMPTY and LIFEAT techniques (since she has been a LIFEAT transcriber),
but she could not, as far as we know, expose any currently employed
agents, with the exception of LIEMPTY-4, who is married to GERENDE'S
sister. (None of the above assessment of the possible security
threat posed by LIEMPTY-19 is changed by her 8 July visit to
JKLANCE Headquarters.)
4. There have been no changes in the functioning or activities
of the LICALLA base house. In addition to the routine photos,
"attendance reports," and special concentration on the activities

Perhaps the most useful contribution during the reporting period
was the updating of a sketch of the back of the MHHARSH Embassy,
identifying the persons he most often sees at each window. Used in
conjunction with the AEMIDRIFF debriefing (and her knowledge of
the inside), this helped us come up with as accurate a view as we
have ever had of the location of various offices and officers
within the MHHARSH Embassy.

During the period of this report, LIEMPTY-4 processed
approximately 142 rolls of 36-exposure film. Roughly one-third
comes from. LICALLA and the remainder from LILYRIC which
commands the better view and more trafficked approach. In
addition to this routine workload, LIEMPTY-4 was called upon
frequently for additional prints and enlargement of special
targets or interest..
8.
.
LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA), in addition to his picture-taking
(perched for seven hours daily atop a ladder arrangement to see
above the heightened garden wall), regularly provides a detailed
"attendance sheet" and, a monthly summary of MHHARSH personnel
activities. The photos are an indispensible tool in the day-
to-day REDTOP operations program, providing photo identifications
of PCS and TDY-MHHARSHers and assisting to determine probable
RIS affiliation based on observed associations within the
compound. The detailed "attendance sheet" helps in keeping
track of MHHARSHers present, their patterns and changes in
pattern of activities. This information is often the principal
tool in PBRAMPART activities, assisting in identifying the
probable MHHARSH contacts of double agents despatched to the
MIHARSH installation.
•
9. Following are some sample requiremerts which were levied
on LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period:
.a.
weekly reports of work being done at the installation
by YERSHOV and PANOV (DIRECTOR 025386), TDY construction
workers since May 1970.
b. special reports on the activities of AEMERGER who
was under the microscope prior to home eave departure
in July 1970.
c. reports on the activities and associations of
Mikhail Vasilyevich UMNOV (201-819913), TDY AMTORG
representative from New York who is of JKLANCE and
LNERGO interest.
d.
watch for the arrival of Viktor Nikitovich KRESOV,
AEKICK officer of Executive Action Department.
e. confirm arrival and provide details of activities
and associations of Subject of 201-866272 (Moble ANGUS),
LNERGO/LNREAD double agent.
f. special report on AETURNKEY throughout the period.
(LIEMPTY-9 is given a target for concentrated coverage
and reporting over a two or three month period at a time.)
10.
LILYRIC was provided with the same requirements as
LICALLA (paragraph 9 a-e, above), LILYRIC is the main source
of license plate and automobile information both on MHHARSHers
and on visitors to the installation, and has a standing
requirement to report by phone the arrivals of all obviously
WOCORK citizens. One such individual, who now visits regularly,
has been tentatively identified as the language instructor of
the MHHARSH Ambassador's son and a potential lead which we will
investigate.

Effective 1 July 1970, all of the agents of the Project

Reference:
HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969'
PRIORITY
SUMMARY
1. The LIEMPTY Project has thus far, survived the absence from
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE's
marital problems. Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project
personnel since early December 1969, when GERENDE was deactivated
and placed on half-pay. No problems have resulted from this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was). The security
threat will remain as long as GERENDE's estranged wife has it
within her power to expose GERENDE's RVROCK connection and the type
of work he was engaged in. She has continually promised not to do
this, and thus far she has kept her word.
2. The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station. It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LNEPGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field. Two recent examples
underline this: The early (and thus far only) debriefing of
AEMIDRIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing her photos
of all MHHARSH Embassy personnel and getting from her a character
sketch on each individual. These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA. Secondly, LIEMPTY observations (as opposed to

The logs showed that A&TURNKEY might have made the first meeting,
but would certainly have been late for it. For the alleged second
meeting, however, the log showed that AETURNKEY was in the MHHARSH
Embassy for the entire period of the meeting (subject of MEXICO CITY
3389 later amended his story to say that AETURNKEY had not made
the second meeting). LILYRIC personnel were quick to spot the
subject of MEXICO CITY 3542, 25 June 1970, making visits to the
MHHARSH Embassy, and reported these visits by phone even before
the Station had learned, from LIENVOY, of this person's telepl:one
call. Several other visitors of apparent WOLADY nationality were
also routinely reported to local LNFRGO, along with a request for
license plate resolution if a WOLADY license plate is spotted.
Late in June, LILYRIC was alerted to report the possible visit of
a person who had made a phone call to 201-087316, offering the
latter some "interesting information.". LILYRIC spotted and
photographed a person who may be identical with the caller, and
attempts are now under way to resolve this.
6.
LIEMPTY-4 continues to handle all photo developing and
minting (except when certain prints are preded quickly), and in
spite of his leg injury, from which he is now recovered, he did
not miss any deadlines. The fact that GERENDE has been terminated
is not expected to affect his relationship with the Station, even
though he is married to one of GERENDE's sisters. FERNALD has
established good rapport with him, and he has stated that GERENDE's
problems are not his and will have no effect on his association.
.
7. The above recital of LILYRIC and LICALLA activities would
seem to indicate a heavy CI emphasis. Actually, this is not the
case. While CI is an important by-product, not only for ourselves
but also in support of walk-in operations run by other agencies,
the day-in day-out bread and butter photo and fixed surveillance
information is of great importance to our positive operations.

8. With respect to the approved project renewal forwarded
with Reference B, we have the following comments:
a.
Through an oversight, we neglected to report in
Reference A that LILYRIC base house rent was raised as of
1 January 1970 to an annual rate of $3,360.00 (USD).
b.
The
LICALLA base house rent was raised, effective 1
July 1970, to an annual rate of $1,373.00 (USD). (Reference
B shows that this figure has already been requested for
FY 1971.)
c.
As indicated in Reference A, salary increases for
all remaining LIEMPTY personnel will probably be recommended

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERENDE was moving in the other direction.
5. The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen
from GERENDE's memos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
of points, including specifically money. LIEMPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per month. GERENDE is willing to pay 5,000. GERENDE
is currently on half-pay, which means that his total (all source)
monthly income is around 14,000 pesos. From this, he would not only
have to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon, he must also
continue payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-19's father
(paying off a loan obtained to build their house). The complicating
factor is the uncertainly of GERENDE's future with RVROCK. The
Station has maintained for some time that it is impossible to
continue to pay GERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and LILYRIC basehouses. Now that FERNALD has absorbed this duty
with only small inconvenience and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GERENDE to work only to do this. GERENDE
has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and.
prior to the current personal crisis he had been told that he
would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain his position. As Headquarters is aware, he had been
given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability. As we have previously stated, he is personable, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experience
in certain fields. On the other hand, there has long been doubt
about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition.
The "reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached
memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an .
LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job. His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago.
--
6.
The question which
must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
the Station has learned to get along without him. What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference. If all of this were blown,
the loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations
against the MHHARSH target, would be considerable. The Station
does not believe that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already
lost a possible source of income through the termination. GERENDE's
termination bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars. Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never been mentioned.
LICALLA
7.
The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
area). Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AESEASICK case,
for ¨example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
involving the basehouse or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested. This
"special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
individual who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
when was he present (or absent), etc. LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40

GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Marital Conflict
1° While this is not intended to be a full exposition of my
personal and private life over recent years, I would like to mako
known some of the factors that have, from my point of view, led
up to the present situation.
2. I realize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the individuals who may have opportunity to come in
contact with my case dictate as little personal involvement as
possible in the lives of agents. Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartmentation and efficiency prescribe the modue
operandi and, to a great extent the modus vivendi, of agency
personael not only in the sense of earning a living but also in
manner of living. Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
life, the better, but, as the years go by, changes may occur which
go unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
events and repercussions. When a person has been working for the
Station, as I have, for fifteen years with little or no personnel
handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
job, and something comes up like the abrupt separation of my
wife (LIEMPTY-19) and me with the personal and potential security
risks it has entailed, I feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation to reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
former Chief and officers with whom I have had the privilege to
work over the years.
3.
I would like to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
and understanding that have been shown me thus far. Whatever the
final outcome, I know that people have been bending over backward
to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the
conflict.

SECURITY
10. Other than the security problems inherent in GERENDE's
personal problems, there have been no security problems during the
reporting period.
FUTURE PLANS

As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated. This is not an easy decision to make,

However,
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK.
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is
probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened. The Station, therefore,
intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970. GERENDE's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary per
full year. This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD). Furthermore,
Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of

she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herself.
Station does not believe that it would be equitable or sound from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose. Therefore, while the figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount. Total obligations for FY 1970 in
the LIEMPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than
$33,000 (USD). The Project has been approved in the amount of
$38,970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD).
is therefore requested that the LIEMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

hours a week just watching (and photographing) MHHARSH personnel,
and over the years he has gottento know them, and their habits,
very well. Ho can spot unusual or atypical behavior, and when he
is asked to put a certain individual under close scrutiny, his
comments can be very useful. Newcomers, no matter what their
cover, will frequently gravitate to their IS colleagues in the
"safety" of the MHHARSH back yard, thereby enabling us to make
tentative AEKICK or AEGRIP identifications. TD Yers can often be
linked up with their internal escort officers. In the case of
specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sometimes give clues
to personal relationships which can be exploited. During the reporting
period we had special coverage on AESEASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AEMIDRIFF defection and following
the operation against him -- and in both cases LICALLA did report
some change in pattern); 201-305870 (for much the same reason,
although here the evidence was not as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on his patterns and his associatious); ALTAKEOFF
(for the same reason); and 201-838166 (to find out if he did,
in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied). Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activities of TD Yers such as
the AEKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that
"security inspectors" are expected he is told of the expected
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomer immediately)
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to
identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet
an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The
value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely
be overstated.
LILYRIC
8. There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIC basehouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December. FERNAID normally meets only LIEMPTY–13,
at pro-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the films and reports. He occa-
sionally meets LIEMPTY-14 (LIEMPTY-13's wife) when LIEMPTY-13 may
be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise
with the work equally divided among LIEMPTY-13, 1, 26, and −27,
who split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted
coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and
0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays. (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may
be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to
the Station request for such extra coverage during the AEMIDRIFF
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MHHARSH officials,
up-to-date recording of MHHARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs.
As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHHARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting all of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled the Station to identify AESEASICK's
companions during his last few days in Mexico. Without LILYRIC,
identification of the new license plates would have taken months and
would have handicapped our operations. LILYRIC has also provided
special coverage of the visit of a Latin American CP representative,
and is currently watching for the two AEKICK security technicians,
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also,
LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican students and the identity
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal with them or hand out
literature to them. In short, LILYRIC's services, even though the

are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda
prepared by GERENDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a settlement. There is no hope of
reconciliation. The Station's position with GERENDE from the
start has been that he must agree to an amicable settlement with
- his wife in order to insure that she would not feel forced to takė
steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations.
For this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any
financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that
salary. GERENDE's wife was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was strictly informal. The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to use his RVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his
wife, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain
from exposing his connections. Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear
to her that she, as well as GERENDE, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for
his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely
out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conform.
-
4. The attached memoranda from GERENDE are, in the Station's
opinion, basically fair accounts. In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIEMPTY-19) the benefit of the
doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character
weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to
procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake). Early in the
conflict, LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about GERENDE's salary. She was told
she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone that GERENDE had any connection with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the
level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDE's monthly salary from
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he
would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts
determined should be paid from his overt income. This, of course
was strictly an informal arrangement, one which would stop the
minute GERENDE stopped receiving a salary. Later, as LIEMPTY-19's
position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for
an amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
that GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him
arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be
jeopardized. While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no
intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a
word to a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in
fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost his job, she and the
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income. Her attitude is

the best thing to do was to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on
the way.
With three friends as partners, I entered on a land-buying
deal which turned out to be complicated as we bought the land in
the form of company stock. The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds from the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since. 1955. LIEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie
us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the
project and the building which began in August 1967. While LIEMPTY-19
supervised the construction, I worked during September and October
almost full-time for the Olympic Organizing Committee and the group
from Czechoslovakia which came to train in the pre-Olympics. My
father-in-law deposited money in Mexico to help us with the major
part of the financing of the house. We used $286,500 pesos of his
money and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-19 and I had saved and got the
house finished enough to move in in March 1968. We were very short
on furniture and shortly after moving, in bought three bedroom sets,
an automatic washer and even a piano, Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful. The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, the house was unpainted.
Thereafter, we did things on the house as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,
built a fence and front gate.

7.
Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
I worked, unofficially this time, with the water polo team from
Australia. LIEMPTY-19 worked for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio and TV group. LIEMPTY-19 was, once again, caught up
in the atmosphere of being among Europeans and doing something
exciting and out of the routine of home and children. She fell
love with the Australians as well, and for several months all she
could talk of was that we should move to Australia. I gave it some
thought but decided that we had neither the money to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioneers "down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority
here in Mexico.
8.
Toward the end of 1968, LIEMPTY-19 decided it was time for
me to move out of the master bedroom as she could no longer face
that aspect of our married life. For several months we tried this
but it did not work out for me One night in March 1969 after we
returned home from a party, she asked me to help her undress and
when she, once again, refused to have any thing to do with me,
got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
had already been pondering, to visit her parents in Holland as soon
as possible. Her father provided the plane fare and she left in
April for the United States to visit her brother and sister and
Holland, for what she said would be a five week trip. She stayed
tway ten weeks. The four children remained with me, the maid, and

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG Embassy,
which served intermittently as a listening post-basehouse for the
agency. At the time, LIEMPTY-19 was working as the manager of the
hookstore at the University of the Americas and, at the same time,
studying for a B.A. in philosophy. Those were happy times. We
received a two-month leave, went to Europe, the Rome Olympics and
visited LIEMPTY-19's family in Holland. Back in alexico, when the
base was in operation I stayed home a lot (one of the requirements),
minded the dial and tape recorders and the baby an unfortunate
reversal of marital roles. After exactly five years the basehouse
was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my
mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse
keeper. My mother and youngest sister gave considerable help in
taking care of the baby while LIEMPTY-19 worked and when we went
to Europe and left the baby with them. This was during the first
three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher.

5.
We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement
the loss of salary and rent allowance, the Station began paying
1,000 pesos a month for the use of a dark room I had built or the
roof of the building. We had our third child, Madeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment. The
a partment need not have been so small but we had chosen it for its
location and style and because it was to be a temporary stop until
we could find something better. We missed going to the Olympics
in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began
negotiating to buy a home building site at Rio Escondido but whea
the deal fell through, we decided to go on leave to Europe again,
this time with the two older children, leaving the baby with my
sister. We visited with LIEMPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to Holland after having lived in Washington. D.C., since
1943) and the two children, stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I
made side trips. Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life.
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back two weeks earlier), LIEMPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving Europe and being back in Mexico she was
emotionally and physically inaccessible for about six weeks. She
had not fully adjusted to living in Mexico or to settling down and
becoming a housewife. Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack
of money, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night
poker games, the three children, all these got her down.
6. In the fall of 1965 after our return from Europe I began
teaching English to beginners in the adult education program at the
American School in the evenings. This started as a two-hour a
week moonlighting experiment but by early 1966, through student
contacts made at the school, I had branched out to teaching at the
offices of Carnation Milk Co., Singer Sewing Machine, and
Richardson-Merrell Drug Co. for a total of about twenty hours per
week.
LIEMPTY-19, meantime, was working part-time at the Hamilton
School in Lomas where the two older children were attending. The
family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

SLET
9 March 1970
SUBJECT:
GERENDE Status Report
The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and
his wife (LIEMPTY-19) is as follows:
1.
GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos
B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9.
Apartment 9. He has rented a three-bedroom
apartment at Tornel 2 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
he has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
former address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezares.
2.
The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, his wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality. The
monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,
beginning 1 February 1970.
3. LIEMPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Barcn
Schelto Van Heemstra at Peña 360, Jardines del Pedregal. It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them. They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends."
4.
LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lawy; and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.
Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal
made by Juardo on 4 March 1970.
5. The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:
a.
Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge
rests at the 5° Juzgado Penal, 2ª Corte Penal located at
LPCA - 33/

"abandon" the children. I refused to visit her lawyer with her
saying I was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that her mind was made up and that we would have to split up.
11.
Things came to a head on the night of 12 Noverber when I
got home around 9 PM and she suggested we have a drink and talk
things over. I mixed some martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought we should get divorced, i.e. I should
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
grant her custody of the children and support of 2,000 pesos per
month per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
upstairs and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not let her do. She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,
Uta de la Hoz, then she went into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their house. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LIEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away.
About a half-hour later I walked up to Uta's to ask LIEMPTY-19
to come home but was told that she was busy phoning her lawyer
and would not return.
12. The following morning I took the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LIEMPTY-4's wife) picked them up ard
took them to her house where I joined them for lunch. LIEMPTY-19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was out, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do so, then
disappeared and was not to be found.
13.
It was the subsequent action taken by LIEMPTY-19 in
dropping her lawyers and taking on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazards that ensued.

my mother who came to help three days a week. Upon her return,
LISPTY-19 bore an air of resignation rather than of enthusiam and,
` again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down
and mentally unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that it she had wanted to live in Australia, she should
have married an Australian. The separation had not improved our
intimate relationship.
9. In August I was to take five weeks'
I was to take five weeks' leave and go with the
children to Astro-World in houston and visit my mother's family in
South Carolina. When I suggested postponing making monthly payments
on her father's loan until December when the Christmas Bonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she was adamant.
saying that if I did not have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrowed from my life insurance policy and left with the
three youngest children. Adriana had a touch of hepatitis and
joined us three weeks later. After spending the month in South
Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LIEMPTY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude.
her solitude. We had already
We had already talked about divorce before
her trip to Holland in the spring. I had told her that I would not
consider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part
of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been
since the buying of the land. LIEMPTY-19 said I could mortgage or
sell the house but that the money was what she was mainly interested
ia. I told her that the sale of the house was not financially
wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very
likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
considering the housing developments going on in the area. Added
to this was the sentimental attachment to the house and area. A
mortgage, on the other hand, for the amount of her father's loan
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico.
10. At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the above-mentioned discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a
course at Japan Airlines to become a tour guide and group leader
for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly,
to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer d 1970. The
received a diploma to that effect. I told her that if she wanted
out of the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay he" father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
and 5 percent per year). She then sought
She then sought legal advice from an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, in turn, steered
her to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children because LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concerning them and she now said that she could not

GERENDE served with papers though his current address is known,
apparently because she is still seeking a voluntary divorce along
the lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of
proposals. GERENDE cannot begin to accept these proposals in
their-present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point
to beginning bargaining from.

showing up to date payment of the loan at the "Mesa 31ª."
No further action has been taken by LIEMPT Y-19 or her lawyer
on this matter but the charge has not finally been settled and
is still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper "lubrication" in order to be filed away.
c. Neglect -- this charge was made by LIEPTY-19 in
December 1969 at the 7° Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute. GERENDE was not
notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a
hearing at the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERENDE, took
him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri. This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged. The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidence. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and
see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparently,
that matter is closed.
6. On 14 November 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared
from home taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges
against her for minor lesions and showed medical proof thereof.
The hearing of 9 February after which GERENDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since the injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in
once a week.
7. LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri. Street in San Angel Inn. The two older children
are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school. On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30
to try to speak to LIEMPTY-19 and see the children. LIEMPTY-19
has objected to this and the meetings have been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's. GERENDE's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).
8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judges,
in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come
to reside at the 1st Juzgado Civil in the D.F. The judge is Olda
CORREA (woman) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's part. LIEMPTY-19, on the other hand, has not had

Lecumberri. The judge is CRUZ Mellado.
These charges have
not been pressed since they were originally made on 13 November
1969 by LIEMPTY-19. The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 2ª Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Juzgados Penales. The
judge of the 6° Juzgado is Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of
GERENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON. Together they have,
on two occasions, been to speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to issue an arrest warrant and who has, finally,
called for a hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10:00. MAGALLON has given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed.

b. Fraud this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDE left the
Villa Obregon jail after having spent a week there for
disobeying a court order. (The court order had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIEMPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children. GERENDE refused them
admission under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention.
a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
LUCAS del ARANAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent. The judge has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
Magallon and Jurado. The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31ª
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal. The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
the separate property marriage clause had wrongfully placed
the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965
in a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and James
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their
spouses. Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen
months the deeds were issued. LIEMPTY-19 supervised and proaded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GERENDE's name. In August 1967 when
construction of the house began, LIEMPTY-19's father's money
was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose.
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GERENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it.
GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts

SEC.
8 March 1970
The following proposals were made to GERENDE on 4 March 1970
(Monday) by LIEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a mutual
friend, Licenciado Carlos Heyu, to wit:
TERMS under which the problem of (LIEMPTY-19] and [Raymond H.
GERENDE] could be solved.
The right (patria potestad) to the minors would be kept
by both the mother and father.
1.
2. The guardianship and custody of the four children is
´entrusted to the mother. The father may visit the children once
a week between 10:00 and 19:00 hours; he may take them out once a
month and will return them to the mother's address before 19:00.
3. The father is obliged to pay the mother the sum of
10,000 pesos MN, in advance, per month beginning with the month
of November 1969, since which time he has not given the mother or
children any money at all.
4. This agreement will be raised to the level of a formal
public writ the day it is signed by both parties.
5. Both spouses agree to divorce voluntarily under the terms
of this agreement.
6. Upon termination of the divorce procedure, by mutual
consent, both parties will desist from the civil and penal actions
that either might have initiated against the other.
7. Both spouses are obliged to attend punctually the meetings
that the legal procedure establishes as well as grant the guarantees
demanded by the Public Ministry and acting Judge for the approval
of this agreement and granting of the divorce.
8. In order that the father may visit his children and take
them out, the mother is obliged to give notice of every change of
address.
With the exception of the one day a week that the father
may visit the children and the one day a month when he may take

them out, the father contracts the obligation of absolutely
abstaining from calling on the mother's address, so that she may
carry on her life freely without neglecting her children.
10. While the voluntary divorce is being processed, the
mother and children will live at
and, as
above stated, to satisfy their needs, the father will make the
first monthly payment of $10,000,
11. Neither the father nor the mother may take the children
out of Mexican territory without the authorization of the other.
12. Since GERENDE owes the parents of LIEMPTY-19 the sum of
$286,500 plus agreed-on interest, minus whatever payments he has
been able to make, the said GERENDE is obliged to mortgage the house
at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, procisely during the
course of the divorce procedure by mutual consent as established
in the antecedent clauses and before the divorce is granted so that
LIEMPTY-19's parents are reimbursed on their loan or on the out-
standing unpaid balance.
13. The expenses of making this agreement a formal writ as
well as the fees of B. Juardo will be paid by GERENDE but these
will be fixed in an equitable manner by Carlos Heyn to whose
decision both will submit.
14. In case of failure to comply with any of the clauses of
this agreement at any time or for just one time, either by GEREND E
or LIEMPTY-19, both agree to expressly establish the following
sanctions and terms:
15.
If GERENDE is the one who violates any clause just one
time, he will forfeit the house at Ladera 39 to the mother and
children, LIEMPTY-19, Adriana Juliette, Christopher Ramon, Maria
Madeleine, and Laurence Fernando, and said property will belong to
the above mentioned persons.
16. If LIEMPTY-19 is the one who violates the terms of this
agreement for just one itme, she will lose the custody of children
in favor of the father or whatever person he designates for the
guardianship and custody of the minors.
17. Since LIEMPTY-19 has to establish an appropriate place
to live, in the company of her four children, both parties agree
that the household effects will be turned over by GERENDE, to
LİEMPTY-19 for that purpose, as well as the automobile she has been
using throughout the marriage.

principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden his
activities, to include additional agent handling and the following
up of ops leads. After a slow start, some progress has been made,
but GERENDE is now involved in divorce proceedings with his wife.
This situation is steadily worsening and represents a potential
security risk to LIEMPTY and other Station operations.
GERENDE
3. As Headquarters is aware, the Station has for some time
tried to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. The Station has
long recognized GERENDE's not inconsiderable talents: He is personable,
fluent in two languages (to the point where he can pass either as a
Nexican or an American with no trouble), he has considerable
experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local
scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the
Station's disposal. He has also worked for RVROCK for close to
15 years, in effect making a career of RVROCK, and the Station
believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCK an
obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benefits
which would not otherwise be due an agent with less longevity. On
the other hand, GERENDE has picked up some bad habits--he is not
punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst of
'all, he lacks drive and ambition.

SUMMARY
1.
HMMA-35080, 22 July 1968
There have been no basic changes in the operation of the
project during the reporting period. Raymond H. GERENDE continues
as principal agent, handling the personnel of the two base houses,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, and performing other additional tasks. On
27 December 1968, consistent with our effort to get as much of the
support activity as possible handled by outside officers, direct
agent-handling responsibility for GERENDE and the LIEMPTY project
was turned over to Bruce H. FERNALD), Vincent P. RIZZUTO remains
as alternate and as FERNALD's inside contact.
GERENDE
2.
Until the introduction of FERNALD, there was no change in
the meeting arrangements with GERENDE. Meetings were held on an
average of three times per week until October, when LIEMPTY-19
(GERENDE's wife) was relieved of the responsibility of transcribing
the Spanish-language portions of LIENVOY coverage of the BEDOX
installation. Thereafter meetings averaged twice per week, the main
business being the transfer of LIEMPTY base house material and
discussion of base house business.

the oren he must past coming to meets are bed and are still getting worse.
He has no way of starting the trip to the meet before 0900-0905 hrs because

G handed in an accounting for his RF.
Separately he handed in a contact report on his meet with

FELLEMENT prepared for G. We discussed briefly the instruction which was
selfexplanatory.

I was obliged to put some pressure on concerning the WUITENAU
report which he did not bring as he promised. In fact he has done some
work on W, but did not get all the info he believed he could get.
6.
I spoke to him again about VARGAS case ( just as I did 2-3 weeks
ago) and this time G was rather convinced that he would not be able to
work hir way to 7 mmoothly and he advocated a direct (cold) approach. I
told him to put on paper what he did thus fer concerning VARGAS and what
were his suggestions. Will the trick work, I do not know.
6.
I told him to ascertain with Base Houses whether the personnel
had plans for Kman leave including himself and xb,itted submit it for

HMMA-38119
After several largely abortive attempts to get GERENDE to
follow up operational leads (and after noting, at the same time, a
fine job he did in recruiting LIRICE-13), the Station decided to
present GERENDE with what amounted to an ultimatum: Following a
six-week leave at the home of relatives in the US, he was told that
in recognition of his past services he was being given a salary
increase to $7,000 US per annum (which may not seem like much until
it is realized that GERENDE pays no taxes on this, and has the use
of a QP car, to boot). He was also told that he would be given a
number of leads to follow up (in some cases persons to whom he had
natural access; in other cases leads which he would follow up under
cover and in alias), as well as agents to handle (in alias). It
would be up to him to take advantage of this opportunity to perform
up to his level of ability; if he did so, Headquarters would be
willing to work out an annuity program which would relieve his
worries about eventual retirement. . If he did not put out, he could
expect to be terminated by the end of FY 1970. GERENDE expressed
his gratitude and his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel,
and, in fact, he has done so. In October 1969 he took over the
handling of LIANVIL-1-from Oliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station has
started to give him leads to follow up. His performance has improved
in every way--his punctuality has improved his written reports
are continually improving, and he has made the effort to devise
approaches to the various leads and to start to follow up on them.
i
The
4. The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24
October, when GERENDE reported that his wife wanted a divorce.
problem is basically one of incompatibility of personalities,
exacerbated by the fact that GERENDE's operational activities
resulted in his being home more often than a man who works a normal
office day. GERENDE's wife had taken a long vacation alone earlier
in the year, visiting her parents, and the leave taken by GERENDE,
referred to above, followed his wife's return and did not include
her. Both times GERENDE had the four children. Thus the news of
the divorce request did not come as a real surprise. The problem,
however, is that both parties want custody of the children, and the
dispute becomes daily more bitter and more violent. The station
has taken the position that security of GERENDE's operations must
be preserved at all costs, hoping, of course, that the divorce can
be avoided. At this writing, the outcome cannot be guessed. If
the bitter fight results in the surfacing of GERENDE's RVROCK
employment, LILYRIC and LICALLA are faced with at least ame threat
of exposure. The MHHARSHers are quite aware that a LILYRIC-like
facility exists; whether they suspect LICALLA is a moot question.
LICALLA is in many ways more useful, and the MHHARSHers could put
it out of business very easily by making their wall higher. Little
could, or probably would, be done to prevent LILYRIC from functioning.
.
5. Other than LIANVIL-1 and the LIEMPTY assets directly
handled by GERENDE (LILYRIC and LICALLA personnel and LIEMPTY-4)
other Station assets whose security might be affected by GERENDE's
current problems include LIENTRAP, LIRICE-13, and the PCM OP.
GERENDE is also aware of the fact that some sort of operation,
presumably technical, is or has been conducted from the LIMESA
complex; he is aware of the existance and knows some of the members
of the LIEMBRACE team (LIEMBRACE-1, -2, and -4, among the currently
active), and he knows of the existance of LIENVOY and LIFEAT. His
wife is LIFEAT-19 and has been a substitute transcriber as late as
Tate 1968, and his mother was LIFEUD-19 (a former LIFEAT basehouse
keeper, inactive since June 1964). : GERENDE also knows SCANTLING,
David M. WILSTED, and Raymond L. BARCENAS, as well as current Station
officers Vincent P. RIZZUTO and Bruce H. FERNALD (the latter in
alias). He has also met Andrew E. PELLEMENT, who used an alias.
In his 15 years, GERENDE has worked in almost every phase of the
Station's support activities, and even though in recent years he
has been pretty much restricted to LIEMPTY, his knowledge of
activities and assets which are still current is considerable.
is too early to judge the outcome of GERENDE's problems, but the
Station is making every effort to see that security of operations
is not affected by whatever decision is reached.

3. GERENDE's agent handling responsibilities within the LIEMPTY
project remain as previously reported. He had also handled EREAIN-3
until the latter's termination in August 1908. He developed a good
relationship with ERFAIN-3, and he showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case officer guidance, of providing useful service to
the Station in the handling of agents beyond the support type to
which he had been limited in the past. The Station intends to try
to expand this role, with due regard for security and for GERENDE'S
limited experience. Furthermore, the Station still has every
intention of using GERENDE selectively in cultivation and development
oi operational leads, as outlined in reference. No such leads were
found for GERENDE during the reporting period (among other reasons,
we have no intention of giving GERENDE a lead simply for the sake of
giving him something to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is
uncovered, it will be passed to GERENDE.
4. GERENDE was particularly useful during the Olympic period.
While he did not get a job with the Olympic Committed as he had
hoped, his wife was employed as a translator by the European television
networks who had come to cover the games. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GERENDE a certain amount of access to Olympic facilities.
Both GERENDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AEEGGHEAD material, and GERENDE performed a number of miscellaneous
tasks assisting the Station in various Olympic responsibilities.
5.
GERENDE has also been used in support of JMROD operations,
such as making mail pick-ups and delivering material and making phone
calls to AMBASSCON. Following the Warsaw Pact Powers' invasion of
Czechoslovakia, GERENDE was asked to cover a demonstration in front
of the Soviet Ambassy, and he wrote a good report which was used in
Embassy briefings. Recently, GERENDE has enrolled at the
University of the Americas to work for an M.A. in contemporary
Mexican history. The Station will explore the possibility of his
getting access to persons or information of interest on the University
campus.
LICALLA
G.
LIEMPTY-9's work (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's room near his working
quarters. During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational photos. His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the past. LIEMPTY-9 is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unique vantage point remains the source of the most
interesting and revealing photos as well as often very informative
reporting.
LILYRIC
7. LIEMPTY-13, -14, -26, and -27 have been able to keep the
LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis from 0800 to 1800 hours
weekdays and 0800 to 1300 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-
able upon request. This has proven to be a far better arrangement
than depending on LIMITED for some of this coverage. In addition to
the 6,763 operational photos taken during the reporting period and the
daily fixed surveillance reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable
help in compiling current vehicle and license plates lists, PCS arrivals
and departures, unusual activities such as, demonstrations or protests,
unusual or lengthy absences of personnel, etc., all of which have
obvious CI importance. It was LILYRIC photos which made it possible
for LN-ERGO to identify the Subject of 201-841520, who had been in
clandestine contact with AEGRIP officers. LILYRIC also reported on
a half dozen other American (or American appearing) visitors, some of
whom it was possible to identify through tracing license plates.

4. It should not be forgotten that a person tried both to
rent and buy Limesa properties earlier in the year after ve
owned them. So far as we know, a check on this person was not.
productive of suspicious data, but the question arises as to how
thorough the investigation was. Possibly the name the man gave
when making inquiries was false, meaning that in effect the right
person has never been investigated at all. Knowing that the
targets have in the past shown some interest in the Limesa build-
ings, it is not beyond the realm of reason that this man was sent
by them. The story he gave for wishing to rent the house--because
it was handy and close to a certain school--is identical with the
story used by the Station to cover rental of Licalla almost next
door.
5. Even granting that the true ownership of Limesa has not
been discovered by the targets, they have various recourses through which
to establish the identity and activity of the occupants thereof. The
following possibilities suggest themselves:
6.
a.
Enter into litigation with Limesa owner over exact
boundaries or other pretext, demanding property be
surveyed. On court order, Limesa could be inspected
thoroughly.
b. Undermine target side of Limesa valls, leading to
possible condemnation of property by local government
or necessity various repairs, etc.
Sabotage of electricity (causing fire) or water or
sewage, necessitating entry into Limesa of outside per-
sons, who could be infiltered by target agents.
d. Ramming by vehicle, with similar results, police,
firemen, etc.
e. Complaint to medical authorities on filth, refuse. etc.,
leading to inspection by health authorities.
f. Various other approaches might be discussed.
One general recommendation can be made: sensitive material
should be used and kept in a crypt, and a good one, rather than in
the relatively insecure special room now planned as the operational
room.
7. Beyond this, every effort should be made to see to it that
the operators have good cover. The idea of clothing them in local
clothing is excellent and shows right thinking in that direction.

1. Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already
been, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly
to what countermeasures the target may institute, or may already
have instituted.
2. One current danger certainly exists, to wit, the exist-
ence of project Licalla base, which is in the group of buildings
comprising the Limesa complex. One of the agents at Licalla
base is known to one of the Lipstick agents arrested in the
summer of 1958, and it is, hence, possible that both the host
government and the target knows of Licalla. It is suggested
that perhaps Licalla should be terminated. The reason has been
advanced that this should not be done since the agent would be
suspicious and in any event Licalla might serve as a red herring
for Limesa. It is believed that the Licalla agent could be
gotten out of this operation without arousing his suspicion. The
Station could mount an obvious tail on him; when he reported it,
he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, the
operation should no longer continue. The agent has been a good
one and could be used elsewhere on some other work. Licalla
house is going to be repaired soon. This might be a good oppor-
tunity to stop work there and let some innocent party rent it.
That would be a better red herring.
3.
Concerning the manner in which Limesa houses were acquired
by the Station, it should be kept in mind that the purchase mechanism
was identical with that used in Limited. The watchman at Limited
knew an American owned it and told this to what to him must have
seemed a casual visitor to the premises when it was under repairs.
We should, therefore, assume the targets know an American owns it
and that it is blown. Therefore, we should also assume that if
the targets have conducted any sort of an investigation of Limesa
houses, they may well have discovered that the same ultimate owner
is involved. So far as is known, the bank which fronts for the
purchases has not been checked to see if any inquiries have been
made. We must agree the targets have the capability to find out
who the front owner is--the bank-- and from there could possibly
establish the identity of the owner, Limousine. Limousine and his
firms have also been used as cover for other Station agents and
operations apart from Limesa and Limited.

15.
In line with the above reasoning, GERENDE was introduced
to Andrew R. DOSCHER on 17 February 1968. The idea was that
GERENDE would be trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations against Central American targets. GERENDE's principal
duty thus far has been to take over the handling of ERFAIN-3,
under DOSCHER's close supervision and guidance. GERENDE has
performed quite creditably in this task. He seems interested
in the work and has learned quickly. On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting. If GERENDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to believe GERENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.
7.
GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a girl who, por LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidence. It is quite likely that he could have
recruited the girl as an access agent against AERODENT, but as
this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, for the time being at loast
(among other things, there was no indication that she had had
any contact with AERODENT for some months). The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to
doing the job. It should be mentioned, however, that at the
same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed.
3.
Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a
listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working for the MIRAVEL committee.
LICALLA
9. The star of the LIEMPTY show, as far as quality of
performance is concerned, continues to be LIEMPTY-9. His
favorable location and his perceptiveness continue to result in
revealing photos and equally revealing commentary. In addition
to the 2,908 operational photos taken during the reporting
period, he has provided daily, weekly, and monthly summaries and
'notes, semi-monthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL personnel
spotted by him), various special reports, and special intensive
coverage of the following: 201-120123; 201-107668; 201-271103;
and 201-305870. As of 1 May 1968 LIEMPTY-9's salary was raised
from 4,000 pesos to 4,500 pesos per month. LIEMPTY-9 was also
given permission to have a maid's room constructed on the roof
of his apartment. The original maid's room is LIEMPTY-9's photo
point. The maid, who has been with the family for 11 years
(since she was 10) either sleeps in the hall, where she is in the
way, or in the bedroom of LIEMPTY-9's nine-year old son, which
LIEMPTY-9 feels is beginning to be not a proper arrangement.
The room will be built at a point on the roof away from the
FJSTEAL. installation (so as to arouse as little suspicion as
possible), and the fact that the maid will be seen going in and
out of the room regularly should quiet any suspicions which may
arise. Construction work put LICALLA out of action starting
24 June, but it is expected that the work will be finished by
20 July.

Summary
1.
During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H. GERENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to the Station. These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the same
token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset. The
LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper-
ations. The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIEMPTY-6,
were terminated on 31 May 1968. Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur-
ably decreased the reliability and effectiveness of LIEMPTY-6's
work. LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC
and LIMITED had together in the past.

2. During the reporting period, the case officer has been
meeting GERENDE an average of three times per week. Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Meetings
average 20 to 30 minutes. GERENDE turns over to the case
officer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
picked up from the base houses since the previous meeting,
along with brief contact reports on his meetings with base
house representatives. Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc-
tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge-
ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting. (The departure
of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber. As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,
GERENDE's wife, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes. She does the work in her home, and GERENDE transports the
tapes.)
--
3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo-processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-6 (LIMITED; met once per week until
termination); LIEMPTYS 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per wook in his absence LIEMPTY-27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). lo is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the administrative problems which may develop. To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents
and is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them particularly LICALIA and LILYRIC personnel.
--
4. As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit.
His MHRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,
but we expect it to start picking up again. GERENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to get
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL
delegation as possible.
same.
5. Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed
nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the
Furthermore, GERENDE's standing assignments (LIEMPTY
base houses, MHRAVEL activity, and occasional support of JMROD
requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough
of GERENDE's timo. GERENDE is rather firmly committed to
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOFIRM for
over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any
consequence. By the same token, he was, through no fault of
his own, doing less work for WOFIRM than at any time in his
career. GERENDE's operational exposure through the years
dictated more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound
security reasons. The solution to GERENDE's problem (lack of
a promising future) and the Station's (not getting its money's
worth) seemed to be to give GERENDE additional tasks which he
could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions. Since most of GERENDE's support activities had
been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction,
It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in
a non-FJSTEAL field.

The Station proposes that LIEHPTY-11 be used part-time with the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team, He also will continue his LIENTRAP
Relivities. This activity will enable the Station to make greater
use of LIEMPTY-11's time and also give complete familiarity with

4. LIEN?TY-11 has an Operational Approval granted on 14

3. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY Project performed in a sat-
isfactory manner during this period. Effective 1 July 1967 LIEMPTY-↳
and LIEMPTY-11 were given slight salary increases, because of their
increased activity.
4. There were no known security incidents affecting the LIEMPTY
Project or the assets involved during the three months under review.
LICALLA
5. This basehouse, the operator of which is LIEMPTY-9, provided
1277 frames of operational photographs covering the patio and garden area
of FJSTEAL. LIEMPTY-9 also prepared fixed-surveillance reports, sighting
reports and special notes and comments.
LILYRIC
6. The LILYRIC basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 and -27,
produced 2854 frames of operational photograph during the period. The
LILYRIC basehouse operators continued to prepare fixed-surveillance reports
on each member of FJSTEAL and turned these in on a weekly basis. LIEMPTY-27
resumed his duties on 1 July as scheduled and this basshouse has now re-
verted to its normal hours of coverage. (See reference relative to the
absence of LIEMPTY-27.)
LIMITED
7. The LIMITED Basehouse, operated by LIEMPTY-6, produced 279 frames
of operational photographs plus weekly fixed surveillance reports on each
of the members of FJSTEAL. The LIMITED basehouse was closed from 17 through
22 July because of the illness of LIEMPTY-6. During this period LIEMPTY-6
did very little radio-alerting for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team because
of the variation of the surveillance team's activities.
LIENTRAP
8. The LIENTRAP mobile photo vehicle had a decrease in activity during
this period because of the dismantling of the old LIENTRAP vehicle and the
modification and installation of equipment in the new vehicle. The old
LIENTRAP vehicle was used to cover photographically all of the residences
of opposition elements in Mexico City. As in the past LIENTRAP provided
photographic coverage of addresses of the local Communist parties, residences
· of members of other Hemisphere parties and several PERUMEN targets. A
total of 332 frames of operational photographs were provided by LIENTRAP.
PHOTO LAB
.
9. LIEMPTY-4, the operator of the LIEMPTY photo lab, processed all
of the operational photographs mentioned above as well as providing from
2 to 6 enlargements of 299 frames of photographs of special interest taken
by the basehouses. LIEMPTY-4 does the photo processing on Tuesday and
Thursday nights.

GENERAL
1. Project LIEMPTY is a support project which provides information of
CI/CE interest on the FJSTFAL installation, FJSTEAL personnel, visitors to
FJSTEAL, both indigenous and foreign, and photographic coverage of various
targets deemed of interest by the several operational sections within the
Station. The Project has eight active agents plus Raymond H. GERENDE,
Principal Agent; two vehicles, GERENDE's QPV and the LIENTRAP photo truck;
a photographic. processing laboratory; and, three basehouses, LILYRIC, LIMITED
and LICALLA. LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11, operators of the photo surveillance
truck, also acquire and service P. O. boxes used operationally by the Station,
Headquarters and other Stations.

On 9 December 1966 Luke B. MARSCHALEK (p) assumed Case Officer res-
ponsibilities for the LIEMPTY Project. MARSCHALEX was introduced to GERENDS in
true name and GERENDE is the only member of the LIEMPTY complex whom MARSCHALEK
has met. There were no problems during the change of Case Officers and none
are envisioned in the future.

4. There were no known security incidents during the period covered in this
report. As a precautionary measure, the LIEMPTY basenousekeepers were instructed
to maintain increased vigilance in their respective areas and buildings and to be
prepared to evacuate any incriminating equipment and papers on a moment's notice.
This was done because of the renewed interest in the assassination of President
Kennedy which in turn brought forth comments in the press about photographs
taken of Oswald during his visit to Mexico. On three occasions during this period,
LIEMBRACE-3 surveilled the operational meetings between GERENDS and LIEMPTY-6.
This was done in order to try to ascertain if any FJSTEAL personnel were taking
measures to verify the activities of LIEMPTY-6. LIEMBRACE-3 reported that all
of the meetings he covered appeared to be clean of hostile surveillance.
(NOTE: Headquarters is aware of the interest FJSTEAL has taken in LIEMPTY-6.
LIEMBRACE-3 does not know the exact location of LIMITED/LIENTY-ć, although he
is aware of the existence of this asset because of the radio alert system used by.
the surveillance team when working the FJSTEAL target. In order to avoid
LIEMBRACE-3 surveilling LIEMPTY-6 to the exact address, LIENERACS-3 was instructed
to surveill GERENDE when he departed the meeting site and to report to GERENDE
after LIEMBRACE-3 was convinced that there was no hostile surveillance and after
they had departed the meeting area.)
LICALLA
5. During this period LIEMPTY-9, operator of the LICALLA basehouse, provided
1112 frames of operational photographs covering the patio and garden area of
FJSTEAL. All photographs provided by LIEMPTY-9 were accompanied by fixed-
surveillance reports, sighting reports and special notes. LIEMPTY-9 is a per-
ceptive individual and his special notes and comments are considered to be of
great value by the interested section in the Station. LICALLA Coverage vas
suspended during the period 19 through 25 March while LIEMPTY- was taking a well-
deserved vacation. The cover of the LICALIA basehouse appears to remain good,
with no undue attention devoted to it by FJSTEAL personnel.
LILYRIC
6. This basehouse, which is staffed by LIEMPTY-13, -14 and -27, produced
2553 frames of operational photographs during the review period. LIEMPTY-13 is
employed full-time and most of the coverage is provided by LIEMPTY-14, and -27,
although during this period, LIEMPTY-14 carried the largest share of the workload.
In March the hours in which LIEMPTY-27, a medical student, attended school
were changed from the afternoon to the morning. This schedule change will remain
in effect until the end of June 1967. LIEMPTY-14 does not have the mental composure
to remain on the job for the hours needed to provide full-time coverage and her
homekeeping duties often interfered with her working hours. In order to alleviate
this problem, the working hours of LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED were increased and those of
LILYRIC/LIEMPTY-14 decreased. No serious loss of coverage resulted from this tem-
porary change in working hours. The salary of LIEMPTY-27 was cut in half for the
period of time in which he will not be providing continual assistance to the Project.
7. LILYRIC remains as the main source of information on WOLADY and other
foreign visitors to FJSTEAL.
LIMITED
8. LIEMPTY-6, the operator of the LIMITED basehouse, provided 684 frames of
operational photographs during the three month period. LINFTY-6 also spent a
great deal of time alerting for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team during this period
because of the AEQUALITY-1 operation. LIEMPTY-6 was on vacation from 8 through
23 April and coverage from this basehouse was suspended during this period. As
mentioned above, LIEMPTY-6 now is working longer hours in order to relieve LIEMPTY-14.
LIEMPTY-6 does not know why his hours were increased.
9. On one occasion during this perio! LIEMPTY-6, while alerting the LIFMBRACE
team on an FJSTEAL target, noted that a WOLADY subject had entered FJSTEAL on foot.
He alerted the team and they were able to surveill the subject and identify him
through records at the hotel where he was staying.
