Coral Gables, Florida
In the evening of 24 July 1990 Iceived a telephone call froin qui ject
who had been von my moms handydon by other bent of the itelligenso
domunity in demention with the pity of his long late information
ming the numbent impending; trib of Betiste the US.
2. Wurbell Infected that he spent a great amount of his in the
Dominican Republic and had eyebly be association with lenders of the gover-
ment, and so with Ceneral Jone Pedraza. He claimed to have ocena Tomer member
also
been
of the 056 with service in China in WWII. Farbell in soldier-of-cortile type
who wears it drive a Hengele Pons, attentive blonde girl
Friend, and in Big Spender. He alla volunteered that he hapa wife and six
Headdo
children living in Georgin
3. Warbell sold p that his principle source of income is in dealing with
Cuban pesos; and sold that he is bed in the business with a John Lipko of
Los Angeles, a jazz musician who formerly played with the Jimmy Dorsey and Jan
Curier bands.
4. Lipko also claims to have been a member of 053 during WWII serving in
the lagunian and Eustian Erope dou. Lipko wa usily engaged in making long.
distice phone calls to Mexico City, Quaten City, and Los Angeles during a
part of the time I wan with the group.
5. Warbell gave me some information on Baba's plans, which is besleally
supposition, and fished some other marginal information which is being fór-
warded, although in my cition edeneb can be placed in anything he says.
It is hard to evaluate hub urbell's motives are in connection wish his deste
to furnish information regarding Dubina to us, but it appeared that he was also
attempting to fish for information, throwing out a number of mentions concerning
the Hilton Terrace Hotel, reportedly aegenbly to have been purchased by Culian
Interests with 9 million Cuban pesos. The house reportedly has been completely
redecorated, with heavy steel doors guarding the entrance. Mis panthe suite
has been rumored to be fatista's intended headquarters once he arrives in the US.
AL of this has been written about in the gossip colums of the l papers.

6. Inasmuch as Wardell my name and phone number, probably little con
be done to prevent him getting in touch with me from time to time, but contach
will not be initiated by me except by direction. The basic purpose of this memo
is for the record.

US national, soldier of fortune type with wide experience in Latin

This report was developed by a Navy representative assigned to the
office of preparation.
1. As of 22 Nov 66 in spite of widespread press reports, no invasion
of Haiti has taken place.
2. Rolando Masferrer Rojas who is sponsoring the alleged invasion, has
been telling Cuban exiles that his group has secured the airport at
Port-de-Paix and they should be prepared to leave at any time
3. Masferrer has given up the idea of moving his group, which consists
of approximately 300 Cubane and 100 Haitians, by boat and is trying
to make arrangements for chartering eleven aircraft, including some
DC-3's. One of the DC-3's would carry Colonel Rene Leon, Masferrer,
and Father Jean Fatiste Georges.
4. The M/V Hudson in to be used to carry part of the weapons. The
Masferrer group is well armed and has plenty of weapons. They have
three tons of C-3 dynamite, and also have some C-2 and C-4.
5. The Henrietta II will carry photographers.
6. In spite of the above I believe that the "invasion" is a farce and
is falling apart. Masferrer is merely trying to cover up for the
;
funds he has received for the invasion. It is believed that Masferrer's
life will be in danger if he does not make some ostensible effort.

During the night of 22 Nov 66 a decision was reached to call off the proposed
invasion of Haiti by the group sponsored by Rolando Manferrer. The invasion
is off indefinitely.
Father Jean Baptiste Georges and Colonel Rene Leon have been arguing with
Maoferror which has caused confusion and disorganization in the movement.
Many Cubano scheduled to participato have pulled out and military chier
Napoleon Villaboise (sic), a Cuban national and alleged military expert,
has resigned because of dissension in the group.
It is believed that US Government agencies have infiltrated the movement
and the leaders fear that all weapons and equipment would be confiscated

On 28 a Cuban oxile, and he told
Cot 66 I spoke with Rolando Masferrer Rojao;
me that he has organized a military force of approximately 250 men to invade
Haiti The invasion force consists of Cuban and Baitian exiles rosiding in
the US, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. The invasion will probably
be launched from the Dominican Republic sometime between 5 and 13 November
and the target is Port-au-Prince. The invasion force will strike in the
early hours of the morning selected. It to well armed, and will have air
cover; the presidential palace will be bombed.

Masferrer stated that Eugene L. Maximilien, Baitian Consul in Miami, Florida,

Maximilien is presently in Haiti informing President Duvalier that the invasion
can be prevented by paying off $200,000 to Masferrer. Maximilien will return
to the US on 3 November and he has agreed with Masfarrer that if Duvalter
agrass to the pay-off, Maximilion vill receive $50,000 and Masferrer $150,000.
Masforrer told me that the invasion will take place in any event and the
$150,000, if received, would be used to further support the invasion..
Masferrer stated that he met within the past 10 days with several dissident
Haitian army officers and he had received their support. The Haitian army
officers told Masferrer that they would revolt as soon as informed that the
invasion had comenced. They do not know that the target will be Port-au-
Prince; they believe that it will be in the cap Haition area.
Masferrer stated that he was confident that the invasion vill succeed, and if
successful, Pather Joan Raptiste Georges would be appointed provisional
president. Masferrer stated that Colonel Rone Leon, Haitian exile, will
participate in the invasion.

Dear Mr. Greaney:
It was a pleasure to meet with you and Clyde Carter
last Monday.
As I explained to you at that time, we are engaged
in an investigation with state and federal law enforcement
agencies concerning importation and distribution of mari-
juana and cocaine. During the course of this investigation,
allegations (unfounded, I am sure) have been made that
certain of the subjects of this investigation are employees
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
I believe it is necessary to resolve as much in
advance of an indictment any problems which may arise
should any of the subjects of the investigation be involved
with the Central Intelligence Agency.
The following individuals are among the subjects
of this investigations

cecurity clearance on grounds of Werbell's "frivolous behavior" in the Haitian

regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on Haiti which is being sponsored by
Rolando Masferrer, even though Masferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal
prison. He told Werbell that if he wished to pass any information along we
would accept it bat under no circunstances should he attempt to elicit any

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG.
SUBJECT
Chief, DCD
OGC 76-0844.
24 February 1976
Chief, LA Division
Mitchell Livingston Werbel III
1. I was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March
in Miami, Florida. The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial,
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA
General Counsel as a defense witness.
2. The Justice Department has received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all-
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruċ-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.
3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in
Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975, Bayard, reportedly an
associate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business
2 March.

REFERENCE.
OCC 76-0344 dated 24 February 1976.
1.
A review of DCD recordo indicates that Mitchell L. Werbell III
was an occasional contact and source of this Division from 24 July 1959
when he first initiated the contact, until March 1971. It appears from
our records that all of the contacts were at Werball's volition and
that at no time was he viewed as a particularly manful or reliable source.
Werbell did provide insolicited information which was reported by BCD In
Beven foreign intelligence information reports. Tu January 1976 DCD
responded to a Freedom of Information inquiry from Werbell. Copies of
the documents released to him are available from the DDO/PIC.
2.
After meeting with Werbell at his own request in July 1959 the
Chief of the Miami Field Office noted in orandum for the Record
that little credence could be placed in anything werball said. birting
succeeding contacts Warbell provided information which resulted in the
following reportst

Four of these reports received advance tolotype

1. On 15 May 1969, Special Agent Dave Ploumen, local OSI representative,

clearance check as the result of presently being employed by a company
with a government contract.
2. Werbell was an unsolicited contact of this office beginning in
1959 and he reached peck notoriety In November 1967 as a result of his
Involvement in the Rolando Masferrer trial in connection with the abortive
Haitian Invasion. John Greaney, OSG was in and at the time to oversee
Agency interests.
3.
Ploumen in contacting other. US Government
Government agencies locally
including the US Attorney's Office somehow, received an indication that CIA
had information on Werbell; thus Ploumen's via to the Man Field office.
4. It was indicated to Ploumen, who is known personally several
members of this staff, that we knew of Werbell and that on occasion he
had reported unsolicited information. It was suggested, however, that
Ploumen direct his request officially through channels via OSI' ngebay
liaison officer in Washington.
5. This is for background and is being forwarded at the

10 March 1971
On 9 kar 71 we received a long distance call, presumably from Fówder
Springs, Georgia, from subject, who is an old and unsavory contact of this
office dating from 1959. Werbell has been involved in a variety of
the Latest of which concerned an abortive invasion of Haiti which John Cresny
was very such concerned about a year or so ago
S
2. Werbell stated that the Department of Defense had just revokud hla
security clearance on grounds of herbell's "frivolous behavior" in the Shitian
caper
Werbell stated that he intended to "fit it to the Suprece Cert
he hind always kept us and other elements of the US Government informed con
cerning developments in the Haition matter.
3. Werbell asked if there was anything that we could do for him in tha
way of interceding for him with the DOD, and we intoned him bluntly am in
no uncertain terus that he was strictly on his can, and we could do nothing
for him. He then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Eart Condales
We informed him that it was up to his attorney to make such recommendations.
"
4. Werbell seemed to get the message, and then offered to keep us advised
regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on laiti hich is being sponsored
Rolando Masferrer, even though Masferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal
Crison. We told herbell that if he wished to pass any information along we
would accept it but under no circumstances should he attest to elicit any
Information on our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this tasis and
Guld he might be in touch with us again.
5.
.
In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact should
be a matter of record and that OCC should be informed of developments.

Dear Sir:
Reference is made to your letter of December 18th,
1975 concerning our client, Mitchell Livingston
WorBell, III and his request for information under
the Freedom of Information Act.
I am enclosing a notarized statement providing you
with the address and place of birth of Mr. WerBell.
With regard to your last paragraph asking for clari-
fication as to which records he desires to have
searched, we, of course, are not familiar with your.
files or filing system. Mr. WerBell spent sometime
in the United States Army during World War II and
has traveled extensively since that time. He was in
Cuba at the time of the Castro military operation,
in the Dominican Republic during that military opera-
tion and in Thailand and Viet Nam during the Viet Nam
War. We feel quite confident your office must have
extensive files and documentation concerning Mr. Wer-
Bell and this request for information is intended to

records reflect no direct contact with the sons.
The
only mention of the sons appears in an article published
in The Washington Post, 27 December 1970, Section D, page 3
and a cable to FR/NY, 17 March 1975 (Director 670514).

Chief, Mieni Field Office
Hemorandum of Visit to Mitchell Warball: In
2211 Eerovia Circle
Coral Gables, Florida
87 MAY 1959.
1. Di the evening of 24 July 1959 I received a telephone call from subjeợt,
shio had been given my name and address by smother semmost of the intelli(race
omamity in connection with the possibility of his passing along Late information
concerning the rumored impending flight of Butista to the US.
F
2. Wartell indicated that he spent a great amount of his time in the
Drzinican Republic and had extremely close association with lenders of the governe.
ment, and alco with Camera Jose Pedraza. He claimed to have been a former arber
of the 033 with service in China in WWII. Varball is a soldier-of-fortune type
who wears a smocle, drives a Marcodes-Doms, sports a most attractive blonde gir
friend, and is a Big Spender. He also volunteered that he has a wife and air
children living in Ceorgia.
3. Urbell told me that his principle source of incoms in in dealing with
Cuban peros, and said that he is unsociated in the inainess with a form Lipte of
Los Angeles, a jazz musician who formerly played with the Jimy Dorexy and Jan
Garber banda.
4. Elpro also claim to have bown a member of 003 during WWII, serving in
the Rusonian and Enstern Europen area. Wipro sas busily expand in making long
& Latance phone calls to Mexico City, Guatemala City, and Los Angeles during a
part of the time I was with the group,
5. Varbell cgave me noise information ms Batista's plans, which is basically
supposition, and furnished some other marginal information which is being for-
warded, although in my opinion little credence can be placed in anything he says.
It is hard to evaluate what Wardall's motims are in connection with his desire
to furnish information regarding Intista to us, but it appeared that he was also
attempting to fish for information, throwing out a number of questions concering:
the Biltmore Terrace Hotel, reportedly recently to have been purchased by Cuban
interests with 9 million Cuban pesos. The penthouse reportedly has been completely
redecorated, with heavy steel doors guarding the entrance. This penthouse suite
has been rumored to be Batista's intended hoadquarters once he arrives in the US.
All of this has been written about in the gossip columns of the local papers,
6. Deasmuch as Warbell has my name and phone number, probably little can
be done to prevent him getting in touch with me from time to time, hart contact
will not be initiated by no exosyl by direction. The tanie purpose of this RO
is for the record.

TELL ROSE CONVERSATION BETWEEN PETERSON AND VAN CLEAVE
-
Tuesday, 6/18/7-,
1 had heard a rumor that,
rumor that, I thought, at the time that these guys, these di
can't be doing this again, but in the last week I have picked up a great deal c
information that I think needs to be known at this location that involves the
Worbell group out of Powder Springs. Are you familiar with that name? [So. I'a
not. 2111 has been handling all of that and I just don't know anything about it,
Mr. Van Cleave. You can give me what information you have and I will pass it on
or do what we can, but Bill has been handling that entirely and we work different
accounts and I'm sorry to say that I am totally unfamiliar with it.] Well, let ze
put it to you this way. Is there any way at all that you will be in touch with
Bill, so that I could get this information to him by phone. (Well, he is up in.
Tennessee and we can get in touch with him, yes. I could give him a call.] Well
'
let me give you a brief synopsis so that you can at least pass that on to him.
And in the process, I'll have to give you a bit of background on this subject. :
i
consider it very important, not from the standpoint of the fact that what these
people are involved in now is starting to break, but 1 think it is extremely
important that this location gets something in to indicate that their contact lets
them know what is going on. Mitchell Worbal is a gun dealer basically. He has
What is called a farm out at Powder Springs, Georgia. Basically, it is a plece
of property with a lake and a firing range and a big house and a gun shop beloy
and a vault with about three thousand Ingram submachine guns and other assorted
weapons. You Werbell has been in and out of all kinds of things. He pops up all
over. He loves publicity and he loves to imply a relationship with the Agency.
Now, about a year ago they were involved with some people from Britain in an
attempt to set up a secession of the Island of Abaco, at the time the Bahamas ware
granted their Independence. Now this was a very serious thing; there were people
including members of Parliment from London that came over here and they were going
to have a small army on Abaco and the local settlers on Abaco were all for this
because they were mostly wille and the thing never got off the ground at that tire.
However, it was known, there were newspapers articles written about it. Tynier
reading, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas was incensed by this whole schere
hanically. if you could think of anything that would be against the best interes:

showing you is that I think stuff is coming into Washington right fast:

lot of old friends who are OSS Lypes in those days and I understand one of these
old boys did have dinner with Colby and Werbell wangled his way into it a couple
of months ago in Washington, So, that is all he needs to start dropping names
like mad. He does know some people in and former people. Now I understand that

suddenly grown bigger. And to be more specific about thin, when I say that, I
can tell you that it is a fact that last Thursday night the new Ambassador from
the Bahamas in Washington got Congressman Andrew Young to one side at a reception
and they discussed this matter with grave seriousness. OK, now, therefore I am
positive that within certain circles in Washington this matter is being discussed
at this moment. Now I also learned that last week the whole group of the Werbells
and their associates were in Washington and 1'11 give you the names that I know of
for sure: Mike Oliver, who is a key figure in this. He represents several wealthy
Americans and Britishers who have long had a dream of having their own island and
establishing their own country. Now this sounds like something right out of cheap
fiction; however, it is a fact.
wealthy individuals, one of whom I think lives in the Bahamas, I believe two are

thing came up once before about eight years ago when they bought a boat and Oliver
went out into the Pacific and laid claim to the coral reef in the Samoan Islands I
think it was and planted a flag on it and established the free soverign state of

until the King of Samoa, or somebody, some Tribal King sent. [end of side of tape]

and I know they have money, To make a long story short, Oliver is involved in
this. He came in, I understand, two weeks after the Bahamas got their independence
and said we've got the money for the Abaco operation, Now I have it on good
source from an informant in their organization that a south or so ago a U-Haul truck

world and talk about their schemes and it has broken somewhere, you know, along

of the conversation was between the Ambassador and Young?] I think it expressed
grave concern about this situation. I think some names were given of the people.
You see they know who Werbell is because Pendling, in fact, one time made a
tough speech about this type of thing with the American intervention in the affairs
of the Bahamas and the name Werbell is an international soldier of fortune.

Subject was of interest to this Agency in 1959 and was granted a
POA in August of that your. This was cancelled in October 1959 when
his information proved to be of little value and because it was
suspected he was using Agency funds to promote his personal interests.
He has subsequently attempted to pass himself off as an Agency
employee.
He is characterized by the filo as unscrupulous, a
'whosler-dealer" and a promoter of grandiose schemes.

10 March 1971
On 9 Mar 71 we received a long distance call, presumably from Powder
Springs, Georgia, from subject, who is an old and unsavory contact of this
office dating from 1959. Werbell has been involved in a variety of scrapes
the latest of which concerned an abortive invasion of Haiti which John Greany:
was very much concerned about a year or so ago.
33
2. Werbell stated that the Department of Defense had just revoked his
security clearance on grounds of Werbell's "frivolous behavior" in the Haitian
caper. Werbell stated that he intended to "fight it to the Supreme Court"
he had always kept us and other elements of the US Government informed con-
cerning developments in the laitian matter.
9. Werbell asked if there was anything that we could do for his in the
way of interceding for him with the DOO, and we
and we informed him bluntly and in
no uncertain terms that he was strictly on his own, and we could do nothing
for him. He then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Bart Gonzales
We informed him that it was up to his attorney to make such recommendations.
v
Werbell seemed to get the seasage, and then offered to keep us advised
regarding an alleged forthcoming attempt on Haiti which is being sponsored by
Rolando Masferrer, even though Masferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal
prison. We told Werbell that if he wished to pass any information along we
would accept it but under no circumstances should he attempt to elicit any
information on our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this basia and
said he might be in touch with us again.
5.
In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact should
be a matter of record and that 000 should be informed of developments.

dedicated to killing people. Environ

bankrolled by some of the East's most
prominent investment houses; he is its
director of international operations.
He is also president of a subsidiary
called Military Armaments Co., Inc.,

image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this. Werßell™ has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has
been around them so long that the
ideas and styles they foster are an in

He comes by both his militarism and
his anticommunism honestly. His
father was an officer in the Russian
Imperial army, even though he was
born in the United States. "It was a
