(Hall) how was the cooperation of the DOD intelligence
agencies including NSA / how much had they withheld ? -
Tilly said he found them cooperative but that the release
was small. Did not know off hand how much was withheld.
Hall considered so few record as "suspect" and ask if NARA
had followed up. Tilly said no. NARA did not have the
authority to question the agencies about their searches. He
indicated that the Army among others had not responded to
NARA's initial request. (During the public comments part of
the meeting Newman and Lesar returned to the question of DOD
compliance.)
Several members of the Board had questions about the
Presidential Libraries; Tilly described his role and the
process.
When Jack open the meeting for public comments, Newman
returned to the question about DOD releases. He clamied
that NSA had release only one true document and that most of
the DIA files was administrative or news clipping. He said
he had seen at least 30 DOD documents in CIA and FBI files
that did not appear in the DIA release.
Newman then ask if the agencies could withhold documents
from the Board; Jack responded that under the law thar only
Board had the power to withold a document.
Lesar ask if the Board had given consideration to. his letter
concerning the definition of an assassination record. Jack
thanked him for the letters but the Board would not be able
to address the issues Lesar raised until they had a staff to
do the research.
A third "expert" named Mark Zaid ask a question about Post
Office files that had been released before and how they
compared with recent Post Office files found by NARA. Anna
responded that such questions require a staff.

This is to confirm our discussion in which we agreed to meet on Wednesday,
September 28, 1994 at 10:00 a.m. in your offices to discuss the agency's review of
records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. I expect all of the Board
members, Kermit Hall, Henry Graff, Anna Nelson, and William Joyce to join me, as well
as the Board's Executive Director, David Marwell. As I indicated, Mr. Marwell now has
a "temporary top secret" security classification. I expect to fax to you on Monday a list
of the questions that the Board would like to review with you and your staff, questions
along the lines we discussed on Wednesday.
We look forward to meeting with you and beginning our understanding of the issues
and the process that the CIA is following with respect to the records that fall within the
Review Board's jurisdiction. Thank you very much.

Plans to begin public hearing on defining an assassination
record in Sept. Anna Nelson commented on the importance of
identifying what is a record before beginning to address
specific issues/documents.
William Joyce reported that he had sent letters to 55
agencies asking about the quaintly of records still held by
the agency and had received 20 responses several which had
identified additional sources for documents (no specifics)
Steve Tilley gave a briefing on status of releases.
Releases since last meeting include tapes of telephone calls
from the Johnson Library, the FBI files, Church Committee (7
boxes), and DOJ's FOIA litigation files. This month an
additional 10 boxes of Church Committee and some Pike
Committee Files (only a small part deals with JFK). Expects
a release from the CIA of approximately 70,000 pages later
this summer (mentioned the 73 Reels).
Tilley also described the 20,000 pages of HSCA material in
CIA files and that NARA would be acting as House agent on
these record.
Questions (to Tilly) by the Board:
Size of the NARA collection?
per foot)
->
1200 Cubic Feet (2500 pages
-
(Jack) what was the number of documents with redactions?
Steve said he could not give a figure, would guess less than
50%
-->
(Graff) any problems with agencies' willingness to release
documents None, considers the work be the various
agencies as a remarkable effort to turn over records. The
problem was the volume of material and the time it takes to
review.
A question about Senate and House Committee reviews
procedures led to a discussion where it was clear that
neither the Board nor Tilly had a good fix on that part of
the review. The point was made that CIA information in
those documents (and in our HSCA material) would be reviewed
by CIA reviewers; the originator of the information was the
key reviewer).
(Jack) how were the agencies doing in defining
"assassination records? -- Tilly described some of his
discussions about assassination records within NARA and with
other agencies. He mentioned that the "major agencies" had
records that they felt fell outside the scope which they
planned to discuss with the board.

NOTE FOR THE FILE
SUBJECT:
Briefing of JFK Board Staff: Cover
1. On 1 December, Barry Gibson, Deputy Chief of the
Office of Central Cover, briefed the Executive Director of
the Assassinations Records Review Board and other Board
staff members. Also participating from CIA were John Goins
and Eleanor Neiman of IMS; Linda Cipriani, OGC; and Barry
Harrelson and I from HRG.
2. The focus of the briefing was on the need to protect
the names of former Agency employees that appeared in the
JFK records. Gibson discussed the risks involved for people
who retired under cover if they were identified in the
public record as former CIA employees. He discussed the
efforts made by his office to obtain written statements from
the more than 100 individuals whose names appear.
3.
The purpose of the briefing was to assist the Board
in its review of names when it meets on 12-13 December. The
Agency was asked in particular to present, in writing,
evidence of risk for each of the names that will be
discussed at the Board's meeting.

Office of Legislative Counsel.
SUBJECT
: HSCA Records
}
1. During the course of the HSCA investigations, much classified
information was assembled in response to HSCA requests. Three categories
of information must now be disposed of under terms of the HSCA/DCI
Memorandum of Understanding.
Category la: Classified material from Agency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, which HSCA staff
members reviewed.
Category 1b: Classified material from Agency
holdings, requested by the HSCA, but which HSCA
staff members did not review.
Category 2: Material generated by the HSCA from
Agency classified holdings made available to the
HSCA in response to the latter's request. (Note:
This HSCA material is considered by the HSCA as its
property and, therefore, not releasable to the
public under the Freedom of Information Act. An
inventory of this material received from HSCA has
been completed.)
Category 3: Classified correspondence and certain
unclassified correspondence exchanged between this
Agency and the NSCA.
2. The HSCA has indicated its desire that copies of these three
categories of material be held in sealed and segregated storage to
ensure the preservation of all relevant records pertaining to the
phase of the investigation involving this Agency. In order to accom-
modate the HSCA, but also leave our own records accessible for routine
purposes, a photographic copy should be made of each official Agency
document made available in response to a specific request by the HSCA
(Category la and lb).

and pertinent supporting documentation. The bulk of the
collection consists of CLA files reviewed by the Committee
and is primarily in the form of 16mm roll film produced,
stored, and inspected in accordance with Federal standards
for archival microfilm. The microfilming was done in
those instances when it was necessary to return the paper
Files to their original locations. (Each paper file
microfilmed will be maintained or disposed of in accor-
dance with approved records control schedules covering
the record series of which the file is a part.)

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
19 August 1977
1
2.5
I. Preparation of Materials
A. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will cooperate fully
in the investigations conducted by the Select Committee on Assassinations
(Committee) by providing access, as requested, to classified information
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and held by the CIA, that bears
upon the study and investigation authorized by H. Res. 222. CIA will
notify the Committee of any requested information held by CLA not
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and notify the Committee of the
proper authority to contact to obtain the information. No document or a
portion of the document in the possession of CIA will be withheld without
written notice of that action to the Committee. Access to all classified
information designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and currently held by any federal
agency or department shall be governed by this memorandum.
B. Documentary material will be made available as expeditiously
and completely as feasible, subject to the responsibility of the DCI to
protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The Committee and
CLA will periodically agree upon a list of identities that will not be excised
from materials turned over to the Committee. Subject to the list of
identities that will not be deleted, CIA will appropriately sanitize, including
excising if necessary, information to assure protection of information
identifying sensitive sources and methods. When an excision is made,
CLA will indicate the nature of the source or method excised, including the
functional intelligence discipline which was the source of the intelligence.
C. The Chief Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations
and a designated representative of the DCI shall meet monthly to discuss
a random sample of the complete and unsanitized materials selected by
the Chief Counsel for the purpose of verifying the appropriateness of the
sanitizing done by the CIA. Those matters on which they do not agree
shall be referred to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and the
DCI for resolution.

CIA's HSCA JFK SEQUESTERED RECORDS I
BOXES 1-63 HARDCOPY MATERIAL
The 63 boxes contain copies of material collected or
prepared in response to over a thousand individual requests
from HSCA. Boxes are grouped by responsible component. With
the exception of the security files, there is no general
subject grouping or order to the boxes. Individual boxes
usually contain a mix of topics and types of documents, and
there is much duplication through out the collection.
Boxes 1-34 (Directorate of Operations): contains a mix of
CIA, third agency (primarily FBI) and Warren Commission
documents plus a significant amount of HSCA originated
material*. These records cover a wide range of topics
but focus on anti-Cuba/Castro activities and Oswald
in USSR, Mexico City and New Orleans. Also included are
responses to the large number of names traces
requested by the HSCA staff, numerous copies of
documents from the Oswald 201, the 1967 IG report,
testimony of Richard Helms before HSCA, Nosenko
material, CIA cable traffic.
Boxes 35-36 (Inspector General): HSCA reports, Senate
Select Committee reports, reports on Cuban
operations, Book V of Church Committee final report.
Boxes 37-38 (Office of the General Counsel): Cuban exile
activities, Garrison investigation, name files.
BOX - 39
(Directorate of Science & Technology): Photo
comparisons of Hunt, Sturgis and the Dallas tramps;
chart of frames from Zapruder film.
Boxes 40-48 (Office of Security): name files.
Boxes 49-63 (Office of Legislative Liaison):
HSCA
requests, notes, memos, correspondence and final
report, plots against Castro, photos of unknown man,
defector study, Nosenko, name files, Mexico City
station files, FBI reports, Warren Commission reports.
:
approximately 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material has
been removed from the files and transferred to the National
Archives.

Release this fall of many records related to Cuba
I am pleased to say -- and I offer this as my personal opinion -- that I have
seen no example where the Board has postponed any information that
bears directly on the assassination. I believe that the story is coming out
with the records that are being released.
Issue immediately before us is the CIA's sequestered collection.
Mr. Pereira has described it from the perspective of the agency.
The Review Board staff has been reviewing the record and has given the
Board its own assessment of the status of the records.

C.
D. In making any excisions or other alterations of requested
materials, CIA shall be bound by 18 U.S. C. Subsection 1505 and all
other applicable statutes.
II. Request Procedure
A. The CIA element responsible for dealing with the Committee
is the Coordination and Review Staff of the Office of Legislative Counsel
(C&RS/OLC). All Committee requests for information will be conveyed
to CIA only via the Coordination and Review Staff. Absent extraordinary
circumstances, appointments with CIA employees and former employees
will be arranged through the Coordination and Review Staff.
B. All Committee requests for information will be in writing..
In the interest of timely response, C&RS/OLC will accept preliminary
telephone or other oral requests, but no information can be made
'available until a request is received in writing from the Chief
Counsel or one of the Deputy Chief Counsels.
III. Staff Clearance
Prior to access by Committee personnel to any material which
has been designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
DCI, such Committee personnel will be granted security clearance
by the Committee after consultation with the CIA. Committee personnel
requiring access to such material will be required to execute, in advance,
the attached Select Committee on Assassinations Nondisclosure Agreement.
IV. Transcripts of Statements Under Oath
A steno-typist from either the Committee or the CIA will make a
verbatim record of all statements of current CIA personnel taken under
oath. One copy of the record will be made available to the Committee
and the other to the CIA in accordance with the Rules of the Committee.
V.. Examination of Material
Materials to which access has been granted by CIA will be reviewed
in a CIA reading room set aside for this purpose or in a designated area
within the Committee's offices.
VI. Storage of Materials
A. Committee procedures for control and storage of any documents
or materials provided by the CIA which require protection will follow
security standards and procedures established in consultation with, and
approved by, the CIA.

B. Upon the termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CLA and examined by the Committee will be kept and
preserved within a segregated and secure area within CLA for
at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time. All persons having access to such
materials must sign an access sheet indicating the date, the name of the
person receiving access, the specific documents or materials to which
access was granted, and the person who authorized the access.
VII. Disclosure of Information
A. The Committee will notify the DCI in writing of its desire to
disclose, in any manner, including under the Select Committee on
Assassinations Nondisclosure Agreement, any information that is
designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the DCI.
If within five days the Committee does not receive a letter from the
DCI objecting to the proposed disclosure and stating the reasons for the
objection, the Committee may disclose the information.
B. If the DCI notifies the Committee within five days that he objects
to the proposed disclosure and states the reasons for his objections,
the Chairman of the Committee and the DCI, or their designated
representatives, shall meet to attempt to resolve any differences over the
information to be disclosed. If the Chairman of the Committee considers
that the negotiations have reached an impasse, he will give the DCI a
written notice to that effect, and the Committee will take no steps until
at least 14 days thereafter to disclose the information in dispute.
· C. Any differences left unresolved by negotiation may become the
subject of litigation. In any such action each party with be free to assert
1. all its constitutional, statutory, or other legal rights, and the parties
agree to be bound by the final outcome of any such action. If such an
action is commenced by the Executive Branch but is disposed of without
a judicial decision on the merits of the disclosure issue, the Committee
agrees that it will not on that basis, or on the basis of its 14-day notice
letter, disclose the information in dispute. This Agreement, however,
is without prejudice to any of the Committee's other rights, privileges
and responsibilities concerning the production by legal compulsion and
disclosure of information, and the DCI's rights, privileges and responsi-
bilities concerning the protection from disclosure of the information.

III.
These types of records need to be reviewed on the same word-to-word basis as
the board has reviewed records thus far.
But we have a new problem: how should the Board review records from the
sequestered collections where the relevance to the assassination is not clear.
Examples where the staff has difficulty finding a nexus to the
assassination in certain records.
I will offer a few examples to provide you with a flavor of some of the issues we
are confronting. The examples below are hypothetical and are loosely based
upon our review of the files in order to illustrate the issues.
A. The “false hit” category
The HSCA requested files from CIA on a great number of persons. In many
instances the agency did not know why the files were requested, and accordingly
it made available files that it had on the name that had been requested.
Because names are not always unique, the agency sometimes made available
files on individuals who were of no interest to the HSCA and who had no
identifiable relation to the assassination.
1.
A very common name - I will use as an example the name Robert Smith.
The HSCA requested Robert Smith files because of an alleged
connection between a “Robert Smith" and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.
The Smith whose file was made available, however, was a CIA officer who
died in 1956. The ARRB staff has reviewed the file and has discovered
no relevance to the assassination.
B. CIA operational files or 201 files.
2.
3.
4.
Cuban now living in the United States. CIA unsuccessfully attempted to
recruit her to collect information on Cuba through her family and friends,
but ultimately abandoned the effort. Neither she nor any of her hoped for
contacts had any identifiable connection to the Oswald story or to the JFK
assassination.
Cuban cultivated for operational work against Castro in whom CIA lost
--- interest when he was not able to meet operation standards.
Soviet official at the Mexico City embassy during Oswald's visit, although
he never had any personal contact with him. The Mexico City portion of
his file ha been reviewed and released in part to NARA. The remainder of

--- Image 104-10333-10008_page_4.jpeg ---
4-00000
CIA JFK Collections
1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release)
1)
JFK hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release)
2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review)
The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff
either requested or had access to. A great deal of the
material is duplicative of that found in the 63 hard copy
boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are
also files not related to the assassination story and files
not reviewed by the HSCA.
HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page)
with the exception of the Oswald 201 file. The Microfilm
collection has been divided into to two parts:
1)
documents reviewed for release and being prepare
for NARA (records related to the assassination, the
investigations, or the various conspiracy theories),
2) documents reviewed but being held pending
discussion with the board (see attachment).

his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA
monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part
of his file - has no bearing on Oswald or the JFK assassination.
C. CIA officials
There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical
records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not
contain any operational details.
5.
CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the
case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, and a
polygraph, none of which has any identifiable bearing on the Oswald story
of the JFK assassination.
As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is
a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged
connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads.
Not all leads are successful.
6.
A CIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of
the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam.
There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the
assassination.
7. CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to
Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer
was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the world. With
the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no
other documents that illuminate the assassination.
D. Summary of problems
First, establishing criteria for relevance
Second, handling different types of records
ex. 1: entire file has no identifiable relevance
ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not
ex. 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not
:

--- Image 104-10333-10008_page_42.jpeg ---
14-00000
-6-
"
(DRE, Alpha 66, etc.), Minutemen, etc.
Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a
memorandum identifying the file, describing the review process, and
explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will
then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the
public.
Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records
will be subjected to the word by word review. Records for which the staff
has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to
describe generally the type of records and explain the basis for finding no
relevance.
Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will
review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records
in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If
such records are identified, they will be subjected to the same word by
word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not
be reviewed again.
Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a document that genuinely have no
identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent
with the 1400.5.
I recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it
wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.

TESTIMONY BEFORE JFK BOARD, 6 AUGUST 1996
INTRODUCTION
Introduce CIA participants
We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination
Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling
its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act. CIA is committed to full
cooperation with the Board.
Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection
directly, I would like to provide some background to help put
the sequestered collection into some sort of context.
In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Act, then Director of Central
Intelligence, Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing
for declassification all records related to the assassination.
The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the
relevant records. Once this was done, the Historical Review
Group took custody of these records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to the National
Archives.
Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our
goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the
22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately
125,000 pages were transferred to the National Archives by that
date.
* With subsequent releases, CIA has now declassified and
transferred some 227,000 pages of material to the National
Archives. Based on discussions with the Board, we are
continuing to release additional information that had been
redacted earlier.
The remaining records are in various stages of review.
Some require review by other agencies. Some is congressional
material. Final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the Review Board.

IV.
Selected Statutory Provisions in The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V
1994)
Definition of Assassination Record
"Assassination record' means a record that is related to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of [the HSCA]."
Sect. 3(2).
Interpretation 1: All records in segregated collection are assassination records.
Argument: the segregated collection are "assassination records" because
a government agency examined them in the course of their investigation
of the assassination.
Interpretation 2: Only segregated collection records that actually relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy come within the scope of the JFK Act.
Argument: In order for a record to be an “assassination record" it must:
(a) relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, and (b) have been
used by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of a
government agency.
Selected CFR Provisions:
"All records collected by or segregated by all Federal, state, and local
government agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of
or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy....” 36 CFR
1400.1(b)(2)
"An assassination record shall be released in its entirety except for
portions specifically postponed pursuant to the grounds for postponement
of public disclosure of records established in . . . the JFK Act, and no
portion of any assassination record shall be withheld from public
disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance unless, in the Review
Board's sole discretion, release of part of a record is sufficient to comply
with the intent and purposes of the JFK Act." 36 CFR 1400.5. –

THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS
In identifying relevant records, we have followed the
definitions in the 1992 Act and the related rules which were
published in the Federal Register.
The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two
major groups of files. One group consists of the documents in
the Lee Harvey Oswald file--sometimes referred to as the "Oswald
201 file". These consist mainly of documents collected after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation.
There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald
file. All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the
National Archives.
The second group is comprised of the "sequestered
collection". These are the records that were made available to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the
Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion
of the Committee's investigation.
Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts from
minutes of the Director's morning meetings, and some working
files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.

Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board
A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination:
Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining
relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed.
The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant
documents would include:
--
-O
- documents that obviously are related to assassination
CIA internal investigations
Oswald records
Garrison investigation
Castro assassination attempts
documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on
issue under consideration
dates associated with Oswald
dates immediately around assassination
dates of Warren Commission
dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations
-- individuals of importance
CIA officials in Mexico City
David Atlee Phillips
Win Scott
CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation
John Scelso
JJ Angleton
-- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico)
B. Handling of records in sequestered collection
First, ARRB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection.
Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to
word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over
time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria for identifying
relevance. The focus will be on individuals and groups that have been
identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination.
Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the
greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips,
Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups

SEQUESTERED COLLECTION
First of all, every document in the sequestered
✓ Frection is available to the Board for review. The
documents are available in full, without redactions.
The record shows that the sequestered collection
consists of documents compiled in connection with the
investigation of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA).
A portion of the documents were created specifically in
response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were
already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee.
Still other documents were created by the Committee itself.
For example, notes of interviews conducted by the
Committee's staff.
Within the sequestered collection there are two major
categories of records. One category consists of
approximately 129,000 pages of hard copy. The second
category consists of 72 reels of microfilm, or the
equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy.
The reason why the documents were sequestered is
explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
Chairman Louis Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner
in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows:
“Upon termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept
and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA
for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of
Representatives agree to a shorter period of time.”
In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff
Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete
the process of designating what materials were to be
sequestered. All the documents made available to the
Committee were included in the sequestered collection.

REVIEW AND DECLASSIFICATION OF THE SEQUESTERED FILES
In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley
requesting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the
records. In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter
to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The
Speaker's decision was made in anticipation of passage of
the Assassination Records Collection Act.
THE HARDCOPY MATERIAL
The hardcopy part of the sequestered collection
includes copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald
201 file. Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and
security files on persons who are mentioned in documents
relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the
conspiracy theories.
The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of
documents, memos, and notes (many handwritten) that were
created by the Committee staff during their investigation.

J. Barry Harrelson
CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer
Records Briefing for ARRB Staff
ARRB letter to DCI, dtd. 27 November, 1997, RE CIA Compliance
with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act.
1. The JFK Board (ARRB) staff has requested briefings by records "specialists" on the
Agency's records systems as part of the compliance with the JFK Act process (see reference). The
first DO briefing took place on 12 February. The DA briefing and a follow-up DO briefing is planned for
early March. I would like to set up the remaining briefings as soon as possible.
2. The ARRB staffers are very familiar with agency documents and have had several general
briefings on Agency records; one member of the staff is a former Agency employee (CTC). These
"compliance" briefings should focus on what files would have existed in the 1958-63 time period and
how we search, or account for, those records today. The ARRB requests you have been working on
give you some sense of the type of information they are interested in. In addition I am faxing a copy of
the "talking points" prepared for the DO briefing. I have also ask Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General Counsel,
to provide a list of directorate specific topics.
3. The briefing can take place at HQ or at IP. The ARRB attendees will include Mr. Gunn and 4
or 5 members of the Board's CIA team; all are fully cleared (SCI). I have asked Mr. Gunn to provide a
list of dates when he and his staff would be available.* I will forward the list to you as soon as I receive
it. Thank you for your assistance in setting up these briefings. If you have any questions, please give
me a call on extension 31825.

Most of these documents fall into
Individual 201 files : These files cover the entire
period of agency interest or contact with a person. For
individuals who are not "key figures" in the JFK story,
those sections of the file that are outside relevant time
frames or can not be linked to Oswald, the assassination,
the various investigations, or any of the conspiracy
theories have been treated as non-related.
Project/Operational Files: Many of these cover the
complete life of a project. Sections of these file deals
with operations which have no connection with the
assassination or fall in only part of a relevant time frame.
For example there are over 3000 pages on the Mexico City
Photo operation covering the 1960's and 1970's.
related material is that falling in the time frame of
Oswald's visit to Mexico City and the investigation
following the assassination.
The only
The anti-Castro
-
Cuban Exile Groups/Operations:
activities of the Cuban exiles in the US during 1960 1963
are considered relevant to the assassination. However, some
of the organizations and individuals members continued to
run operations against Castro into the 1970's. The exile
activities after the assassination are generally not
considered related unless they involve plots to assassinate
Castro, the continuation of pre-assassination projects or
the Garrison Investigation.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
FROM:
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
Lee Strickland @ DA
DA Focal Point for JFK Board
J. Barry Harrelson
CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer
Records Briefing for ARRB Staff
1. Meeting with you, 21 February, 1997, same subject;
2. ARRB letter to DCI, dtd 27 November 27, 1997, RE CIA Compliance
with the JFK Assassination Records Collection ACT.
1. As we discussed in our meeting of 21 February, the ARRB staff has asked for briefings on
the Agency's records systems. These briefings are the first steps in the compliance with the JFK ACT
process describe in reference #2. At the meeting we set the first two weeks in March as the timeframe
for the DA briefing. Mr. Gunn has requested that the briefing take place prior to 12 March if possible.
The Board is meeting on the 13-14 March and he will be reporting on the status of the compliance
process. Let me know as soon as possible if this is feasible.
2. Your proposal to include representatives of offices of Security and Personnel is excellent.
The briefing should focus on what records would have existed in 1963 and how we search, or account
for, those records today. The talking points paper for the DO briefing, which I left with you, will give you
a good sense of the type of information the ARRB staff is interested in. If you have any questions, please
give me a call on extension 31825.

e.
Intelligence information often looks sensitive to
the layman or generalist when the expert will tell you it is
innocuous. And conversely, what seems innocuous to the
layman can be quite sensitive. Our job is to help you
distinguish the one from the other.
we rely on you to help us figure out ways to ensure
your job is done and the American people are informed
without doing damage to intelligence equities.
E.
g. We want to be as forward leaning as possible, and
work out compromises so it is a win-win solution for our
respective organizations and for the American people.
h.
We will strive very hard for a cooperative,
harmonious relationship and we are committed to providing
whatever resources are needed, from a very slender resource
base to ensuring that we have met all of your taskings.

Challenges
◇ Directorate Search & Review Is Cumbersome

> Coordination Is Resource Intensive & Inefficient
◇ IRO Task Not Perceived As Important
□ --Limits Experience & Sophistication We Can
Bring to the Task
◇ The IRO Has Little Clout or Resources
Policies
◇ Saying "No" Is Easier Than Justifying Damage
◇ Past Practices Are Not Examined Until Forced

s/addais/ed/briefing/982Gina8.ppt
Process: First, process - the components own the information and the IRO is the gate-
keeper who controls what will be done, what will be searched, and what will be released.
This makes coordination complex, but the larger issue is that the IRO usually does not
have either the clout or the resources to do the job and we find cases bottle-necked.
Policies: What also makes coordination difficult, is an institutional bias to withhold
until forced to release. Thus, we adopt silly positions. When pressed, we often concede
in the end, but we lose credibility in the process.
There is no stomach, and perhaps no time to:
✓ Question the questionable,
✓ Revalidate the counter intuitive,
or even overturn the nonsensical.

THE MICROFILM PORTION OF THE SEQUESTERED COLLECTION
As I noted earlier, there are approximately 72 reels of
microfilm in the sequestered collection. (Incidentally, we
have arranged to have all of the microfilm records printed
in hard copy.)
The decision to microfilm a portion of the sequestered
collection was apparently based on two major considerations:
First, the integrity of the sequestered records
had to be maintained.
Second, a number of the files requested by the
HSCA were active and had to be available to allow people to
continue conducting their normal activities.
The solution was to replace certain records with
microfilm versions. These records were microfilmed during
1979-80 with the approval of the Assassinations Committee.
THE CONTENT OF THE MICROFILM
1
1
A sizeable portion of the microfilm--approximately 50
percent--duplicates the hard copy files. For example, there
are 12 reels of material from the Oswald 201 file.
The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel files of
CIA employees. There are also a number of files on anti-
Castro organizations. All but a small percentage of the
materials are CIA-originated cables, dispatches, memoranda,
reports, and correspondence.
35
There are questions of privacy that we believe the
Board may want to consider in determining what information
is to be released to the public. Some of the records
contain, for example, medical information on an individual.
There are also questions of relevancy that we suggest
the Board consider. For example, many of the documents
cover sensitive activities that go far beyond the timeframe
of the assassination or investigations into the
assassination.

Sixth, Capture of Previously Released Information: We are trying to complete the job of
populating a data base of previously declassified and released information.
It is not acceptable that those outside the Agency know better than we do, what we have released.
Our MORI database, once fully populated will allow us to:
Satisfy many requesters from information we already have declassified.
Speed up our declassification by knowing what decisions have already been made.
Increase the consistency of our decisions.
And most importantly, avoid wasting resources and embarrassing ourselves fighting to protect.
what already has been released.
And seventh, Classification Policy: The world is changing.
The overall budget figure was never released, but now it is.
It was forbidden to mention the existence of the NRO; that has changed.
All NRO contractors were under cover; now a two page listing of those contractors has been
published in the media.
We tightly protected all overhead imagery program, but we now are declassifying product
from early systems.
On the other hand, we still have policies that are outdated and may no longer make sense - [Farm,
defectors, psychoanalysis, bios, World War II liaison information.]
A small effort can inject fresh thinking, and can staff issues for periodic and systematic validation by
senior management.

This can pay dividends by keeping us from wasting time and resources protecting and defending what
senior managers believe can and should be released.

Talking Points for meeting with ARRB Executive Director,
Laura Denk
4:00 p.m., 17 Aug. 1998
--
Meeting is primary a “Meet and Greet”
Laura will be looking for reaffirming of commitment to
complete the tasks still outstanding and to meet the
deadline for the Final Declaration. She may also bring up
the subject of a "Memo of Understanding” on what is to be
done after the Board goes out of business.
Current Status:
Sequestered Collection
The re-review is virtually complete-- the remaining material
(approximate two boxes) is mostly security files)
[Note: In the review controversial, complicated or Denied
in Full documents were white-banded for later processing;
currently have a team of 3 reviewers going through the
collection handling these problem documents. A number of
these could lead to potential appeal issues. It will take
2-3 weeks to complete the white band review.]

Bill re Stations:
No problem with release of CAS (Controlled American Source),
fact we have overseas locations, CIA representatives in
specific countries the problem comes with officially
--
acknowledging the stations thereby putting the host
government and service in a position of explaining why it is
allowing a foreign espionage unit to operate in the country.
This may become a serious political issue for the
government, especially in countries where the government
does not acknowledge its own service. Also can be perceived
as “rubbing their nose in it” and can affect the trust
between the Agency and the host service (violated agreement
of confidentially).
Marwell pointed out that this information was 30 years old
and asked what was the impact of acknowledging a station
presence in 1963 on current operations or relations.
Bill responded “opened up old sores” and cited Rome and the
sensitivity to our involvement in past election. Mentioned
the reaction to the announcement on covert actions by DCI.
Gunn asked if stations

Mary asked about changes in government; Bill responded that

the group that leaves when a neww government comes into
power will be back in power at some point.
Bill comments on specific stations
If important to the story such as Mexico City and the
surrounding stations which were involved in the cable
exchanges re Oswald, then will release.
“Don't take it away from us for little or no gain to the
story”, I. e. if not critical to the story let us protect.

Other issues discussed
Crypts other than LIs and AMS - there was a discussion re
deleting digraph and letting rest of crypt; everyone seemed
receptive, but no decision.
Bill mentioned Iranian takeover as good example of damage
caused by release of documents with crypts, file #s, etc.
Gunn ask if there was an internal “damage” study prepared.
Bill said he would check.
Marwell rejected the approach of the Agency having the
opportunity to discuss Board actions before official
notification. If we have evidence, need to present upfront,
not come back with additional evidence after the decision.
The balancing of public interest vs Agency needs came up.
several times; Marwell commented that even if a document or
item is not important to the Oswald story, the Agency must
still defend.
Bill stated several timed during the meeting “If important
to the story, we can live with release".

Notes:
I did not address the financial records of the CRC that we
are replacing with a summary (need to review again); we will
probably have to wait until we meet with the full board to
get their thinking on summaries.
There are other categories/types of documents that are non-
related but do not fit in the above categories. For
example, the HSCA requested files on 29 on defectors; they
chose only 11 for their defector sample to be compared with
Oswald. We treated the 11 as related and the rest as non-
related. However, the number of pages involved is small
compared to the above three categories.
