1. Attached to this mesorandum is a copy of an article appearing
in the February 1960, issue of "Science and Mechanics" magazine, Page 2
reflects a comment to the effect that the U. S. Intelligende under urote
the development of the Identi-kit to the amount of $87,000..
24.
2. TSD/ under RD-177 and under the EARPORT
EAPPORT Program has invested
Â£82,531 into the Identi-kit. Chief Hugh C, MOJONALD, who is mentioned
in the article, is a cleared TED consultant. He was initially briefed by
Mr. ANDERSON, TSD/EB. The Agency sponsored Mr. McDONALD's visit to y
Washington and arranged his trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, all in connection
with the development of the Identi-kit. The Townsend Corporation, work-
ing with MCDONALD, has built a number of these kits and will advise the
Agency of those sold to foreign powers, etc. Mr. Courtney OWENS, Sales
manager of Townsend Engineering Corporation, is a TSD/EB cleared source 24
and understands the Agency's interest in the Kit. Townsend has also opaned
school for Identi-kit users. Three persona from TSD have attended this
school.
3. The TSD project engineers are very dubious that MCDONALD disclosed
classified information to unauthorized persons and speak highly of him.
They have especially noted his eagerness to assist us on various crash-typs
projects of an unclassified natura
4. Therefore, we have no desire to alienate his feelings. Nevertheless,
I would suggest that Mr. JONES, during his forthcoming visit to the West
Coast, interview Mr. McDONALD to determino, if possible, the reason for
inclusion of U. S. Intelligence interest in the attached article, whether
not CIA was mentioned during his interview with the author and to further
brief MCDONALD if necessary. Furthermore, the Identi-kit is expected to
receive considerable publicity as the sales program is stepped up.
.1.
5. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to FSD (Attn: Robert
SWENDIHAR) to determine whether or not any other components of the Agency
are or have used MCDONALD (possibly contactar or 880).
