Since Roberto appears to be an excellent recruit-

toward having AMDUG-1 make an approach to him at the
first opportunity. Although Hector appears far less

During the middle and late 1950s, Roberto
had been a salesman for the Burroughs flour company
and had stayed clear of the political picture in Cuba.
e. During the same period, Hector had been a
student in the University of Havana, under Raul ROA,
and had taken part in some revolutionary activities.
He had been arrested and beaten by the Batista police
for his anti-government actions and his father had
sent him into exile in the US.
f. When Castro came into power, the father was
a potential "var criminal" for his illicit dealings.
ANMUG-1, who was in the police force in the initial
stages of the revolution, states that he deleted an
incriminating page from the father's dossier (showing
he paid off the police to run his bolita operation)
and thus saved him from prosecution.
"
g.
AMMUG-1 continued to be close to the family,
especially with Roberto, "whom I saw every day and
ran around with. Roberto never entertained the
revolution. As late as 1962-63, "We used to talk
quite openly and frankly. He was always against the
revolution and the communists. He worked in the
Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the
to get out
job, but he had only one idea in his head:
of Cuba and come to the US. He was even plotting to
get out by boat. He had a US visa for many years and
had visited here many times."
h. When ALBUG-1 defected, he lost contact with
Roberto. But, about two weeks ago a neighbor from
Regla came to Miami on the Freedom Flights. (COMMENT:
This undoubtedly refers to Cuban refugee Segundo
CASCUDO Gonzalez. Reference forwarded the AMOT

asked about Roberto, the neighbor said that he under-

Embassy." The refugee could not say what country

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH
SUBJECT
:
Deputy Director for Plans
Vladimir RODRIGUEZ La Hera
1. This memorandum contains a recommendation in
paragraph three for the approval of the DDCI.
2.
Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lahera is a former Cuban national
who defected to the United States in Nova Scotia, Canada on
21 April 1964. At that time he was an intelligence officer
in the General Directorate of Intelligence, the Cuban external
intelligence agency. He was brought to the United States
under the provision of Section 7 of Public Law 110 (CIA Act
of 1949). He has never been a member of the Communist Party,
but due to his service in the Cuban external intelligence
organization he is not eligible to petition for naturalization
until ten years after the date of his defection, or 1974.
3.
Mr. RODRIGUEZ desires to become a naturalized U.S.
citizen at the earliest possible time and has requested
assistance from this Agency. We request that a private bill
be submitted to Congress waiving the ten-year provision of
the Immigration and Naturalization Act in his case, enabling
him to become a U.S. citizen after five years of residence.
It is recommended that you authorize the Legislative Counsel
to seek a private bill for RODRIGUEZ' relief.

4. Soon after RODRIGUEZ joined the General Directorate
of Intelligence, he found he could no longer submit to having
his thoughts and actions circumscribed by controls which
deprived him of liberty and self respect nor continue to
support the Cuban Government or be a part of its intelligence
activities; he therefore planned to defect as soon as the
opportunity arose. After deciding to leave Cuba permanently,
he began a systematic collection of documents at the General
Directorate of Intelligence Headquarters. He brought these
documents with him to the United States as proof of Fidel
CASTRO's subversive activities in Latin America.

BIOGRAPHIC DATA
Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera
.1. Vladimir RODRIGUEZ La Hera was born on 6 February 1937
in the City of Havana, Cuba, the son of Carlos RODRIGUEZ Ferrer
and Josefa LAHERA Marrero. RODRIGUEZ' wife, Luisa Nelia
RODRIGUEZ y Timoneda, born 24 August 1934 in Regla, Havana,
and her two children by a former marriage, Vicente Maximiliano
HERNANDEZ Rodriguez, age 19, and Francisca Luciana HERNANDEZ
Rodriguez, age 17, legally entered the United States on
11 May 1965 and reside with Subject in Miami.
in Miami. Her parents,
Pablo RODRIGUEZ Escobar and Sara TIMONEDA Valdes now reside
in the United States.
2.
RODRIGUEZ attended Escuela Publica #45, first to sixth
grade; Primaria Superior #19, seventh and eighth grade; Artes y
Oficios (Construction Civil) one year%; and Instituto de Habana
for two years.
3.
Subject was a member of the Cuban Rebel Army from
1957 to 1961, during which time he advanced from the rank of
Private to Lieutenant. He was imprisoned at Castello Principe,
Cuba,
from 14 July 1957 to 11 February 1958 for participation
in sabotage and propaganda activities on behalf of the 26th of
July Movement. He then joined Fidel CASTRO's forces in the
Sierra Maestra and remained there until the end of 1958 when
he returned to Havana upon the fall of the BATISTA Government.
He was a precinct lieutenant of the Cuban National Police from
November 1959 to December 1961, at which time he resigned from
the Army under which he had held his position in the National
Police. He was out of work until April 1962 at which time he
was employed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade where he remained
until he became a staff member of the General Directorate of
Intelligence in August 1963. He was a member of this
organization until his defection in Ottawa, Canada, on
21 April 1964, when he left his plane which was enroute from
Cuba to Prague.

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT
1. Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera has cooperated with this
Agency since his defection on 21 April 1964 at which time he
turned over to CIA documents from the General Directorate of
Intelligence he had collected during the preceeding several
months. In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate
and valuable information on the organization of the Cuban
intelligence services, their operations, staff members and
agents. These documents and information have given us the
potential and opportunity to take effective measures to
safeguard United States Government interests. Subject has
been of great value in the past, and will continue to be in
the future, in the CIA recruitment/defection program. His
wide acquaintance among and knowledge concerning high level
Cuban diplomats and Cuban intelligence personnel provides
the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations
against them and makes Subject ideal for use in carrying out
the operations. His talents and contacts can be used not only
in furthering the defector program, but in other types of
political action and psychological warfare operations.
2.
As a result of technical interrogations of RCDRIGUEZ
on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his bona fides have
been established not only for intelligence exploitation
purposes but also 1for the purpose of resettlement in the
United States. There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ
is under the control of any hostile intelligence service.
The medical and psychiatric examinations have shown
that RODRIGUEZ has no serious medical or psychiatric problems.
3.
4.
Mr. RODRIGUEZ has adjusted well to American life.
He has been trained as a dental technician and has recently
applied for employment with an airline company. It is
believed that he would be a solid, responsible citizen.

On 30 December 1969, AMNIP-1 reported that AMMUG-1's
wife called him on the day before Christmas and informed him
that her father had been hospitalized with a heart attack
and that AMMUG-1 had left her. AMNIP-1 Ccalled AMMUG-1's
place of employment in Miami on the day after Christmas and
was informed AMMUG-1 was not working that day. AMNIP-1 left
a message for AMMUG-1 to call him but as of 30 December had
not heard from AMMUG-1. AMNIP-1 Commented that he thought
AMMUG-1's wife was a little unbalanced mentally and although
her parents are now in the United States and she has no real
ties left in Cuba, that she is interested in returning to
Cuba.

1.
On 27 January, Alien Affairs Staff advised that under
Section 313 of Immigration and Naturalization Act, AMMUG-I
cannot become an American citizen until after 10 years from
April 1964. While normal Cuban exile must wait five years,
Communist party members must wait 10 years. AMMUG-1's
position as "intelligence officer" is considered a "meaningful
extension" of CP membership.
2. In view of AMMUG-1's distinguished service to RVROCK,
WH Division will submit a memorandum through appropriate channels
requesting authorization to submit a bill to Congress to reduce
AMMUG-1's waiting period from ten to five years. At this writing,
we do not know how long this processing will take but will keep
you advised.
3.
Paragraph 2 above is our intention and we naturally
cannot guarantee approval at this time. If a special bill is
passed by Congress, AMMUG-1 will go through routine application
for Naturalization with RVROCK guidance.
