note.
44 USC 2107
(a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.-The Congress finds and note.
declares that
(1) all Government records related to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical
and governmental purposes;
(2) all Government records concerning the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy should. carry a presumption
of immediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually
disclosed to enable the public to become fully informsă about
the history surrounding the assassination;
(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable,
independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure
of such records;
(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records
related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at
least the year 2029;
(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, as implemented by the executive branch, has pre-
vented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy,
(6) legislation is necessary because Executive Order No.
12356, entitled "National Security Information" has eliminated
the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to
classified information across government and has prevented
the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy; and
(7) most of the records related to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only
in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued
protection of such records.
(b) PURPOSES.-The purposes of this Act are--
(1) to provide for the creation of the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National
Archives and Records Administration; and
(2) to require the expeditious public transmission to the
Archivist and public disclosure of such records.

Possible Illegal Destruction of Records
1. (AIUO) The OIG/IMO received a request from the
AD/IG/INV to search for records needed to verify certain
nominees. During the course of this search, the IMO
discovered what appeared to be the inadvertent destruction
of permanent OIG records.
2. (AIUO) The records, cases from 1977, were retired
in 1980. See exhibit A for a copy of the original records
retirement request.
3. (C) When form 140 (exhibit A) was approved by the
Agency Archives and Records Center (AARC) and returned with
a job number (80-01770R), the records were prepared in
folders, placed in boxes, and a shelflist was created (see
exhibit B for shelflist).
4. (AIUO) Please take notice of the highlighted
portion of the shelflist that claims the records disposition
as 'permanent'. This along with the use of the terminology
'case no.', led me to believe these were permanent records.
5. (AIUO) Exhibit C is a completed request (form
141b) from AARC for authority to destroy these records.
of the records. except those listed on a handwritten note
(exhibit D) attached to form 141b were destroyed.
All
6. (AIUO) At this point, I referred to the original
form 140 (exhibit A) to determine what Records Control
Schedule (RCS) and Item Number was used to retire these
records in 1980. I ordered a copy of the old RCS 07-76 and
checked the disposition of item number '3b' (see highlighted
section of exhibit E). The disposition does allow for the
lawful destruction of these temporary records.

Disclosure of assassination records or particular information.
in assassination records to the public may be postponed subject
to the limitations of this Act if there is clear and convincing evidence
that_
(1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence oper-
ations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States
posed by the public disclosure of the assassination is of such
gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and such public
disclosure would reveal
.
(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection;
(B) an intelligence source or method which is currently
utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the United
States Government and which has not been officially dis-
closed, the disclosure of which would interfere with the

(C) any other matter currently relating to the military
defense, intelligence operations or conduct of foreign rela-
tions of the United States, the disclosure of which would
demonstrably impair the national security of the United
States;

reveal the name or identity of a living person who provided
confidential information to the United States and would pose
a substantial risk of harm to that person;

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so substan-
tial that it outweighs the public interest;
(4) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality
currently requiring protection between a Government agent
and a cooperating individual or a foreign government, and
public disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the
public interest; or

reveal a security or protective procedure currently utilized,
or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the Secret Service
or another Government agency responsible for protecting Gov-
ernment officials, and public disclosure would be so harmful
that it outweighs the public interest.

7. (AIUO) I then noticed that the destruction
authorization form 141b (exhibit C) listed the RCS as 10-84
and the Item Number as 29B. Referring to the newer version
of the RCS I found that this schedule and item number also
allow for the lawful destruction of these temporary records.
Please see the highlighted text of exhibit F.
8. (AIUO) At this juncture, I reviewed the material
and noticed a note on exhibit D that stated, "IG 37/77
Lonnquist (Kennedy Assassination) destroyed on 5/1/95 by
S.K.".
9. (AIUO) Please see the attached JFK Assassination
Act (exhibit G), para (a) (1) thru (6). In short, this law
was enacted in 1992 and these records were destroyed in
1995. The fact the records were scheduled as temporary and
then destroyed according to Agency regulations does not
override Public Law 102-526, the JFK Assassination Act.
1
10. (AIUO) I found three entries in Textware on
Lonnquist. Two pertain to nothing of interest in this case;
however the third entry states, "allegations regarding the
Lee Harvey Oswald file” (see the highlighted text of exhibit
H).
11. (AIUO.) In May 1997, I told the JFK Assassination
Review Board (ARB), in an informal hearing, that OIG had no
knowledge or record of any JFK records under OIG's perview
being destroyed. This was during discussions at the table,
and not one of the listed questions for the OIG/IMO to
answer.
12. (AIUO) My plan is to contact the DCI/IMO, enlist
his assistance in notifying the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA) and the ARB that records
pertaining to the JFK Assassination were inadvertently
destroyed and explain in detail the events surrounding the
discovery and what steps have been taken to prevent this
from happening again.
t
13. (AIUO) I personally doubt that there was anything
of value to the ARB in the Lonnquist case file, but because
LHO is referenced it is considered a JFK ARB file, and by
law I have to report its destruction to NARA and the ARB.
