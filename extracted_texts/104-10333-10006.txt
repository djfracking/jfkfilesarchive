DS&T and DO Briefing Questions
COMMENTS:
Barry,
Attached are the final versions of the DS&T and DO briefing questions. There are no changes in
the DS&T questions. Questions have been added to the DO list to reflect our conversation
March 19 and 20. You, of course, already have our detailed explanations for the earlier DO
questions. If you have any questions or if there are any problems, please give me a call. I should
be in all day. See you tomorrow.

since 25 May 1956 Mr. Hunter Leake had seen SHAW casually,
by chance, in various downtown New Orleans restaurants,
and greetings were exchanged. The last such casual
encounter was just before SHAW's retirement in 1965.

On 7 March 1967 Pravda published an article
CIA datelined Rome
called "Clay Shaw of the CIA datalined Rome, 6 March
1967, written by V. YERMAKOV. The article charged that.
CIA made use of the services of Clay SHAW for CIA's own
interests in Italy. The Pravda place notes that the DA
in New Orleans is accusing SHAW. of participation in the
assassination conspiracy. It says SHAW spent "some years"
in Rome as a World Trade Canter leader.
•
the Center was a cover for financing anti-Communist activity.
CIA gave directives to SHAW. The World Trade Canter was
a branch of "Permidax" (sic), "which the newspapers in
Switserland openly accused of 'criminal operations'...
(Comment: It appears that all of the Pravda charges are
untrue, except that there was a CIA-SHAW relationship.
far as is known, SHAW was never asked to use his relation-
ship with the World Trade Center for clandestine purposes
and, in fact, he has not been in Italy.)

Types of Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
March 17, 1997
1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton's
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office was notified."
(p. 143) Where are these records?
2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA's
Record's Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?
3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?
4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199?
5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the fist month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?
7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?
9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
j
11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?
12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register,
13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?

Testimony of Abram Chayes
Legal Advisor, Dept. of State
Warren Commission, Vol. 5.
Mr. ONAYES. No; I think in each case it will depend so much on the situation
with the particular person. If a person comes in and he is very ägitated or
something of that kind, it might dictate a fotally different approach than a differ-
ent kind of thing
Mr. DULLES. Wouldn't it be useful though to give-I don't want to suggest
what the Secretary of State should do in this, but in the light of this expert-
ence, would there not be some benefit possibly in giving people in the field the
result of the experience gained in this particular case?
Mr. CHAXES. Well, the general approach, and other matters related to it,
are touched on in orientation courses for consular officers and so on. I think
as I look on Consul Snyder's actions, that he behaved very much like a respon-
sible Foreign Service officer.
That happened long before I was in the Department, so I can say that
without any involvement. But it seemed to me that he did just what be
should have done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to me, at
least, that the training and orientation that these people are getting is right, is
serviceable, and they are able to handle these situations as they come in.".
Mr.. DULLES. I realize that you ought not to prescribe hard and fast rules,
that there is a broad range of discretion that should be exercised here. But I
Just raise the question as to whether a good deal of experience hasn't been gained
in this case in that very fleld.
Mr. CHAYER Well, it may very well be that more attention to that particular
aspect should be given in the orientation courses and so on. Those things
tend to reflect what is hot at the moment you know, and if you haven't had
trouble with something for a pretty long time, it tenda maybe not to get
mentioned..
Representative FORD. If Oswald had persisted that day, October 81, in de-
manding the form that is a prerequisite under your definition for renunciation,
would Snyder have been required to give it to him and permit him to sign it?
Mr. CHAYES..I think if it had been in ordinary office hours when the com-
sulate was open for business, and if Snyder was satisfied that he was competent,
that Oswald was competent, he would have to give him the form, yes, sir.
Representative FORD. Does Snyder. have the authority to make a determina-
tion of competency?
Mr: CHAXES. No; he doesn't have the authority to make a determination of
competence, and I suppose it is possible at some point to get the issue tried in
court. But I think a consular officer would probably be acting within his
discretion if he saw sombody who was drunk or raving or something and just
said; "Well, I am not going to give you this until I am sure that your action is
your act.” After all; when the consul accepts the oath, he is certifying that it
is the act of the person in a meaningful sense, and so if he thought that the
'person was incompetent, I think he would have discretion not to give the oath.
But I put that far aside because in the particular case bere, Mr. Snyder made it
perfectly clear that he had no reason to doubt that Oswald was fully competent.
And so if Oswald had been there at a time when 'the office was open, or had
returned at a time when the office was open, and had persisted in his demand,
I think Snyder would have been under an obligation to give him the form.
Representative Form. The only technical reason or basla upon which Snyder
could have denied Oswald the right that day was the fact that it was on a
Saturday, a non-working-hour period of the Embassy.
Mr. CHAYES. Yes; I think he had every right to try to dissuade him, or per-
suade him not to act or persuade him to think it over and come back the next
day. But if after all of that Oswald still had said "But I want to do it now"
and if the office was open for business, then I think he would have had to do it.
Mr. DULLES. I think it might be useful if it has not been done to introduce
at this point as an exhibit the form of oath of renunciation. Here is the for-
malized oath and I think it would be well to have this in our records unless
it is already in our records.
Representative Forn. I agree.·
Mr. COLEMAN. No; it isn't. Could we say it will be marked as Commission
Exhibit No. 955 and place this sticker on that page, photostat it and then just
and it hart?
(Commission Exhibit No. 955 was marked for identification and received, in
evidence)

was a regular working day-

Representative FORD. Are all of the employees, Mr. Snyder, Mr. McVickar,
and the others who had any. firsthand contact with the Oswald case in this
area, were they State Department employees?…..
Mr. CHAYES. Yes, sir; these two men, who, were the only ones who did
him directly, I think the secretary, their secretary also saw him, but had nothin
to do with him except as a receptionist. These two men were Foreign.

Representative Fox, Could you tell us in a bit more detail the process that
your followed or the procedure that you carried out when you first got into the
Oswald care.
You mentioned yesterday you got a call or you were directed by I believe
the Secretary of State or by somebody in higher authority to take certain steps.
WNl you tell us who called you, what you did in the first 8 or 4 days?
Mr. CHAITS. It was the evening of the day, perhaps about 5 o'clock on the
· day of the assassination. It may have been somewhat earlier, because I think
I`remember I went home for an hour and then came back to carry out this
assignment. Mr. Ball, once it became known that Oswald had same history as

Mr. CHATES. He was then the Acting Secretary, because the Secretary of State
as you recall was on a plane over the Pacific. So he was the Acting Secretary.
But even if he had been the Under Becretary he is my client.
Representative FORD. He still had some authority.
Mr. CHAYES. Yes; he directed me to gather together the files in the Department
on Oswald, and to prepare a report to be avaliable for him the first thing in the
morning covering as best we could within that time span the contacts that
Oswald had with the Department.
We got the passport file. We got the security office file. We got the special
consular services file which covered Mrs. Oswald's visa and the repatriation
loan: I think those three files were the ones that we had. It may have been
there was a smaller fourth file, but I think those three were the ones.
Representative Furn. What would that smaller fourth file be?
Mr. CHAYES, I can't remember. It was duplicates if it was anything. Oh, that
is right, we haď a visa file and an 808 file so those were the four. The 808
file, that is Special Consular Services, in the office; in the Bureau of Security
and Consular Affairs.

Question #9:
SECRET
P.5
i
Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How could a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
The two 1967 Ramparts articles mention connections between the Agency and
journalists worldwide. The primary focus of this question is on any connection between
the Agency and any journalist who might have covered the assassination domestically.
Additionally, we would be interested in any publishing company involved in
publishing books about the assassination. HSCA staff notes (RIF 180-10142-10087)
summarize several files dealing with contacts between the Agency, publishing houses,
and authors. For example, the file identified as QKOPERA/Liaison ZRBLESS outlines
a memo by Gunnar W. Beckman CA/PROP on the status of negotiations between
Praeger Publishing and Milovan Djilas. ZRBLESS is identified as a subproject of
WUBONBON. Further, the staff notes mention a project involving "Praeger) and
publication" [sic], a separate project involving "the Freedom Fund and distribution"
[sic], and a third project to provide news service to the foreign press through
Continental Press. Each of these projects appears to have been in operation in 1963-64.
Question # 10:
Did the Agency have any relationship, projects or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
This question is a follow up to question # 9. One record that is already in the collection
(RIF 180-10142-10087) summarizes the Project File of WUPUNDIT and notes two 'one
time only' operations in 1963--WURAISIN and WUTRANSIT which were responsible
for publishing two books each. In addition, WUSENDER is reported to be a 'one time
only' operation responsible for three books in 1964. If these books have domestic
implications or are on subjects related to the assassination, they would be relevant
documents.
We hope that this additional explication may help you and the DO understand our
approach to the issues raised in our questions. Should any of our requests impose on
you or your staff a burden that we may not have anticipated - or which would entail
work of dubious value or benefit -- please advise us so that we can work with you to
modify or amend the requests accordingly.

Question # 5:
We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on the
Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1 and
December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?
Until very recently, we had seen no evidence that CIA had microphone surveillance of
the Cuban compound. However, Dispatch HMMW 12454 (no IDEN number attached)
found in Box 23, Folder 9 of the Sequestered Collection, makes reference to LICOOLS
(concealed microphones inside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City). Though the
dispatch reports that the last LICOOL ceased functioning in 1961--before the period in
question-the prior existence of this capability and the fact that the dispatch discusses
the possibility of reactivation prompts the question of whether all technical and'
surveillance operations against the Cuban and Soviet Consulates have been identified
to the ARRB. In addition, the dispatch refers to MKTRAP, a telephone hot mike
operation which was re-actuated from a basehouse in November 1963. The specific hot
mike telephone PBIMPULSE appears to have been in operation during 1963. Are there
records from this operation? Are there any other operations that may have picked up
Oswald's visit?
Question # 6:
How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of technical production that were available
at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production still exists,
where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to retrieve any
additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records exist of the
destruction?
This question is a follow up to question # 5. If MKTRAP was in operation from
September 1-December 1, 1963, where are the records or transcripts describing the take?
Was the take ever retained or reviewed? Do any original tapes or transcripts still exist?
Where might these records be found? Were any other technical operations in progress?
The various project files for the technical operations known to exist during this period
are spotty and incomplete. How can the ARRB know if it has reviewed records of all
the technical operation take for the relevant time period?

ARRB Questions Submitted for DO Briefing
1.
I would like to address some of the concerns that you expressed at our meeting
yesterday, where we briefly discussed the Review Board's Proposed Questions for the
March 17 briefing regarding DO records. We understand that you have some concerns
about the scope of the topics raised. We very much appreciate your recognition of the
importance that we attach to the ARRB's independence and we again wish to
emphasize the fact that we fully understand your proper concern for the protection of
information that is unrelated to the Kennedy assassination.
I would like to emphasize that the questions that we sent to you were not intended as in
depth research queries, but rather as topical talking points for discussion. We prepared
the questions, at your request, in order to give the persons conducting the briefing an
understanding of the types of issues in which we were interested. They represent issues
that we wish to explore in our quest for additional information and records to facilitate
the completion of the ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act.
We appreciate your acknowledgment that the ARRB is not necessarily obligated to
justify to CIA the questions it deems relevant to the assassination. Nevertheless, in
order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, we are very willing to offer the following
additional explication of those questions that we understand may have been considered
by the Agency to be excessively broad.

2. The purpose of this dispatch is to submit for Station comment
review of the technical operational effort against PERUMEN TPELIDE.
#ince its inception. The objectives are (1) to complete Headquarters
records which lack considerable detail concerning the intricacies of
the operation, (2) to urge a more precise use of cryptonyms in
reporting, this activity which would benefit Headquarters personnel
responsible for monitoring and supporting those operations and (3) to
suggest a few administrative adjustments which would dispel the present
confusion mentioned in this dispatch.
It was
3. The initial effort against the target was PRIMPULSE:
introduced into the target using LIFEAT assets and was actuated from
the LIFEAT VI basehouse. This is mentioned only to complete the record
and does not pertain to the intent of this discussion. Properly
speaking the initial effort begins with the activation of LIFEAT/
LIERODE in February 1959, as indicated in mod 12358. Subsequently
eight (8) LICOOL attempts were made during 1960-1961 against the same
target, The LICOOLE were monitored from a mobile LP (not LIFIRE),
Basehouse ABLE and Basehouse BAKER, and the latter came to be referred
to as the LIERODE base. The most productive operation of this sort
seems to have been LICOOL/11, activated on 9 May 1959, according to
MEXI 3884, dated 15 May 1959. According to our records the last LICOOL
ceased functioning during läte 1961. Please confirm.

At that time a different technique was planned. The following
briefly outlines the development of the oporations which the Station
habitually refers to as "¼XTRAP" :
1. 5 February 1962: Request for operation received at
MKCHARITY by Harvey C. MULFORD.
8 Feb.-Mar.1962: Design and construction of HKTRAP.
9' March 1967 : UKTRAP dolivered to LIFEAT CO for
placement in target area.
10 March 1962
MKTRAP installed by LIFEAT assets and
initial LP tests performed from LIFEAT VI basehouse
with negative results.
14. March 1962 : LP tests conducted with revised series
line connections with positive results.”
6-13 April 1962: Design and construction of LP equipment.
16 April 1962 : Installaction of LP equipment in
LIFEAT VI basehouse.
MKTRAP, although moved from room to room, remained in place within
the target area, though inactive most of the time. During November
1963 MITRAP was re-actuated from a second LIFEAT basehouse known as
Basatiouse CHARLIE.
5. The photo surveillance of PERUMEN TPELIDE was put into effect,
using basehouse BAKER (LIERODE Rese) at the same time that MXTRAP was
actuated. This photo coverage, the basehouse, PBRUMEN TPRLIDE and the
activity for which the cryptonym was first authorized have all been
identified as LIKRODE which has created considerable confusion here at
Headquarters.
6. According to scanty leadquarter's records the following
operations have utilized these bases against the target:

Headquarters has the impression that the principal factors that
contributed to the suspension of MATRAP activity from LIFEAT VI.. were
the physical deterioration of the house itself and the divorce of the
basehouse keepers. The current LIFEAT Project Outline indicates that.
LIFEUD 14 and LIFAUD 17 ware obtaining a divorce and were terminated
as of 30 September 1962. Headquarters assumes they were the occupants
of LIFEAT VI, yet the project outline does not show that the base was
closed. · LIFEAT VI was listed on page 20 of the outline as an active
unit. On the other hand, page 15 of the outline states that LIFEUD 22
and LIFEUD 23 are occupying the "LIERODE photo basehouse", but that

"LIFEAT/XXTRAP", technical difficulties made this impossible,
therefore these two agents were not being included under LIFEAT
Project. When MKTRAP was re-actuated in November 1963 and as stated
above, the Station utilized another LIFEAT baвehouse, also called
basohouse CHARLIE, situated approximately six milow from target.
Please confirm the accuracy of the foregoing and supplement it by
informing Headquarters the basehouses and keepers involved and the
operations they are currently monitoring:
•
7. Headquarters requests 'Station's comments on the following
suggestions;
2. Photographic coverage. That a separate project be
prepared tō Include LYFEUD 22 and 23. The project should
cover their salaries, basehouse rent, and equipment
expenses, an arrangement similar to LITABBY and LIDOGTROT.
This activity, identified with a new cryptonym would
eliminate further confusion when discussing photographie
coverage of PBRUMEN TPELIDE.
b. LICOOL. Headquarters is not aware of any LICOOLS
presently operative. If any are contemplated, CSI-52-6, 27
February 1958, requires special Headquarters approval prior
to any action taken, If successful, a decision can be made
at that time whether a new project is necessary or whether
it can adequately be covered undor LIFEAT, depending on
the assets being utilized in the operation.
j
c. LIERODE. The original intent of this cryptonym is
discussed in the separate cover attachment and the activity
has been assigned file number 50-6-32/6. If the operation
utilizes LIFEAT assets, it is suggested that it remain.

all correspondence. Please inform Headquarters of the assets

d. MKTRAP. KURIOT would prefer the Station not use this
It
cryptonym in reporting this particular type of coverage.
is suggested that a new cryptonym, in the LI series, be
utilized to reference this activity. The present cryptonym
refers to a technique which has progressed from the
developmental into the operational stage and should more
appropriately be identified with a regular Station cryptonym.
If this operation is being worked by LIFEAT assets, then
it might be identified with a dual cryptonym LIFEAT/LI. A
separate file number, within the LIFEAT series, can be
assigned to cover "KTRAP" if the Station requests it, but
It does not seem necessary since othor LIFEAT targets do not
have separate file numbers either. ·
e. Consolidated Project. If the Station prefers, all
technical operations - LIERODE, MKTRAP, LICOOL, PHOTO
directed against PBRUMEN TPELIDE can be funded and
administered under one project.

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?
9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?
10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?
11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?
12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register,
13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?
14. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:
A.
B.
What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).
Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico
City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept- 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963 (other than
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.
Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?
15. ARRB's Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?
16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the "A" at the ends of Shaw's number
2
signify? Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?
18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?
19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QKENCHANT
20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?
21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?
22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?
23. Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?
