Komsomol until the year was up and kept the

NOSENKO described the Komsomol unit as
very small, consisting of approximately 17
people. The Secretaries of most of the
Departments were females. Dues were collected
every month and there was some type of meet-

the name of the Secretary of the KGB Komsomol

a member of the Collegium of the Komsomol
Bureau who was supervising the Komsomol organ-

Contrary to statements in the paper, [KEYZERS was not inter-
viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;

[MORONE] did have contact with a girl at American House posing
as a West German journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH

after his arrival in Moscow.

A number of previous CIA conclusions

It indicates that NOSENKO said he was a valuable FCD agent who
traveled overtly to Western Europe and thereafter clandestinely
to the USSR.
COMMENT:
This case was referred to in notes brought
out by NOSENKO in 1964. FBI translated the
name in these notes as "EKTER." On December 8,
1967, (N-60), NOSENKO translated the name "ECTOR"
but acknowledged it could be "ACTOR." He related
that he had noted this name when a representative
of the FCD had complained to the 7th Department,
SCD, that this name had been included in a
communication sent by Intourist through the
open mails to various Soviet stations abroad.
FCD was afraid its valuable agent would be
compromised. This protest took place in 1963

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided sources
or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the
nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate
clarification regarding three of the other five cases which
were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review
of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",
instead of "ACTOR" or "PROCTOR" Previously obtained, as the
name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed

NEW CASES AND NEW OR CONFIRMATORY INFORMATION
Information set forth above regarding the cases
discussed in the CIA paper has clearly indicated that the
current series of interrogations of NOSENKO in 1967 and
1968 have been much more thorough and have produced
voluminous information clarifying data obtained from him
in previous interviews. Of particular significance,
however, in addition to that set forth above is information
obtained during the current series of interviews which is
completely new. Some of the information relates to new cases
and some of it is new information on cases mentioned previously.
Set forth below is a summary of the most significant data
in these categories and additional new and confirmatory data
obtained during the current interrogation. This material not
only suggests that the previous interviews were inadequate
but also appears significant in assessing the bona fides of

The CIA paper also relates that the KGB agent GEORGE
BLAKE furnished to KGB in 1959 a 19 page document covering a
conference held in London between British and CIA representatives
outlining British and American use of tourists for intelligence
purposes. The KGB was therefore fully aware of the use of
tourists and it was stated that the substance of this informa
tion, if not the document itself, would have been brought to
the attention of the Deputy Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section.

that this case, at the beginning, was a task for the

REM
7th Department. "MC GUIRE" was an "aspirant" (student)
"and he arrived in Russia having several tours and
had about 30 or 40 days." He was young and alone
and although there was no information on him in the
Archives he was suspected because of his "legend"
(stated reason for coming to the USSR). He, therefore
was the subject of coverage which detected his mailing
of a letter in Minsk. This was reported to Moscow by
KGB in Minsk, apparently directed to GRIBANOV, who
turned the case over to the First (American) Department
which thereafter handled the investigation. This`
happened in the late 1950's but NOSENKO could not
recall the year.
NOSENKO stated that the letter

mailed by this CMC GOWAN - MC GUIRE"] was going to a
Russian. (The transfer of this case from the 7th to
the 1st Department suggests that the Russian to whom
the letter was mailed was being used in an operational
game by the 2nd Section of the 1st Department.)

He said the document contained

the content of the document after GOLITZYN's defection

compromised and "x'd out." He did not believe the
document contained the names of any persons who had

On page 158 it is stated that NOSENKO said KOVSHUK

NOSENKO could identify only WINTERS. On page 159 it is

It is considered probable that the 1961
communication referred to by GOLITZYN is identical
with, or related to, data furnished by [SHAMROCK]
in (s)
1967 which indicated KGB was emphasizing operations
against code clerks in 1961. The contents of the
document made available by SHAMROCK undoubtedly (S)
emanated from JOHN DISCOE SMITH, a former State
Department code clerk and crypto technician who
resigned in December, 1959, left the United States
in May or June, 1960, and whose whereabouts there
after were unknown until he was publicized as a
defector by the Soviets in the Fall of 1967
In this connection it is not clear how GRYAZNOV
of the SCD would have knowledge of SMITH in the Spring
of 1960. If SMITH was an agent prior to that time he
would have been an agent of FCD. NOSENKO has reported,
however, that another friend of GRYAZNOV's, NIKOLAY
SKVORTSOV of FCD was handling "ZHARI" (believed to be
the crytonym of SMITH) in 1961 and later "ZHARI" was f

The possibility exists that GOLITZYN obtained
information regarding the "real agent" from SKVORTSOV

SKVORTSOV during the period April - July, 1960,

The discrepancy between NOSENKO's description

COMMENT:
TOP SECRET
On November 4, 1967, (N-10a), NOSENKO furnished
basically the same information concerning the Bulgarian
trip set forth in the CIA paper. The fact that there
was no apparent necessity for the Bulgarian Minister
of Interior to request a KGB officer for consultation
is not a reasonable basis for judging this account to
be untrue.

18. Transfer to 7th Department/
(u)
On page 260 it is stated that NOSENKO dated his
transfer to the 7th Department from the 1st Department as
occurring before the defection of GOLITZYN which he dated as
mid-January, 1962, despite being advised that the correct date
was December 16, 1961
COMMENT:
(u)
NOSENKO during interview on March 6, 1968,
(N-157), recalled that KGB had sent a cable to
Helsinki after GOLITZYN's defection instructing that
the residency make contact with FREISFREUND to warn
him. NOSENKO and KOVSHUK contacted TARABRIN of
FCD to arrange for the cable to be sent. KOVSHUK

On April 22, 1968, (N-184), NOSENKO stated
that he could not make a flat statement that he
would have known of any recruitments in the American
Embassy during the 1955-59 period but believed he
would have heard of them. He would have known of
any such recruitments in 1960-61. He believed he
would also have known of any recruitments in the
1962-63 period because he saw GRYAZNOV frequently
and GRYAŻNOV talked freely because NOSENKO helped
him advance from Senior Case Officer in January, 1962",

PREFACE
TOP SECRET
A. Purpose of Paper
This paper has been prepared to compare the results
of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA
paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of
the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based
on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that
NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector
(u)
According to the paper, in arriving at this
conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOSENKO, analysis
of KGB operations which he related and comparison of his
assertions with collateral information from other sources
were considered.

B. Background
For convenience in assessing these papers, the
following chronology of events is set forth:

NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in
June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia
and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to
Geneva in January, 1964. On his return to Geneva he indicated

it is noted therein that NOSENKO claimed SHAKHOV was not and
never had been a KGB officer. It was stated that RASTVOROV had

Pages 324 and 325 relate to the recall telegram and

ordering NOSENKO to return to Moscow. Eventually NOSENKO
retracted this assertion and stated that there was no recall
telegram; that he invented the telegram to hasten his defection.
It is stated that special intelligence does not confirm the
existence of the recall telegram but, SCOTCH reported on
February 20, 1964, that the KGB resident in New York had
advised members of the Residency on February 18 or 19, 1964,

This case has not been clarified but no
