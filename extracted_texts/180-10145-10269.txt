15. 11/17/60 Cable to Director from MASH
On 11/15/60, [Parlett alias Bender met with Ray in complete privacy.
"Unquestionably, the youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humble Ray
is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.
Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940
constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate
private investment and utilities would be nationalized.
-->
Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" each member to have specific
responsibilities and feel important to revolution.
--
Also
Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S.
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday Bender made commitment.
03
[Parlett] believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-
U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is
problematical.

MRP, 11/18/60
Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent anything to cheer
about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to
control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders.
Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was
agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that financial and military support
for MRP be channelled through FRD.
17. 11/23/60 Contact Report: Meeting with Ray and Chibas in NYC, 11/22/60
Ray says MRP has contacts at Isle of Pines with two garrisons and can
expect about 750 men to desert Castro at proper time. CAPTAIN CAPOTA is

Comments on his Anti-Castro Activities
Signed: Calvin Hicks WH/4/PM/Operations
"Ray is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort
to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-
called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or
operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or
claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he
always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has
always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with
them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them.
His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power
in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo
RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more
so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to
be the power in Cuba."

with [Noel that no money should be given Ray until his plans are studies.
Ray is asking for support separate from FRD since Ray has withdrawn from
this group. Noel further states in Memo, "---I would like to point out the
security risks inherent in any arrangements with RYA-BENTANCOURT-CISNEROS
trio. These fellows have had easy access to the White House and to the
Department, are notorious for their 'planned leaks', will probably presume
all the Department officials they deal with are privy to the arrangement, and

purpose of visit of Ray to Puerto Rico, terminating when Ray hurridely left
Puerto Rico following press account that he had been removed as Coordinator
of the MRP.
Source said MRP leaders in exile believe Rays dismissal due to propaganda
and pressures by the CIA which brought about the impression that the obstacle
to receipt of help from outside (money, arms, etc) was Ray himself and that
oner Ray removed, they would receive all types of help. The exile leaders are
of opinion that it was also brought about because Ray was a divisionist
inasmuch as he had abandoned Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Council.

Dr. Jose ALVAREZ Diaz, former Minister of Finance under Prio (Pg 12)
Dr. Jorge BERUFF, former president of Banco de Desarrollo
Economico de Cuba, (pg 13)
Cover note pencilled comment (The content is so biased and mixed
with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence community
to disseminate it.
Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was
a Protestant but today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC
against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July
Movement fused into one, and as soon as Castro came into power, control
of the organization was given to the Communists. Tells of Ray's association
with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother
was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due
to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a
traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and
supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations.
Says in
Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and
deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic
procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own
movement.
Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining
relations with USSR and not making Communist Party illegal. Said that
although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press
coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and
would try to put ideas into practive if he ever came to power. Alverez
also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,
socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.
.
Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruff said Ray well-intentioned with no
Communist tendencies. Cited a meeting at which the basic points of the
MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with
the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the
meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Â· Out of this
meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of
the banks and public utilities.
On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not
true and part of a "campaign against him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City
Transit Company".

Date: August 4, 1961
Subject: Debriefing of Father Bastarrica
Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile.
luncheon meeting, he reported as follows:
i
At a
MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo
Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.
All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP
was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party
or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the
following:
a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray
b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo
c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet
d. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)
e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos
f. Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged
to Accion Democratica.
Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether
Ray is Communist or Marxist. Lacks quality of leadership because he
does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology.
He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them
or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a
very dangerous man. Is extremely ambitous for himself, with great desire
for power.

a 25-foot boat outfitted in Miami area to be operational by about Sept. 10.

Cuba. Ray also says he has been offered a 210 ft. Corvette, flying a
Venezuelan flag and owned by Spaniards friendly to JURE. Said he could extend
operations along the south coast of Cuba for as much as 2 - 3 weeks with

not pose as many difficulties as present Mexican and Spanish air travel
conditions.
Ray says he hoped to soon penetrate the Cuban delegation to the U.N.

JURE, continues, but without significant progress. Lechuga is most

6. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dtd 31 Jan 64 Article in Miami Herlad about
the discovery of arms cache in Puerto Rico confirms accuracy of Amtaup/2
reporting that Ray involved in robbery U.S. Military installation and that
Governor Marin is misleading FBI investigation. WAVE believes the C-3
explosive found in cache was provided Ray by WAVE as directed by Hdqtrs,
but WAVE did not provide any weapons. WAVE will tell loaal FBI that they
know nothing regarding background of cache discovery and assume Hdqtrs will
coordinate case at Wash.D.C. level with FBI.
7.
Intelligence Information Cable, dated 4 Feb. 1964 - reliable source
says RAY expected in Caracas, Venezuela middle of February 1964 to establish
a guerrilla training base for JURE in venezuela. Will be a regional center
used by JERE members in Venezuela and Panama. (Likely that if Ray succeeds
in setting up camp, it will be with tacit consent of Betancourt government.
Field Comment). Ray claims he will be inside Cuba by 20 May 1964.
8. Cable to DIR from Panama City, dated 9 Feb 1964 states JOSE MARIA PUENTE
BLANCO, Panamanian/Cuban, DOB 17 July 1930, Havana, Cuba, keft Panama City
for Caracas on 8 Feb. He is possible Castro agent and Panama City would
appreciate information re his activities in Caracas and/or subsequent travel.
9. Memo for the Record, dtd 12 Feb 1964 from Alfonso Rodriguez
Subject: Meeting with AMBANG/1
ELC, according to Ray, was now disolved and became a part of JURE on 17 Jan.
1964. This brings to JURE the best former rebel army officers in exile and-
should give JURE a military background and support second to none in the
exile community.
Comments: AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated Cisneros activities and statements
are directed against the CIA. Rodriguez discusses Amtaup/2's reporting with
Tony Sforza and Warren Frank. If Cisneros is in fact directing a program
of denigration against the CIA, suggest agency follow the activities of
Dionisio Suarez Esquival, who reportedly has been selected to carry out such
a program in various Latin American univerities.
10.
Cable to DIR from Panama City, dated 22 Feb. 1964. The PUENTE BLANCO
brothers have been under some suspicion since their arrival in RACY following
their release from Cuban prison as result of intervention of Thelma King.
Part of suspicion is a result of activities of their brother, Jorge, still
in Cuba.

Ä½ AMOT-84 said he learned from newspaperman Abelardo (Garcia) Berry that Ray
had met in Paris with Carlos Franqui Mesa to propose that Franqui join
Ray's organization, that is, sector of "Betrayed Revolution". Garcia
believes that in order to obtain Franqui's defection, Ray told him about
alleged plans of U.S. to overthrow Castro in which Ray was to play a
prominent part. Garcia further believes that Franqui's "falling into
disgrace" in Cuba is a trick of Castro and Franqui.
4.
Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dated 8 January 1964 states that Governor Munoz
Marin, Puerto Rico, pledged to give Ray double any amount Ray raised on a
bond sale by JURE to buy guns. JURE has large quantity of arms in P.R.
under protection of the Governor.
5. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dated 14 January 1964. Cisneros said JURE
has military training base in Costa Rica under command of Julio Cesar Alonso,
Military Chief of JURE. All JURE boats now at Costa Rican base and also
arms which had been in Puerto Rico. Said JURE leaders do not plan to
to work in Miami area or anywhere else in U.S. because they are afraid
CIA will seize their military equipment.
6. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dtd 16 Jan 1964 - Amtaup/2 reported that
Julio Cesar Alonso replaced as chief of Costa Rican
military base of JURE because of his failure to go on a scheduled operation.
(Check to see if this was the aborted mission of 25 November 1963)
6. Cable to DIR from JMWAVE, dated 30 January 1964. Amtaup/2 reported
conversation with Sergio Sanchez and Rogelio Cisneros. Cisneros said FBI and
INS, Puerto Rico, picked up JURE arms and explosives cached at Cajon de
Muerto. Before JURE could pick cach up, it was discovered by a fisherman who
advised authorities. JURE boat found and searched, but not retained as they
had thrown antiaircraft guns overboard. Governor of P.R. called newspapers
and informed them he thought Castro had cached the arms in order to overthrow
P.R. Cisneros says he did this to sidetrack FBI and TNS investagations and
to eliminate possibility Ray's activities would be revealed. Cisneros
said JURE boat located in P.R. and registered in Panama in name of person
who is extremely close to governor P.R. and bitter enemy of CIA. Amtaup/2
questioned by Governor P.R. was trusted by Jure, to which Cisneros replied
that Governor primarily nationalist and enemy of U.S. imperialist politics
and therefore an enemy of CIA.

Ray's plans to infiltrate Cuba by 20 May were discussed at meeting. Questions
about Ray's financing of Puerto Rican conference and ability to store arms
and engage in training activities on U.S. soil were raised by AMYUM/19(MRR)
Hember). He volunteered to tell Hecksher where arms could be found be
Hecksher "quickly dissuaded him from divulging further details" at which

not put it past Ray to go into hiding in a secure place while pretending
to be in Cuba.

2. Cable to JMWAVE from DIR, 7 May 1964 After looking at AMTAUP material,
it is obvious much of conspiratorial talk in JURE is for internal consumption
only, the purpose being to protect myth that JURE is independent as basically
hostile to CIA. In a desire to obtain proof of any anti-CIA or U.S. govt.
activity by Ray, urge every effort to check accuracy of AMTAUP/AMOT reporting
and follow through for any overt manifestations of many allegations made.

Origin of Autonomous Operations
Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority
in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups
to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.
Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a
"Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-
controlled Cuban teams, CIA would extend financial aid and some advice and
guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.
Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.
1. "It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be
executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the
overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,
both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.
2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives.
in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations
If this cost
can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,
they cannot be resumed.
3. All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory
of the United States.
4.
The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly
any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may
be the reports of U. S. complicity.
5. The United States presence and direct participation in the
operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an
operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it
clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except
to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be
assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide
general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.
He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.
6. These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time
schedule."

1.
Memo dtd 18 November 1965 to: United States Secret Service
From: Deputy Director for Plans
Subject: Ray, Rivero, Manuel Antonio aka: Ray, Manolo
In response to a telephonic request of 15 Nov. 1965 for a name trace
on Ray. CIA files contain voluminous information from sources of
varying reliability re: Ray who is well known to Intelligence Community
as a prominent anti-Castro Cuban exile leader and head of JURE.
If par-
ticular info is desired, please specify.
2. Memo dtd 6 Dec 1965 to Secret Service from DD/P gives 2 1/2 page
standard bio information on Ray.
3. Memo dtd 15 Dec 1965 to Commissioner, INS from DD/P
Subject: Roige Cerezo, Jose
(A 12 399 923 TC)
According to CIA files, information dtd Aug 1963 from a Cuban emigree source,
Roige was designated chief of intelligence by National Direction Abroad of
JURE. Source said intelligence group created in Marc 1963 on orders of
Manuel Ray for purpose of infiltrating JURE members into various organizations
which operated in Miami area, as well as into agencies of U.S. govt. Further,
that in April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member into CIA
in order to learn details of plans regarding Cuba. JURE also intended to
drop leaflets into Cuba of a derogatory nature regarding U.S. govt. In-
cluded in these leaflets was Subject's manifesto against the U.S. govt and
against this Agency.
4.
Ltr. dtd June 2, 1966 from Dr. Julian Gallo to Harry (Mahoney?)
Gallo is contact with Ray in Puerto Rico and trying to discover the names
of Ray's contacts in Cuba. Ray, apparently is seeking a Mexican visa from
Gallo and unhappy that it did not come through. Refused to reveal names
or addresses to Gallo and would not give information about where his radio
broadcast tapes were to be sent for transmission into Cuba.
5. Memo for the Record, dtd 21 June 1966 from Charles Anderson
Met with Ray on 28 April 1966. Anderson said in general Ray had less
information on the "purge situation that I did.! Ray said relatives
of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,
about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him
were thin. "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than
we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure
on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on
the chance that Ray might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know
if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use
an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism."
"I believe that later in the summer it might be a good idea to have
another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile thinking, and feeding more
deception thoughts."

On Aug 24, 1964, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.
Stated Ray incapable of directing both political and military activities.
Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had
believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically
unformed politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated
that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President
Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to
him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding liberal and democractic
exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy
would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to
Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros
that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

Conclusions "I recommend we give Ray what he asks and close the JURE books
for good. If Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
not, our help won't do much good.
"He is honest and at least the money will largely be spent for the
purpose he wants to achief .
"Whatever Ray may ever say, he was treated the way he asked to be
treated. We have played the game in a manner beyond reproach.

with Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, military leader of SNFE, and other revolutionary
organizations, unless he enters Cuba. He wants to have same influence of
others when Haiti leadership starts distributing bases to Cuban exiles and
providing them help for their aid in overthowing Francois Duvalier (a trade off).
According to St. George, the Haiti combine is composed of Gutierrez,
Antonio Cuesta del Valle of Commandos L, and DRE members. Also, Rolando

->
1. Memo dated 24 Oct 1962 to Chief, Contact Division, from Chief, San
Francisco Office
Subject: Suitability of Manuel Ray and Miro Cardona for Important
Roles in a Possible New Cuban Government
05
Information received from Dr. Robert North Professor of Political Science 05
29 at Stanford University and long-time source of exceptional value. North â
visited in Miami and contacted about 25 former Castro supporters representing
a broad political gamut. Dr. North got the impression from many of the
05 Cubans that they suspected Ray of being a "possible Communist sleeper".
â North reluctant to pass along this information, because accusations were
very broad.
Â© Cubans

Infomation report dated 16 July 1962 and Earlier
Source: Cuban National (Alien File #A-12570921) who asked for an
interview on occasion of first contact with CIA.
Cannot vouch for his bona fides. Had credential indicating membership in
branch of revolutionary army's intelligence service, now in exile in U.S.
and maintaing connections with colleagues in that country.
-->
A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5cc would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country
dinner in honor of the occasion should bring together most of the important
members of the regime and that is when the attempt will be made.

Branch from Daniels. Source is Ernesto Dezaldo). Cuban lawyer now
living in New York City. Stated the MRP in Havana is far less radical than
under the leadership of Ray, who has been completely discredited in recent
months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industrial and government installations
in Havana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000
measured more in terms of fund raising ability and blowing up of buildings.

3. Information dated June 4, 1961, Subject: Underground Student Leader
Comments on Post-invasion Cuba. Reporting officer talked with
ISIDRO BORJA, on the leaders of DRE. Borja says top DRE members in jail
or in a friendly embassy in Havana but said new leaders have been selected
and will resume sabotage activities shortly. Thought the underground could
restore tension in Cuba in 3-4 months. However, said outside help needed
to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
buy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials they were tainted by
corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
estimated to be around 30-856. Most support is out of fear because the
people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of
Cuba working hard for release of former leader, Alberto Muller from prison.

Memo to Acting Chief, Contact Division dtd 20 May 1964
From: Chief, Miami Field Office
Subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray
Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szulc reporting Ray's war movements from
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.
Hendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "war" is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far.

Betsy Palmer

1. Cable suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife
and children from CIA rather than through the FRD may pay large future
dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.
2.
Cable to Director
From: MASH
19 September 1960
i
Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by
KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY.
Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be
noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with
no apparent difficulties.
CHIBAS' sources of information:
Mason in U. S. government
Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives
Nino Diaz as Alianza representative
Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.
This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.
3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member.
*CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's
assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization
inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with
Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to
Ray and would check with him.
4. 27 September 1960.
Memo to Western Hemisphere/4 Chief
From: Rudolph E. Gomez, Acting Chief, WH
Subject: Approval from State to Include Manuel Ray Rivero in the
FRD Complex
At a 20 September 1960 meeting, Ray's name was suggested for inclusion
in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was
discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with
Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.
5. September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WH9 indicates MASH somewhat
doubtful about Ray's feelings toward U.S. and continued dealings with
this group needs further policy consideration.
