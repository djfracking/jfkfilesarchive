Subject began to work against the CASTRO regime with the MRP in
1960. At that time he was employed in the Santa Clara power plant as a
technician. His job was controlling the amount. of electric current that
was distributed. (Attachmont "A" contains a list of Subject's friends
currently employed in power plants in Cuba). On 17 April 1961 Subject
made contact with a KJBARK infiltration team and began to assist the team.
Team consisted of Segundo BORGES "Pepe" *GONZALES and *AMARGO/1. Case
Officer Comment: AMARGO/1 has confirmed the fact that Subject worked
with his team in Cuba . Subject permitted the team to install their RS-1
set in his house located at #219 Carretera de Camajuani in the City of
Santa Clara.. He also safohoused the team on occasion and permitted them

be the Civil Coordinator of the movement in that province. Enrique ①4
* ORTEGA was selected as the Military Coordinator. On 21 July 1961, while
[ORTEGA and Subject were in Havana for discussions with MRR leaders
*AMIOOK/1 and Juan FALCON the KUBARK infiltration team and many other
members of the MRR in Las Villas, including Subject's wife, were arrested.
(Discussions were about actions to take place 26 July 1961).

2. Maria RODRIGUEZ Posa, from Santa Clara, age 50/55 yrs, called
OORTEGA Havana and told him not to return to Santa Clara as many
people had been arrested.0 ORTEGA passed the information to. Subject but
as subject thought it applied only to ORTEGA he returned to Santa Clara
late at night on 22 July. He went to his home and on 23 July proceeded
to work at the power plant. Maria RODRIGUEZ Posal intercepted him on
his way home for lunch and told him that the G-2 was at his home and that
they also were going to the power plant to arrest him. Subject also
learned that there was surveillance on his home on the night of 22 July
1961, but the person watching the house had gotten drunk and did not see
subject when he returned from Ilavana. From that moment until entering
an Embassy on 6 September 1962, subject lived "black".

Subject proceeded to the outskirts of Santa Clara where a friend,
Efrain WAREN, resided. His friend told him to go to Havana. While
driving to Havana Subject met another person who informed him that the
G-2 had a roadblock on the highway at Colon, Matanzas, and that all cars
were being searched. On 24 July 1961, Subject went to a beach called
"GANUZA" located on the north coast of Las Villas near Corralillo.
Subject's sister has a home at "Ganuza" so he left his car there and
proceeded to Havana with some friends of his sister. Later the G-2
confiscated his auto. (It is interesting to note that the G-2, after
confiscating subject's auto at the beach, believed that Subject had
departed from Cuba. Subject thereafter communicated with his wife by
sending her letters in jail via Miami where they were postmarked)..
