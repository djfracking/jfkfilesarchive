Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and
the undersigned returned to the Embassy office where after a quick lunch the
questions for the examination were written. The operator met Subject, returne
to the house, and began the examination at about 1430, it having been agreed
we would
did this to find that the
operat appear at the safehouse promptly at 16300
operator had not concluded the examination but there was sufficient tim at the
to
continue which he did. The examination was completed about 1845 hours, whereupon
we were informed by the operator that in his opinion Subject was not attempting
to deceive on any important points, even though some of the more prosaic aspects
of his biography continue to defy logical acceptance.
We then discussed future meeting arrangements with Subject: Subject will
appear in front of the Cafe Georges Von the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours
on 6 April. He will wait for five minutes in front of the cafe but will hot
enter. if we are not there he will return for the alternate. In any event
alternate contact will be made through Annick. Subject was instructed to clear
up his affairs in Ambert and be prepared to depart for Germany; however, it was
also explained to Subject that we were not authorized to make a final commitment
to Subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.
Subject was paid Francs 15,500 for which no receipt was obtained since we were
in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague. If Subject has any difficulties he
will write Annick. He will not return to Gap. He expects to stay with Josef.
Dassaud in Ambert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to Paris by
train. It was further agreed that on or about 4 or 5 April Subject will have
sent a letter to Annickfor "Mike" in which he will conform his arrival and in
double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.
We discussed with Platipodis of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice".
to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if subject had written.

to the residence A
the undersigned borrowed a car
from the Paris station on 19 March and drove that night to Moulins, arriving about
9 o'clock. From the principal hotel in this town a call was made to Subject who
was informed that we would arrive at Ambert at about 12 o'clock, and we agreed to
cet at the railroad station at 1200 hours. We proceeded to Vichey where we changed

into the car and we drove to a restaurant which we left immediately as it was too
was
crowded and returned on foot to 14 rue St. Josef house where our conversation
held. Incidentally, Subject showed the undersigned around the work shop and
demonstrated how the machine and the
for it are made. One cannot
help but marvel at Subject's ingenuity and ability as a tinkerer and pseudo-sort
of engineer. He said they are producing about 300 a month, sell a few more than
this at 48,000 francs a piece (nearly $100). However, Subject gets no income other

the bull by the horns we explained to Subject the delay: A telegram had been sent
to "certain colleagues" in Paris who were supposed to write a letter to be for -
warded to Subject. The man to whom the telegram was sent was on leave and upon
return he was not notified of the telegram we sent; consequently, Subject was not
informed as he should have been. We are terribly sorry and hope that Subject would
appreciate such a minor matter. In any event we reminded Subject that he had not
een promised a letter on or about 1 February but rather told that he could expect
ɔ hear from us then. Subject agreed this was so.
.:

He rhetorically
Subject was far less interested in explanation than a decision.
asked whether he was acceptable, adding he was obliged to assume he was not, and
commenting that although there are "many two legged people in America also" he
thought he was probably a unique persom from the point of view of language ability,
experience as an operator in dangerous situations, etc. We replied thus: One man
(the psychologist) has already come all the way from the States just to see Subject
and another was on his way. From this subject could fairly conclude the importance
"Headquarters" attaches to Subject's candidature and that far from being a dead
issue, Subject's prospects were good, although all depended on him.
'
'
We then turned to the matter of Subject coming to Paris. Subject explained
that Paul (
) had been sent by the Paris station
to Annick and had not done very well. He had failed to convince Annick that he was
sent by Mike (Friganza) and apparently although we did not go into the details of..
this, he did not get the message straight. In any case Subject immediately said
that he could come to Paris anytime although he would be obliged to travel
illegally. This because he had permitted his identity document to expire as of 14
February 1959. However, Subject felt he could make the journey by train without
being caught because the police are not checking most trains. He did not want to
travel by car because he had heard there are occasional road blocks (this may be
true for the undersigned ran into one on the drive from Paris to Ambert). Subject
also said he could stay as long as need by but it was absolutely essential that he
not be obliged to stay at a hotel -- he could either stay with Annick or at a place
put at his disposal by us.

forwarded a letter which ALLOMETER-2 had picked up the day before.
This letter was registered, and ALLOMETER-2 was obliged (for the second time)
to make a personal appearance before the responsible persons and to sign (in alias)||
an acknowledgment of receipt. If it is at all possible to send these letters
unregistered the Base would mich prefer that this system be adopted. ALLOMETER-2,
over a period of years, has rented many different post office boxes under different
names, and the Base considers it a definite security hazard if he is forced to
identify himself in the manner required by the registration of these letters.
2. Headquarters attention is called to the fact that the letter which the Base
forwarded on 7 October 1960 was postmarked in Europe on 12 August 1960. Even in
the light of the notoriously slow Brazilian postal system, the Base cannot explain
such a long delay in transit for air mail. Such a delay has been typical of
almost every letter the Base has received in the past six months. The Base has
no reason to disbelieve ALLOMETER-2 in his repeated assertions that he services
the box at least once a week.

Knowing that the LCFLUTT operator could get to Paris in two days we asked
February He agreed to do this.
He said it would be necessary for his (if he is accepted) to return to Ambert
once more: will not be necessary for him to return to Cap. After discussing this
and paying Subject Francs 10,000, we drove by the railroad station where Subject
hecked on train schedules and we parted. In regard to the lapse of the validity
Subjects documents Subject said: After the 7-10 January meeting in Paris he
had driven back to Ambert; he did act return to Cap; he has been living illegally
In Ambert since his return from Paris on 11 January. He has failed to extend his
document because he calculates he would leave France before the document expired.
Subject surmises that if he were obliged to return to Gap he might be able to
talk his way out of trouble but he might be given two weeks in Jall as a sharp
reminder of the necessity to validate documents promptly.

car provided by the station to Les Halles where we had dinner at the Pied de Cochon.
We returned to the apartment at about 20 hours, talked for another hour or so while
ving a drink, and then retired. During this conversation Subject was encouraged
✓ prompted to develop thoughts on a variety of matters which we hoped would tend
give us better grounds on which to assess him. Nothing of particular operational
or biographic significance was discussed.

arrived we decided on a program and returned to the apartment and suggested that
Subject spend the afternoon on his own and agreed on a 2230 rendezvous not far from
Port Maillot and the safehouse where subject was met. We walked to the safehouse
and retired at about midnight.

23 March 1959: We arose at &, left the apartment by about 8:40, walked to a cafe
where we breakfasted, and then per arrangement passed the corner of Port Maillot
and rue Malakoff at which time the LCFLUTTER operator observed us and followed, us
to the apartment. We showed Subject upstairs and left the apartment where we met
the operator and took him upstairs and introduced him as Mr. Brown. After a very
brief introduction with no explanation, we absented ourselves from the room while
the operator reviewed Subject's biography in preparation for the LCFLUTTER examination.
At about 1245 hours Subject left the apartment on his own, it having been agreed to
meet him on the Avenue Grand Amee in front of the fout Bien cafe. The FLUTTER
operator returned to the Paris station office with us where it was agreed that the
undersigned would go to Germany and return to Paris on 24 or 25 March. The operator
met Subject at the rendezvous and took him to the apartment. After making arrange-
ments for tickets, etc., we returned to the apartment where we interrupted Subject
and the operator. During this brief meeting Subject was paid a further 39,000
Francs, making a total of Francs 49,000 or $100. He was instructed to spend the
night of 23 and 24 March chez Annick and we would return to see him again on 25 March.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Mexican Resettlement Arrangements for AESENTINEL
agent AEASPIC
1. At 1400 hours, 19 August, SR/DOB case officer,
Fred Kirkpatrick and Jerry Pochron from Defection Coordinators
Office of CIA met with Clay Calendar and Jim Myers of TSD/IB
re documentations arrangements and travel routing for possible"
resettlement of AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC. The following
arrangements were proposed by Mr. Calendar and Mr. Myers
for SR/DOB's consideration. TSD/IB suggested that Subject be
sent by black flight from here to West Germany, and there
surfaced with an altered Greek passport which TSD/IB now has
available. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated
re the possession of a Greek passport by Subject, while Subject
has no Greek language capability. Since this passport is a valid
one, (and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore
backstopped in name, Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy
in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this
passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration
action upon declaration of intent to become a Mexican citizen and
upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an employer in Mexico
City.
2. Upon your concurrence, Mr. Pochron will arrange for
Mr. Kirkpatrick to meet with Mr. Coolidge, the CIA contact used
for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.
Mr. Pochron has already talked with Mr. Coolidge on two occasions
and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks, Mr. Pochron
has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete
Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.
3. AEASPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane
tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,
would be waiting for him. The time table for this entire operation
was estimated at about five weeks. Of course we did not discuss
Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel,
nor until Subject could begin earning his own living.

NETCRÂNDUS FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Contact Report:
5/DCH
On 2 September 1940 the undersigned accompanied by S8/7/8 case
officers Perry Crookham and Fred Kirkpatrick met with David Tzitzich vill
(201-233477) in a safe house. The purpose of this meeting was to
assess David for possible use by JMARC. The subjects are he was boing
interviewed as the same procedure had been used previously by representative
of the African Division.
2. The subject has led an exciting and diverse life. The Division
5
brought his to the United States (black) to train for a mission which has
subsequently been cancelled. At the present time the Division is making
arrangements for the resettlement of the subject in Latin America, probably
in Mexico. However, due to the training this agency has given the subject.
SR feels he should be utilized by the CD/P if possible.
"
13. Observing David for some two hours and listening to his story the
undersigned feels there may be sore use of him by JMMC. David is a smooth
talker who has obviously told his story many times to the satisfaction of
his listeners. He elaborates on the exciting and bizarre parts of his life
and tends to gloss over those sections he feels that are common to everyone.
4. The subject has been in the United States for some time. This time
has been spent in training for a specific mission which never came to pass.
Recently he has been engaged in "make work" programe to pass the time. This
could well explain his apparent impatience and desire to do something • In
his own words he wishes to prove that he is capable of accomplishing a task
assigned to him. He asks for a chance to surveil someone, to take clandestine
pictures, even to assassinate someone. He very marly begged to be given a
giten during this meeting.
"
5. The subject is a stateless person. He is in the United States black
and could be completely unattributable if necessary. He desires citizenship
and a chance to settle down in ons spot. He prefers U.. citizenship but is
not adsment on this. However the basic motivation appears to be love of
excitement. The subject gives a very pood appearance of the classical
adventurer. He relates his past exploits in wartime Europe as sotivated by
the thrill of duping the existing authority..

4. Mr. Pochron expressed his concern and the concern
of Mr. Pennington of Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility
of Subject re pass Agency tie-in and Agency assets. It will of
course be our job to assure Security that Subject is not knowledgable
and will entail a minimum of risk to transport and to resettle in
Mexico. In view of this concern, all arrangements offered for
DOB's consideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by
step denial or participation by the U. S. Government. In effect,
all items procured by Subject for resettlement could just as
easily be obtained on the European black market as well as from
this Government. Subject will in effect be briefed and taken by
German Station asset to obtain his documents ostensibly on the
black market. Monies due Subject would be withheld pending
destination arrival. The letter head and supporting sponsorship
documents to be used by him for ultimate employment in Mexico
would be prepared in such a manner as to be either legitimate or
forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely
handled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the
security aspect both to Subject and to this agency.
5. The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be
informed whether these arrangements in theory meet with the
approval of SR/DOB, and Office of Security. Mr. Kirkpatrick
was assured that Documentation aspects by TSD/IB could be
accomplished within one week upon authorization by SR/DOB.
With your permission Fred Kirkpatrick will proceed to affirm
Mexican employment arrangements for AEASPIC.

SUBJECT: Biographic Information/Case Officer Evaluation of
David TZITZÍCHVILI, alias David DURVARD
Biographic Information
.3
David 1ZITZICHVILI was born 20 December 1913 in Tbilisi, Georgia, where
he lived with his parents until 1921. Subject at that time moved to France
with his parents. Subject grew up in France and therefore speaks native
French (Parisian). Subject does not have French citizenship, however, and
must be classed as stateless. Subject earned the first part of his baccalaureat
at Breguet (electro-engineering), then entered the Foreign Legion at the
beginning of WWII. Subject fought in N. Africa until French capitulation in
1940, at which time he was discharged to return home to Paris. In 1943 he wont
to Germany as a voluntary worker. Ho worked there primarily as an industrial
electrician. While in Germany he assisted French officer P.O.W.'s to escape,
aiding them with cleverly falsified papers, stamps, cachets and even uniforms.
It is interesting to note that while subject attended school at Breuguet, he
also attended the Technicum for Cinematography. It was from these past studies
at the Tuchnicum that subject was able to develop techniques to apply to photo-
mechanical forging of documents, starps, and cachets. Subject was betrayed
to Germans, arrested, and sentenced to death for espionage. Subject was able
to drag this case out by implying the existence of a large British run net
of which he was a part. In 1945 he was liberated by the U.S. Army and returned
to Paris. Subject lived there in relative quiet until he, together with a war-
time friend, robbed a Paris bank of a sizeable amount of money. Subject and
accomplice were apprehended by the Surete on 11 July 1950, sentenced to prison,
but released some five years later for good behavior and on the basis of their

This office, with your concurrence, has agreed to lend the use of
this apartment for a period of about two weeks, effective 28 September

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
RKFERENCE:
Possible resettlement of SR/DUB Redsox Agent.
SR/DOB/60-2011, 25 July 1960
As a result of referenced memorandum and in line with con-
versations held between the undersigned and various members of SR/DOB,
the undersigned met with Mr. Gross, president of
the Gillette Razor
Blade Company in the Company's offices in Boston on 15 September 1960.
It was explained to Mr. Gross that the Agency had a resettlement prob-
lem and that they wished to invite the cooperation of the Company in
the resettlement in Mexico City of asset for whom we wished to find
employment.
2.
Mr. Gross, after posing several questions, agreed in principle
that the company would be willing to supply such agent with employment
in their Mexico City factory. However, he wished to discuss it with
the General Counsel and also to look into the laws of Mexico dealing
with the period of employment and what provisions there were for dis-
associating themselves with such man should he prove completely un-
satisfactory. It was then explained to Mr. Gross that the Agency would
like to be able to supply the agent with a reasonable facimile of a
Gillette letterhead together with a message which would offer him em-
ployment upon his arrival in Mexico City. Again' Mr. Gross approved of
it in principle, but requested that a copy of the letter be shown him
prior to its dispatch.
3. Upon return to headquarters, the undersigned talked with Mr.
Fred Kirkpatrick of SR/DOB and explained to him what uns needed to
satisfy the requests of Mr. Gross. Mr. Kirkpatrick explained that
within the last 48 hours a different division had evidenced interest
in the agent and were picking him up for their use so that there would
be no further need of the offer of employment from Gillette.
4. The undersigned will see Mr. Gross on 21 September 1960 to
explain the situation and thank him for his offer of cooperation.

SUBJECT: Mexican Resettlement Arrangements for AESENTINEL
Agent AEASPIC
1. At 1330 hours, 26 August SR/DOB case officer Fred
Kirkpatrick met with Clay Calendar and Jim Meyers of TSD/IB
and Frank Coalidge of Office of Security Contacts. At this time
a name, for AEASPIC was agreed on and then passed on to
Mr. Coolidge so that he in turn could ascertain the job possibilities
for AEASPIC's possible Mexican Resettlement. The name agreed
on for AEASPIC was Dimitrius I. Difonas, a Greek name to
fit his Greek passport. TSD/IB is ready to draft and arrange all
necessary Greek documentation for AEASPIC as soon as a job
offer through Mr. Coolidge's Office can be firmed up, which should
come about in early September. SR/DOB is to furnish TSD/IB
passport type photos with negatives. This has already been.
arranged for with Hal McCormick of this office.
--
2. SR/DOB case officer, Fred Kirkpatrick with Clay
Calendar of TSD/IB is presently engaged in writing a cover story/
biography to fit the new identity of AEASPIC. AEASPIC is as yet
unaware of any resettlement arrangements. It is hoped AEASPIC
can be utilized by some component of the DD/P, however if not,
then these resettlement will go through as per plan.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Biographic Information/Case Officer Evaluation of
David TZITZICHVIFI, alias David DURVARD
Biographic Information
David TZITZICHVILI was born 19 July 1918 in Tbilisi, Georgia,
where he lived with his parents until 1921. Subject at that time
moved to France with his parents. Subject grew up in France and
therefore speaks native French (Parisian). Subject does not have
French citizenship, however, and must be classed as stateless.
Subject earned the first part of his baccalureat at Breguet (electro-
engineering), then entered the Foreign Legion at the beginning of
World War II. Subject fought in N. Africa until French capitulation
in 1940, at which time he was discharged to return home to Paris.
In 1943 he went to Germany as a voluntary worker. He worked there
primarily as an industrial electrician. While in Germany he assisted
French officer P.O.W.'s to escape, aiding them with cleverly
falsified papers, stamps, cachets and even uniforms. It is interesting
to note that while Subject attended school at Breuguet, he also
attended the Technicum for Cinematography. It was from these past
studies at the Technicum that Subject was able to develop techniques
to apply to photo-mechanical forging of documents, stamps, and
cachets. Subject was betrayed to Germans, arrested, and sentenced
to death for espionage. Subject was able to drag his case out by .

implying the existence of a large British run net of which he wa
part. In 1945 he was liberated by the U. S. Army and returned to
Paris. Subject lived there in relative quiet until he, together with
wartime friend, robbed a Paris bank of a sizeable amount of money.
:
Subject and accomplice were apprehended by the Surete on 11 July 1950,
sentenced to prison, but released some five years later for good
behavior and on the basis of their war record. It is interesting to
note that while in prison, Subject invented a machine for making
cardboard boxes. This machine was actually built for one of the
prison administrations and put into operation at the prison factory.
Upon discharge from prison in December of 1955, Subject lived,
worked and was paroled to his brother in Gap, France. It was while
there that Subject was contacted by this agency and subsequently
brought to this country for use as one of two agents for Project
AESENTINEL.
Subject is presently residing in his Washington, D.C. apartment and
is readily available for any interviews.
Subject is engaged in his safe office in several technical gimmicks
which could be of value to this Agency. Two of his ideas have been
passed forward to TSD for development/exploitation. TSD has
expressed interest in another of his ideas, the plans for which have -
just been completed.
Alien Affairs Staff of Immigration/Naturalization has extended
Subject's backstopped residence status until 20 October 1960.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Personnel for Contingency Force
1. There is presently in the Washington area an individ-
ual who appears to be suitable for the JMARC Contingency Force.
The undersigned was at one time, Case Officer of subject and
believes that he is readily adaptable to the program. Subject
is a Contract Agent of SR/DOB who was trained for a specific
black mission into Russia during 1959. His nationality is
Russian, however, he is now stateless and prior to being re-
cruited, had been living in France. Subject's background appears
to
qualify him as he has served in the Red Army, the French
Foreign Legion and in addition has received various training
including para-military, while under Agency sponsorship. Sub-
Ject is unwitting and has good non-B. S. attributility.
2. SR would like to see Subject utilised in some capacity
as he represents a large investment in time, training and money.
SR now has nothing for subject as his intended mission was
scrapped prior to dispatch because of the then forthcoming
visit of KRUCHEV to the U. S. Also, subject's resident permit
will expire in October at which time, unless he is continued
on contract status, he will be re-settled in South America.
3. Attached you will find Bl and Case Officer evaluation

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, OS/Allen Affairs Staff
ATTENTION:
SUBJECT:
Mr. Pennington
Change of Living Quarters, Case of ALASPIC,
CI/OA No. C-73532
1. Background:
Subject was brought to the United States via HBRAINBOW
flight on 20 April 1959 for training preparatory to dispatch on a black
mission into the USSR as a member of a REDSOX team. CI/OA
Division approved (No. C-73532) on March 1959. This mission
has been postponed as of 17 June 19oe.
2. In view of the effort and expense devoted to the recruit-
ment and training of AEASPIC, SR Division has deemed it worthwhile
to give Subject certain ilmited additiona: training prior to operational
utilization by another component of the DD/P. To facilitate this end
it is requested that subject, towards the end of July, 1960, be
permitted to be moved to an SR/DOB safehouse on the outskirts of
Washington, D. C. Subject will remain there unti: final disposition
of his case. Although Subject has conducted himself in an exemplary
manner re his personal habits and sease of security, final disposition
of Subject can be better accomplished in a more controlled installation.
3. It is anticipated that final resolvement of the case of
AEASPIC: 1. e. operational utilization by another component of the
DD/P or resettlement, will be accomplished by 20 October 1960,
the date approved by OS/Alien Affairs Staff whereby AEASPIC can
legally romain backstopped in the United States.
4. It is further requested that AEASPIC be permitted to
continue to spend occasional week-end free time unescorted within
the limits of the greater Washington. D. C. area.
5. Subject will continue to be advised and guided by an
SR/DOB Case Officer re Subject's personal life and habits.

SECRET
MENORAATICH FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT Discontinuance of Project AESEMINEL for 1940'
23 June 156
1. On 17 June 1960, SP/pop was informed telephonically by
Quent JOHNSON, CON/G (Acting Chief SR/Div.) that Project AESENTINEL
would-not-be-carried out this year (1760).
2. The foasibility/practicability of carrying out this project
at a later date would of course depend on the line of United States
policy vis-a-vis countering the Soviet throat.
3. After due consideration, on/in has taken steps to temurate
one of the two ABSENTINEL agents, ARNUTHER/3. As regards the other
ament, AAC, it is felt that he could be of definite service to
this Agency in some similar capacity. This office is presently engaged.
in finding a job for AMC.

abstract in this respect. Generally,

he has always regarded his society, through his disappointments and
mortifying experiences, as wicked and selfish in its majority. Since
he felt society was selfish and mean, he expressed his dissatisfaction
in the form of aggressive and destructive behaviour. Apparently Subject

appointment that there was no Santa Claus.

However,
At first Subject felt his disillusionment was unique and peculiar
to his particular life experience, but he soon discovered that his dis-
content was characteristic of others. He experienced this fighting
attitude within himself and he reflected it in his non-conforming be-
haviour.

The mother was apparently a marked conformist who insisted that Subject

behaviour problems and because she did not advise him of what she was
dɔing and got him to a psychiatrist on a subterfuge, and because Subject
did not agree with the psychiatrist's conclusions, he did not benefit
by this experience. This indicates to us that in handling Subject it

words he is motivated to helping others in order to obtain love and

of his motives.

he was too young to understand it. However, he feels he revolted against

13. When his father and sister returned to Georgia, Subject was driven
to despair by the breaking-up of the family. The death of his mother and
the departure of his father and sister was quite a threat to his security.

Paris, 24 March
Hi Hid,
I hope that unlike myself you received my letter. Since the mailing of the
last letter a sensational event occurred in the family. A fourth daughter for
Atch, Sophie, born on March 13th. As you asked me, I sent them your address and
my congratulations.
Yesterday Loulou came by for a few minutes in the afternoon to give us some
very bad news. His father's condition is very bad. We are afraid it is a tumor
of the lung. Unfortunately, when one says tumor, one often means cancert I hope
to God that I am mistaken. Little (eligible) the cousin of Ramaz had a fine boy
named Christophe; and that's the latest news!
The children should write you every day, but if you want to chew them out,
here is Nina's address: Mme. Monestier, 159 Bd. Auguste Elanqui, Paris 13.
Nelly has been working since last Monday in a very stylish and terribly
expensive little shop. The job of sales clerk seems to agree with her.

He tried to hold his father back and even threatened him that because
a French law according to which a foreigner must pay his taxes before he
leaves the country the father ran the risk of being arrested. When he
told this to his sister, she became angry with him and replied that the
father was mature enough to act as well as possible. Subject B attempt
to prevent his father from leaving was conflictual for him because it.
represented an interference with his father's desire and project. This
experience taught him that when his father had taken a decision, he would
carry it through at any cost. As it happened, the result was the dis-
integration of the family. If Subject found himself in the same
situation today, he would act in exactly the same way
The father apparently returned to Georgia because he wanted to
die in Georgia. Subject feels that his father was doing something important
to realize his objectivity or to achieve his purpose. However, he feels
his father accepted defeat by returning to Georgia to die. The mother
did not go with the father and apparently was at her wits end after the
father left. Subject regards his mother as the axle of the family and
when he lost her through suicide, he feels she deserted him.
15. Subject's sister followed her father to Georgia out of a spirit
of affection and sacrifice. She felt that her father needed her and
Subject feels she was a tributary of his mistakes. The sister has a Ph.D.
in languages and taught courses in school. At the time of Stalin the
children would say. "we have done this and that thanks to Stalin" and she
would reply "you are individuals and you have done this or that without
Stalin." As a result she was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.
with the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and got her job back.
16. The sister's husband returned to Russia also and Subject believes
that because he had served in the German army he may have been sent to a
concentration camp. He feels the intellectual level of the brother-in-law
is lower than that of the sister. The brother-in-law apparently has an
inferiority complex. He emigrated to France at a much later date and
apparently could not adapt himself and regretted having left Russia.

Paris, March 25, 1960
Dear Eduardo,
"
Everybody was very happy to hear from you again. You know that Mind and
Mama have already written you as wall as, undoubtedly, Nina and Nelly. Therefore,
I'm the very last to write you but that doesn't mean that I don't think of you.
It's almost a year since you left. Time passes rather quickly in spite of
everything. Everybody must have already told you the most important news. So
much the worse if I talk nonsense.
Last August 15 I went to meet Titi in Algeria. We returned together early
in October. A whole year passed without our seeing each other, but with letters
every day, and we found each other as if we had parted the day before, or almost.
It was funny to see Titi exercising his functions as a second lieutenant with a
section under his orders. What a pleasure to find myself with him there. Now
when Bebert and company speak of military service I can join them. The life of
an officer's wife is not so bad. One is spoiled! The first month we were at
the sea shore. Since I love the heat this was just the thing for me! Titi left
every morning at 5 o'clock to join his section 25 km from the place where I was
staying and returned only at 4 o'clock in the afternoon; _ the weeks passed
quickly except for the beach -- and still we could not go very far because of the
guerrillas! In short, apart from going out to lunch, I stayed, so to speak,
shuttered up in my room waiting for the return of my lord and master. I tried
to go swimming alone, but the city and the beach were full of soldiers and I gave
up quickly. You cannot imagine, I think, what it's like to eat alone as a woman
in a restaurant dining room full of soldiers. I did not dare to raise my eyes
from my plate and, to feel looked at while eating makes you become clumsy. Hardly

any women except some middle-aged ones who give me side ways glances. There
was plenty of youth but then too they looked at me like à China doll. That's
a
enough for my "military service".
Titi went back to the school of fine arte, he's coming along fine. Unless
someone offers him a wonderful position he will continue at the school. It will
be very long! He also works for an architectual firm. Pinally you know th
-procedure having almost been in it yourself, we are looking for an apartment.
We would like to have a home of our own. Certain people don't understand dy
we want to leave la rue Cabanis since there's enough room there. First of all
there isn't that much! We have to qua cp for the bath room; if Titi wants to
T
walk around in his shorts he can't do it (it's not that he is accustomed to doing
this sort of thing) and the people can hear everything that's going on in the
room. And then again it's very understandable that we want to have a place of
our own which we will furnish as we like and where we will live as we like. To
spend a full day in bed or to eat at one o'clock in the morning, etc.—and then,
too, there is also a little friction between Mama and me. I'd like to shake her
up. If you can do it by letter don't hesitate. She's getting bitter how can she
do otherwise. She does nothing or next to nothing and she's letting herself go.
She could be so cute if she did what's necessary to get thin, and despite her
45 summers she's still well-built. What she needs is a man to take care of her,
to take her out and pull her out of her comatose or almost comatose state. I
shake her up often but as for me I am abrupt and sometimes I say what should not
be said. I'd like to find her a part-time job, something pleasant which would
cause her to get out, take a walk see people, etc. Evidently the house is leas
gay than previously and, nevertheless, we are still here. What will it be like
when only Nelly will remain who is hardly ever here because she goes out with
Ramas. And then there's another thing; people criticise Mama because they see
her with nothing to do - I allow myself to criticise, but I refuse to hear

conforming. He has not distinguished himself in any extraordinary fashion
and Subject unconsciously compares himself with his brother. It is likely
that he and his brother were rivals for the mother's affection and,
whereas Subject feels that his brother is jealous of him, it is likely
that Subject is Jealous of the brother's accomplishments. He feels that
whenever he succeeds his brother is Jealous. Subject is also identified
with his brother in a complex and interesting way. For example he feels
that both he and his brother .love the same type of women. He is not able
to say much about his brother except that he is kind, somewhat vain, and
that he is fond of his brother. However, it is likely that his brother
may have been indirectly instrumental in Subject's recruitment. It may
also be that his brother regards Subject as "Peck's bad boy" or the black
sheep of the familyand is interested in
him as regards
accomplishment or success.
Spasoning
18. Subject was the baby of the family and still is. Whereas he
was born in 1918, his brother was born in 1916 and his sister in 1915.
Subject was more expressive of affection, particularly for his mother,
whereas his brother was more timid, shy, and independent. When the
brother saw Subject getting the mother's attention, he tried to replace
Subject. This sibling
This sibling rivalry may continue to date, for example, the
brother learned that Subject was seeing a girl whom he knew. The brother
advised the girl to leave Subject alone.
19. Subject denies he is jealous of his brother. He admits his
brother has been successful but in his own sphere. Subject's new found
philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been unsuccessful, but
to try to explain why he has not. In other words he seems to be motivated
to obtain greater knowledge of himself.
20. Subject does not consider himself as a Georgian; this is of no
importance to him. He regards the flight from Georgia as a defeat and as
a loss of the motherland which he has never accepted. He feels he was a
Georgian as a child but the most important aspect is that he feels he was
defeated by the necessity of the family's flight from Georgia. He offers
as an analogy the fact that he was committed to prison; this was a defeat
for him. In other words he was not bothered by the prison life but by the
fact that he made a wrong calculation in taking on a bad associate and con-

is disappointed in his mother because he feels he loved her but she de-
serted him through suicide He feels she sacrificed herself completely
for the children and that she killed herself because she no longer knew
how to distribute love and care. Subject began to lose regard for his
father from the time he realized that his father was not giving his
mother affection However, he identifies with his father in the respect
that both never achieved anything significant and that they both may have
disappointed the mother. Subject misses his mother's love and he feels
his life was broken up when she died. He found himself completely alone
and all his illusions disappeared. He tried to find affection through
others. He feels the need for affection is a big part of himself but
on the other hand "I am a complicated person."
26.
Subject claims he has learned the difference between a man and
a woman: This is likely to have a good deal of meaning to him, particularly-
as regards his relationship with his mother. He regards women as allogical
and to be determined by a psycho-feminine education. This is enough to
tip us off that he should not be exposed to handling by females.
27. Subject claims he has learned from his personal experience in
life rather than from the experience of others. In other words he has
educated himself in the school of life and has derived little from the
actual formal school situation. For example, he claims his mother's
opinions had importance only at the time she was rendering her opinions;
thereafter they were not influential as far as he was concerned. This
may be important as regards training. It is likely that he would prefer
to proceed with the task in actuality rather than to learn about per-
forming the task through the experiences or training of others.

mobilization into the French army, but he felt the authorities took an
awful long time to make a decision in connection with him. Because of
this, he joined the Foreign Legion and left immediately for North Africa
feeling that thus he was becoming a member of a famous unit and at the
same time fulfilling his obligations toward the French military service.
In the beginning he was satisfied but later he was of the opinion that
France was an incoherent mess, and he bitterly regretted that he had
become acquainted with people who obviously did not know what they wanted.
This experience did not have a great influence on his character except
that it expressed a profound dislike for irresolute persons. This in-
dicates that Subject is an impatient fellow who desires immediate action
as regards his interest He is impatient with postponement and unless he
is dealt with promptly, he may satisfy his interests elsewhere. However
in the current instance he has no alternative and he is forced to go along
with normal procedures which he may regard as a waste of time, but will
accept..
29. Subject feels that he married because he regarded marriage as
necessary to build a family and to make a home. He feels his marriage was
a mistake because, even though he understands the value of the principles
involved, principles which were inculcated by his father, it is ridiculous
to marry just for the sake of principles without the necessary sentiments.
He feels that at the time he was merely abiding by precepts of his father
without thinking of the possible consequences. However he soon discovered,
in fact, a family did not represent anything at all, and that creating the
family was aggravating the incoherence and the division of society. In
view point getting married meant building a wall around himself. It also
meant that instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all that he
obtained from the partnership was a
reflection of himself.
He feels that the so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He claims
that, sexually speaking, women are necessary but he fails to say why it
is necessary to build a separate world with it..
*30. As was explained above, the reasons for his marriage are connected
with his family education. He does not regard his marriage as a complete
fiasco. He regards his wife as very nice. He thinks he was nice, too.

until he saw that the end was near. For example, there was a great need

This véignette indicates that Subject has the developed capacity
con man and that he is capable of imaginatively talking himself out
of rather tight situations. This, of course, is an outstanding qualification
as regards the requirements of the project.
35. Subject attacked a bank in 1950. At the time he was married and
was the father of one child. He was working in a model makers shop and
although he was not well off, he was earning a decent living. However,
because of his love for risk and out of friendship for another fellow, he
agreed to participate in the bank attack. Apparently the other fellow
trusted Subject because he knew of Subject's war activities and he figured
that because Subject had been able to accomplish certain illegal activities
that he was quite capable of attacking a bank. The attack was carefully
planned. Because there were only two on the team they were compelled in
view of the smallness of his staff to give extra attention to their plan.
36. According to Subject he was close to this young friend who
solicited his financial assistance. At first, Subject felt that the other'

of conscience and asked himself the question "is it right to do harm by
robbing a bank?" Subject never felt that the two alone would be able to
attack the bank successfully. Consequently, they determined to knock
over a Jewelry shop first. At each point in the developments Subject
wanted to withdraw from the whole deal by saying "if my mother learned of
this, she would die." They postponed the job indefinitely. However, his
mother died in the meantime and his friend again approached him and told
him that now that his mother was dead, there was no longer such a danger.
Subsequently they knocked over the jewelry store.

37. Subject's chief motivation for such an activity appears to be
the following: (a) Friendship. Apparently Subject will do anything for
friend. (b) Action. Apparently Subject relishes novelty and excitement
and daring-do. Apparently he is a Jesse James type. (c) Emotional outlet
for success of planning Apparently Subject indulges himself in problem-
solving and obtains a compulsive satisfaction if his plans succeed.
In
other words, he s motivated to carry out such an action because of his
displaced interest in successfully engineering and accomplishing Job.
(d) Money. Subject apparently is not motivated for mater al reward. In
the case of the robbery his friend got 3/4 of the take and Subject got
1/4 Subject was content not to spend his money freely because his wife
might become suspicious
38. However, the friend returned after having spent his money.
Previously Subject had told him "you got your money for the marriage;
now leave me alone. However, the friend had not married and was now
desirous of robbing a bank in order to finance another intended marriage.
Subject agreed that this would be the last Job. They cased the joint very
carefully and then committed the act. The other fellow apparently threw
his money around, was arrested, and squealed. The police came to

to the Spanish border. Subject was fleeing to the Pyrenees because he
had learned that his bank deal partner had been arrested and had talked,
and that the police were after him. Subject voluntarily admits that he
lost control over himself and that he had failed to plan in case he failed
and had to flee. He had not foreseen or prepared himself fur such a con-
sequence. If he were to find himself again in the same situation, he would
prepare an escape even if it were only necessary for the satisfactory
planning of the project.
.
39. However, the question which arises in this examiner's mind is
why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un
consciously wanted to get caught and to be punished in order to relieve
his guilt. If this is so, then important consideration should be given
to this aspect of Subject's personality as regards planning the project.

They got along fairly well with one another but did not live very com-

Although Subject has seen many things in his life and has had
many opportunities to become angry, he feels he has never completely lost
self control. He feels he has always been the master of his actions at
all times and that these actions could have been changed by his own volition.
45. If Subject has ever been ashamed of himself, it must have been
when his behaviour was wrongly interpreted by persons whom he loved or who
loved him.
46. Subject tends to become embarrassed and confused when certain
persons who ask or accept something from him display too much gratitude.
In other words, too large a dose of affection will unseat Subject despite
the fact that he continually solicits affection.
47. Subject has continually deceived and disappointed his mother
because every time she started him in a new school, she made him promise
he would behave nicely, but each time he was thrown out of school. He is
convinced she wanted this for his good and not for the satisfaction of
having a perfect child. However, it is likely that the mother's over-
solicitousness was actually compensatory for her basic rejection of
Subject. Therefore, she wanted him to be perfect so that she could love
him. Consequently, it is likely that she did things for him, but she did
things with him for herself. In other words, she wanted him to be perfect
so that he could be worthy of her love. He was not perfect, probably did
not obtain her love, and consequently is continually seeking the love of
other persons. However, he cannot accept this fact as regards his mother
and denies she did not act in his interest. One of his chief defenses is
denial, that is, simply assuming the attitude that such and such was not
true when he probably believes it was true.
48. Subject's actions are often impulsive and unreasoned. Such
irrational behaviour usually takes place with another person despite the
fact that there may be no particular tie or affection between him and the
other person. Subject is unable to explain why this is so and intellectually
realizes that any explanations which ne might offer are not sufficient
to explain such behaviour and his emotional state. In other words, this
man's impulsiveness and tendence to behave irrationally and to his own.

was jailed by the French police he was somewhat de-
pressed by the fact that he had greatly disappointed his close relatives
and because he was looked upon as a noisy and rash fellow rather than as
man capable of carrying out a crime
41
Subject feels he failed badly when he was arrested by the Germans
and also when he was arrested by the French. He feels these two failures

feels it is now up to him to take all the necessary precautions in order
to avoid the same pitfalls in the future.

42. There have been times in this man's life when he felt that the
entire world seemed to conspire against him and when everything seemed to
collapse before him. Yet he has always felt there were ways to get out of
mess principally by virtue of working. He continues to believe that
unless á man is so weak both physically and morally, it is always possible
for him to get back on his feet or at least to hope that this is possible.
Consequently, even when he was broke, Subject always believed there was a
possibility to fight and conquer. It is likely he will always have hope
and optimism.
43. As regards his philosophy on the two projects which involved
liberating French prisoners and the bank attack, he was betrayed by
another. Actually, however, he could not have become angry at these
persons because he felt his betrayal was unimportant. However, these
persons lost his esteem because he feels there are certain moral values
which he holds dearly, namely friendship. This would indicate that he is
more in contempt of himself for having miscalculated than angry with the
other person for having betrayed him. However,
However, Subject does not feel that
any of his mistakes, regardless of their size and consequence, have serious
consequences as regards his near or distant future. There is no question
that his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, but he
is optimistic and it is likely he regards this assignment as a golden
opportunity which not only permits him a chance of success, but does not
censure him for his past deeds. Consequently, he feels that to be dis
couraged about the future is nonsense for if there is a future, there is
hope.

out of place.
57.
It is Subject's experience that his friends love him for what
he is. He likes his friends as they are, probably because they are as
they are. The idea of attempting to change a friend is unthinkable for
him: He loves them for their bad points as well as their good points.
58.
Subject is an optimist but also a pessimist. He feels he will
never be able to reach his ideals because his material ideal (social
reform is so distant that he would need to lead many
order to attain it It might be unfair to call this man a pessimist,

he strikes the examiner as a true Frenchman he thinks and feels like a
Frenchman and is certainly not a Russian in his personality. It is likely
that he identifies the French authorities with the police. He cannot
tolerate rejecting attitudes. He is like an outsider who is looking in.
It may be he has the "sour grapes" attitude by which he feels that since
he cannot have what he wants, it is not too good anyway.
60. Subject is not a planner. Despite his interest in invention
and the fact that he has pulled off a number of capers, he is more of an
instigator, a leader, and an executor. In order for him to be successful
in future projects, it is necessary that someone else plan and then tell
him exactly what to do.
61. Subject is currently involved in the invention business which
he started alone. He is the owner and exploiter of several patents and
certain persons are financially and technically interested in his in-
ventions. He is faced with a problem at this time. He is involved in
the initial and preliminary phases with us and consequently is put on
the fence as regards his invention business, Furthermore, if he were to

In this respect he is
propelled by an uncontrollable force. This is an important point of
consideration as regards his utilization in this project.

these in an explosion. This occurred in Germany when he was involved in
the repatriation deal: After the bombing of Berlin he picked up among
the ruins an unexploded bomb of British origin and took it home to
salvage the explosive which he might use in various ways. While he wa
removing the detonator which was probably stuck in its receptacle, the
detonator exploded in his fingers. Subject does not regret the fact that
he tried to dismantle the bomb because he feels he has learned that one
should keep his hands away from certain things: The explosion occurred
so quickly that there was no immediate pain but the people around him be-
came panicky.
He remained cold blooded and gave the order to remove all
things which were there because the explosion undoubtedly alerted the
police. The police came and he explained that he had played with a
fountain pen which had burst. The policemen strongly advised him never
again to pick up objects dropped by the enemy. They took cognizance of
his declarations and went away. The Red Cross took care of his wounds.

Subject does not think he will be very different in the future
from what he is now. However, he feels his material situation will have
improved. He does not mean financially but socially. He naively hopes
that the workd w 11 .change and there will be no discrimination. He also
hopes to acquire, if necessary, a nationality in which case he will feel
he actually belongs to society. However, he feels that society is
anxious to stamp and label individuals and it may be that he would prefer
to be an individualist who is outside of society than to be a member of
society who is required to conform. Since this person lives in the
present, it is very difficult for him to imagine what his future will be.
51. Despite the fact that this man is motivated by rather vivid
ideals, he still strikes the examiner as a practical realist who thinks
and acts in a matter of fact manner. He has experienced a good deal of
life and he is quite sophisticated.

52 Subject feels that a friend would regard him as unstable,
affectionate, and a day dreamer
53.
Subject feels that a critic would say of him that the majority
of his commercial undertakings have brought results which are considerably
lower than hoped for. Consequently, he feels he is either an optimist
or a Joker or else his views on the possibilities of accomplishing
things are not very healthy.
54. In his defense he emphasizes that in his opinion the value of an
achievement does not consist of its spectacular magnitude or in its
multiplicity. For example, he feels it s not necessary to say good
morning”. 100 times in order to understand the meaning and purpose of
"good morning. Also he does not feel it is necessary to mass produce
a machine in order to fully understand its function. However, he realizes
that, commercially speaking, it is more rational to mass produce the
machine but the repitition does not interest him. In his opinion the
creative idea and the prototype have a much greater value and importance.
than the setting up of the factory which will popularize the prototype.
To illustrate his feeling further he is of the opinion that one single
thought from a great thinker appears to him to be much more valuable
than the millions of books which are published yearly.
55. In describing himself Subject reveals that he always tries his
hardest to keep his promises. He also feels that he sometimes appears to
talk somewhat rashly but he feels this is due to the fact that he thinks
fast and he is able to see quickly the components and the essence of a
problem in its various prospectives. He is able to rapidly synthesize.
In other words he learns extremely fast and he gets the point immediately.
He is so quick that he will understand what you are trying to say before
you finish the sentence.
56. Subject is unable to see himself in terms of what he would like
to be. In order for him to display himself, it would be necessary that he
would be another person altogether. However, he feels that, everything
relative, perhaps he should show more strength of character, be a little
more compromising, more realistic, and less sentimental. However, this
would imply that he would then find himself in an environment in which.
there was no room for sentiment in which case his personality would

62. This person will open himself up readily to an open personality.
He will be secretive with an inhibited or secretive personality. Con-
sequently, the best person to work with this individual is a direct,
expressive and visible personality.
63. This person's social drives seem to involve:
(a) General im-
provement of living conditions for everybody; in other words he is
humanitarian. He is not necessarily an activistic social reformer.
(b) Improvement of his own standard of living He has an inclination

desire to obtain oral supplies by incorporation. What this means is that
he will eat you up.
65. Subject reflects superior intelligence, is capable of abstract
conceptualization, and is able to deal in symbols.
66. Subject is a narcissistic character who feels that because others
don't love him, he needs to love himself. In other words, he is quite in
love with himself and acts accordingly.
67. Subject tends to rationalize and to offer socially acceptable
reasons for his individualistic behavior.

and for which he is not necessarily being paid. He acts out of principle,
with no special reason.
He helped the French prisoners despite the fact
that he had sympathy for the Germans. However, his sympathy for the
Germans was based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in Germany
and he preferred that the Germans would defeat the Russians.

that they were suffering and because they were suffering, he wanted to
relieve them by helping them return to their country. Thus he was beat

which he likes. He understands the United States has political interest
but he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the
Americans. He is not looking for special compensation. Generally, he is
quite willing to do what is asked without rational reasons. In other
words, his motivation is typically emotional and is understandable in:

fact that people are treated as individuals rather than as numbers.
80. Subject's motives are genuine and are compatible with his
outlook on life. They are not necessarily original or sophisticated but
they are personal and therefore bona fide. Furthermore, Subject is really
on the shelf in Gap. He is controlled in his movements and is restricted
in his aspirations and consequently is unable to realize his freedom and
to develop himself as an individual. Consequently, the assignment
represents a unique opportunity for him to rise above his present re-
stricted level of existence.
81. Subject is a very sensitive person and he attaches great im-
portance to events of life.

self confident in his prowess but is insecure that others may not regard
him as adequate as he feels he is.
74 It is interesting to note that Subject participated in the
release of the 13 French prisoners not out of patriotie motives, but to
satisfy his taste for action If they were German prisoners, he would
have done the same thing. Actually, Subject admired the German army, had

quite paradoxical but understandable in terms of the Subject's personality.
His emotionalized ideals are not defined in terms of politics or
nationalities, but are determined by a vague desire to help others who
need it. This combination can mislead him and get him into difficulty;
for example, his accomplice in the bank robbery.
He is a non-conformist.
75. Subject is a rank individualist.
However, he realizes he must cope with the community, must sacrifice for
the
of the community, and must not harm others. In this
regard it is unlikely that Subject has ever committed physical assault,
nor is it likely that he would in the future. No matter what the other
person is or represents to Subject, he is still a human being whom
Subject respects.
76. Although Subject is basically an exhibitionist, he is not
inclined to bragging or to exhibit himself in a transparent or patent
fashion. He is too sophisticated. However, he needs attention and is
likely to do things in order to get attention. This is what he did in
18 schools.
77. As was previously mentioned, Subject helped French prisoners
get back to France during the war. He thought it was the right thing to
do but did not do it just for France. He was paid for it but he gave
his money to help the prisoners. In terms of his hierarchy of motives,
it is likely that this person acts according to what he considers to be
right. He also expresses self pride in doing the outstanding, the difficult,

Another important characteristic is his curiosity and his interest
latatic
Another interesting proclivity is Subject's tendency to assume
blame for the mistakes of others even when he is not necessarily guilty.
As a child he was gifted but undisciplined and an unsuitable student
who couldn't concentrate and adapt to the school situation. As a result.
he was always in trouble but, more interestingly, he was always glad to
assume responsibility for the anti-social actions of others. Whether
did this for masochistic reasons or because he wanted to obtain the
approval of others for whom he sacrificed is difficult to determine:
What is true, however, is that he will submit himself for punishment
even though he has not done wrong. He may do this out of friendship
in order to have others feel greatful to him. He has the attitude he
should be punished for doing wrong, but should not be degraded for doing
right. Subject has always realized that he has needed help as regards
his emotional problems. He likes to be helped materially, not as and it-
self (?) but because material help involves the implication of moral
help. For example, a dentist in Gap offered to help Subject in his in-
ventions without asking for advantages. This means a lot to Subject. He
attaches small importance to money and he derives a tremendous satisfaction
out of helping others or being helped.
84. Subject reflects a tremendous vitality that has, in the past,
expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery, etc.
He feels he is not being used as he should and that there is a power
within himself, a creative urge of movement, a power of realization.
It is highly emotionally charged and he feels he is capable of doing much
more than he has in the past. Although he feels he is a complicated
person, he does not feel he is difficult to understand.
85. Subject likes to act intelligently and sensibly. He strives
for efficiency. For example, haxxxx if a person were to ask him to open
a window, he feels it is up to him to decide as regards the proper method.
The efficiency plus the results are his rewards. Consequently, he likes
practical work which involves an intellectual effort.

93. Subject is a stubborn fellow who does not like to be defeated
and he strives to conquer
94. Subject always looks for causes. He is no magical thinker but

Subject relies quite heavily upon humor for relief of tension

98. An important aspect of this man's personality and history would
appear to be his so-called accident proneness. He is like the cat in the
Disney film who, while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention
directed to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertantly
gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered
by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not arriving at the goal;
1.e., catching the mouse. He thereupon acts upon feelings of revenge on
the mouse for having caused his unfortunate accident. In addition, this
example signifies that Subject is likely to keep his eye too much upon the
goal and insufficiently upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. It
may be argued that Subject's philosophy in his past operations are related
in some manner to his lack of attention to such details. His history is
that of the unlucky cat who manages to get himself run over successfully.
99. This person can be quite discomposed by the surprise of un-
expected occurrences.
100.
Despite defeat Subject is able to pick himself up, figure things
out, start all over in a more systematic way, and continue in his pursuit
of his goal. Consequently, he does learn by experience. His mistakes are

86. Subject has a highly developed verbal intelligence and he is
able to amplify and elaborate on his ideas
87. Prior to the last session on the 10th of January Subject was
routinely contacted by the French police who were investigating his
activities in Paris at this time. As a result of this contact, he was
markedly apprehensive and pre-occupied with the seriousness of this visit
by the police and was not able to freely devote himself to psychological
analysis as heretofore. The important point here is that Subject is an
extremely alert and vigilant person. His primary moti is
self-preservation and he is likely to over-react and to become emotionally
upset with provocation. He needs the guiding influence of a more mature
and experienced person who is in control of the situation
course
88. Another important aspect of his relationship with us appears to
be the fact that he consciously or unconsciously feels he has "arrived"
and is acceptable to us. In other words he feels that perhaps a decision
has been made which is in his favor. This reflects his own desire to be
accepted together with his estimation of the situation.
89. This individual, despite his past exploits, is not necessarily
a hostile person. In other words he will not do harm nor will he hurt
others who are weaker than himself. He will act out of exigency but he
will deliberately avoid being sadistic or wantonly cruel.
90. For some reason Subject exhibits a marked degree of loneliness
and isolation at this time. He seems to be seeking companionship.
91. Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research, but
as regards the execution of an operation he prefers to be with someone or
part of an organization. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is
alone and that others had been unreliable in his past. However, if it is
necessary for him to work with two or more individuals, he will accept it.
92. Subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his
size and strength but he denies he has feelings of intellectual inferiority.
He depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical. "I have
no fear of an elephant if I have a gun.”

is seriousness. One of the chief motives is his
curiousity. He seeks the unknown but when he approaches the unknown; he
experiences a certain feeling which he recognizes as a threat to his
emotional security and he is ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing.

Immediate reaction is to turn around and go away without having solved
the problem. Consequently, he needs a person of greater intelligence who
is able to help him to evaluate the realities of his situation or
predicament. It must be kept in mind that his self-preservation is
stronger than his desire to solve problems.
102. Subject is likely to be loyal to a superior and may even be
critical of himself in relation to the superior. In other words, he would
like to be as useful as possible in order to express his loyalty, but may
feel inadequate in that he requires the pretection of his superior.
103.
This person puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or
reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not
impressed or motivated for glory symbols. If he were to accomplish an
outstanding feat, he would not want a medal all he would want was a
remark from an important figure to the effect "well done, thank you.”
He feels it is sufficient only for him to know he has done well.

104. Subject will attempt to assume leadership on the team but
it may be that if his partner is superior, he would be a better follower
than he would be a leader of a less adequate person. He is more of a
dependent than independent person in terms of his inter-personal relation-
ships; furthermore, he acts on sentiment and impulse and consequently
his judgment is questionable. This would indicate that he would work.

Tutorial Seeret Writing
DATES. TRAIRED
2-4 November 1960
During the three-day period WIROGUE received same six hours training
"
in the operation usage of Secret Writing, covering the specifics of his
ents of the two S
two SV systems assigned for his operation. The
insta
English
vas given-
given in an AP safehouse and was presented entirely in
2. In consonance with his own requirements the agent was given a
triefing in the principles and practices of SW as a clandestine means of
communication in covert operations,--plans at this writing envisage the use
of El only for emergency commo. It was repeatedly emphasized that the
success of an SW letter depends 50% upon the unobtrusive "normley" of the
open text and 50% upon the preparation of the SW text itself.
3. Terminal Evaluation
WIROGUE demonstrated that he could adequately prepare letters
bearing a carbon-type secret ink which would meet operational require-
ments. He is a very meticulous vorker and possesses a high degree of
manual dexterity--ambidextrously, yet!
bi He quité adequately mastered the development procedures for his
assigned receiving system.
4. The agent's training specifically covered the following:
8. Writing techniques with a carbon-type ink
b. Search development of BW
C.
Standard defense measures for carbon-ink vriting
:
a.
Use of glancing light in defensive and offensive examination
for SH
e.
Relative placements of the SW and overt texts on the lettersheet
:
f. Discussion of cover letters and indicators.

operational supplies passed to the Instructor by SAB vare issued
to WLAOGUE at the completion of the training.
CI/CB Reflections:
WIROGUE in the opening phases of the instruction indicated (from
sense of modesty, I presume) that he was completely unfamiliar with 8.
During training sessions the caliber of his questions, observations and even
of some of the sters in Sw technique which he independently suggested for

ABSTRACT
i
The plans and development of the WIROGUE project have reached a point
summation of the progress made and the plans for the future is in
At this writing it is anticipated that WIROCUR/1 will be on the
Loopoldville somme on first of December
whareby
order
2. WIROGUE/1 had originally been recruited in Europe for a REDSOX operation.
He was flown to FBIRDE "black" and underwent an extensive training program.
This included survival, mall arms and other similar type FM training. After a
year of such training the project failed to materialize, as a result subject was
preparing for resettlement in South America. The AF/Division took interest in
MIROGUE/1 and after an assessment decided that with his peculiar background,
talents and general makeup he could effectively be utilized along the lines
cited in reference A. On 21 October 1960 the case was transferred officially to

3. Since that date to the present, every effort has been made to paycho-
logically orient WIROGUE/1 for this assignment and to prepare him operationally
for its fulfillment. To insure the security of the operation, prevent any
identification with ODYOXE and/or KUBARK, and to preclude any unexpected
uncovery of VIROGUE/1's past which would associate him with his pro-KUBARK life,
a number of basic steps vere taken. These veres

Reason for termination:
Subject's noor performance and lack of operational security coupled with his
possible arrast by the Congolese authorities necessitated the removal from
the area of WINOGUE/1. Once this complished there was little or no
possibility to continue the project.
Effectiveness of project:

En route to Annick Friganza, changed his mind and returned to the rendezvous

Georges VI rendezvous (which is understandable considering the hurried circumstances
of the previous parting when the rendezvous was discussed), had waited perhaps 1/2
hr. and then decided he had better check the Georges V. On arrival at the Georges V
Restedt immediately recognized him, approached the taxi which Subject had left and

ordinary attentions, ordered the taxi around the corner, paid him his due fare, and
re-joined Rostedt. It was at this moment that Friganza returned on intuition.

Subject and to put to Subject several questions concerning willingness and the job.
After lunch Friganza and Rostedt decided that under the circumstances it would
be advisable to keep subject in Faris rather than risk his arrest travelling between
Paris and Ambert or returning to Gap to have his carte d'identite, revalidated.
Accordingly while Rostedt spent the next 1 hrs. or so with Subject, Friganza

Project WIROGUE (Approval)
AF - Leopoldvil, 75
+
1. The attached project, originating in AF
Division, is presented for approval for the period
1 November 1960 through 31 October 19st. The purpose
of the project is to establish a long-term deep-cover
asset in the Republic of Congo in the form of a foreign
national contract agent who will open a small business
in Leopoldville.
2. Authority is requested to obligate $17,250
from the DD/P-AF Division budget: $13,250 in fiscal year
1961 and $4,000 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the avail-
ability of funds. The funds requested included $9,000
salary and allowances: $1,250 travel expenses: $5,000 op-
erational loan; and $2,000, operational expenses.
3. The attached project outline sets forth
the background and concept of the project and is accompa-
nied by a fiscal annex. The agent, WIROQUE/1, is a state-
less person who was recruited and trained for a REDSOX op-
eration involving a black mission to the USSR under Project
AESENTINEL. That project was postponed for a year and in
June 1960 was abandoned. In the interim MIROGUE/1 has been
working with TSD at a covert site in cataloging information
from East German documents and developing or improving
methods for picking locks. WIROGUE/1 was born in Georgia,
USSR, in 1918. He spent the period from 1922 until World
War II in Paris, France. He served in the French Foreign
Legion, volunteered in 1942 for work in Germany and spent
considerable time in German prisons and concentration camps
as a result of being arrested for forgery. He has a prison
record for burglary in France subsequent to World War II.
He has had schooling and experience in mechanical engineer-
ing, as a camera technician and in commercial photography.

The agent was first contacted in October 1958 as a result of a lead
from AEPADDLE. Ee was recruited in April 1959 by the Frankfurt Station,
for a REDSCX operation. There had been some difficulty in the initial
recruitment, since it could not be resolved as to whether or not he
could work amicably with another agent in the proposed operation.
ter psychological assessments and LCFLUTTER examination, it was decided
to recruit subject. He was assigned the crypto AEASPIC. In April 1959
subject was brought to the DCB, via a HBRAINBOW Tlight. Subject was

the interim he was assigned to TSD, where he was employed at a covert
site, involving the cataloguing of specific information from East
German Documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for
picking locks.
On 17 June 1900, it was decided that Project AESENTINEL
would not be carried out. On receipt of this information SR/DOB en-
deavored to place subject elsewhere, where his training would be bene-
ficial. The African Division expressed interest and had agreed to uti-
lize him as a result of assessments. During the period from the 21st
of October until dispatch, subject will be carried on OCA funds.
2. Security Flaps
For
A. During the latter part of WW II subject was arrested by the Ger-
man police for forgery. He was not unduly held by the criminal investi-
gation branch of the police but passed on to the Gestapo. Subject was
brought to Berlin where he was interrogated for several months at
Gestapo Headquarters. Later he was tried and sentenced to death.
some unknown reason he was moved from jail to jail, concentration camp to
concentration camp. While in prison he resorted to a "ruse de guerre"
and told the Germans his father had invented a motor that could run
without gasoline. He offered to draw the designs of the motor and was
able to stall long enough to be liberated by components of the advan-
cing U.S. Army.
B. In 1946-47 subject and an accomplice committed two robberies of
jewelry stores.
C,
In 1949 subject robbed a bank of 1,000,000 Fr. fr. His accomplice
was apprehended and shortly thereafter confessed, implicating subject.
Subject was apprehended while attempting to cross the Franco-Spanish
border. He was sentenced to ten years in prison of which he served
only five, receiving parole for good behavior. Upon release in 1955, he
was exiled on parole to Cap, France where he worked as an architect.
D. To our knowledge thereis no indication that subject is known to
be associated with KUBARK.

anticipated to take several months. Hence he will become operational in early
1961. However, it is reasonable to expect that the station will undoubtedly
place him in covert role much sooner. Nonetheless, we do not anticipate any FI

8. Timetable:
His covert training will be completed by 15 November 1960. He will be
briefed on his cover story, documents, contact instructions, etc., 15-18 Novem-
ber 1960. On/about 18-20 November he will be flown black to West Germany.
There he will spend 5 to 7 days to familiarize himself with Germany, receive
his final briefing and obtain a visa, then depart for Leopoldville arriving o/a
1 December in Leopoldville. Once there he will require 1-2 months to look over
the business possibilities and establish himself.

Subject does not know that he is working for KUBARK. He knows that
he is connected with some intelligence organization, e.g., ODIERX. He
does not know anything about KUBARK organization nor its modus oper-
andi.

there, making his own way to Leopoldville.
There he is to establish a small repair or photo shop. This would pro-
vide a natural reason for his CO or anyone to visit him under the guise
of overt business. Longer meetings would be held clandestinely as
determined by his CO. All communication channels will have to be worked
out in the field. However until contact is established, a secure emer-
gency channel with Headquarters is being established. This channel is
to be used only in the event subject finds himself stranded or for
dire emergency.
5. Security:
•
The agent is very security conscious and will follow any direction
in the interest of secuirty ·
6. Control:
On this point here are several aspects for consideration. He is
under contract to us and although he is not too interested in money, he
does enjoy its benefits and realizes that it will continue so long as
he does a good job. The more important built in control is the fact
that he will be under false documents, and being stateless, he is com-
pletely dependent on KUBARK to perpetuate his quasi legal existence and
to eventually legalize his status. Added to this is the control which
stems from the prospect of resettlement in another country. This would
give him status as a citizen. Realizing these points, subject is more
than willing to play ball with us.
7.
Prior contacts with any security service:
As stated in 3B (2) above, the only brush subject has had in the
past was with Gestapo and French police. These were prior to his re-
cruitment by KUBARK and were not as a result of I.S. activity.

Subject has undergone plastic surgery in order to change his appearance,
also a toupe was made to further assist in the changing of his outward
appearance. This action was designed to preclude any possibility of
recognition by former French associates, particularly since he is to
pass as an Austrian. The cover facility, as stated, will offer access
to all classes of people, it will provide a natural means for contact,
and will permit subject to make trips under the guise of business tra-

.
WIROGUE/1 will be required to set himself up in business. The
dearth of qualified technicians will help facilitate his opening an
establishment. WIROGUE/1 will need capital to set himself up, buy
needed supplies and have working funds. For the purpose of providing
him with funds to establish and open this cover business, we will ad-
vance him $4000.00 as an operational loan, to be secured with a non-
interest bearing promisary note. An additional $1000.00 will be held
in reserve, should he need more money. Ostensibly it will represent
his own savings, and will be deposited in a Swiss bank. Provision will
be made to pay this money back from his profits. After the loan is
paid off, WIROGUE is to keep the profits he may make.
He will initially transfer $1000.00 to a bank in Leopoldville. We
are certain that he will not abscond with the funds, since his docu-
mentation will be false and his pay and allowances total $8500 per
annun, he would therefore stand to lose a great deal more than he would
gain.. :
Being a contract agent, there is ample control if he shows signs of
spending too much time in the pursuit of profits from his cover business.
His salary and allowances will be paid in part to a personal account
in Switzerland (separate from his business account). This money will
ostensibly also represent his savings. The remainder will be paid
directly at the station.
C. Security Estimate:
WIROGUE had been recruited in France and exfiltrated black from West
Germany to SR/DOB. He has had no known I.S. connections in the past. He
will be surfaced in West Germany and will proceed to Leopoldville. He
will be documented as an Austrian.
4. Background
'r
The need for various technicians to stabilize the chaotic conditions in
Leopoldville coupled with an urgent need for controlled assets in that city gave
rise to this project. WIROGUE's particular talents, experience, ability and
training open up a wide variety of possibilities.

FISCAL ANTIEK
Project WIRUGUR-LUAN
Purpose: The objective of this project is to provide a long term, deep cover
asset, a contract agent, WIROGUE/1, in the Republic of Congo and adjacent areas in
order to build a covert net in support of operational activities and to provide
an asset for utility support for KUBARK personnel under official cover. For cover
purposes, WIROGUE/1 will establish his own business, a small photo or repair shop,
which will give him a degree of latitude in movement and a cover for covert contact.
To assist WIROGUE/1 in establishing his business KUBARK will loan
him up to $5,000 on his personal notes, non-interest bearing and due on demand.
The initial loan will be in the amount of $4,000. An additional $1,000 loan will
be made when, in the opinion of the Chief, Africa Division, it is required and
necessary for the business to continue and operate.
Funding: Up to $5,000 in U.S. currency or the equivalent in foreign curren-
cies may be advanced to WIROGUE/1 as loans. The loaned funds will be passed to
WIROGUE/1 in a manner agreeable to Chief, Africa Division and Chief, Finance Divi-
sion. All funds loaned to WIROGUE/1 will be secured by U.S. dollar, non-interest
bearing notes payable to bearer on demand. Such notes will be prepared by or ap-
proved by the Office of General Counsel. It is anticipated that an initial $4000
will be deposited in a Swiss bank, ostensibly representing his own savings, by
KUBARK, Monetary Branch.
Accounting and Write-off: WIROGUE/1 will be required to sign receipts for
all funds loaned to him. Finance Division is authorized to accept these receipts
as a charge to expense and to set up the loans payable in a memorandum account
without a due date. The notes signed by WIROGUE/1 shall be transmitted to Finance
Division for safekeeping. Repayment of the loan shall be made from business pro-
fits. WIROGUE/1 will be required to submit quarterly income and expense statements
on his cover business and also copies of all tax returns filed in connection with
his cover business. A copy of all income and expense statements and tax returns
will be forwarded to Finance Division. It shall be the responsibility of the Chief,
Africa Division to determine when profits warrant payments on the leans and to ef-
fect such repayments.
→
For purposes of control and collection, WIROGUE/1 will be required
to sign blank checks on his Swiss and African business bank accounts.
