Ciron it disintegrated. Nevertheless, he said, he was able to keep in
contact with a few DRE people who are in Havana. He said details on the
DRE could be obtained from Manuel Salvat, but he did state that he belonged
to the DRE group headed by a brother of Diaz Lanz. This brother is still
in Havana. He said this group wants to engage in political assassination,
and has repeatedly requested that pistols with silencers be sent from
the United States.
