Official Activities

Our few references to LEXIV make it appear that he, like EELYAKOV and ANTYASOV,
with whom he seems to le vaguely associated, is a t ird echelon functionary who
probably performs a variety of administrative tasks in support of one or another
phase of the Embassy operations and might be in on-the-job training for a spe-
cialised joh as assistant to, at a guoss, SMOILOV. In early August, shortly af-
ter his arrival, he called a voman instructor at an o scuro local business school
and was told that he could come by for his grades the following week. (We infer
from another convera tim that HTVTIEV was a tending this school with him.).
LECHOV was also with ANITYASOV and BELIAKOV when AUUTIASOV was detained on their
way "back from the University" at the and of September. (Feet AUTYASW.) This
should indicate that he was principally occupied during the weeks after his ar
rival in aequainting himself with local business methods and comercial prao-
tices, and perhaps taking some further formal instruction. Otherwise, his ap-
pear nees in the traffic have been 11 ited to answering the telephone for both
KOLOMYAKOV and SAMOILOV in their absence (without making decisions or taking
any action) and, under the tutelage of LAZAREV before the latter's departure,
raking routine calls connected with ordering wine, repairing the movie projec
tor, and the like. He has also occasionally been seen driving one or another
of the Embassy automobiles, apparently filling in for one of the chauffeurs,
Private 'stivities
Our only information on LECIOV's private life is the fact that the ZHUKOVs moved
into the LEXNOV]' apartment (No. 4 at Industria Ho. 71) upon their arrival

Private Activities
Although we have no definite indications to that effect, there is a fair possi-
bility that LEONOVA is employed in some administrative or clorical position in
the Embassy, since she seems to be present in the Chancery area a good deel
during office hours and, without children, would not otherwise have a great deal
to do.
Our only information relating directly to LⱭNOVA occurs during a conversation
botaseen APA INOVA and MELNIKOVA on 26 Uctober in which AFARENOVA complained bit-
terly that LEXNOVA wa shirking har share of responsibility in preparing food
for the 7 November rese; tion. LEVA bad apparently failed to buy ingredients,
after being asked to do so, on the plea that she had not been told exatly what
kind of apples to cet aur where to buy them. AARINOVAS "KOMSOMOLTSI almmys
brag about being in the front line, but in actuality, bah FMLNIKOVA: "Yes,
when I was at their home, wo happened to discuss the reception, and Rita
(AUTYASOVA) caid, "Why should wo do the work for the reception?' I told her she
should be ashamed of herself. I work in the Embassy and hold out during recep-
tions and all holidays, and I don't complain. LEON VA claims she is not (oing
to do any shopping because she was not given the responsibility." APARUERIVA,
"What does she meant I met her and naid' 'Lara,
The caid she'd one over
Sunday and make a list of the things to be bought." MELNIKOVA: "And she didn't
COEG OVES. She was probably afraid of the work and the money involval. APARY-
ROVA: "How silly. I told her we would refund all œçenses.
Commont
We infer that LEONOV (and perhaps her husband as well) is a good KOMSOMOL and
may be ɑndowed with the aggressively impleasant personality which the Soviet
system somms to foster so often. As shown in our photo coverage, both she and
her husband have the appearance of persons who could be the wall-disciplined, up-
questioning, devoted Communists idealised in Soviet propagamla.

on 7 Hovember and the two couples lived together for about three weeks, when the
LEQNOVs moved into other quarters at Juanoatlan 80. (There were no indications
that the original arrangement had evor boon intended to be other than teŋ; orary
or that the subsequent move of the LOVE was due to friction between the two
couples.) This raises the suggestion that ZUKCW may be associated in some way
with LECHOV within the Embassy as wall, a yosgibility which is borns out to some
ertent by the fact that both habitually sinse and make calls from the same Re-
bacay telephones.

We cannot yet asseas LECHOV for operational purposes,

(S) (Gp-1) A Soviet Embassy official in Mexico City,
Nikolai S. LEONOV, is allegedly actively planning an insur-
gent movement in Latin America. LEONOV left Mexico for the
USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEY and CASTRO.
Credence is given this report by the publication of a photo-
graph of the three on 8 May in a Cuban newspaper. The pho-
tograph was purportedly taken during a recent meeting.
(S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV's
schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency. Cuba
would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for
covert distribution of arms.
(S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man
for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in simi-
lar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.
(S) (Gp-3) Another report from sources in Colombia
stated that pro-CASTRO ex-President CARDENAS planned to
call a meeting in Mexico City of "leftist bent", disgrun-
tled retired military officers from Latin American coun-
tries on the subject of insurgency. (DIA, 3 June 1963)

resest public statements admitting his long-time syspathies and asso-

thie "expose", it is also felt that LON:V's Kexiom background, dating
back to 1955 and including the incident played up by the Mexican press

ponsible position in the Soviet Embassy of Mexico will provide added
interest in the story. The Station will therefore attempt to obtain the
Mexican press accounts of the 1956 incident, updating this information
into a press article for exploitation as sarrested in reference,

be feasible to replay the original incident indicating the tie betagen

the scizion of Headquarters that it would be useful to cite a specifie

viewpoint us alleged action of Liv in planting" the card would still
not impair the replay of the wiginal incident.

LECNOV's contact with Samuel RAMOS as dispatched in DG-A-4386 (19 March 1956) was
reported again on 7 March 1358 when RAYCS called LECNOT and the two discussed a
chess tournament to which Soviet delegates were apparently to be invited. When
LED NOV asked from where RAMOS was calling, he replied from his home. RAYOS stated
he was nor back in class "at the University" and so "we won't be able to meet
at my house now." RANCS invited LETNG to one of the tournaments the following
week and also made arrangements to visit subject at the embassy to give him the
list of books "which we (want)..."
Unless LEONOV has something to do with consular affairs, we are at a loss to
explain the following LIMERICK reference. On 10 November 1955 a man identifying
Himself as "your friend, Col. CONZALEZ" asked LEONOV if he had found out about
some matter he had requested. It appeared that LEINOY had forwarded the "request"
to the USSR and that the "exican Arbassador to the Soviet Union was to notify
Col. GCXZALEZ, GONZALEZ stopped short after starting to ask what happened to
that matter, explaining it would be better if they got together and talked it
over. The two arranged to meet at the a bassy. At the beginning of the conversation
CONZALEZ, in recalling to LEONOV's mind who he was, stated, "He wore chatting about
this project which I have to present to the Presidencia about the use of the
waters from the Toluca volcao, Chinantecatl." The Cia. Exportadora e Importadora
Mexicana, S.A. (CEIMSA) had commissioned (NZALEZ to go to Chihuahua to see some
farmers and therefore he was not able to contact LECHOV earlier.
Other then the two preceding LIMERICK references, which in themselves are incon-
clusive, we have no indication that LECNOV is engaged in RIS activities.
There are vague references suggesting that the LECNOVs may be leaving Kexico in
April 1956.

lecture, two of the embassy wives remarked on how good LICNOV was. (It is known
that LEONOV has taken his turn at giving Political Information Class lestures.)
LEDNOV also appears to mjoy athletics –– he plays tennis, attends shooting
matches, arranges football games with the Caacha, and plays volleyball, He takes

Official Activities
LEONOV remains an obscure figure and although we assume he is employed in the
administrative section of the Chancellery, we cannot pinpoint his duties. He
has identified himself from time to time as the secretary to the Ambassador, has
been noted taking his turn as embassy duty officer and has taken hospital bedside
guard duty. During 1958, before the arrival of the regular administrative officer
Vladimir Ivmovich ZHUKCV, in November 1955, LSONCV was handling calls concerning
goods and services but was probably merely filling in, because of his facility
with the Spanish language, until ZHUXOV's arrival. In December 1954 APARINOV
asked one of the guards whether he had the keys to LECNOV's room in the embassy.
Since, during that time, we believe LEINOV was residing at Industria 71, it would
appear that LEONOV had a private office in the embassy, one which was apparently
kept locked when he was away. One or two other very vague references indicate
he might have something to do with communications work. Beginning about Hovember
1955 LE NOV began to merge as an interpreter and translator. He spent a good
deal of time with the Social Security delegation, with Soviet pianist GILELS and
with Soviet movie director ALEXSANDROV, each time appearing as the interpreter
or træalator. His recent association in January 1956 with the daughter of
Communist General Heriberto JARA also involved translation work. Other more
recent references make us begin to wonder now if LE HOV might not be connected
with the Cultural Section. During the last two months of 1955 he appeared to be
associated in work with MASTUKEVICH, director of the Soviet Embassy Information
Bulletin. In March 1956, when PAPOROV could not keep an appointment at University
City at the invitation of Mexican President RUIZ CORTINES, he asked that either
LEONOV, GUNDARKV or POPŮV keep the appointment. It is known that PAPOROV, OUNDAREV
and POPOV are all definitely assigned to the Cultural Section indicating further.
that LECNCV may be associated with that group. We, therefor, classify LEONOV as

2. LIMERICK reported that on 24 February 1956 one Samuel RAMOS contacted
Mikolai 8. LEONOV, who acts as secretary to the Soviet Ambassador in Maxico,
RAMOS told LEONOV "We are not going to meet at my house this afternoon but
at SALO)'s (which is at) Insurgentes 429-51 at the usual hour." LEONOV
replied that he thought he could get to the meeting at 1900 hours and sent
greetings "to the boys." RAMOS said "we have some books we want to order
through LEONOJ.
On the face of it, this conversation appeared to be quite unusual
and attracted the interest of this Station. Furthermore, it is known that
for years the Soviets have used the hours between 1900 and 2000 for meeting
alandestine or unusual contacts in Mexico.
3.
The following steps were taken to ascertain general information on
RAMOS and “SALEO”:
B. Station file record on Samuel RAMOS resulted in no clear iden-
tifications. There is a Samuel RAMOS who was listed in 1948 as
Rector of the School of Philosophy and Letters of the University..
LIESTHENITE ascertained that the address mentioned is occupied
by a female doctor named Renee SALGO Burger, allegedly of French
nationality, who operates a beauty parlor. This is confirmed in
the telephone book.
Files of this office indicate an ODENVY report that one Rense
SALGO was a member of the Hungarian club EMUNA in 1951. The files
also show that one Alejandro BURGER was a member of the club and
that he and Renee lived at the same address. The file further shous
that one andres SALGO was a member of the club and describes him as
a Commnist sympathiser.

LEONOV
page 51
It is reported by LIMERICK that LEVOVA gives some sort of instruction to
exbanay personnel and although it is not known just what type of lessons these
may be, we venture a guess that she toaches Spanish. During October 1955
