Mr. John R. Tunheim
Chair, Assassination Records
Review Board
600 E Street, NW
Washington, DC 20530
Re: JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
Dear Mr. Tunheim:
This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding
Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JFK Act.”
I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its
obligations to locate, review, and release "assassination
records" as defined in the JFK Act. The Agency's 2 September
1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's
Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my
judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency's
searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration.
.
As Director of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly
responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the
adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under
the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of
Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with
direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and
complete. There was no more appropriate signatory.
In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers
have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board
all relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do
not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from
the Board. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding.
I trust that this will meet your requirements.
Sincerely,
Cat
George J. Tenet

Attachment I
Universe and Scope of CIA Documents
Addressed Related to the JFK Assassination
Summary. This Attachment discusses CIA material
examined in order to fulfill the requirements of the JFK
Assassinations Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act). It
addresses the types of CIA documents found in the records of
earlier investigations, including that of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, and materials and files
recovered in response to searches conducted in 1992 and
thereafter. It discusses the process by which documents
became "assassination-related records."
Discussion. The Central Intelligence Agency has
provided large numbers of documents and materials over the
years in support of successive reviews and investigations
related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
We estimate that the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages
comprise the “CIA collection" of documents associated with
prior assassination reviews, including duplicates. In
addition, we estimate that in responses to the JFK Act, CIA
has reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents from the
National Archives, the Ford, Johnson, and Kennedy
Presidential Libraries and miscellaneous papers from the
National Security Council, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), the Rockefeller
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, and
the Senate Select (Church) Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.
The documentation exists in many forms, from original
contemporaneous material, such as field reporting from
overseas or analytic reports, to material generated
specifically as an Agency response to investigation
questions. The largest "CIA collection," as such, is
associated with the records of the House Select Committee on

Types of Questions for DA Records Briefing
March 17, 1997
P.1
Budget and Finance
1. In Cold Warrior (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly
controlled by Angleton and never audited by the usual procedures. According to
Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Angleton to run his own operations without
supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any, records of
CI operational expenses for the period 1959-63?..
2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for
Angleton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there
a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?
3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain
information on the allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or
DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of
information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?
4. What records are kept on disbursements to sources in the field? If, hypothetically,
LHO had received money from the Agency, what records would exist?
Personnel
1. What records are maintained on contract personnel?
Security
1. For the period between 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on
individuals or groups?
2. How are Office of Security records indexed?
3. What was the function of the Office of Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)?
Why were defector records kept in this component?

4. In the OS/SRS:mèmo of Oct. 31, 1960; written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file
numbers of several defectors are listed: "Robert Edward Webster, EE-18854; Lee
Harvey Oswald, MS-11165; Libero Ricciardelli, MS-8295; Vladimir Sloboda, MS-10565;
and Joseph Dutkanicz, MS-10724." What do the "MS" and "EE" file prefixes.designate?
How are these designations assigned?
5. Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (e.g. sources) to receive
access to classified information? What kinds of files are created by this process? How
long are these files maintained. For example, Clay Shaw was given a security clearance
and had access to, classified information based on his "responsibilities" as a source for
the Domestic Contacts Division (DCD).
6. Where are records that would describe liaison (etc.) cooperation or operations
between OS and allocated? How are these records organized?
7. Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located. For
example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?
8. How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which OS components maintained files on
Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?

and left an office during the same quarter they might not appear
on the staffing complement, 2, If an individual was TDY to an
office they would not appear on the staffing complement of that
office. 3) If an individual was being paid by their home office
they would not appear on the staffing complement of the outside
office they were supporting.
Question 3 - We have seen DO monthly operational reports
which contain information on the allocation/distribution of
operational funds. Are there other DO or DA records which
reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this
type of information from the early 1960s still be retrieved?
The DO operational fund records would contain expenditures
against a certain project or operation. However, according to
C/FSD the system that preceded the General Accounting System
(GAS) was RCA 501 (not sure what this contained) but in all
probability has been destroyed, would have this type of
information also. More information may have been recorded in 201
files similar to today's automated systems.
Question 4
-
What records are kept on disbursements in the
field? If hypothetically LHO had received money from the Agency
what records would exist?
According to the OFL Records Control Schedule station
accounting containing indigenous personnel are kept for 56 years,
station accounting not containing indigenous personnel are kept
20 years.
Personnel
Question 1 - What records are maintained on contract
personnel?
Responsibility for records maintained on independent
contract personnel was transferred to OFL o/a 1 October 1996.
Staff contract personnel files continue to be maintained by HRM.
Office Contract Personnel Files contain many of the same
items found in the staff Official Personnel File (OPF) --
application info, actions (Staff contracts only) clearance info,
secrecy agreement, etc., and also contract info (agreements,
amendments, terminations, etc.) A separate payroll file was also
maintained.
IC's - fee for task
Staff Contracts hired for job--not to exceed 5 years.
-
Contract files can be opened/maintained/retired in true
name, pseudo, alias or crypt depending upon the sensitivity of
the contract.

John
Thank you for agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to be held on Monday,
17 March, at 2:00 p.m., in 2006 IP Bldg. I regret the short
notice. As we discussed, the ARRB has asked for information
relating to the creation, transmission, and dissemination of
cables and your name instantly came to mind. Their specific
questions are:
1- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency
during the
1960-1964 time period?
Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD
(Development Products Division) at 1717 H Street or to the
Communications Center at “L” Street. In addition there
also was a Q building that received special traffic.
After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and
were processed in different areas depending on the
types of traffic.
Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor
for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs
would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the
Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat.
2- How did cables come in?
Messages came in from the field via the Brandy Station State
Channels or military channels.
3- How were they decrypted?
Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape)
or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.

Security
Question 1 - For the period between 1955-65, what was the
universe of files that Os had on individuals or groups?
OPS located information which describes the categories of……..
files created during this time frame but it is impossible to
state this is all inclusive:
General
-
Usually unsolicited correspondence of crank
variety and junk.
Security Research Staff
counterintelligence interest.
DCD contacts
-
possibly material of
-
persons who travel abroad and/or have
specific information.
Contractor Employees - industrial contractors with
collateral and/or SCI accesses
Miscellaneous - Includes publications, organizations,
intelligence services, etc.
Alien - Foreign nationals who were of interest
New Building
-
Persons involved with construction of
original Headquarters Building
Regular
GSA/GSI, etc.
-
Files which included staff employees, contractors;¨¨¨
Question 2 - How are Office of Security records indexed?
Prior to 1964 all index records were maintained on 3x5 inch
index cards. When the information was known, these cards
included names (primary, alias, telecodes), file numbers,
kin/relatives, location/residence, DPOB, citizenship, occupation,
polygraph number, reference source data, information codes,
remarks, SSN, sex, employer, and file retirement data. To locate
a file record, the subject of interest was searched in this card
system.
During mid-1964 these index cards with the exception öf
impersonal entities, were under conversion to a keypunch system.
The impersonals (companies, publications, intelligence services,
organizations, etc.) were maintained on cards until much later,
possibly mid-1970s. Aside form the subject name indices, the
Office of Security also indexed information of interest within a
file record. This information could include associates,
companies, publications, other government agency reports
Vinformation, etc.
TODAY'S INDEXING PARAMETERS ARE VERY LIMITED.

Budget and Finance

Question 1 In Cold Warrior Mangold refers to a CIA secret
slush fund which was tightly controlled by Angleton and not
audited by usual procedures. Did the fund exist? Was the fund
audited? Are there any records of CI operational, expenses for
the period 1959-63?
According to C/Financial Service Division (FSD/OFL) who
contacted a former finance officer who was a secretary in CI in
1957-60, to the best of their recollection CI did not have their
own finance officer. C/FSD also talked to another officer during
that era who did not recall that CI was one of the early offices
to do their own certification of expenses. It was his feeling
that there very well may have been a CI fund that was not
handled in the usual way however it is very unlikely to
impossible that any fund was not audited/certified in some
fashion (i.e. reviewed and certified decentrally and only
reported on the books in some aggregate amount). He commented
that he has never in discussion with finance officers heard of an
account managed by staff officers that wasn't certified by
someone in finance.
Question 2
-
Mangold also refers to unnamed CI/B&F officer
who says he worked for Angleton from 1958-64 and never dealt with
him directly on a single matter. Is there a list of B&F
officers assigned to the CI staff from 1959-63? Do their records
still exist?
OFL - The Career Management Officer stated that we would
need the name of the B&F officer in order to identify if he/she
was assigned to the CI/Staff. CMO also stated that he does have
some old records during that time period pertaining to
assignments but the list he has is alphabetical by name.
current procedure is that the soft file maintained in OFL
contains the assignment of each officer in the biographical
profile.
HRM

The
Has microfilm staffing complements for the 1959-63
timeframe. These staffing complements were created on a
quarterly basis and are broken down by the office (location)
level. With the correct directorate/office name we can visually
search these microfilm records, find the correct office and
produce hardcopy reports listing the employees on the rolls for a
given quarter. The hardcopy report could be reviewed to break
down the office listing by occupation and create a list of names
associated with the occupation (i.e. B&F officers assigned to CI
from 1959-63. The employee name could then be used to located
current or archived HRM files. CAUTION: 1) If an individual came

Question 6 - Where are records that would describe liaison
(etc) cooperation or operations between OS and CI located? How
are these records organized?
With the short turnaround time imposed on responding to this
request no information could be readily located to provide an
answer to this question. It is believed that if information of
this nature does exist, it may be located in archived policy or
administrative files of the Office of Security and/or Security
Research Staff. Retrieval and review of this information would
require an extensive research effort. Officers who may possess
knowledge of this type of record were queried and it was
suggested that info responsive to this question may possibly be
located in DO records.
Question 7
-
Where are records regarding operations that OS
participated in or ran located? For example, where are the OS
records on the Castro assassination attempts?
Records on operations and/or projects in which the Office of
Security was involved in the past have most likely been
destroyed, unless they are maintained because of congressional
directives or the records control schedules. The Office of
Personnel Security has the capability of retrieving a listing of
any current records with the prefix or "project" or "operation”.
If the title does not include these words, retrieveal would be
more difficult unless an exact name or acronym is known for a
particular operation or project.
Question 8 - How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which Qs
components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files
on Oswald?
OPS answered in CIA-16. Copy attached.

14-00000
Question 3
-
What was the function of the Office of
Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)? Why were defector
records kept in this component?
A
The Security Research Staff (SPS) was the component
responsible for collecting, developing, and evaluating
information of a counterintelligence nature to detect and/or
prevent penetration of the Agency's organization, employees, and
activities by foreign or domestic organizations or individuals.
SRS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases
and maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counter
intelligence effort throughout OS. SRS reported directly to the
Director of Security.
Question 4 - In the OS/SRS memo of Oct 31, 1960 written by
Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of several defectors are
listed. What do the MS and EE file prefixed designate? How are
these designations assigned.
As noted in question 1, records were categorized according
to the type and the older file numbers reflected the file
category. "M" designated a miscellaneous record; "S" designated
a Security Research Staff record. Therefore "MS" most likely
referred to a miscellaneous record of interest to the Security
Research Staff. “E” or “EE” designations covered subjects of
interest to the Domestic Contacts Division for
information/intelligence purposes. It appears that at least some
of these alpha designations were converted to numerical values
circa 1964.
Question 5
-
Does OS process security clearances for non-
employees (e.g. sources) to receive access to classified
information? What kind of files are created by this process?
How long are these files maintained.
Security clearances per se are not processed for non-
employees (sources/contacts). The Office of Security conducts
appropriate national agency checks to try to determine the
reliability of those individuals who are of interest for contact
purposes because of their foreign travels, specific scientific
information, etc. In a few instances an ad hoc
clearance/validation may be requested in the event some
classified information would be revealed in the course of
acquiring intelligence from these sources. The validation period
is normally five years, and any files created are maintained in
the individual's name for a period of ten years after the
validation period has expired. The DO would most likely have
further information on a particular source.

4- What happened from the time a cable was sent from a field
site until it arrived
on a desk åt Headquarters?
Messages sent from a field site would be passed to a
"
4
communicator, encrypted and transmitted via
•
High Frequency Radio. The message received from Brandy
and relayed to headquarters and then it was decrypted.
The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the
message and match what they read against customer
requirements. They then would have a typist type the
dissemination on the message. The message then would be
picked up from the message center by the various staffs
and or divisions.

How were cables disseminated?

Assassinations (HSCA). 1 The HSCA brought together in one
place in 1978 the principal documents retrieved over the
course of years from earlier investigations, including the
Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, and the
Church Committee.
The Warren Commission in 1963 and 1964 was the first
major review of the JFK Assassination. Existing records
suggest that CIA provided roughly 4,000 pages of
documentation to the Warren Commission review, plus
testimony by Richard Helms and John McCone. The Warren
Commission pursued matters related primarily to events and
actions directly associated with the assassination event,
including materials from CIA's Mexico City Station, which
were considered relevant because of a visit to Mexico City
by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination.
The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 and Church Committee
investigation in 1975 and 1976 were focused on allegations
of wrongdoing by the CIA. Nonetheless, as a part of these
investigations they yielded information which, to many,
appeared to relate in some way to the assassination, such as
an operational capability or willingness to consider
assassination as an intelligence method.
From 1976 through 1979 the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) pursued additional leads, generating
still further documentation. The HSCA ultimately brought
together within its broad scope of investigation many of the
documents from the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller
Commission and the Church Committee. This collection
ultimately became the "HSCA sequestered collection,” which
altogether contains an equivalent of over 300,000 pages, in
paper, photographs, tapes, and microfilm media, including
duplicates. Because the myriad conspiracy theories included
possible Soviet, Cuban, Mafia or right-wing American
involvement, the scope of the HSCA investigation included
anything or anyone that might appear to support those
theories, including historical institutional behavior
patterns. Further, although this sequestered collection was
considered to be CIA's, it contains documents from other
agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and over 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material.
1
The HSCA sequestered collection reflects the major corpus of CIA material or
information reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (or to
which they had access) during the 1976-1979 time frame. The pulling together
of this collection was coordinated by the Committee and they defined what it was
to include. This Collection has been physically held by CIA since 1979,
although CIA was not authorized access until 1992, when permission was given by
Congress to review the material in preparation for responding to the JFK Act.

(J) The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic
data on each name . This listing was maintained separately
from the actual Defectors File; notations within the
Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as
permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS.
Efforts to locate this listing or determine the disposition
have been unsuccessful.
(J) Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors
File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
Katie Nakai of this office at one time was assigned to the
Security Analysis Group and recalls the Defector Machine
Listing. From her recollection, this machine listing was
approximately one and one-half inches thick and was in two
parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical index of
defector names with assigned numbers. The second part
listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and contained
limited information on each name.
(C) The Special Investigations Branch of Investigations
Division is the current operating component encompassing most
of the Security Analysis Group functions still conducted in
OPS. Gail Jewell of this office was queried regarding office
holdings relating to the Defector Machine Listing. Ms.
Jewell had no knowledge of the listing and suggested William
Gilbert as a resource. Mr. Gilbert, CIC Liaison Officer,
could not recall the listing, opined it may have been
destroyed, and suggested contacting Zachary Filis of the
Counterintelligence Center (CIC).
(C) CIC assumed many of the functions previously
conducted by the Security Analysis Group. Mr. Filis was
queried regarding the possibility the Defector Machine
Listing may have been transferred to CIC during the
realignment of duties. Mr. Filis advised the Defector
Machine Listing could not be located in CIC holdings; and he
has made inquiries with Directorate of Operations
counterparts regarding the listing.

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (%230351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MD?/?S.

In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0Q77826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of
Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of
these files.
This

on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.
Response; (U)
As noted above, all HTLINGUAL Files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official H˜LINGUAL files as:

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Operations.
(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This compilation of information was received from press

(U) The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature
to
detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.
(5) Don Staton of the OPS/Management Staff was queried
regarding the mission and functions of SRS during the pre-
assassination time period. Mr. Staton made inquiries
relating to the above request, and the OPS/Information
Management Officer Ronda Allen retrieved retired policy
records for review. The information on the mission and
function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office of
Security administrative and historical files as well as a
review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.
3. (U) For your information, a page-by-page review of
the documents contained in the Defectors File (12 volumes)
and Lee Harvey Oswald's file (7 volumes) has not been
conducted for the purposes of this request. Our efforts
were concentrated on the pre-assassination time frame.
4. (U) This review was conducted by Katie Nakai,

Question 4i (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
Files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.
Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on. Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number o
documents on this person increased, a separate file was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.
(U) Both the Defectors File (%30341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#230351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

The HSCA sequestered collection is contained in 64
boxes of multimedia material, including paper, photographs,
and microfilm which have been loosely organized into major
categories of information. Boxes 1 through 34 are mostly
material collected by the CIA's Directorate of Operations,
the FBI, and other Government agencies, including field
reporting and handwritten notes. They also include
newspaper articles, name traces performed in response to
requests by the HSCA staff, and copies of other documents
such as the CIA Inspector General's 1967 report on CIA plots
against Castro and Richard Helms' executive session
testimony before the HSCA.
Boxes 35 through 63 of this collection are largely
records of CIA's Legislative Counsel, Inspector General,
General Counsel, Office of Security, and Directorate of
Science and Technology, as well as internal records of the
HSCA staff. They consist of reports, memoranda,
transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper clippings,
photographs, and charts. Box 64 contains 72 reels of
microfilm the equivalent of roughly 72 more boxes of paper
documents. This material includes the file which the
Directorate of Operations maintained on Lee Harvey Oswald
(the 201 file) as well as similar files on additional
individuals. Many of the microfilm documents duplicate
other documents in the other boxes.
While not a part of the sequestered collection, a
separate "Oswald 201 File" has served as a CIA repository
for JFK assassination-related material over the years and to
a large extent material in this file is duplicative of
material in the sequestered collection. Only a few
documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.
The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages currently in this
file consists of documents collected immediately after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission
investigation. Included are a large number of third agency
documents, primarily from the FBI. Other major additions to
the Oswald 201 file include relevant Mexico City Station
files and material generated by various FOIA requests and
investigations, such as that of New Orleans District
Attorney, James Garrison.
Assassination-related materials beyond the sequestered
collection and the Oswald 201 file which have been located
since 1992 generally fall into three categories. First,
there are new documents which have been generated since
1978, such as defector reports that mention rumors or
perceptions of conspiracies or newspaper or other open

me of all histories produced under the CIA History Program for
release to the Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB).
Regarding equities that concern the Office of the DA, I reviewed
pages 38 through 48 and pages 51-54 and have no problem granting
access to the list except for those noted on page 40, 42, 46,
and 48. If this list is to be provided unclassified, then the
station names as marked would need to be redacted. If this list
is to be provided classified, the DA pages may be passed without
sanitization.
2. Is the ARRB allowed to request access to any Agency
document if unrelated to the JFK Assassination? We could be
setting a precedent if we grant the ARRB access to see this
entire list. Potentially, the ARRB could request access to any
number of Agency documents totally unrelated to the JFK
Assassination (i.e. 201 files).

Bonnie:
This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 note wherein you asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart
Henry and William Morris Kent. In an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (CIA-IR-12) up-to-date, I provide the following:
My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and
Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, and as outlined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB to John Pereira, that Cross, Henry and
Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.
Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM to conduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996,
I advised Barry that HRM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived from AC. It
is my understanding that Becky gave you the OPF yesterday. HRM advsied further that they had attempted to locate files on Cross,
Henry and Gupton but failed to locate any files on these individuals in light of the fact that only the pseudos had been provided. We
further advised that if in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.
On 23 December 1997, I advised Barry that OPS had located files on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross and Doug Gupton and that the files were
in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record on Bart Henry. It is my understanding that you have not reviewed these files to
date but are in the process of making arrangements to do so. Sue-Ann Pierson conducted the search back in July and I am certain that -
she will be glad to you in this matter (40000).
And lastly, I have no record of ever having received a request to search on William Morris Kent. Accordingly, I will request OPS and
HRM to do so.
Please let me know if I have misinterpreted the status of this request. Thank you. Frieda

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (%230351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.
(U) In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--%230077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of
Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of
these files.
(U) Attached is all of the available information
regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This
information was retrieved from Lydia Hoffman of the
Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and
from a review of general office administrative files.
Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.
Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:
#0077826
#0090079
#0093466
#0119144
Opened approximately July 1952

source materials related to an individual associated with
the assassination. Second, in a number of cases targeted
areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of
interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and
added documents to the collection. And third, improved
search techniques have provided better access to those files
which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the
material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to
the material in the sequestered collection and the overall
set of material from CIA which has been designated as
"assassination records" by the JFK Board.
In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority
to designate records which it considers relevant to the
assassination as "Assassination Records." These documents
are then subject to review for declassification or, as
deemed appropriate by the Board, held for declassification
in the year 2017. The Board has designated the entire
sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as
selected material generated in the course of searches
subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is
the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including
duplicates.

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Operations.
(U) The Defectors File (#30341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This compilation of information was received from press
clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the
various armed services. The pre-assassination documents

(J) The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1965 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic
data on each name. This listing was maintained separately
from the actual Defectors File; notations within the
Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as
permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS.
Efforts to locate this listing or determine the disposition
have been unsuccessful.
(U) Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors
File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
Katie Nakai of this office at one time was assigned to the
Security Analysis Group and recalls the Defector Machine
Listing. From her recollection, this machine listing was
approximately one and one-half inches thick and was in two
parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical index of
defector names with assigned numbers. The second part
listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and contained
limited information on each name.
(C) The Special Investigations Branch of Investigations
Division is the current operating component encompassing most
of the Security Analysis Group functions still conducted in
OPS. Gail Jewell of this office was queried regarding office
holdings relating to the Defector Machine Listing. Ms.
Jewell had no knowledge of the listing and suggested William
Gilbert as a resource. Mr. Gilbert, CIC Liaison Officer,
could not recall the listing, opined it may have been
destroyed, and suggested contacting Zachary Filis of the
Counterintelligence Center (CIC).
(C) CIC assumed many of the functions previously
conducted by the Security Analysis Group. Mr. Filis was
queried regarding the possibility the Defector Machine
Listing may have been transferred to CIC during the
realignment of duties. Mr. Filis advised the Defector
Machine Listing could not be located in CIC holdings; and he
has made inquiries with Directorate of Operations
counterparts regarding the listing.

Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.
Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on. Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
documents on this person increased, a separate file was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.
(U) Both the Defectors File (#230341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (%230351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

(U) The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to
detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.
(5) Don Staton of the OPS/Management Staff was queried
regarding the mission and functions of SRS during the pre-
assassination time period. Mr. Staton made inquiries
relating to the above request, and the OPS/Information
Management Officer Ronda Allen retrieved retired policy
records for review. The information on the mission and
function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office of
Security administrative and historical files as well as a
review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.
3. (U) For your information, a page-by-page review of
the documents contained in the Defectors File (12 volumes)
and Lee Harvey Oswald's file (7 volumes) has not been
conducted for the purposes of this request. Our efforts
were concentrated on the pre-assassination time frame.

Barry & Gary:
I have reviewed the draft response to CIA-IR-11 dated 13 August 1998 and following are my
comments and requested changes:
Paragraphs 1 and 2 - OK
Para 2a: EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found no files identifiable with subject; a file was found
on an individual with the same name but; with research, it was determined that the individual was not the
Edward J. Epstein who is the subject of this request. DA searches found a Center for CIA Security,
formerly the Office of Personnel Security, file and a Publications Review Board file on subject, as well as
three "hits" to records destroyed pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The destroyed
records involved three Freedom of Information requests that mention Epstein's name in the subject line.
None of the requests were for information on Epstein.
Para 2b: LANE, Mark
4th line - Please change Public Affairs to Privacy Act request
Para 2c: MEAGHER, Sylvia - A reference to the fact subject made a Privacy Act request was
found. In addition, the Center for CIA Security found that it had, at one time, a folder on subject and a
1968 Ramparts Magazine article. Both subject's Privacy Act request file and the impersonal folder have
been destroyed pursuant to normal record control schedules.
Para 2d: defer to DO
Para 2e: WEISBERG, Harold
11th line - Please change Office of Security to Center for CIA Security.
In so far as DA equities are concerned, I concur with draft letter once the above changes have
been incorporated.

ATTACHMENT II.
Search Methodology and Types of Searches Conducted
i
Summary. This Attachment discusses the methodologies
used in conducting the searches, including what we know of
the searches which were conducted on behalf of the earlier
assassination investigations. It includes, in referenced
tabs, documentation of selected taskings. It discusses the
distributed nature of CIA's paper recordkeeping systems and
electronic databases and the custom keyword searches that
are used with electronic databases which CIA maintains.
Discussion.
The collection of CIA materials contained
in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)
"sequestered collection" has existed as a discrete body of
records since 1978. This material resulted from highly
labor intensive and systematic searches by individuals
familiar with the Agency's paper files and records systems
in use in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the sequestered
collection comprises the great bulk of CIA-originated
documents which can be associated with the JFK Assassination
and related investigations.
For most of its history, the Agency has had a system of
records which has been shaped by the divergent requirements
of the directorates in accordance with the wide variance of
focus in their missions. These basic differences in the
missions of the directorates, as well as the compartmental-
ization-of-information procedures (the "need-to-know”
concept), have resulted in each directorate keeping its own
set of records in accordance with directorate-specific
guidelines. This applies equally to paper records as well
as to electronic databases.²
Since the late 1970s, the Agency has been in the
process of converting to electronic databases, which allow
for electronic searches for documents using keyword and
2 Even within a single database, information may--in accordance with information
compartmentalization requirements based on the need-to-know principle--be stored
in separate files by several offices or divisions, each with its distinct
recordkeeping criteria and access requirements. In order for a search to be
thorough, a search for one term or a combination of terms must be conducted
across all such files.

Office of Personnel Security
Priority Requests from JFK Board
Request dated 17 December 1996
1. (C)
(C) In response to referenced request for "additional
files" searches on Spas T. Raikin and Marilyn Dorothy Murret, the
Office of Personnel Security conducted appropriate searches of
the Management Data Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). MDP/PS
is the automated database of security records used by the Office
of Personnel Security. The searches undertaken were reasonably
calculated to uncover all responsive records.
2. (C) The Office of Personnel Security has a file on Spas
T. Raikin (#30134669). This file reflects that in August 1957
Foreign Documents Division/00 requested a clearance on Spas T.
Raikin for unclassified contract employment with Project U.S.
Joint Publications Research Service in New York City on an
unwitting basis. The Office of Security responded there was no
information which would preclude use of Mr. Raikin. On 31
January 1967 the Office of Security again granted approval for
Mr. Raikin to be used as an unwitting independent contractor with
the U.S. Joint Publications Research Service.
3. (C)
The Office of Personnel Security does not maintain
a security file on Marilyn Dorothy Murret, but there is an index
record to an media article dated 1971 from Computers and
Automation. This article contains the statement that Marylyn
Murrett is Lee Harvey Oswald's cousin and that evidence indicates
she was involved in espionage activities in Russia and Asia.

Frieda,
I have completed searches for Andrew Anderson as Anderson for maximum hits, on Howard
Guebler under Guebler, on Gordon Novel under Novel and Edward Butler under Butler, all last names for
maximum possible hits. My searchs on these four individuals produced no hits, no records, and no
indexed data on one and all.
I note the presumption "Evidently, he (Anderson) was a former employee" because he had a AIN
number of 0 800211. An AIN number is an Agency Identification Number, not necessarily suggesting an
"employee" relationship. An "EIN" is an Employee Identification Number, but what categories of
employment fall under it, I'm not prepared to say.

Barry Harrelson, the JFK Project Officer, is requesting that you search once again under the name of
Andrew (Andy) Anderson in light of the fact that CCS has located a file on one Andrew Clarence Anderson
(AÌN 0 800211). Evidently, he was a former employee. I regret that we did not have this information prior
to tasking you the first time.

Barry: HRM's response follows to your request for the address of "Holmer McMann". This sounds like the individual you
described-spelling different. As stated, McMahon resigned in 1970 and the Agency has no current address or record of whether or not
he is still alive. If you want us to pull the file to determine his address while he was an employee, let me now. That info, of course, is 28

other indexing tools which provide much more expedited and
efficient searches. Because the most significant portion of
JFK assassination-related material was generated prior to
this conversion to electronic databases, searches of the
sequestered collection or other contemporaneous CIA records
have had to rely primarily upon labor intensive hand
searches.
Since 1992 and the passage of the JFK Act, CIA has, in
responding to the requests of the Board, had to devise
search methodologies and techniques to address both the hard
copy and electronic versions of our databases. With respect
to the hard copy material, Agency efforts have concentrated
on those component records most likely to yield
assassination-related documents. Short of a complete manual
review of all documents in the Agency, the techniques used
for searching hard copy materials include expert reviews of
file series and folder names, including associations with
known related topics, retrieving boxes of files from the
Agency's Archives and Records Center, and manually reviewing
those files identified as likely to contain the sought after
materials.
Electronic files searches can actually be more complex
than manual searches, in major part because of the number of
different electronic systems in use. The Directorate of
Operations' electronic databases, for instance, include most
cables since 1978 and they can be searched using single or
multiple search terms against the full text of these cables.
The Directorate of Intelligence's automated systems include
original source material used for analytic assessments as
well as the products themselves and can be searched through
a variety of electronic techniques. The DCI Area
(considered, for this purpose a directorate) maintains the
Executive Registry files which are not normally retrievable
through full text search, but by index searches. The
Directorate of Administration maintains a large and diverse
system of databases and files on employees and contractors
that includes data on security issues, medical records,
training, etc. The Directorate of Science and Technology
and its subordinate components maintain other electronic
databases unique to individual missions. Each of these
systems requires a unique set of access criteria and search
commands and must be searched by information management
experts of the respective directorates.
Where possible, automated systems were searched using
key words such as JFK, Kennedy, assassination, executive
action, Oswald, place names, and a large number of names,
crypts, or pseudonyms identifying individuals known to have

PRIORITY - CIA-IR-27 - ARRB Request for Security Files on 5 Individuals (DA/IRO No. 14)

Curt:
In response to CIA-IR-27, on 26 September 1997 OPS advised Barry Harrelson (JFK Project Officer) that security records are available
for review by his office on the following individuals:
NAGELL, Richard C.
NOVEL, Gordon D.
RUBY, Jack L.
SHERIDAN, Walter J.
WEISBERG, Harold
Barry has just advised that the files on Nagell, Novel and Ruby have been identified as Assassination Records. Accordingly, they have
requested that OPS transfer these files to DCI/CSI/HRG (J. Barry Harrelson) for inclusion in these records. Barry has further advised that
a copy of the documents from each file would be acceptable if OPS prefers.
This is with respect to the files on Walter J. SHERIDAN and Harold WEISBERG. Barry has asked that arrangements be made for these
files to be reviewed by the ARRB to determine which documents in each of these files are Assassination Records. In light of a short
deadline, it is requested that the arrangements be made early in February. Once documents have been selected, Barry will need copies of
those documents as well.
Please keep Becky and me posted with respect to these requests. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Frieda

an and a man of at
Cswald LeWinter is a naturalized US
least four other names George Mearah, Oscar Lewinter, Racin
Lewinter, and Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the East
German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never had any official
affiliation with Lewinter. Lewinter was the subject of an Agency
"burn notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the intelligence
community. In this case, the alert advised that Lewinter was an
intelligence swindler, peddler, and fabricator.
CIA has a report of an episode involving an inte ligence
fabricator and convicted drug dealer Oswald Lewinter, AKA George
Mearah, born 2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1991, a
CIA representative overseas reported that leWinter, using the
name of George Mearah, contacted him and offered to put high-
level GDR officials wishing to defect in touch with our
representative and in turn the CIA. This contact would be in
exchange for help and a presidential pardon that would wipe the
slate clean and leave Lewinter (Mearah) without a record as a
convicted felon. Lewinter (Mearah) claimed this was important he
was married (for the third time) and starting a new life; he was
reportedly considering quietly acquiring Israeli citizenship.
This contact was not followed up because of the "burn notice.

ATTACHMENT TO 10 MARCH 1998 MEMORANDUM RE: CIA-IR-36
1. Per the Review Board staff's request the following
is a brief explanation of how the Directorate of Operations
(DO) processed cables in the 1963/1964 time-frame. "As we
are unable to locate any definitive records on the subject,
and in all probability none ever existed, the information
provided is based solely on the memory of DO officers
familiar with procedures in place at the time.
•
'
2. Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed
its own registry. Although each registry was configured to
meet each division's unique requirements, there were common
functions performed by all the registries to include:
collecting, sorting, and delivering of incoming cables;
maintenance of incoming and outgoing cable "chronos";
collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouch
material; and the issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and
alias" card files.
3. To the specific question regarding processing of
cables, on a daily basis, usually six day per week, each
registry collected its incoming cable traffic from a central
processing point, then called the Cable Secretariate, within
the Office of Communications. The incoming cables were then
sorted by registry personnel according to pre-defined
guidelines. These guidelines were unique to each division
and were frequently altered to meet changing operational
requirements. Sorted cables were then delivered to specific
operational/area desks. A "chrono" copy of each was
maintained, on a temporary basis, usually for 90 days and
then destroyed.
4. Outgoing cables were created and coordinated by
appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by
the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer.
"Released" cables were then hand delivered or sent by
pneumatic tube system ( a system long ago dismantled from
the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariate
for processing into the Agency's communication network.
"Chrono" copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the
registry for a 90 day hold and then destroyed.
5. It is important to note that the cable scenario
outlined here is general in nature and that throughout their
existence registries and their procedures were frequently
altered until the registry system as described above was
eliminated in the mid-1980's.

Prior to enactment of the JFK Act, in early 1992, the
Chief of the CIA History Staff, through various manual
searches of shelf lists, located the "sequestered
collection" of the House Select Committee on Assassinations
(sixty-four record center size boxes). After obtaining the
permission of the Congress, his staff surveyed these and
other related holdings on the assassination. In addition,
the History Staff located sixteen boxes of Lee Harvey
Oswald's 201 file and a number of loose folders, mainly from
Mexico City Station records that had been collected for the
Warren Commission.
In October 1993, following enactment of the JFK Act but
prior to the President's appointment of the Board, CIA's
Historical Review Group (HRG) requested the directorates to
conduct a name search on Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK
assassination, and any related documents (Tab 1). This
request resulted in a series of meetings and discussions
with various Agency components and Information Release
Officers. More than thirty-one additional boxes of
materials were sent to HRG for review. Included in this
material were nineteen boxes of JFK working files of Mr.
Russ Holmes, a CIA employee who for many years was the
Agency's focal point officer with responsibility for
responding to questions related to our assassinated-related
records. Also included were two boxes on Nosenko, seven
boxes of Latin America Division documents, and three boxes
from the Bay of Pigs project. Out of these thirty-one
additional boxes provided to the Board staff, approximately
twenty-two boxes of material were designated by the Board as
assassination records. The preponderant volume of these
records is duplicative of documents in the sequestered
collection.
In April 1995, after the Agency received the Board's
first formal request, and in anticipation of "what are

Declaration of Teresa F. Wilcox
I, Teresa F. Wilcox, hereby declare and say as follows:
1. (AIUO) I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the
Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T). I was appointed to
this position in February 1996, and have held various professional
positions within the Central Intelligence Agency since 1985. I am
responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the
DS&T, to include the Offices of the Deputy Director for Science and
Technology and the Associate Deputy Director for Science and
Technology; the Office of Technical Service (OTS); the Office of
Technical Collection (OTC); the Clandestine Information Technology
Office (CITO); the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS);
the Office of Development and Engineering (OD&E); the Office of
Advanced Analytic Tools (AAT); the Office of Advanced Projects
(OAP); and the Office of Research and Development (ORD). In
addition, I am responsible for searching and reviewing certain
records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center
(NPIC).
2. (AIUO) I am aware that the DS&T has searched appropriate
records systems for information responsive to all requests the DS&T
has received. I have obtained this knowledge through my personal
experience, as well my conversations with, and my review of the
records of, the former DS&T IRO Anthony R. Frasķeti, and the DS&T
Information Management Officer, Marsha A. Hubbs.
3. (AIUO) The following is a description of DS&T searches
and review of documents undertaken in response to Board taskings
the DS&T has received.
CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart. The DS&T made
deletions to security records located by the Directorate of
Administration. The DS&T Searched ODDS&T records for
Capehart's medical file. The DS&T forwarded the medical file
to the Board for its review.
CIA-IR-08 Family Jewels Memorandum. The DS&T reviewed a
package of documents forwarded by Barry Harrelson. The DS&T
advised the Board it had no objection to ARRB access.
CIA-IR-15 Electronic 'take' from Mexico City Station.
This memorandum addresses the portion of the action, "In
addition, the Board is still awaiting a response on the
present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the
outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board
continues to seek a full accounting for all surveillance
conducted during the relevant time periods."

"
In conducting a search for the above information, the
DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title,
"Mexico City, Mexico. We forwarded the entire contents of
that folder for the period 24 May 1961 to 10 June 1965, with
one exception. Three Operational Monthly Reports were
forwarded to the Board. The dates covered were 1-30 September
1963; 1-31 October 1963; and 1-30 November 1963. The
attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was
not included. It was a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish,
between two individuals talking about office procedures.
substantive information was exchanged during this
conversation.
No
The DS&T also conducted a search of OTC records. This
office would have inherited the Division D records of the
Directorate of Operations (DO). We reviewed old DO Records
Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder-
inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests
since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO
system. We forwarded for the Board's review the six Records
Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959
to 1962. We advised the Board that Records Center records
indicated the records' disposition as follows:
1. 59-S-477: Destroyed September 1977.
2. 60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980.
3.
60-S-402: Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977.
4. 61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March
1972; three boxes destroyed, May 1980.
5. 62-S-885: Destroyed (no date given).
6. 62S000986R: Transferred to the Office of SIGINT Operations
(DS&T).
These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the
possession of OTC that are in the time frame relevant to the
JFK assassination. As their descriptions indicate, they do
not appear relevant to the request.
The DS&T also conducted a search of CITO records. This
DS&T office inherited some files from OTC when CITO was
established. We searched its records in the event some
Division D records were held by CITO. These searches
identified no responsive records.
Searches of OTS, OTC, and CITO records used the following
keywords:

CIA-IR-16 U-2 Files. The DS&T provided the Board a copy
of the U-2 shelflist. We also searched for records filed
under Richard Bissell's name. We received no follow-on
request from the Board.
CIA-IR-16 FBIS-USR-92-112. The DS&T provided to the
Board a translation of articles about a KGB file on Oswald.
CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro Assassination Plots.
Records of the ODDS&T, OTC, and OTS were searched for the
following keywords: Castro, Oswalt, Oswald, assas*, and
KDBADGER. In addition, we searched OTS records on the
following: Project ZRRIFLE, Mollusca, Cubela, Black Leaf,
ballpoint pen, hypodermic syringe, Artime, silencer, gambling,
aerosol, cigar, depilatory, wiretapping, Phyllis McGuire, skin
diving suit, sea shell, and project AMLASH. As a result of
these searches, we provided to the Board a document titled,
"Handwriting Analysis - AMLASH-1," dated 7 April 1965.
CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film. A search was conducted on
records of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (records of
the former National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC)
and Office of Imagery Analysis) using the terms Zapruder, JFK,
Commission, and 1963. Hits on year 1963 did not reveal any
pertinent information. We located no record of a "William
Green" at NPIC in November 1963. We located no log books or
indexes regarding the processing or handling of any
assassination films. We also reviewed an audiotaped
interview with a former NPIC employee, and made minimal
deletions to the tape.
CIA-IR-33 Search of FBIS records for any files on Oswald,
and request for information on how FBIS-USR92-112 was filed.
No past or present files were found. An explanation on how
FBIS-USR-92-112 was filed was provided.
Review of three Ford Library Documents (178-10003-10453,
178-10004-10087, 178-10002-10394. Made deletions and deferred
to the DO on 178-10002-10394. Made deletions to Summary
Report on CIA Investigation of MKNAOMI.
Review of two terms. The DS&T advised that the terms
should not be released because of ongoing CIA activity at the
location.
-
Review of Alias Documentation issue (104-10220-10179,
10181, and -10188). Requested that Board postpone release of
specific information. A search of OTS records indicated OTS
had no records on particular documents in the 1960s and 1970s.
Review of a slug in current use. Requested that the
Board postpone its release because the slug is in current use.

likely to be many requests from the Board for information..."
the Agency Executive Director asked each directorate and the
DCI Administrative Officer to appoint a focal point officer
for the JFK Assassination review. (Tab 2)
In the spring and summer of 1997, the Agency arranged
for the Board staff to receive a series of briefings by
representatives of each directorate on the files kept within
the records systems of each directorate. These briefings
covered aspects of the records systems, such as how the
records are organized, maintained, searched and retrieved,
as well as how they had been previously searched for
assassination-related materials.
The Board staff requested a number of additional
searches, which have now been completed. These requests
were both formal and informal and resulted in responses to
the Board staff which included a wide range of additional
material, some of which was judged relevant to the history
of the assassination. This material includes the histories
of various CIA operations and Agency components, files on
specific individuals involved in either the Warren
Commission or in HSCA investigations, and the results of CIA
internal reviews of programs and operations. Although many
requests from the Board and responses from the Agency were
handled informally, the significant initial requests are
listed in the table in Attachment V.
Prompted in part by the surfacing of a small number of
new relevant documents, the Board staff requested CIA in the
summer of 1998 to: (a) perform an additional set of searches
on certain specific topics; and (b) issue an Agency-wide
notice reminding CIA employees of the requirements of the
JFK Act.
Specially tailored tasking was sent to the three
Directorate of Operations components deemed most likely to
possess records relevant to the JFK assassination of the
kind of concern to the Board (See Tab 3). Among other
considerations, this special tasking included a list of new
or revised search terms, a request for clarification on the
disposition of the James Angleton files, and the requirement
to focus on potential new information from the debriefing of
defectors in which any reference to Oswald or to the Kennedy
assassination occurs.
DCI Tenet issued an Agency-wide Employees Bulletin on
22 July 1998 directing all CIA personnel to “consider

JFK Declaration of FREDRICK C. WICKHAM, JR.
I, Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. declare and say as follows:
1. (U) I am the JFK Focal point Officer ("FPO") for
the Directorate of Operations ("DO") of the United States
Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA"). I have held technical
positions associated with the design and implementation of
computer systems, information management positions including
the DO IMO, and currently manage the DO information review
and release programs. I have been with the CIA since 1967
and have been associated with the JFK records review
activity since 1992 and the JFK FPO since 1995.
2.
(U) I have obtained the information contained in
this declaration based upon my personal knowledge and
experience, as well as conversations with the DO Information
Review Officer, the DO Information Management Officer and
individuals taking action on the specific requests.
3.
(U) DO records were predominately paper with a
hard copy card index in the 1960's and an electronic index
in the 1970's. The indices were based upon names that meet
specific collection requirements or projects that were
undertaken in the performance of our mission. Searches that
exceeded the capability of the indices required manual paper
file searches. I am aware that the DO searched the central
record system, which includes retired records, and hand
searched the convenience files and specialized files located
within various offices. Specialized collections are often
extremely sensitive and therefore only reside within the
components. During our newer searches we have not found any
significant documents in the DO files dated 1978 or prior
that appear to have been missed by the searches through
1978. We did locate one set of tapes which we know was made
available to the Warren Commission but was not included in
the HSCA sequestered collection. We also found one file
that was only partially included in the HSCA sequestered
collection.

We have received numerous specific requests for

information reflected in our records, I am aware of the
following efforts that were conducted in responding to
specific ARRB requests for DO records. I have abbreviated
the questions to save space:
CIA-1 - Information on the organization of CIA
(U) The March 1995 ARRB request called for the
availability of "comprehensive organizational charts
(or the best available substitutes)." The request
contained about three pages of various requirements,
including:
A. organizational charts of the Directorate of Plans
(DDP); "CIA Stations . . . in Mexico City (1960-68
only), Miami, other stations that we will discuss
orally;” any other offices
any pro-Castro groups,

filing systems,
copies of the instructions, guidelines, and other
materials used by your reviewers;
(U) Over a thousand pages of material were
provided in responding to this request.
(U) In May 1997 the ARRB further requested that 35
pages from CSN 5-50, 2 pages of the JMWAVE chart, and

13 pages from Regulation No. 1-130 and HR #1 be
reviewed for release.
(U) Although the AARB staff had access to all of
the requested material, in January 1998 the Agency
answered that the various CSN 5-50 pages contained
basic information regarding the mission and functions
of the Office of Operations (now the Directorate of
Operations (DO)) and could not be released. However, in
April 1998, we agreed to provide structure charts for
the DDP in 1961 and 1963, with Division and Staff
titles and a JMWAVE Chart.

Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information
(U) The ARRB request was dated May 1995 and was
six pages of file code numbers, crypts, names, dispatch
designators, and cable location designators and
requested identification thereof. A variety of methods
of responses was utilized, (some dated June and July
1995 and some undated) to answer, including a paired
listing (returned to CIA) microfilm file summary
sheets, and descriptive sheets.
CIA-3 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information
(U) This ARRB request was dated June 1995 and was
three more pages of queries similar to CIA-2. A

dated June 1995 and some undated) to answer, including
a paired listing marked (returned to CIA), microfilm

(S) ARRB staffers Jeremy Gunn and Michelle Combs
have reviewed all of the requested histories except one
still under pre-review by the component because of
sensitive information we expect this to be resolved
--
in the near future. They were granted access to
identify any relevance to the assassination of
President Kennedy. They selected a number of pages to
be included within the materials to be declassified and
released to the National Archives. The histories
reviewed were as follows:
Record of Paramilitary Action Against the Castro
Government of Cuba, written by Colonel J. Hawkins,
USMC, on 5 May 1961, and controlled by WH division.
Domestic Operations Base, written by Perry E.
Crookham, in May 1967, and controlled by SO
Division. We are also aware that relevant parts of
pp. 29-31 have been released in the Bay of Pigs
declassification project.
The TS history entitled Foreign Intelligence
Staff/Division D 1948-1965, written by Fred Griffin,
Frank B. Rowlett, and Vyrl E. Leichliter, in April
1974, and controlled by CIA History Staff.

Queries About Some Information

CIA-6
Request for Systematic Review of Traffic
(U) This request was dated September 1995 and was
for "the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and
dispatches for . . . September 26, 1963 through October
20, 1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30,
1963 between" : . Mexico City and Headquarters and
Mexico City and JMWAVE.
(C) The DO provided a classified response in
January 1998. All cable traffic and dispatches for the
period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and
November 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between:
(a) the Mexico city Station and Headquarters, and (B)
the Mexico City Station and JMWAVE are not available as
a chronological collection. The Office of
Communications (OC) only held cables long enough to
ensure that they were successfully transmitted to the
recipient. Because processes and resources to perform
cleanup activity varies, cables were sometimes held for
longer periods but not with the intention of becoming a
long-term reference collection. The offices of record
for the origination of cable traffic and dispatches did
not create files in this manner. The desks maintained
a temporary paper cable chrono. These were not usually
retained for more than 90 days. There is no electronic
repository for cables and dispatches from the stations.
Cables were printed out and went into specific files
dealing with subjects or operations. Accordingly, it
is not possible to recreate as a collection all of the
requested cables and dispatches.

4. (S) Many of the searches performed today are not
significantly different than the ones done during the period
of the various commissions and committees. The searches
performed since 1995 still use the index to the central
record system the same as in 1978 but we have a couple of
new databases that were not available in 1978. We now
capture all cable traffic electronically and are able to
perform text searches of that repository. That repository
post-dates the HSCA so it is not useful in locating older
records. Additionally, we have converted a small amount of
very sensitive paper files into computer searchable form.
While these specific collections are part of the DO's record
system, they were not electronically searchable nor were
they included within the indices to the DO's central records
system. We have searched all of these records systems for
information responsive to requests the DO has received.
Some of the specific requests could not be satisfied by the
electronic searches and we resorted to manual paper searches
in an effort to locate the information.
5. (U) The DO provided several briefings to the
Assassination Records Review Board and their staff, starting
in 1995, to describe the records created by the DO and the
record system that manages that information. We also
described what is meant by the need to continue protection
of sources and methods, and the impacts the revelation of
information would have on the lives of individuals and
current operations. The presenters included the Agency's
General Counsel, Deputy Director for Operations, Chief of
the Information Management Staff, and several other DO
managers associated with the conduct of operations and
protection of sources and methods. We also provided
detailed descriptions of current operations. We provided
information about specific individuals whose lives or
livelihood would be threatened as examples of harm that
would occur if certain information was released.
Additionally, we presented a description of the operational
environment that existed and the intensity under which
searches were performed in the wake of the assassination.
6. (U) The CIA issued an Agency-wide employee
bulletin for a new search for JFK Assassination records (OIM
98-0081, dated 30 July 1998). As requested by the ARRB, the
DO distributed the employee bulletin via Lotus Notes on 17

division summary, much as it is today. The RMDs from
year-to-year could and often did change with the
operational requirements the Agency was expected to
fulfill. As such, the RMDs for each station had value
only as data to the larger examination of how the
Agency performed its intelligence mission in a given
year and what trends or changes this review would
suggest for the ensuing year.
(U) Station reporting of the type described above
would be treated as transitory information and as such
meet the definition of a temporary record. It is
entirely possible and quite probable that these
facilitative reports were systematically destroyed.
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
authorized the Agency to destroy facilitative reports
in 1954 (NARA Reference: II-NNA-1057); the destruction
of intelligence collection requirement files in 1962
(NARA Reference: NN-163-1), and operational management
objective files at the subcomponent level (which would
include reports from. Stations and base) in 1977 (NARA

remains in force today.

Mexico City Station Annual Reports
(U) The DO was asked for specific annual reports from
Mexico City.
(S) We informed the ARRB that we were successful in
locating an official DO file which contained station
"annual reports" for the years 1957 through 1973. The
file included two dispatches which forwarded the RMDs
from Mexico Station for the years 1960 and 1961.
However, the RMDs, which were sent as separate
attachments (sent in a different pouch from the
covering dispatch memorandum) were not present in the
file. (NOTE: Attachments which contained true names
of CIA officers or assets or information that would
identify operational sources with CIA were customarily
sent in separate transmissions as a security measure if
a pouch(es) were compromised). We also note that in
a speed letter, dated 1978, written by DDO/LA/STB to
OLC, that the RMDs for Mexico City Station, for the
years, 1962, 1963, or 1964 could not be located.
(S) Based upon further review, we are providing an
updated response to the ARRB as follow: The only
report that was annually required of a station was that
relating to its ability to meet its mission directives,
now called "operational directives". These annual
reports called the Station's "Relative Mission
Directives" (RMD) were used to compose an overall
annual division or staff submission to the Deputy
Director for Operations, as an evaluative tool. The
RMDs, themselves are a summary of station activities
reported to Headquarters in other correspondence during
the course of the year, were used to compile a division
level evaluation--in a sense, an annual report card--on
how it was doing against operational requirements. The
station reporting was extracted into the larger

CIA - 16 - Oswald Pre-Assassination Files
(S) The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO
records to determine if there were any additional files
containing pre-assassination records relating to
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.
CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were
incorporated into the 201.
(S) Prior to establishing a 201, any documents
received would have been placed in an operational
interest file. We found no reference to the existence
of an operational interest file. If such a file had
existed, however, it might not have been registered in
the central index. It was standard procedure that
upon opening a 201, the documents from an operational
interest file would be transferred to the 201.
(S) Given that Oswald was a subject of the
HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that
there was a file on him. We destroyed all of the
HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was
made of what files existed. We did not review all of
the DO record system to destroy all copies of material
which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material.
We know, for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items
related to Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection.
(S) In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the
information we are aware of that we had prior to the
assassination.

1976-1979, the CI files were reviewed and incorporated
into the DO record system. Items that were duplicates
or not worthy of retention were destroyed. The memos

interviewed a former COS Moscow. The Board staff is
satisfied with the response and will prepare its own

CIA-IR-03 - Full Computer Search for List of HTLINGUAL
Files
(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church
Committees investigations, all HTLINGUAL files which
were identifiable, as such, were destroyed under court
order. Copies of materials from these files that may
have been made prior to the destruction order and put
into other files have, however, surfaced as files are
reviewed. This includes material in the HSCA
sequestered collection.
(C) The DO ran a search on the term "HTLINGUAL.”
Some records were identified as destroyed. Some were
not so marked but are not locatable under the job
number identified; however, given that there is no
requirement to record destroyed records under the
Federal statutes for disposition programs and given
limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is
not uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified
files because they had been the subject of Freedom of
Information Act queries; however, these were not
HTLINGUAL files per se, but files which contained the
FOIA requester queries for HTLINGUAL information.
(U) ARRB staff member Michelle Combs has reviewed
the HTLINGUAL file run and has selected some folders
for review. OIM has identified that they have only
redacted records for the large FOIA case that is
listed. IMS/ESG/HCS is retrieving its records for
unredacted copies of the records and will make them
available.

these records, our research did surface a reference to
a file titled "Garrison Investigation of Kennedy

in response to FOIA requests or news clippings in

dismiss this name as a false “hit."

(S) As part of DA/OIM/JFK's research, IMS/ESG/HCS
was requested to do a trace on "Charles Ford." The
trace resulted in no hits.
(S) Later, to answer CIA-IR-03 on HTLINGUAL
material, a computer run was made. The list contained
a citation to testimony to Congress by Charles Ford in
September of 1975. A copy of Ford's testimony to a
Senate Committee regarding a Mafia connection to
assassination plots against Castro was provided to
DA/OIM/JFK in February 1998.
(U) At the request of HRP JFK, several project
Crypts were searched and results provided in connection
with this request.

Contacts with journalists or publishing
(U) The DO provided both an unclassified and
classified response about contacts with journalists or
publishing houses, regarding whether CIA might have
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers
regarding public discussion of the assassination.
Searches with generic terms such as “journalists,"
"publishers," "publishing houses," and "media" would'
not produce meaningful responses. This question
required the research of crypts mentioned in various
documents in the JFK "assassination records." These
crypts referred to projects managed under the overall
guidance of a staff in the DO and in all instances were
projects concerning press and propaganda programs
designed to promote anti-communism and to counter
Soviet press and propaganda initiatives worldwide.
Specifically, the various projects were developed for
the following reasons (Corresponding cryptonyms to
these projects were provided in a classified document,
and are not included below):
A. to counter Soviet activities in international
intellectual organizations, in order to unite and
promote anti-Communist intellectuals.

and for files on the crypts cited in this document and
searched for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document. As previously explained, the
crypts in HMMW 12454 have been researched. The dispatch
was apparently written in haste and in truncated
language without correct knowledge of the operational
crypts for the specific operations in Mexico City. The
crypts in the dispatch are the more generic crypts for
teltap operations, not for the then-current operations
in Mexico City, which are in question.
(U) There has been considerable interest over the
years in locating any electronic surveillance tapes
that would have been made during the period that Oswald
visited Mexico (26 September - 2 October 1963). A
thorough search has been conducted of the DO's record
system as well as the index to retired records in an
attempt to locate any tapes and/or find documentation
to resolve their disposition. We have discussed this
issue with operational experts and their professional
opinion is that most likely tapes such as these were
never returned to Headquarters for retention.
It was
normal practice to recycle audio tapes after they had
been listened to by transcribers and their transcripts
made.
(U) Messages between field stations and
headquarters used operational jargon and shortened
sentence structures that can sometimes allow for
misinterpretations. Thus, possible confusion was
created when references to what was being sent to
headquarters referred to "tapes" but really intend
"information" from tapes.
(U) In our search efforts we did locate
approximately 185 audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban
and Soviet embassies in Mexico City that were recorded
during the immediate time following the assassination
(22 November 1963 to January 1964). The fact that
these tapes were retained and returned to Headquarters
could account for the fact that some people recall that
some tapes existed which were sent to Headquarters.

do not exist and were almost certainly recycled in the
normal course of business before their potential value
was identified.

(S) A name trace was run. The resultant
information was included in an IMS/ESG/HCS
“clarification memo" for the ARRB. The text, which was
classified "Secret," reads as follows:
"Oswald LeWinter is a naturalized US citizen and
George
--
a man of at least four other names
Mearah, Oscar LeWinter, Razin LeWinter, and
Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the
East German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never
had any official affiliation with LeWinter.
LeWinter was the subject of an Agency "burn
notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the
intelligence community. In this case, the alert
advised that LeWinter was an intelligence
swindler, peddler, and fabricator. (C)
CIA has a report of an episode involving an
intelligence fabricator and convicted drug
dealer Oswald LeWinter, AKA George Mearah, born
2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1990,
a CIA representative overseas reported that
LeWinter, using the name of George Mearah,
contacted him and offered to put high-level GDR
officials wishing to defect in touch with our
representative and in turn the CIA. This
contact would be in exchange for help and a
presidential pardon that would wipe the slate
clean and leave LeWinter (Mearah) without a
record as a convicted felon. LeWinter (Mearah)
claimed this was important [because] he was
married (for the third time) and starting a new
life; he was reportedly considering quietly
acquiring Israeli citizenship. This contact was
not followed up because of the “burn notice."

paramilitary efforts were run out of the
Nicaragua base. The third base was located in
Miami to service AMWORLD requirements including
the collection of operational leads, servicing

(C) Combs asked two follow up questions: Was part
of the program to put in place a government in exile?
Was there ever a government in exile? IMS/ESG/HCS put
these questions to LA and DO/IRO. The DO/IRO has
provided the following additional write up, classified
confidential:
“(C) Based on file reviews and recollections
from officers involved in the Cuban program,
there was never a Cuban Government in Exile.
During the planning for the Bay of Pigs
operation it was envisioned that after the
invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and
the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be flown
to the area to establish a new Cuban Government.
The invasion site was never secured.
(C) The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the
failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after
the release of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay
of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was
designed to support and unite several Cuban
exile groups under the control of Artime in an
effort to enhance the cohesion of the exiles and
augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda
and paramilitary attacks against the Cuban
mainland. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to
foment a popular uprising in Cuba which could
lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro.
There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission even
remotely came close to fruition and no evidence
that a projected government in exile was ever
considered as a viable option.''

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to
the ARRB staff's request for a brief explanation of how
the Directorate of Operations processed cables in the
1963/1964 timeframe. We are unable to locate any
Agency-wide definitive records on the subject for this
time frame, and the information provided below is based
solely on the memory of DO officers familiar with
procedures in place at the time and in the specific

staffed its own registry. Although each registry was
configured to meet each division's unique requirements,
there were common functions performed by all the

incoming cables were then sorted by registry personnel
according to predefined guidelines. These guidelines
were unique to each division and were frequently
altered to meet changing operational requirements.
Sorted cables were then delivered to specific
operational/area desks. A "chrono" copy of each
incoming cable was maintained, on a temporary basis,
usually for 90 days, and the receiving office placed a
copy into an operational file based upon subject or
activity.
(U) Outgoing cables were created and coordinated
by appropriate operational/area desks and usually
released by the chief of the division or a designated
releasing officer. "Released" cables were then hand
delivered or sent by pneumatic tube system (a system
long ago dismantled from the original Headquarters
building) to Cable Secretariat for processing into the
Agency's communication network. "Chrono" copies of

William Pawley
(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to
the ARRB's request to review all files on William
Pawley and any files on his possible connection with
Cuban exile groups in the 1962-1963 time frame. The
Agency's 201 file on Pawley consists of three volumes,
the same as in the JFK sequestered collection, and
November 1962 is the date of the last record indexed to
his 201. However, the Agency holds operational files
for the period 1963 to 1965 which related to Pawley.
Those files were made available for review by the ARRB
staff and they selected a number of documents for
inclusion in the materials being processed for release
to NARA.

Worldwide Query
(U) In March 1998 the ARRB asked "whether a

Agency effort to provide support to several
Cuban exile groups. This was an "autonomous"
operation designed to bring the exile groups
under the direct control of Manuel Artime
Buesa. AMWORLD's mission was to cause a popular
uprising in Cuba through the use of propaganda
and paramilitary forces to ultimately overthrow
Fidel Castro.

Certain such reporting records will be included in the
JFK collection as records in Oswald's 201. A Board
request for an updated search of records for Oswald
related material generated some 128 hits, which were
reviewed by Ms. Michelle Combs of the ARRB staff.
Three records, selected by Ms. Combs and sanitized with
her concurrence, were selected for inclusion in the JFK

(U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent
specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has
complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act.
these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee
Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave "no
stone unturned" in assuring that relevant documents are

2. (U) In part because relevant new documents have
surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also
requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's
"counterintelligence files. The new documents have
"
surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references
to assassination related personalities in recent defector

FINAL DOCUMENT SEARCH TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH “PRESIDENT JOHN
F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992" (JFK ACT)
FROM: George J. Tenet
1.
Director of Central Intelligence
(U) As you know, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) is completing
its task of overseeing the search and declassification of all Federal government records relating to
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by 30 September 1998. The Board and we want
to do everything possible to place before the American people the full story as reflected in
government and other records.
2.
(U) The Agency has been working on this effort since 1992 and has searched all of the
obvious databases. We want to make certain that we have left no stone unturned and that no
employee has any records that might possibly be considered relevant to the assassination-
including any records created [or received] after 1992. The reference to 1992 is largely intended
to encompass documents which may have come into our hands since the collapse of the Soviet
Union and Warsaw Pact.
3. (AIUO) In accordance with the provisions of the JFK Act, I hereby direct all CIA
personnel to consider documents in their possession or with which they are familiar that might
have relevance to the Board's review and that might not have been found in the course of
electronic or manual searches over the past six years. Representatives of the Historical Review
Program believe that if such documents do exist they would, most likely, be found in files that
would not be generally related to the assassination or that would not be “logical" areas for
systematic searches. These include working paper files or smaller databases related to countries
not normally associated with the assassination. Relevant documents can be in the form of papers,
photographs, recordings, tapes, or other media, and can include documents "related to the
assassination,” such as later investigations, key topics/events within the Oswald/JFK Story, or
material related to key figures such as Nosenko.

DECLARATION OF DAVID W. CAREY
I, DAVID W. CAREY, hereby declare and say:
1. I presently serve as the Executive Director of the
of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA or Agency). I have
held the position of Executive Director since July of 1997
and have served with the CIA for over 29 years in a variety
of operational, staff, and management positions.
j
2. As the Executive Director I am responsible, on
behalf of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI), for the
overall daily management of the Central Intelligence Agency,
for strategic planning and coordination, and for the
development and execution of the Agency's annual program.
In order to carry out these responsibilities, I have been
delegated all authorities vested in the DCI and DDCI except
as prohibited by law or Agency regulation or policy.
3. The purpose of this declaration is to provide an
assurance that the Central Intelligence Agency: (1) has made
a diligent records search to locate and disclose to the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) all records
in its possession relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the
assassination of President Kennedy; and (2) is aware of no
other assassination-related records in its possession being
withheld from the Board. I make these and the following
statements (including those in the attachments by reference)
based upon my personal knowledge, information made available
to me in my official capacity, the advice of CIA's Office of
General Counsel, and the conclusions I reached in accordance
therewith.
4. With respect to the overall issues of search and
review, and as explained in the attachments or otherwise
included by reference, the CIA's Directorates of
Intelligence (DI), Operations ("DO"), Science and Technology
("DS&T"), and Administration ("DA") and the DCI Area
Information Review Officer have certified to me that their
respective offices or directorates have properly and fully
responded to requests from the Board. Accordingly, I
believe that the Central Intelligence Agency has worked
diligently with the Board to declassify, consistent with the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107) and other statutes,

Attachment III
Records Declassified and Released.
Summary. This Attachment discusses the process used by
CIA to declassify JFK assassination-related documents,
including interaction with the Board and subsequent re-
reviews of materials, as well as the personnel resources
engaged in this effort. It discusses the volumes of records
reviewed, the volumes of records declassified, and the
manner in which the material has or will be made available
to the public.
Discussion. In response to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and in
anticipation of the appointment of the Review Board, CIA,
during 1992 and 1993, reviewed for declassification material
which had been sequestered following the investigation of
the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978.
As a result of this effort, CIA released as declassified to
the National Archives in August 1993 some 127,000 pages of
material from this collection. Since that time, additional
releases have been made; approximately 74,000 pages from the
microfilm part of the collection were declassified and
released in August 1994 and 30,000 pages of HSCA originated
material were declassified and released in 1995. We
estimate that, since 1992, CIA has devoted over 100 work
years to its effort to respond to the JFK Act (including
experienced annuitants working as independent contractors).
The development of the declassification review
methodology was, from the beginning in 1992, an iterative
process that took into account both the requirements of the
JFK Act to release to the public information relevant to an
understanding of the assassination and the DCI's statutory
mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods under
the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949.
In the years since 1992, considerable effort has been
expended to balancing these two objectives. Interaction
with the Board's staff was a significant factor in reaching
this proper balance. The net result is that practices over
this period evolved to the extent that types of material
that had been redacted at the beginning of the process were,
by the end, no longer considered necessary to withhold.
This has, of course, required a further re-review of the
material released during the earlier period to assure that

As
over the six years of our review process. The National
Archives ground rules called for release of every copy for
inclusion in the NARA collection; therefore, each of these
47 copies is included as part of the total collection.
duplicate copies were found, comparison with the 1993
released version revealed not only inconsistencies but
textual phrasing which, in a mosaic of related documents,
made likely the identification of a protected individual or
action. As a result, much re-review of the files was
required and did occur.
Another time-consumer was the question of the
identification of overseas station locations, traditionally
not revealed--both to protect Agency individuals, activities
and sources and to avoid foreign relations difficulties with
foreign governments. In these cases, a window of time for
acknowledgment of such facilities was negotiated, directly
relevant to such actions as Oswald's travels and post-
assassination requests for foreign government assistance in
the U.S. investigation.
Except for redaction of names of CIA employees, true
names of clandestine agents (otherwise identified with
traceable cryptonyms), and currently-sensitive cooperation
with specific foreign intelligence services, the final
collection in the National Archives will contain very
limited redactions and, in our opinion, none that would
affect an historian's understanding of the Agency's
information on, and relevance to, the event.

consistent standards were being used for the entire
collection.
--
Each document in the collection was read by an
Historical Review Program (HRP) Reviewer in every case a
retired officer with at least two decades of Agency
experience who examined every word in the document with
an eye toward releasing documents unless such release could
be expected to cause damage to:
--
•
Human intelligence assets or their families;
•
Intelligence methodology clearly requiring continued
protection;
Intelligence operations or activities warranting
continued protection, including relationships with
foreign governments.
The reviewed documents were then passed to teams of
officers from the components that generated the documents
(in most cases the Directorate of Operations), who were
responsible for determining current sensitivity. The senior
HRP reviewers validated the component groups' actions prior
to forwarding the materials to the Board.
Names of CIA employees who served all or most of their
careers under cover posed particular problems and, while
many names have been redacted, with Board concurrence for
release at a later date, the current sensitivity, or lack
thereof, of retired individuals' employment by CIA had to be
checked in each case. Names of key players in the post-
assassination scenario, as stipulated by the Board, were
released as true names or with temporary and traceable
substitute names. Identification by the Board of those who
were considered key players was a complicated and time-
consuming task. Significant review and analysis went into
the decision to release true names of many Cubans connected
with the Bay of Pigs.
Material from the Rockefeller Commission and Church
Committee investigations, presidential libraries and PFIAB
files which addressed the entire scope of CIA activities
raised issues with respect to relevance to the JFK
assassination. For example, Project MONGOOSE, a clandestine
portion of the publicly acknowledged U.S. anti-Castro
policy, was released.
Another major issue was consistency in reviewing
duplicate copies of documents. In one case 47 copies of a
cable were found by different reviewers in separate files

There are six attachments to this declaration,
which are incorporated by reference. Attachment I addresses
the universe and scope of documents that have been ther'
subject of CIA's review. Attachment II describes the
methodology and types of the searches conducted. Attachment
III describes, in general, the records declassified and
released (separate detailed indices will be provided when
documents are released to the National Archives and Records
Administration). Attachment IV addresses questions raised
by the Board regarding perceived gaps in our records,
including possible loss or destruction of records.
Attachment V discusses specific requests from the Board and
incorporates specific CIA responses by reference. And
Attachment VI addresses commitments which this Agency makes
with regard to provision to the National Archives and
Records Administration of assassination related documents,
including any documents which may be newly discovered or
created subsequent to the tenure of the Board.

6. Based upon the foregoing and the attachments
(Attachments I through VI, which are incorporated by
reference) I believe that the CIA is in full compliance with
the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107).
I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING AND
THE ATTACHMENTS (ATTACHMENTS I THROUGH VI, WHICH ARE
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE) ARE TRUE AND CORRECT.

ATTACHMENT IV.
Perceived Gaps in CIA Records
Summary. This Attachment addresses the Board's
requested explanation for the apparent absence of files
which are known to have existed (or for which there is some
evidence that they existed at one time) but cannot now be
located. Specifically, the Board asked for such information
on the following: Oswald files; certain files of James
Angleton; DCI McCone files; William Pawley; and Win Scott.
This Attachment also addresses the Board's request that the
Agency's Declaration "...identify any other records relating
to Oswald or the assassination that CIA knows to have been
destroyed or removed from CIA files."
Discussion.
Files on Lee Harvey Oswald
(a) The Office of Security (OS) maintained a pre-
assassination subject file on Oswald. This file contained
newspaper articles and reports from other government
agencies. As would be expected, the number of volumes of
the subject file grew following the assassination.
The pre-
assassination material remained in volume one and subsequent
material was filed in volumes numbered II through VI.
However, during a February 1997 search, no volume V was
found. A second thorough search of the OS file system
failed to produce any record of Volume V. A careful page-
by-page review of the contents of the existing volumes
revealed there is no time gap in the material. Therefore,
it is believed the label on Volume VI is simply incorrect;
it should have been labeled Volume V.
The OS Oswald subject file was reviewed by the HSCA in
1978; however, it was not stored with the rest of the
sequestered material. There is no documentation on why this
file was not incorporated into the sequestered collection
held by the DO; eight boxes of non-Oswald OS files were in
the collection. The Oswald Security File has been reviewed,
declassified, and released to NARA.
-
(b) There has been considerable interest over the years in
locating any electronic surveillance tapes that would have
been made during the period that Oswald visited Mexico (26
September 2 October 1963). A thorough search has been
conducted of the DO's record system as well as the index to
retired records in an attempt to locate any tapes and/or
find documentation to resolve their disposition. We have
discussed this issue with operational experts and their

--- Image 104-10332-10023_page_40.jpeg ---
14-00000
1
professional opinion is that most likely such tapes were
never returned to Headquarters for retention. It was normal
practice to recycle audio tapes after they had been listened
to by transcribers and their transcripts made.
Messages between field stations and headquarters used
operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that
can sometimes allow for misinterpretations. Thus, possible
confusion was created when references to what was being sent
to headquarters referred to “tapes" but really intend
“information" from tapes.
In our search efforts we did locate approximately 185
audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban and Soviet embassies
in Mexico City that were recorded during the immediate time
following the assassination (22 November 1963 to January
1964). The fact that these tapes were retained and returned
to Headquarters could account for the fact that some people
recall that some tapes existed which were sent to
Headquarters.
Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken and
the opinions of operational experts consulted, CIA has
concluded that the tapes in question do not exist and were
almost certainly recycled in the normal course of business
before their potential value was identified.
James J. Angleton (Chief, CounterIntelligence Staff, 1954-
1974)
As noted in a 24 August 1998 memo to the Board, the
files of Mr. Angleton were incorporated within the files of
the CI Staff and the Directorate of Operations. Three
memoranda, dated 23 November 1976, 5 August 1977, and 29
November 1979, detail the review and incorporation into
the DO Central Records System of the Angleton files as well
as all the files found in CI Staff following Mr. Angleton's
departure. As a result of this review and incorporation of
files, there is no identifiable collection of Angleton
files. The three memoranda mentioned above have been
included in the Agency's JFK collection for processing and
release to NARA.
John McCone
(Director of Central Intelligence, 1961-1965)
Within the McCone papers are several file folders with
notations that indicate documents are missing. However,
each folder has an index of the documents that were
originally within it. Of all the missing documents only two
refer to the Kennedy assassination. One document is
described as "Date of Meeting - 26 Nov; Participants

Records Relating to Oswald or the Assassination known to
have been destroyed or removed.
In November 1997, the Information Management Officer of
the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) advised that he
had discovered a record which indicated a file that referred
to the Kennedy assassination had been destroyed on "5/1/95”.
A search for information on this document revealed that the
document had been created in 1977 and was described as
"allegations regarding the Lee Harvey Oswald file.” It was
included with other documents grouped under the description:
"Individual Case Files Consists of documents
-
accumulated in investigating complaints, suggestions,
or problems of individuals which are brought to the
attention of the IG. Filed numerically by case number.
Potential cases filed alphabetically."
It has been confirmed that copies of the documents were
made available to the HSCA and are in the sequestered
collection. The OIG has reconstructed the file and will
maintain it as a permanent record. Documentation is
provided at Tab 1.

-
-
Both documents were noted as missing when the files
were reviewed by the CIA History Staff in November 1986.
William Pawley
(Industrialist; friend of DCI Dulles and
supporter of Anti-Castro activities)
The JFK collection contains a 201 file on Mr. Pawley
that ends in 1962. The Directorate of Operations determined
that material through 1965 that should have been in the 201
file was filed in an operational file. Most of the material
was already within the JFK collection. The Board staff
reviewed all the documents within the operational file and
selected additional documents for inclusion in the JFK
collection. This material will be processed for release to
NARA.
J
Win Scott (Chief of Station, Mexico City, 1956-1969)
The Agency's Retired Record Table (RRT) shows Mr.
Scott's Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-00594R on
11 August 1972. These records were retired to the Agency's
Archives and Records Center under Item Number 40-76 in the
DO Records Control Schedule in effect at that time. Files
under Item Number 40-76 were described as:
"Temporary. Destroy upon completion of a specific job
or as they serve their purpose. Return folders and
documents on loan and destroy remaining papers."
The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12 January.
1987, based upon reference to Item Number 40-76 of the
Records Control Schedule.
The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr. Scott's
files and the page of the Records Control Schedule which
describes Item Number 40-76 have been incorporated in the
Agency's JFK collection and will be processed for release to
NARA.
Certain Station Files
Within the Board's guidance for CIA's compliance
declaration, the Board asked that the Agency specifically
address the existence, non-existence or destruction of files
3

}
The
from two stations in its Final Compliance Statement.
two stations in question are Mexico City for the period
1963-1964, and Moscow for the period 1959-1962.
It has been long-standing practice and policy that
materials that the DO keeps in the field are for immediate
operational needs, and that record materials are to be
returned to Headquarters for safekeeping. Limited storage
space overseas as well as the risk of physical loss in the
event of civil unrest or the need for evacuation are
contributing factors to this policy. Once at Headquarters,
these materials are normally organized by topic or subject
rather than by station because this is the way that work is
performed. Particularly with paper records and the passage
of significant time, it is extremely difficult if not
impossible to reconstruct with any confidence, a full set of
documents for any particular station.
We do know that files from Mexico City Station are
listed in the documents found in the sequestered collection
and the Oswald 201 file materials. This divergence from
normal practice with respect to these files can be explained
by the obvious high interest of the Warren Commission in the
events in Mexico City surrounding the time of the assassin-
ation (as shown by the fact that they are contained in the
Warren Commission materials). It would not have been normal
practice at the time for the Agency to keep these records in
this form. Thus, other than the materials in the sequest-
ered collection and the Oswald 201 file, we have been unable
to identify collections of records which would represent
files for the two stations for the periods requested.
HTLINGUAL
The Church and Pike Committees both expressed concern
about HTLINGUAL, a mail opening project which held
information on American citizens. As a result of these
investigations, CIA was directed by court order to destroy
all HTLINGUAL material. It is reasonable to believe that an
HTLINGUAL file existed on Lee Harvey Oswald; however, along
with all other files designated as HTLINGUAL files, it would
have been destroyed in accordance with the court order.
Within the JFK sequestered collection, there are HTLINGUAL
materials on Oswald materials which were apparently
copied from the HTLINGUAL files before they were destroyed
in accordance with the court order. It is not possible,
however, to say that everything on Oswald that was held in
the HTLINGUAL file wound up in the JFK collection.

EXDIR Declaration Signature, 23 September 1998
Memorandum for the Record:
This is to confirm that I replaced the first page of the ExDir's signed JFK Declaration, dated 23
September, with letterhead stationery to assure that the statement was comparable to that signed
by Mr. Cohen, as earlier requested by the Board Chairman. The wording of the declaration was
unchanged; only the letterhead stationery was changed. I called Michelle in the EXDIR's Officer to
confirm that the Executive Director would have no problem with such a change (simply replacing
the first page). She called back, saying that she had asked Mr. Carey, and he had no problem with
this change.
Mr. Harrelson of this office will be hand carrying the EXDIR's declaration to the Board today. At the
same time, and in accordance with my agreement with Chairman Tunheim of yesterday, Mr.
Harrelson will be retrieving the earlier declaration signed by Mr. Cohen, the DCI letter of 16
September, both of which are being withdrawn. The Judge Tunheim also agreed yesterday that
since the EXDIR had agreed to sign the declaration that there will no longer be a need for the critical
language in their report on this issue.

Attachment V
Specific Requests From the Board
Summary. The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act
of 1992 mandates a number of specific actions on behalf of
all government departments and agencies. One of these is
to:
"...make available to the Review Board any
additional information and records that
the Review Board has reason to believe it
requires for conducting a review under
this Act." (Sec. 5(c) 2 H.)
In the exercise of this authority under the Act, the Board
made fifty-three specific requests for additional records
and information in the form of sixteen (16) requests
designated as "formal" and thirty-seven (37) designated as
"informal." On each request, the CIA worked closely with
the Board and Board staff to provide the information and/or
documents requested and a written response which records
such actions.
Discussion.
As a part of this Final Declaration, the
CIA has attached at Tab 1 a list of the fifty-three requests
by number and a short description of the subject of each.
At the Board's request this attachment includes at Tab 2 the
specific response to the request numbered CIA-16 (Oswald
Pre-Assassination File)
Beyond the fifty-three requests, the Board raised two
additional matters which tend to fall within the category of
special requests:
1) A request that the Agency review and declassify the
Board's interviews of former CIA officer and Mexico City
station employee, Anne Goodpasture; the Agency's response to
that request is complete.
2) A request for Board staff access to sealed
Rockefeller Commission records held by the Library of
Congress; these records were given to the Library by
Rockefeller via a deed of gift which requires a letter from
the DCI before access can be granted. This letter will be
completed by 9 September 1998.

Dear Dr. Gunn:
Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)
This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent
request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had
on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments
and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of
Security questions. The DO response is pending.
1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum
containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel
Security which provides details about the files it had on
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they
were created. These include the Office of Security file on
Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.
2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which
explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald.
particular, it explains why the "missing" volume V may never
have existed..
3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald
Security file and the file on American defectors.
In
4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB
· staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will
be processed according to current release guidelines.
If you have any questions about this response, please
advise.
Sincerely,
J. Barry Harrelson

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
22 December 1997
1. Pursuant to ARRB "Resquet No. CIA-16, the Office of
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following
responses are provided to those questions which pertain to
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are
the best reasonable answers based on available information.
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to
1 October 1994.
Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.
Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office
of Security (OS) held two files which contained information
on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled “Defectors File“
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (%230351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.
2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search
of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any
of these files. Attached is all of the available
information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL
files. This information was retrieved from the Information
Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review
of general office administrative files.

--- Image 104-10332-10023_page_58.jpeg ---
14-00000
Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on
Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the
purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that
were in the file at the time of the assassination.
Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been
destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:
#0077826
#0090079
#0093466
#0119144
Opened approximately July 1952
Opened approximately February 1953
Opened approximately July 1953
Opened approximately May 1955
3. HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In the Office of Security this project was known
as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,
INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually
conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the
acquired information being referred to the Directorate of
Operations.
4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This file contained information was from press clippings,
Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed
services. The pre-assassination documents located in this
file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:
a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959
entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at
15"

Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing
known defectors to the USSR, Red China, Cuba, and

5. The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data
on each name. This listing was maintained separately from
the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors
File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently
charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of
Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its
disposition have been unsuccessful.
6. Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors
File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
An employee of this office was, recalls the Defector Machine
Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick
and in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical
index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second
part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and
contained the limited biographic data on each name.
7.
The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald
(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file
was created as a separate repository for the numerous press
clippings and reports received from other government
agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
and his activities following his return to the United
States. The first volume of this file appears to have been
preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
contained in this file are as follows:

Declaration of EDMUND COHEN
(
I, Edmund Cohen, hereby declare and say:
1. I presently serve as the Director of Information
Management for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA or
Agency). I have held this position since February 1994; I
have also held the position of Director of the Office of
Information Management since October 1997. I have served
with the CIA for over 30 years in a variety of intelligence,
legal, staff, and management positions.
2. As Director of Information Management, I am
responsible for providing oversight and direction to the
Agency's records and classification management activities,
and information declassification and release programs. I am
also responsible for the development and maintenance of
automated tools to support these activities. I oversee
classification and declassification policies, procedures,
and practices. I manage the Agency Archives and Records
Center, and serve as the CIA Archivist and the Agency.
Information Review Officer. I coordinate the conduct of
special searches within the Agency and the release of
information uncovered in such searches. I am also the
Agency's official liaison with the National Archives and
Records Administration and its Office of the Federal
Register, with the Information Security Oversight Office,
and with any other entities on any matters within the
responsibility or authority of the Director of Information
Management.
3.
I make the following statements based upon my
personal knowledge, information made available to me in my

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.
Response: It is believed that OS holdings on Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM:
SUBJECT:
Janet A. Ecklund
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security
OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
AIN: 0351164
1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study
of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of
Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was.
generated by the John F. Kennedy Board's desire to review and
declassify relevant material. The results of this review were
forwarded to the HRG/CSI on 27 February 1997.
2. During the Information Management Branch's
(IMB) research in response to the above tasking it was noted that
Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes
I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where
the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The
IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an
all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find
Volume V.
3. In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by
page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt
was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know
what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any
persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.
4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no
time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall
ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V
had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never
existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have
been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this
error to occur.

DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16
Oswald Pre-Assassination Files
The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO
records to determine if there were any additional files
containing pre-assassination records relating to
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.
CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were
incorporated into the 201.
Prior to establishing a 201, any documents received
would have been placed in an operational interest file.
We found no reference to the existence of an
operational file. If such a file had existed, however,
it might not have been registered in the central index.
It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the
documents from an interest file would be transferred to
the 201.
Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL
operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a
file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files
under court order, and no record was made of what files
existed. We did not review all of the DO record system
to destroy all copies of material which may have been
derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for
instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to
Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection
In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the
information we are aware of that we had prior to the
assassination.

documents increased, a separate file was created to be the
repository of information on the alleged American defector.
There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate
file exists on Oswald.
9.
Both the Defectors File (#30341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (%230351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.
10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to
detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years.
SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.
11. A representataive of the Office of Personnel
Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission
and functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time
period. He made inquiries relating to the above request,
and the OPS/Information Management Officer retrieved retired
policy records for review. The information on the mission
and function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office
of Security administrative and historical files as well as a
review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

"Custody of CIA Assassination Records to be Released in
2017.”
The CIA proposes that the classified versions of Lee
Harvey Oswald's Security File and "A" File along with Marina
Oswald's original 201 be transferred to the protected
(secure) portion of the JFK Collection At NARA by 30
September 1998. The CIA will need to retain custody of the
classified version of the original Oswald 201 and the CIA-
HSCA sequestered collection to complete the review of
duplicate documents by September 1999.
In September 1999, the classified versions of the
Oswald 201 (original and microfilm from the sequestered
collection) will be transferred to NARA. Due to the
sensitive nature of the information in the remaining
sequestered collection, particularly the NBR material, CIA
proposes that the Agency and National Archives work out a
joint custody arrangement that would allow these record to
remain in CIA physical custody until 2017.

Post-September 1998 Discovery of Assassination Records.
Diligent searches have been made and we are aware of no
assassination records being withheld from the Board.
However, given the Agency's decentralized records systems,
it is possible that assassination-related documents will be
discovered in the future. A guide has been prepared for
those officers whose work requires them to review Agency
documents and material (Executive Order Review, FOIA, etc.)
that may be subject to the JFK Act. Any assassination
records that are discovered will be processed according to
JFK release standards and forwarded to NARA. A copy of the
guide is attached. (TAB 1)
• Referrals not complete by 30 September 1998. The CIA
proposes that it complete its review and return to
originating agency by April 1999 all unreviewed third
agency referral documents which were received prior to 30
September 1998. To date the following referral have been
identified for possible post-September 1998 review:
a. Army's Investigative Records Repository (from Review
Board):
File on Alfredo Mirabal Diaz
b. SSCI
--
Church Committee Records
(to be identified by Review Board staff)
c. JFK Presidential Library:
151 pages
TBD pages
Records from Robert Kennedy files
1484 pages
These documents have not been formally designated as
Assassination Records. The CIA proposes that these be
handled in a manner similar to the John F. Kennedy
National Security Files on Cuba that were reviewed in
1996 by a joint CIA-State-DOD-Review Board task force.

Executive Order
JFK Records Review Project
(U) The following is intended as a guide for those
people whose work requires them to review Agency documents
and materials that may be subject to the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.
Some of the records within the Agency's JFK collection are
assassination specific, others are ancillary. They deal
with individuals and events not directly linked with Oswald
or the assassination; but they are thought to have had a
relationship to the assassination, or investigation into the
assassination.
I. The Agency's JFK Collection.
(U)
The Agency's JFK records collection is made up
primarily of records pulled together for the Warren
Commission and House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA). There were eighty-one (81) Records Center-sized
boxes in the original collection. Of these, the first
seventeen (17) made up the Oswald 201 file. The next sixty-
four (64) are referred to as the "JFK files" or sequestered
collection and break down as follows: thirty-four (34) boxes
of DO materials; nine (9) boxes of Office of Security files;
fifteen (15) boxes of OLC materials; two (2) boxes each of
OGC and IG materials; and one (1) box of DDS&T documents.
HSCA originated material, including notes by HSCA staff
members, are found throughout the collection. Box 64
contains seventy two (72) reels of microfilm.
(U)
The microfilm contains copies of complete files to
which the HSCA had access during its investigation. In
addition to the Oswald 201 file (12 reels), the microfilm
includes: 201 files on Cubans, Americans, and Soviets linked
to Oswald, the JFK assassination or the various
investigations (approximately 26 reels) and the Cuban
Revolutionary Council and other exile group activities
(approximately 13 reels); the personnel files of CIA staff
employees (approximately 5 reels); and operational files on
organizations, projects, and other subjects of interest to
the HSCA investigation (approximately 16 reels).

After reading the note below, I spoke with the GC, who working with Bob Caudle, was seeking to have
included in the Board statement the fact that the DCI had sent a letter endorsing my declaration. I
suggested to the GC that even with this addition, the JFK Board comment would be most unfortunate.
The whole six year effort was designed to put to rest all of the conspiracy theories and this comment
would undercut the effort. In addition, it likely would result in significant additional questions, additional
work for OIM, OCA, OGC and PAS, and put the Agency in a bad light. I suggested that I should ask the
EXDIR to sign the declaration. The GC interposed no objection. I then spoke with the EXDIR who agreed
to sign a declaration if this would satisfy the situation. I informed the GC that the EXDIR was willing to
sign and the GC asked me to inform Bob Caudle, which I did. After you spoke with Judge Tunheim and
got his agreement to: 1) return the Cohen declaration and the DCI letter and substitute the EXDIR
declaration, and 2) eliminate the "blurb," I had the EXDIR sign the declaration.
I subsequently briefed the DDA, ADDA, and ADDA/IS. of the above.

(U). We continue to identify other collections of documents
that properly belong within the JFK collection. These
include: The Oswald Security File; Agency working files
generated by JFK assassination investigations and requests;
and CIA documents found by other agencies and Presidential
Libraries and referred to CIA for review under the JFK Act.
II. The Time Frame of JFK Assassination Records.
(U) In general, the time frame of JFK records commences
when Oswald arrived at the US air base (the U-2) at Atsugi,
Japan, in December 1957 and continues through the end of the
Garrison investigation in 1968. Note, however, for
information which is clearly related to the story of the JFK
assassination or its investigations, there is no time frame
limitation. Any document or request that deals with the
assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the various conspiracy
theories should be referred to the HRG/JFK review project.
III. Key Topics, Etc.
(U)
Certain individuals, organizations, places,
projects, and subjects are central to the Oswald/JFK story
and the ensuing investigations, which causes a number of
documents with no mention of Oswald or the assassination to
fall within the purview of the JFK Act. Clearly, it is not
possible to list every category of document which may have
been reviewed and released under the JFK Assassination
Records Act. The following categories contain examples of
information that are considered to be within the JFK
review.

Declaration of EDMUND COHEN
'
4. The Central Intelligence Agency: (a) has made
diligent records searches to locate and disclose to the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) all records
in its possession relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the
assassination of President Kennedy; and (b) is aware of no
other assassination-related records in its possession being
withheld from the Board.
5. With respect to the overall issues of search and
review, and as explained in the attachments or otherwise
included by reference, the CIA's Directorates of
Intelligence (DI), Operations (DO), Science and Technology
(DS&T), and Administration (DA) and the DCI Area Information
Review Officer have certified to me that their respective
offices or directorates have properly and fully responded to
requests from the Board. In addition to these
certifications, I have had briefings on the principal .
searches conducted and have had all of my questions answered
to my satisfaction. Accordingly, I believe that the Central
Intelligence Agency has worked diligently with the Board to
locate and declassify, consistent with the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, as
amended, reprinted at 44 U.S.C. 2107 note, and other
statutes, assassination-related records in its possession,
in order to make such records available to the public.

*6: There are six attachments, numbered I through VI,
to this declaration, which I incorporate herein by
reference. Attachment I addresses the universe and scope of
documents that have been the subject of CIA's review.
Attachment II describes the methodology and types of the
searches conducted. Attachment III describes, in general,
the records declassified and released. Separate detailed
indices will be provided when documents are released to the

The CIA refused. The Board then, as an alternative, asked the highest officials of the Agency
Executive Director and General Counsel -- to certify that CIA had met its obligations under the JFK Act
and that no records on Oswald or assassination were withheld. The CIA refused. Instead, the CIA
designated its Director of Information Management to sign CIA's Declaration of Compliance. In the
Board's view, CIA's highest officials should have been willing to certify, under oath, that the Agency has
complied with all the requirements of the JFK Act. The CIA's failure to do so raises serious concerns for
the Board that the CIA has in fact fully complied with the JFK Act."

1. Barbara Blufer, declare and state based on my personal knowledge and the Information made
available to me in my official capacity that:
1. I am the Information Review Officer for (IRO) for the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) of
the Central Intelligence Agency (Agency). I was appointed to this position on 6 October 1997 and
have held various administrative and professional positions within the Agency since (1980). I am
responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the DI that may contain JFK
Assassination records and may be responsive to Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB)
requests.
2. Since assuming my present position, I have had limited contact with the ARRB. With
respect to matters prior to 6 October 1997, this statement has been prepared with inputs from my
predecessor, Richard J. Flynn, who occupied my current position during the DI's principal contact
with the Board.
3. Mr. Flynn has reported that, to ensure that the ARRB staff understood the DI records
system and search capabilities, the DVIRO and the DI Information Management Officer, Ms.
Diana Hastings, briefed the staff on 13 May 1997. Other DI participants at the meeting were
Joyce Jump, Marie Menefee, and lisa Hartman. These officers were at that time assigned to the
DI Office of Information Resources. Ms. Hastings focused on the current DI records keeping
system, and, as best we could, the system that existed in the 1980s. Di participants stressed
that the Direcords keeping system has evolved over time and that the DI Is continuously striving
to achieve greater consistency in our procedures. DI participants candidly Informed the ARRB
staff that none of them at the meeting had first hand knowledge of DI records keeping in the
1960s, and b) the system in place at that time was entirely paper-based and therefore could not
be considered as accurate as the present system. Members of the ARRB sald they understood
this limitation
.
4. Mr. Flynn further reported that based on his recollection, Mr. Flynn is aware of
limited number of records searches the DI conducted in direct response to ARRB requests. On
11 June 1997, DI personnel met with members of the ARRB. Mr. Flynn had arranged this
meeting earlier to give ARRB staffers, Michelle Combs and Bob Skwrlot, an even more detailed
briefing of DI's document search capabilities. The topics they asked the DI to search are noted in
an attached memorandum to Barry Harrelson dated 17 June 1997.. The result of further
searches (CIA -9) are summarized a 19 June 1997 memorandum a member of the DI/IRO's staff
prepared for Mr. Barry Harrelson, CIA's point of contact on the JFK assassination issue. This
memorandum is also attached.
5. On 21 August, Mr. Harrelson contacted me for a further search of DI records, asking
specifically that the DI follow up on a previously search by extending the timeframe covered In
that original search. According to Mr. Harrelson, the ARRB requested a search for all documents
concėming Mexico, Cuba, or the USSR for the period from 20 November 1963 to 6 December
1963. On the basis of this request, a search was conducted 32 documents not belonging to the
DI were located. The materials were turned over to Mr. Harrelson.
6. All employees of the Directorate of Intelligence have been furnished with a copy of
DCI Tenet's 22 July 1998 directive to all employees requiring them to search records in their
possession for Information related to the JFK assassination that might not have been found in the
course of the searches conducted over the past 6 years.
7. 1 declare under penalty of perjury that foregoing is true and correct.

2. By memo date 6 April 1995, the Executive Director (CIA)
requested that focal points for each Directorate be
appointed to be responsible for responding to requests for
information from the Assassination Records Review Board-
(ARRB): Until that time the Historical Review Group (HRG)
of the Center for the Studies of Intelligence (CSI) had been
the principal liaison with the JFK Board. As of that date,
DCI area/IRO was appointed to be the DCI area focal point.
HRG would continue to receive requests from the Board
forwarding them to the Directorate focal point for action.
Responses from the Directorate were coordinated by HRG,
which then made the responses available to the Board.
the
3. In an effort to understand the DCI area records systems
and to ensure the conduct of thorough searches and responses,
ARRB staff requested a meeting with the DCI area/IRO and key DCI
records management officers. Detailed questions were presented in
advance to CIA personnel who then provided complete responses to
the ARRB staff during the summer of 1997. At that time HRG
instructed my predecessor to wait for formal taskings from ARRB
before proceeding with additional searches.

See Attachment 1
Based on personal knowledge and information reflected in
the records of the DCI area/IRO, I am aware that the
following searches and reviews were conducted in response to
Board requests for DCI area records.

IG Reports
On 3 August 1998, the DCI area/IRO informed HRG that OIG does not
maintain an index or inventory of IG cases. All reports and
material prepared by the IG on the JFK assassination were turned
over to the Office of External Affairs (OEXA). There is no
indication that a report on the handling of Oswald was ever
prepared.

The ARRB staff provided a list of McCone records that they wished
to review: The DCI area/IRO, in turn, gave the ARRB staff
complete access to the McCone files in March 1998. The records
selected by the Board's staff are being processed for release.
On 30 April 1998, the DCI area/IRO was notified that the request
was complete. The DCI area was then notified on 3 August the
there were missing McCone files that remained of interest to the
Board. As soon as we receive a list of the missing files, we
will begin an in-depth review of Executive Registry records in an
effort to locate the missing file

5. In addition to the formal requests, the DCI area/IRO
completed the declassification review of three NIEs, documents
from the Ford and Kennedy libraries, and an IG Report.
See Attachment 13
6. As this declaration demonstrates, the DCI area/IRO including
predecessors, to the best of his/her ability has caused thorough
searches of the DCI area systems of records for records related
to the JFK assassination not included in the CIA-HSCA Sequestered
Collection and will place any newly discovered or created
assassination records into the JFK collection.

The DA conducted file searches in OS and HRM for records on Theodore Shackley, Ronald Cross,
Bart Henry, Doug Gupton, David Morales. We were subsequently advised by HRP that the David Morales
OS file was part of the collection so the OS searched for records on the first four names only. OS
identified files on Shackley, Cross and Gupton which were reviewed by the ARRB staff. HRM identified
files on Morales and Shackley which were provided to HRP. Neither office surfaced records on Bart
Henry. (Attachment 4)

DECLARATION OF BECKY L. RANT
I, Becky L. Rant, declare and say as follows:
1. I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the Directorate of Administration (DA) of the
Central Intelligence Agency (Agency). I was appointed to this position on 3 February 1997, and have held
various administrative and professional positions within the Agency since 1965. I am responsible for the
review of records maintained by offices in the DA, Office of the Deputy Director of Administration
(ODDA), Center for CIA Security (CCS-formerly the Office of Security ((OS)), Office of Human Resource
Management (HRM), Office of Medical Services (OMS), Office of Finance and Logistics (OFL), Office of
Communications (OC), Office of Training and Education (OTE), Office of Facilities and Security Services
(OFSS), Agency Technology Services (ATS), Center for Security Evaluation (CSE), that may contain JFK
Assassination records and may be responsive to Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) requests.
2. To ensure that the ARRB staff understood the DA records systems and search capabilities, the
DAMIRO and DA Information Management Officer (DA/IMO) briefed the staff on 17 March 1997. The
briefing focused on the DA records systems that existed in the 1960s and the current records systems.
Questions that were provided by the staff prior to the briefing were discussed and an individual from the
Office of Communications (OC) attended to answer questions related to cable processing in the 1960s. In
addition to OC participation, the Offices of Finance & Logistics (OFL), Human Resource Management
(HRM), and Security (OS) provided written responses to the list of questions submitted by the staff. It was
agreed that the additional questions raised by the staff during the briefing would be tasked to the directorate
formally by the Agency JFK Focal Point/Historical Review Program (HRP). An outline of the records
briefing and a copy of the advance questions and the answers provided appear as Attachment 1.
3. Based on personal knowledge and on information reflected in the records of the DA/IRO, I am
aware of the following searches that were conducted in response to specific AARB requests for DA records:
CIA 1 - Information on Organization of CIA
The DA provided from the records of the Regulatory Services Group/ODDA copies of Agency
regulations and notices pertaining to the organizational structure of the Agency during the time periods
specified by the ARRB staff. DA/IRO gave approval for the cleared staff members to review the material.
Subsequently the DA/IRO approved release of the following items:
release)
31 mission statements and organization charts for the DDA (DDS) and Office of Security (full
2 organization charts and mission statement of the Office of Communications (OC) (sanitized)
16 Agency mission, function and organization charts (full release with concurrence of the other
directorates) (Attachment 2)
CIA-7-Histories
The DA JFK Focal Point reviewed the index of histories produced by the CIA History Program
for release to the ARRB and approved access with certain restrictions. There is no record in the DA/IRO's
office that the staff requested access to the DA histories on the list. (Attachment 3)

information. In addition, the offices of the Directorate of Administration have certified to me that all
employees have been furnished with a copy of DCI Tenet's 22 July 1998 directive to all employees
requiring them to search records in their possession for information related to the JFK Assassination that
