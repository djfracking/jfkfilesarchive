FORMANCE NORMALLY, AN EXPERIENCED OFFICER REQUIRES THREE MONTHS ON-THE-JOB TRAINING
PLUS ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME ON SHIFT BEFORE HE IS READY TO COPE, WITHOUT STRONG
SUPPORT OR SUPERVISION, WITH ALL THE PROBLEMSONNECTED WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT. MR.HICKS
JOINED THE UNIT ON 5 JUNE, COMPLETED A SHORTENED OUT PERIOD AND HAS BEEN ON SHIFT ONLY
SINCE LATE SUMMER: HE HAS APPLIED HERSELF WITH DILIGENCE. TO LEARNING THE PRINCIPLES.
AND TECHNIQUES OF TD DISSEMINATIONS FROM CABLED FIELD INFORMATION REPORTS. ALTHOUGH
EXPERIENCED OPERATIONALLY, HE HAS QUITE NATURALLY LACKED THE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE THAT
THIS JOB REQUIRES. HE HAS MADE VERY GRATIFYING PROGRESS, BUT HE STILL MUST MASTER
KNOWLEDGE IN DEPTH PECULIAR TO THE IW FUNCTION; WHILE I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT HE CAN
HANDLE ROUTINE DISSEMINATION MATTERS WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY, AND SOME "PROBLEM" DIS-
SEMINATION CASES, HE HAS YET TO MEET A. REAL CRISIS SITUATION WHEN HE IS ON DUTY, BY HIM-
SELF. I THINK HE HAS MOVED FROM ADEQUACY OF PERFORMANCE TO PROFICIENCY--IT BEING VERY
DIFFICULT TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE TWO--AND HE IS LARGELY BEYOND THE POINT WHERE HE
NEEDS CLOSE SUPERVISION. HE WILL PROBABLY BE A STRONG-OFFICER GIVEN TIME.
HE HAS
ADAPTED WELL TO THE PRESSURES OF THIS ASSIGNMENT AND APPEARS TO HAVE THE PHYSICAL AÑO
MENTAL STAMINA TO WITHSTAND ITS. RIGORS. HE IS EXTREMELY CONSCIENTIOUS AND VERY ACCON-
MODATING IN ACCEPTING SCHEDULE CHANGES RECESSITATED BY THE ILLNESS OR ABSENCE OF HIS
FELLOW OFFICERS. HE GETS ALONG WELL WITH CABLE SECRETARIAT PERSONNEL, WITH WHOM TW
MUST WORK VERY CLOSELY, BECAUSE OF AN OUTGOING AND FRIENDLY PERSONALITY. HE RESPONDS
WELL TO DIRECTION. I AM SURE THAT HIS COOPERATIVE ATTITUDE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE
SMOOTH OPERATION OF THE OFFICE. THIS ASSIGNMENT CARRIES NO SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES
AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEMONSTRATION OF COST CONSCIOUSNESS.

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD
Course objectives are to aid participants to: 'learn the managerial theories
contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid
terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action
skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique
for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization
Culture and Development.
In
The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of
level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense.
Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective
solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly
assessed, Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness.
Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might
change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus
managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing
themselves.
About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights
gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate
student achievement in this course.

Desk.
lombia
This report is being submitted because of reassignment of
the rating officer.
$
Although Mr. Hicks is an experienced officer with strong,
qualifications and abilities, it should be noted that some aspects
of his present job were a new experience for him, since his past
(experience has been entirely in the PM field. However, Mr. Hicks
adapted well and quickly to the new environment, showed a great
deal of initiative and resourcefulness in familiarizing himself
with the work, and by bringing sound operational and administrative
experience to bear, carried out his duties in a thoroughly competent
manner. He demonstrated uncommon ability to organize his work,
anticipate problems or requirements, and take effective action
promptly. In dealings with his associates he exercised a good
balance of persuasiveness and friendliness which paid dividends
in terms of getting a job done. He can be relied on absolutely
to carry out a given task promptly and well.
.
I would welcome any occasion which permitted Mr. Hicks to
work with me again.

Mr. Hicks is a mature and thoughtful individual who made
the switch from PM to FI activities at his own volition. He
was originally scheduled for a field assignment to a WH Station
in the fall of 1966, but for medical reasons will probably be
staying at Headquarters for some time. While this restriction
may limit his ability to get that feel for FI field operations
which a Headquarters desk officer should have, he has previous
field experience in a PM capacity to compensate for this.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence Staff
SUBJECT
Intelligence Watch Assistance to
European Division
1. As I am preparing to leave the European Division,
a note of appreciation is in order for the services rendered
to us for the four years of my tenure here by the officers
of the Intelligence Watch.
•
1.17
2. At a time of increasingly complicated intelligence
collection and reporting problems, our Agency has come of
age. We have recognized that information often cannot be
allowed to wait for attention until sunrise, and that we
must be able to respond to national needs and world events
pround the clock. The Intelligence Watch, more than any
other single institution, has made it possible for us to
do this. We have benefited from its cooperation particularly
under strained reporting conditions during Presidential.
trips abroad, for instance - but have also found IW's
presence and judgment helpful at other times. I know that
my staff relied on IW extensively.
'
3. I am making a point of recognizing this because
the Intelligence Watch -- a bit like our Agency as a whole
is apt to get more attention with an occasional slip than
with a record of continuing accomplishment and success in
coping with problems. From what I have been able to observe,
the job has been well done.
4. I hope you will bring this memorandum to the
attention of those concerned.

LANGUAGE TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
The general aims of language training are attainment of proficiency in speaking, understanding, reading and
writing. The specific objectives are (1) ability to produce and distinguish the sounds of the language; (2) ability
to use a stock of basic sentences and expressions; (3). àbility to recombine the elements of basic sentences and ex-
pressions and to apply them to new situations; (4) ability to comprehend the language spoken at normal speed in vari-
ous situations; (5) ability to write and read the language commensurate with ability to speak.
Methods used in all courses stress oral drills, and free conversation based at first on memorized material and,
at a later stage, on varied reading materials, written and oral tests are given at intervals. Listening to and re-
cording on tapes in the Language Lab is essential for class preparation. .

Mr. Hicks' primary responsibility has been to provide Head-
quarters support and guidance for the PM activities directed by the
Miami Station against the Cuban target. Mr. Hicks has shown a high
degree of professional judgment in carrying out his duties, and his
judgment is respected by senior officials who are required to submit
the PM programs for high-level approval. During operational phases
of the PM programs, Mr. Hicks is frequently required to be on call
to act on emergency situations on a 24-hour basis. He has accepted
this responsibility willingly. He has consistently taken the initia-
tive in investigating technical developments which might provide
assistance to the Station in the conduct of PM operations.
supervises two professional and two clerical employees in his Section
and runs his unit smoothly with no discernible friction. He does a
good job of briefing and indoctrinating junior officers. While his
experience has been predominantly in the PM field, he has acquired
FI experience in the last two years because of the unique nature of
Cuban PM (FI) operations. In his consideration of budgetary matters,
he has demonstrated an understanding of the need to curtail expenses,
where feasible. ∙I would be glad to have Mr. Hicks work with me at
any future time.

Mr. Hicks has an exceptional knowledge of and experience with the problems
involved in the conduct and support of covert PM operations. He has shown
a high degree of initiative in providing the training and other support
required and in preparing material for staff présentation to higher echelons.
His attention to detail is a strength in accomplishing his duties but he
must try harder to overcome a tendency for too much detail in his staff
communications, oral and written. His written work in particular shows a
weakness in synthesizing which it is believed could be overcome by available
courses of training. Mr. Hicks has also reached the point where he must
broaden his outlook as to the wider political and operational implications
of PM operations. To this end, it is intended that Mr. Hicks will attend
the Inter-Agency Counterinsurgency Course in the near future. Under an
experienced Chief of Operations, Mr. Hicks could handle PM operations at most
Field Stations; in a major operation such as Viet Nam or Cuba, he could ade-
quately handle a large segment such as PM Training, the handling of a large
indigenous group, or the duties of Chief/PM Operations or Deputy Chief, PM. He
would be a definite asset, in the field or at Hqs., in any type of task force.

Dear Mr. Hicker
For your information and convenience, an Annuity Statement has been

period 28 December 1974 through 28 February 1975.
Enclosed is a retiree identification card. Before using the document,
please sign your name in ink on the reverse side of the card.
This office is in receipt of your signed statement wherein you elected ·
to receive payment under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) ·
in lieu of a rotirement annuity under the CIA Retirement and Disability
System. Accordingly, your annuity ceased as of 28 February 1975 and you
will henceforth receive benefits under FECA. An adjustment will be made
in the payment issued by FECA retroactive to 28 December 1974. If, at a
later date, the determination is made that you are not permanently nor
totally disabled, your FECA payments might by reduced or stopped, at which
time you may request the initiation of your retirement annuity.
If you elect to receive an annuity instead of benefits under FECA, you
must so advise the Office of Federal Employees' Compensation, indicating
the date of this election. In addition, you should send a copy of your corre-
spondence with that office to the Agency. .

5 MARCH 1971
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE PROMOTION OF CALVIN W. Hicks
(056361) TO GS-14
1.1 RECOMMEND THE PROMOTION OF SUBJECT OFFICER FROM GS-13 To GS-14.
MR. HICKS HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH/FI STAFF SINCE JUNE
1967 AND SERVES ON A ROTATING" SCHEDULE WITH SEVEN OTHER" OFFICERs doing
IDENTICAL WORK, FOUR OF WHOM ARE CURRENTLY IN GRADE GS-14.
2. MR. HICKS HAS BEEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE WATCH (IW) FOR ALMOST.
FOUR YEARS AND HIS WORK, BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY, HAS BEEN
CONSISTENTLY OF A VERY HIGH CALIBER..
"
3. HIS KEENLY DEVELOPED SENSE OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY RESULTING FROM
HIS EXTENSIVE PARAMILITARY EXPERIENCE; COUPLED WITH. HIS CLEAR UNDERSTAND-
ING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE, HAS MADE HIM
A VERY FINE OFFICER AND, A VALUABLE ASSET TO IW. HE HAS BEEN UNDER MY SU-
PERVISION FOR 18 MONTHS AND I HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE HIST
PERFORMANCE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS. HE VERY ABLY APPLIES A MULTITUDE
OF DETAIL AND GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DIFFERENT. SITUATIONS
MANIFEST IN EACH INCOMING REPORT AND DISPLAYS INITIATIVE IN MEETING UN-
FORESEEN CRISES WITH RAPID AND EFFECTIVE ACTION. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE
INFORMATION IS THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICE PUTS OUT TO The in-
TELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE PERFORMANCE OF WATCH OFFICERS IS OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE. THIS FACTOR BECOMES APPARENT WHEN IT IS NOTED THAT OVER
75 PERCENT OF ALL CABLED INTELLIGENCE REPORTS ARE DISSEMINATED BY W.
4. MR. HICKS HAS AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND' IN PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS
BOTH IN THE FIELD AND AT HEADQUARTERS. ALL OF HIS FITNESS REPORTS FOR THE
SIX YEARS PRECEDING HIS ASSIGNMENT TO IW HAVE BORNE THE OVERALL RATING
OF "STRONG. HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "HIGHLY MOTIVATED, SINCERE, AND.
CAPABLE. ALSO, "HE WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS AND HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY
ARE RESPECTED. OTHER SUPERVISORS DURING THE YEARS PRIOR TO THIS ASSIGN-
*MENT HAVE DESCRIBED HIM AS "SERICUS, HARD-WORKING AND DEPENDABLE.
His
PERFORMANCE IN HIS PRESENT ASSIGNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THESE SAME QUALI -
TIES.
5. MR. HickS IS A DISTINCT ASSET TO IW AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND his
FOR PROMOTION TO GS-14.

Request for Quality Step Increase.
Mr. Calvin W. Hicks
17 March 1972
1. The GS-13 Evaluation Board for FY 1972, having carefully reviewed
the performance or all officers in grade GS-13 according to the standards
of HR 20-31a(3)(b), recommends Mr. Calvin W. Hicks for a Quality Step
Increase.
2. Mr. Hicks performed in a superior manner as a paramilitary officer
during the early years of his career, overseas and in Headquarters.
medical hold on overseas duty led to his assignment in 1967 to the Intelli-
gence Watch/FI Staff where he has remained up to the present. Mr. Hicks
has received overall ratings of "strong" from 1968 through 1971, with his
performance characterized as exceptionally proficient. Of the seven
officers with whom he serves on a rotating basis, four are GS-14's. The
FI Staff has recommended Mr. Hicks for promotion in 1968, 1969, 1971 and
1972, with a recommendation for QSI in 1970. None of these recommenda-
tions were approved.
3. The Board has noted that Mr. Hicks plans to retire in 1974 at
the age of 50. In view of the very high regard in which he is held by
the FI Staff; his record of sustained superior performance and his high
dedication to the Agency, the Board recommends recognition in the form
of a Quality Step Increase for Mr. Hicks.

2. Mr. Hicks is one of three officers in the Intel-
ligence Watch, FI Staff, on whom identical recommendations
are being submitted. These officers, all in grade GS-13,
have for several years done responsible and demanding work,
identical to that done in the same office by five other of-
'ficers, GS-14 and 15, and all three have been rated "Strong."
'
3. The Intelligence Watch is the primary intelligence
dissemination office of the Clandestine Service. Its out-
put of over 2,000 reports a month is the chief end-product
of CS collection operations. Watch Officers serve on a
rotating schedule. When an officer draws the night shift
he serves alone. He must make quick, independent dissemina-
tion decisions. Mr. Hicks has done well at this work. He
is alert and conscientious and has a sharp operational sense
which is extremely useful in the handling of CS intelligence
information. He has been recommended several times for pro-
motion to GS-14.
'
•
4. The high quality of Mr. Hicks's performance has
continued for more than two years. There is no reason to
expect any decline-in it. His enthusiasm continues, and
his tour has recently been extended for another two years.
5. Consideration has been given to recommending him
for an Honor and Merit Award, but on balance I believe that
a Quality Step Increase would be more appropriate.

William T. Hornaday, formerly CCB Cherat
: Letter of Commendation for Calvin W. Hicks
1. This is a letter of commendation for Calvin W. Hicks for the period
of 7 January 25 August 1960. During this time he served under my command" on
the staff of CLEVER Project. His assignment" was Operations Officer on the
ACLFVER staff, and Chief Operations Officer for the United States clement of
the Joint Operations Staff, serving oposite a like officer from the Allied
service.
2. Hicks at all times was an outstanding member of the staff. He was
zealous in his efforts to improve operational techniques to increase opera-
tional assets, and to insure that these assets were of trustworthy nature
and were highly trained and qualified. His forerost thoughts were always
centered on what was Fest for the interests of the United States.
He was prac.
tical, unremitting in his efforts, and hard-headed in his analysis of how best
to deal with the Allied partners for the best interests of the United States.
He was a sound staff officer, offering sound operational advice to his com
mander, and always submitting staff work in completed form. After giving
strong support to the courses of action recommended by him, he never failed to
give complete support to his commander after a decision was made, oven though
it contravened the course he favored.
3. Mr. Hicks has been a GS-12 since November 1956. He has amply demon-
strated his complete qualifications to perform the duties of the next higher
grads, and it is my conviction he has earned the right to early consideration
for promotion.
4. I shall always welcome any opportunity that permits Mr. Hicks to serve
with me again.

an unusual strain, caused by the simultaneous outbreak of

3. Prior to his assignment to the Intelligence Watch, Mr. Hicks
served with WH Division and with the Cuban Operation. He has an exten-
sive background in paremilitary operations both in the field and at
headquarters. All of his Fitness Reports for the six years preceding
his assignment to the Intelligence Watch have borne the overall rating
of "strong." He has been described as "highly motivated", "sincere and
capable." He has been further complimented as "working well with others
and his knowledge and ability are respected." Other supervisors. have
described him as "serious, hard-working and dependable." His performance
in his present assignment has demonstrated these same qualities. He has
managed the transition from active operations to the life of a desk bound
intelligence officer with ease. I recommend him with enthusiasm for
promotion to GS-14.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSPS/Section A
SUBJECT
Recommendation for the promotion of
Calvin . Hicks (056361) to GS-14
1. I recommend the promotion of subject officer from GS-13 to
GS-14. M. Hicks has been assigned to the Intelligence Watch/FI Staff
since June 1967, and serves on a rotating schedule with seven other
officers doing identical work, five of whom are currently in Grade CS-14.
>
2. Mr. Hicks has been with TW for almost two years and his work,
both quantitatively and qualitatively has been consistently of a very
high caliber. Normally six months are required before an officer newly
_ assigned to the Intelligence Watch is able to handle a shift by himself.
At least a year is required before a Watch Officer.can perform at a high
level of proficiency. However, in the case of this officer, in a little
more than a year he had earned the rating of "Strong" and has maintained
it ever since. Although most of his "gency experience had been in para-
military operations, he adapted quickly to the demands of his new assign-
ment. His keenly developed sense of operational security, coupled with
his clear understanding of the relationship between operations and
intelligence, has made him a very fine officer and a valuable asset to
T. He has been under my supervision for 16 months and I have had ample
opportunity to observe his performance under conditions of stress. He is
even tempered and level headed. His mistakes are few and infrequent and
these are usually of the clerical variety, not in matters of judgment. I
continue to be impressed with his thoroughness in handling information;
with the evidence of his coordination when the interests of more than one
division are involved. Since operations have to be submerged and the
intelligence is the portion of the iceberg which shows to the intelligence
community, the performance of the Watch Officers is of great importance.
This factor becomes apparent when it is noted that about 80% of all cabled
intelligence reports are disseminated by the Intelligence Watch. Recently
the Watch Officers were commended by the Chief, FI Staff and the Chief,
Europe Division for their performance during the Fresident's trip to
Western Europe. The simultaneous outbreak of crises in different parts of
the world further added to the burdens of the Watch Office at that time.
Mr. Hicks made a real contribution during that period and deserves the
commendation personally in a high degree.

MISTAKES ARE FEW AND INFREQUENT. I AM PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED
WITH HIS THOROUGHNESS IN HANDLING INFORMATION; WITH THE EVIDENCE
OF THE COORDINATION WHICH HE SO OFTEN ATTEMPTS WITH SEVERAL AREA
DIVISIONS WHEN NECESSARY BEFORE DISSEMINATING A-REPORT TO THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION RE-
PORT IS THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICES SHOWS TO THE IN-

2. ALTHOUGH MR. HICKS HAS BEEN WITH IW LESS THAN A YEAR,
THIS WORK BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY IS OF VERY HIGH

FREQUENTLY INDICATE TIME SPENT BY HIM IN CONSULTATION WITH AS MANY

WILL BE DISSEMINATED TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THE EXERCISE
OF GOOD JUDGMENT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE PROPER FUNCTION-

I heartily endorse this recommendation that Mr. Hicks be
promoted to GS-14. As his supervisor points out, Mr. Hicks,
when he came to the Intelligence Watch, was essentially a
querrilla warfare field operational officer. Positive intelli-
gence information reporting and the handling of reports were
new to him, and called for professional skills and other
qualities radically different from those which most of his
previous experience had brought into play. Yet in a relatively
short time, Mr. Hicks has developed the skills required of a
Watch Officer, and thanks to this and to other strengths has
become one of the most valuable officers in the unit.

INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. SINCE THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION RE-
PORT IS, THE FACE THAT THE CLANDESTINE SERVICES SHOWS TỔ THE IN-

}
1. It is recommended that Calvin W. Hicks be promoted
from Grade CS-12 to Grade GS-13 in recognition of his outstand-
ing performance as a member of JMATE Project.
F
2. Mr. Hicks was assigned to JMATE Project in October 1960
as an operations officer in the Paramilitury Section. His years.
of Agency experience and varied operational assignments enabled
him to immediately take hold and perform the many functions
requirad in the Paramilitary Operations Section in a most out-
standing manner. This included recruitment, training, briefing,
debriefing and in-exfiltration of agents'; supervision of the
infiltration of supplies and bodies by air for the Paramilitary
Operations Section; case officer for certain high level agents
and their W/Ť operators inside the target area. Mr. licks' maturity,
common sense and varied experience enabled him to operate with
the minimum of supervision. He trained certain agents in trade-
craft, air and maritime reception, mapping, and guerrilla warfare
with the result that these agents received the only completely
successful air drops. In addition, some of these agents handled
and trained by Mr. Hicks became our most trusted and important.
agents, and a large measure of their willingness to go on after
continued frustrations was due to their respect for, and trust
and confidence in, Mr: Hicks.
.
3. Mr. Hicks has continuously demonstrated the ability
to perform duties in a higher grade. He has the leadership,
maturity, common sense, stability, and ability to make decisions
and to operate with minimum supervision so necessary to senior
officers in the Agency. He is aggressive and capable of fighting
for his views; at the same time he will listen to advice and
once a decision has been handed down, will give it his full
support even though he might have opposed it before the
decision was made.

Mr. Hicks continues to perform with exceptional proficiency. In April 1972 he
was granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem
in which he is held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.
Mr. Hicks services have been particularly valuable during this reporting period.
because of DDP's increased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational
security in the dissemination of its intelligence information. Mr. Hicks has been iņ-
strumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of Ill officers, the authen-
tication statement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint
the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands. Mr. Hicks!.
notations on the IW log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the
seriousness in which Mr. Hicks approaches his daily tasks and his contributions in
reminding Divisional personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the
need to comply with the prescribed format.
The exercise of good judgment in referring or consulting on an Intel Cable prior to
its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper
functioning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's
reputation..
With the retirement and reassignment of several IW officers during this reporting
period, Mr. Hicks is now the IW officer with the most experience and continuity on the
job. This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors an
pressures inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in
the unit.
The assignment carries no supervisory responsibilities and does not require any
significent demonstration of CD COMENTS

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
16 May 1955
SUBJECT
: Credit Reference for Mr. Calvin W. Hicks
1. Mr. Calvin W. Hicks has had the following history of employment
with the Agency:
December 1950-April 1952
overseas
a.
August 1950 - EOD Headquarters
b.
-
FE Division, stationed
c.
April 1952-March 1954
-
OTR, Headquarters
2. March 1954-May 1955 - OTR, ISOLATION
During his time at Headquarters he was a student and did not establish
credit. While overseas, his cover was that of a Department of the
1
L
Army civilian, although he told casual friends that he had been recalled
to active iny. From April 1952 to March 1954, he used a nominal cover
of a Department of Defense civilian. He used the Commanding Officer of
ISOLATION (ss locally known) to establish credit there.
.2. Mr. Nicks will abide by the above story. Therefore, he should
adait po affiliation with the Agency, and his employment with the Agency
will be denied.

MÉMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group
SUBJECT:
Promotion of Mr. Calvin W. Hicks
1. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel
to consider the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the cur-
rent cycle of promotions from GS-13 to GS-14.
2. After Mr. Hicks EOD in 1950, he advanced rapidly in three years
to GS-11. He was promoted to GS-12 in 1956, six years later to GS-13 in
1962, and since then has been almost 12 years in grade. He has had over-
seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served as a training instructor, on
a PM task force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WH. In these
assignments he consistently received Strong ratings. Despite a largely para
military background, in 1967 he adjusted to the intelligence production cycle.
and developed the skills of an operations officer doing operations-oriented
reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest
continuity in the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful
Individual who exercises excellent professional judgment. He was recom-
mended for promotion from GS-13 to GS-14 in April 1968 and in April 1969.
In 1970 he was recommended for a QSI by FI Chief, Peer deSilva. He was.
again recommended for promotion in March 1971, in November 1972, and in
November 1973.
"
3. Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela-
tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available. The overall history of
his career would seem to argue the equity of granting the often recommended
promotion to Mr. Calvin Hicks as he nears the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is
49 years old and has a family of five children. He has a medical hold which
will not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem-
plates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974). He is and will be until then a
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.
4. I recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last
decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle.

MEMORANDUM. FOR: Career Management Group
Mid-Career Officer Branch
SUBJECT
13 November 1973
Recommendation for the Promotion of Calvin W. Hicks (056361)
to GS-14
"
1. I would again like to recommend the promotion of subject officer from
GS-13 to GS-14. Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967
and his performance has been characterized consistently by exceptional proficiency.
He serves on a rotating schedule with seven other officers doing identical work,
some of whom are currently in GS-14.
☐ 2. A medical hold has precluded any further overseas assignments and for
this reason his stay in IW has been extended until November 1974, when he will
be 50-years-old at which time he plans to retire under the Agency retirement
system.
.
3. Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the multitude of
reporting instructions and techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in
✓ crisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis.
He has consistently displayed initiative and good judgment in meeting unforeseen
crisis with rapid and effective action and has clearly demonstrated his ability
to continuously adjust to rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.
4: For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received
a quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which
he is held by his superiors. He occupies a GS-14 slot. His promotion is again
recommended in recognition of his long years of Agency service.

There has been no change in Mr. Hicks performance from the last reporting period.
It is still characterized by exceptional proficiency. He continues to display initiative.
resourcefulness and good judgment in the performance of the duties assigned to an IW
officer.
I
r
Mr. Hicks has been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967. A medical hold has
precluded any further overseas assignments and for this reason his tour in IW has been
extended until he reaches age 50 (November 1974) at which time he plans to retire under
the Agency retirement system. Throughout this period he has continuously applied himsel
with diligence and enthusiasm. Even after some protracted sick leave periods he has
returned ready to step in and pick up where he left off which is the best proof of his
mastery of details and the mechanics of dissemination, as well as his ability to adjust
to the stresses, and strains resulting from this type of assignment.
Since the inception of his IW assignment he has borne the same responsibilities and
carried the same burdens as his colleagues in the GS-14 category and continues to per-
form at this level. For this sustained high-level of performance in 1972 he received a
quality step increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which he is
held by his superiors.
Mr. Hicks' resourcefulness and ability to apply the myriad of reporting skills and
techniques has been clearly demonstrated in crisis situations such as the recent
Chilean political upheaval and the current Near Eastern crisis. The presence of IN
officers such as Mr. Hicks enables the DDO to effect electrical dissemination of the
high precedence traffic to the Intelligence Community in a matter of minutes on a 24-
hour-a-day basis

Mr. Hicks continues to perform with exceptional proficiency. In April 1972 he
was granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition and as proof of the high esteem
in which he is held by his supervisor in the Clandestine Service.
Mr. Hicks' services have been particularly valuable during this reporting period
because of DDP's increased concern regarding the strict maintenance of operational
security in the dissemination of its intelligence information. Mr. Hicks has been in-
strumental in referring many reports when in the opinion of IW officers, the authen-
tication statement and the manner in which the report is written would help to pinpoint
the source of the information if the report fell in unauthorized hands. Mr. Hicks'
notations on the IW log cards which record the action taken on each report indicate the
seriousness, in which Mr. Hicks, approaches his daily tasks and his contributions in
reminding Divisional personnel about the essential elements of good reporting and the
need to comply with the prescribed format.
•
The exercise of good judgment in referring or consulting on an Intel: Cable prior to
its dissemination to the Intelligence Community is an essential element in the proper
functioning of this office and upon which depends to a certain extent the Agency's
reputation.
"
With the retirement and reassignment of several IW officers during this reporting
period, Mr. Hicks is now the IW officer with the most experience and continuity on the
job. This together with his maturity of judgment and ability to withstand the rigors and
pressures. inherent in an around-the-clock activity, make Mr. Hicks a distinct asset in
the unit.
The assignment carries no supervisory responsibilities and does not require any
significant demonstration of CERTIFICA HUN AND COMMENTS

Nr. Hicks has been with I for almost 2 years and is a dependable and thoroughly
reliable member of the team. He brings to his work & fine operational background
and a sense of operational security which is of great assistence in the exercise of
sound judgment on dissemination matters. He has an instinct for prompt recognition
of problem cases and is imaginative in his approach to problems of under-enlighten-
ment of the reader and the opposite extreme of lax source protection.
He is careful and meticulous in his work, level headed and sound in his judgments.
Se knows how to balance the customer demand for speed and enlightenment against the
equally important demands for source protection. He stands up well under pressure,
is cooperative and congenial with his colleagues and with the divisional personnel
with whom he is in contact.
' Neither cost consciousness nor supervision is a factor in his performance.

I concur in this report primarily on the basis of my confidence in the
judgment of the supervisor, as I have had no opportunity to evaluate closely
the performance of individual officers in the Intelligence latch. Such direct
contacts as I have had with Mr. Hicks have tended to confirm the overall rating
of "Strong." I am satisfied that he is performing at the GS-14 level.
