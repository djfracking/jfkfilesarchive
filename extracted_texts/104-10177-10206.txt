General Counsel

SUBJECT

Joseph R. Merola
REFERENCE
: Assistant United States Attorney
Pennsylvania Letter, 10 March 1977,
Subject as Above

1. The question in reference is the nature of
any involvement of Merola with CIA prior to
August 1961.
2. The Directorate's first recorded contact
with Joseph Raymond Merola prior to August 1961
occurred on 6 February 1961. It followed a series
of telephone calls over a period of several months
(late 1960 - early 1961) in which Merola had
expressed interest in offering his assistance in
connection with Cuban matters. Our officer had
declined contact until 6 February, when Merola
claimed to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidante"
of "Che" Guevera.. Because Guevera was the proper
subject of foreign positive intelligence collection
requirement our officer agreed to a meeting.
3. The last recorded contact, except for the
litigation outlined below, with Merola was a tele-
phone contact with Merolà in late July 1975 when
he volunteered additional foreign positive intel-
ligence.
4. At the end of August 1975, Merola
contacted a staff officer to ask for testimony in
the criminal fraud trial in San Diego, California
(U.S. v. Joseph R. Merola, et al, Southern District
of California, CR 74-2277-GT) which we subsequently..

trial, "actively engaged in the service
of the government"
Irving Green, attorney for Carlucc
and Hanna, said the prosecutors, His
bert I. Tete.baum and Daniel J. San
dor, knew Mercia was a government
agent and therefore "perpetrated a
fraud upon the-trial exurt.
Teitelbauma and Snyder are now fed-
eral judges in Pittacurzh and have not
commented about the action filed by
Green, which is still pending. But an
official familiar with their position
sud the two judges will, if necessary,
swear they did not know Merola was a
government agent.
Cuban Connection
"The answer to this whole thing re-
volves around Cuba," said this off
cial.
Green, who represents Mannarino's
son-in-law, said he didn't thinks Ma
rola's testimony la Chicago had been
particularly “helpful" to the prese
cution. A "imore logical assumption"
is that Meroia was freed from prison
because of what be could do for the
government in Cuba, he said. »
"This guy works anywhere he wants
to," said Green. "The government has
protected him in California, Chicago-
and everywhere else. He still has to be
of value to the government."
One thing is certain: Merola is wel'
known in the Miami Cuban comm
nity and among those who have been
linked to alleged Castro assassination
attempts.
-
\"Joe was an undercover agent, he
was closely associated with the gov.
ernment," Frank Sturgis, of Miami,
told The Bulletin. “He did have an as-
sociation with the CIA."

"
nations Committee said Merola was
"a good friend" of Fugerio (Rolando)
Mertinez, another of those convicted
of the Watergate burglary. Martinez
153ciated with the CIA in the
Bay of Pigs effort and in other satı--
Castro moves.
"Joe's place in Miami Beach was on
the water and it was used by anti-C1s-
tro groups to smuggle arms to Cuba,
this source said. “Martinez was one of
them."
"I can't recall" Martinez said, .
when asked by The Bulletin about
using Merula's dock. "Really, I can't
tell you anything about it.
'
"He was connected with helping
people here in Miam against the dic-
tatorship of Bausta. He might have
been in some other branch that I don't
know about."
Alfredo Borges, a Miami business
consultant and a Bay of Pigs veteran,
told a Bulletin reporter inquiring
about Merola to "please write me a
letter."
"I don't know who you are." Borges
said. "I cannot talk over the tels
· phone."
One investigator interested in Me
rola said the matter is "very sensi-
tive, records are hard to come by."
"He seems to fit everything." this
investigator said. "He's a pilot, he
speaks Spanish, he knows Cuba and
he's connected. But nobody wants to
cooperate."
A Scared Man

SUBJECT: Court Appearance on 13 Kovember 1975, San Diego, California
1
2. On 13 November 1975, Matt MacVane appeared as a witness for the
defense at the Caited States District Court for the Southern District of
California, 325 West F Street, San Diego, California. The case was the
United States of America V. Dalton C. Saith, et al. MacVane was called
to testify by E. Mac Amos Jr., attorney for defendant Joe Kerola. In
honor of the subpoena MacVane appeared at the court. On 13 November 1975
at approximately 15:30 hours San Diego time acvane was called to the
witness stand.
2. Mac Aros, attorney for defendant Joe Merola begán questioning
after MacVane was sworn in as a witness. Amos asked how long MacVáne
had been employed by the CIA? He asked if MacVane knew defendant Merola?
He asked if MacTane were told by Merola about a shipment of surplus
belicopter parts going to the country of El Salvador? He asked MacVane
if Merola had volunteered other information to the Agency? He then asked
if Merola were ever paid for such information? Amos also tried to establish
the value of surples parts in Latin America compared to the US.
This was
objected to by attorney Robert Thaller, prosecutor in the case. The judge
sustained the objection and Mackage did not have to answer the question.
Amos finished his questioning and Thaller began a short cross examination.
Thaller asked if MacVane ever beard Merola mention stocks? He also asked
if MacVane knew the name of the corporation that Merola represented? He
thenspointed out that even if some stock fraud were occurring, MacVane
would not be witting because Macane was not an investigator, but rather
a collector of foreign information. The cross examination then ended.
All questions were answered to the best of MacVane's ability and knowledge.
3. There appeared to be little purpose in the appearance of MacVane
because it was obvious that Macvane knew nothing of any value concerning
the case. Macane's total time on the witness stand was about 10 minutes.
After completion of his testimony MacVane was released.

SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola

OGC 75-1073
5 November 1975
1. On.3 November I talked to Mr. Matt McVane, DCD officer
stationed in Miami, and he said that he had received the subpoena
from E:Mac Amos, Jr. to appear as a defense witness in the trial in
San Diego on November. Mr. McVane agreed to come to Headquarters
on 6 November to discuss the information in the files and Mr. Robert
Starling of DCD agreed to join in the meeting. Mr. McVane told me
that Lt. Colonel Douglas W. Haldane, who had previously been on
detail to the DCD Miami Office, had returned to the Army and was
currently assigned somewhere in Europe and that his address was
Headquarters, USAREUR, APO New York, New York 09403:
2. Since this Office had received a letter from Mr. Amos with a
[request for the current address of Colonel Haldane, I called Mr. Amos
on. 4 November and explained to him that Colonel Haldane was no longer
with the Central Intelligence Agency and it was our understanding that
Colonel Haldane was stationed in Europe. Mr. Amos did not want the
current address of Colonel Haidane. He did state, however, that Mr.
McVane would not be needed in San Diego until Wednesday morning.
12 November. As things stood now, Mr. Merola was the tifth defendant
and it would be that length of time before Mr. McVane's testimony vould
be needed.
3. Mr. McVane told ine that he had been called by Mr. Robert
Thaler of the U.S. Attorney's Office in California. I told Mr. McVane
that I would contact Mr. Thaler. I called Mr. Thaler who is a a member
of the Organized Crime Sutke Force, Department of Justice, Room 2307.
300 North Los Angeles Street, Los Angeles, California 90012. telephone
No. (AC 213) 688-5808. Mr. Thaler was pleased to hear that Mr. McVane

--- Image 104-10177-10206_page_21.jpeg ---

was being made available to testify and explained that he thought Mr.
Amos had aiready prepared a motion to dismiss if Mr. McVane was to be
denied as a witness for the defense. I explained to Mr. Thaler that Mr.
McVane was coming to Headquarters on Thursday. 6 November, and said
that we would call him to discuss the role Mr. McVane played in receiving
information from Mr. Merola.
4. If this case runs parallel to many criminal prosecutions, the
defense may never put Mr. McVane on the stand when he actually shows
up as this may prove detrimental to their defense. However, we should
be prepared for his testimony if, in fact, it does take place.

Dear Sir
:

Our firm represents Mr. Joseph Merola who is
presently on trial as a defendant in the Southern
District of California in an action entitled United
States of America v. Dalton C. Smith, et al. (No. 74-2277-
GT). In order to properly defend Mr. Merola, we need to
utilize the testimony of Mr. Matt McVane and possibly the
testimony of Col. Douglas Haldane. We understand that
Mr. McVane is employed by the Central Intelligence Agency
and works out of the Miami office. We also understand
that Coll Douglas Hildane is employed by the Central
Intelligence Agency but we do not have an address for
service upon Col. Haldane.
*.Enclosed you will find copies of Subpoenas
issued for Mr. McVane: and Col. Haldane. These Subpoenas
require the attendance of the individuals in the Southern
District of California at San Diego, California on
November 11, 1975 at 9:00 a.m. Enclosed you will also
find a copy of the Order signed by Judge Gordon Thompson
authorizing the issuance of the Subpoena for Mr. McVane.
Since we do not have an address for Col. Haldane at
this time, the court has not approved the issuance of
a Subpoena for him in which the government would be
responsible for all of the expenses and costs.
We have been informed by Mr. McVane that it
is necessary for him to obtain the approval of your office
before he canitestify in this matter. Accordingly, we
request that he be granted the necessary approval in
order to allow him to testify in this matter. In addition,
we request that we be provided with an address for
Col. Haldare and that he also be allowed to testify in
this Cusu, we would appreciate being advised as soon as

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola
24 clade 75
25
i
"
1.
On 23 October, Mr. Robert Starling of DCD called to say that
Matthew McVane (phonetic), a DCD officer who is stationed in Miami.
Florida, had received a telephone call from a San Diego attorney saying
that he was mailing a subpoena to him. The attorney, E. Mac Amos, Jr.,
is a member of the law firm of Holt, Rhodes and Hollywood at 1010 Second
Avenue, San Diego, California 92101, telephone No. (AC 714) 238-1712.
Mr. Amos advised Mr. McVane that the subpoena was for his appearance
on behalf of Mr. Merola who was on trial in San Diego.
·
2. Mr. Starling indicated that the charges against Merola had
something to do with exporting airplane parts without a license. I called
Mr. Clyde Bryant, Office of Munitions Control, Department of State, to
determine if this prosecution was related to 22 U.S.C. 1934. - Mr. Bryant
called back and said that Merola was one of seven defendants being tried
on criminal fraud charges for having engaged in a flimflam operation
against the Salvadorian government. The scheme was to establish a
facility in Salvador to assemble and service helicopters. The group had
assembled a collection of Army surplus parts for helicopters and was in
the process of shipping them without an export license and they were
seized by U.S.Customs officers on 21 February 1974. Mr. Bryant
indicated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego in charge of
the prosecution was a Mr. Robert Thaller, telephone No. (AC 714) 203-5668.
Mr.. Bryant also indicated that an individual by the name of Henry Maier-
(hoffer was also one of the defendants and it was Mr. Bryant's recollection
that Maierhoffer had some previous connection with CIA.
3. I called Mr. Starling and reported this information to him and
he said that Mr. Merola was a real operator in the Miami area, always
involved in some scheme to buy and sell weapons but that he had volun-
teered information to the DCD Office, some of which was useful. I asked
Mr. Starling to have Mr. McVane call me when he got the subpoena but
that he would not have to go unless they furnished the travel funds.

Domestic Collection Division
Hr. Shaun P. Ryan
Joseph R. MEROLA
HH 25826, 8 January 1974
1. On 10 January 1974 the HH/2/GS desk received the
referenced memorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
indicating the Miami field office had been in contact with one
Joseph R. MEROLA. MEROLA had just returned from a business
trip to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had
identified a Mr. Gremillion in the Political Section of the
American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. MEROLA indicated that on several
occasions in the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA
agent. The Chief of Station, the Mr. Gremillion referred to
above, was recently questioned regarding any Embassy contact
with MEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The COS
stated that both within the Embassy community and at social
functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with.
the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor
mation to a former Station contact.
2. In light of the above, it would appear that MEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate
manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador
Station. We would, accordingly, appreciate that this be given
due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your
continued contact with hto.

ratti,
We have cent a -rivate channel letter to
the COS on this matter, metingat KKÍ
asking at the end for comments as to whether
MOROLA is "embarrassing" the Station or CIA
generally by talking so much about his CIA
connections. If his re-ly is in the affirmative,
I it will -robably be best for you to draft
a note to De DCD suggesting that he somehow
be silenced, -erha-s by their withdrawing from
contact with them since it is obviously something
that he brags about and otherwise tries to take
advantage of

Matt MacVane, DCD officer in Miami, met with Joseph R. MEROLA
on 15 January 1974; at which time MEROLA identified the friend in San
Salvador who had identified Mr. Gremillion in the American Embassy in
San Salvador as a CIA representative.
✓ MEROLA also provided
the names of two women employed in the Embassy who were xapaxtɛt involved
in compromising situations with both Americans and local nationals.
MEROLA identified the two women as Nancy SHALLOT and Delia OBESA. MEROLA
was met again on 17 January 1974 *■********±ª×&æ±¤Ã¤ÌNH¤¤¤XXØ±hæкxp=«st\tex
at which time he provided the name of a third woman in the Embassy. Gloria,
who has also been involved in compromising situations. Upon чж*нк inquiring
Headquarters personnel who had recently returned from San Salvador, the
above identities were confirmed; all three are American citizens assigned
to the Embassy in San Salvador.

1. One of our sources in Miami, Joseph Merola, revealed
the name and position of an individual reported to be an Agency
official in El Salvador to Matt MacVane during the course of an
interview on 21 December 1973. This was reported in MIN-006–74
4 January 1974. This report was forwarded to the El Salvador
Desk on 8 January 1974. On 16 January 1974 the Desk requested
that DCD obtain the name of the individual mentioned in this
memorandum who said he know a CIA officer in the Embassy. This
request was passed by telecon and TWX to MacVane by Ryan on
16 January 1974. The El Salvador Desk also questioned the
reliability of our source. Joseph Merola, at this time and
requested we query Miami as to his reliability.
2. On 17 January 1974 at the request of MacVane, Ryan
visited the El Salvador Desk to ascertain their objections to
our source, known to us as a convicted felon. Desk objections
stemmed from a 1964 report which indicated that Merola had
informed persons that be vas a "CIA agent". Further conversa-
tion elicited the fact that Merola had again made this state-
ment in 1973 at an Embassy function. We advised the Desk that
OCD was well aware of Merola's criminal background but that he
had provided DCD with reliable reports in the past unrelated
to his own "pursuits".
3. The El Salvador desk confirmed the fact that the
individual mentioned by Merola's informant as being a CIA
officer was in fact such. Ryan advised MacVane of this per
telecon on 17 January 1974. Macvane and Mainwaring told Ryan
they were sending two cables relating to this case. The first
would provide the name of the person who reportedly know the
CIA official. The second provided the names of two women
employed in the Embassy who were reportedly involved in

compromising situations with both Americans and local nationals.
This latter cable was requested after the El Salvador desk
officer advised that all avenues and possible leads were to be
pursued to determine who leaked the information relating to the
CIA official. These two names (phonetically spelled) were
provided in the second cable by Hiasi. All of the information
received in these cabies was passed via secure phone to the
El Salvador dosk by Ryan upon receipt.
4. Macva advised Ryan via teiocon that he anticipated
meeting with doseph Merola at 1300 on 17 Jesuary to address.
further matters concerned with this case. MacVane adviced bran
that he would forward such information as soon as possible.

Regarding Joe Merola:
Information passed on

Buskirk advised that we should have somebody
ready to go to court and to deny the claim
of Connel that he was working on our behalf.
The date for the trial is not as yet set and
Van Buskirk said there is no hurry, but he
would like to know whether or not we would
have somebody there in as much as this person ;
intends to base his defense on the basis of

•MURAWSK!??
1. Joe Merola contacted the Miami office on 21 December 1973 to
explain that he recently had spoken with a friend of his in San Salvador,
El Sulvador. The friend, who allegedly works for the El Salvadoran
Secret Service, told Morola that when he (Merola) comes to El Salvador
not to go to the US Embassy to see a man nured Vermillion. The friend
told Kerola that Vermillion is the Commercial Attache at the embassy
and in under surveillance because he is suspected of being the CIA man
in San Salvador. Merola told his friend that he did not know a man
named Vermillion, nor would he ever have cause to see such a man. The
friend then toll Merola that he was only telling him for his own good,
and that if he (Merola) were to see this Vermillion that Merola would
become a suspected CIA agent as well.
2. Merola said that he was passing this information to us in case
we did indeed have a man in San Salvador by the name of Vermillion.
Merola has been a contact of the Miami Field Office for some ten years,
and during that period he has passed to this office some very reliable
information.

Dear Mr. Curry:
.
Re: Joseph Raymond Merola
In response to your letter of March 10, 1977 I wish to advise you
that the Central Intelligence Agency had one meeting with Joseph Raymond
Merola prior to August 1961. In late 1960 Joseph Raymond Merola made
several telephone calls to a CIA office offering his assistance in a general
way in connection with Cuban matters, which was refused. However, on
16 February 1961 Merola claimed to have information on a Latin American
senator who was a "close friend and confidant" of "Che" Guevera. Since
Guevera was listed as being the subject of foreign intelligence requirements,
the CIA employee agreed to meet with Mr. Merola. The meeting took place on
6 February 1961 and is the only meeting with Merola prior to his incarceration
which you stated in your letter began in August 1961.
Mr. Merola was not employed by the Central Intelligence Agency. His
contact with the CIA could not be described as an undercover Government
informant as alleged in the Writs of Error Coram Nobis by Victor Carlucci.
and Daniel Hanna. This one contact on 6 February 1961 by Merola with the
CIA was voluntary on his part.
Mathew McVane, an employee of the CIA, did testify in San Diego in
November 1975 concerning CLA contacts with Joseph Raymond Merola. The
citation we have for that case is U.S. v. Dalton C. Smith, et al. in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, No. 74-2277-GT.

:
The testimony given in that trial is not inconsistent with the response given
above. It is true that after Merola was released from prison he again
volunteered information to the CIA. Merota was a voluntary source of foreign
intelligence.
I hope this provides sufficient information for you to file your response.
If not, please call me at (AC 703) 351-7531.
Sincerely,
