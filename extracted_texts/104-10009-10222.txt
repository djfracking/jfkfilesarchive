Dear Charles,
520003
Thank you for your letter of 15 October
recommending against the declassification of
Warren Commission document CD-971. I might
mention that our inquiry to you in August (1968)
was in anticipation of further pressure for the
release of Warren Commission papers, a pressure
which has not materialized. Accordingly, there is
not, at the present time, any intention to release
CO-971.

Should the question be raised at some futuro
time, the points made by you in your letter provide
every reason to keep the document out of the
public domain.
