Case-40,556 - Clemard Joseph Charles
1. At Clemard Joseph Charles' request, on 14 May 63 C/S Balog
had a "farewell" interview with the Haitian banker. The private con-
versation, which took place at Charles' room at the Park Sheraten
Hotel in New York, lasted about one hour. On 15 May 1963 Charles flew
back to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
T
2. At the outset of our "confidential" interview Charles'.
shoved us a letter written by William Stix Wasserman, 40 Wall Street,
Hew York 5, N.Y. whom Charles' desuribed as a "big financiar and my
adviser" and addressed to Senator Hubert Humphrey. According to Charles,
Humphrey and Wasserman are good friends, an allegation which may be trus
since the salutation of the letter was "Dear Hubert" and the general tone
of it indicated a fairly close relationship between the two.
3. In his letter, Wasserman asked the Senator to receive Charles
whom he described as a man with "liberal views in regard to cooperatives.
Wasserman want on saying that Charles sees "the necessity of creating
new relationship between capital and labor primarily through profit
sharing that will at least nullify to some extent the siren song of
Communist propaganda." Wasserman concluded by stating the following:
"I think at this very critical time in Haitian affairs and with Castro
60 miles away that the Administration might begin to look for men
1th Er. Charles' ability and attitude to see what can constructively
dane to bring some hope to that unfortunate island."
Charles stated that since he was unable to make another trip
Washington to see Rater Humphrey he asked his friend and business
teer, Joseph F. Dryer, Tampa, Florida to present Wasserman's letter
Sonater and request him to receive, Charles when the Haitian banker

glad to talk with a US Government official concerning the "general political
climate in Haiti." Although he has had several contacts with members of
the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, he prefers to cooperate with "one
of Captain Balog's friends." All the US official has to do is to walk
Anto his office at the bank and say that "Im am a friend of Captain
Balog's". If a contact is made this way he will be willing to cooperate
"to the fullest."
1 1
:
6. He told us that he was not prepared to give his support to
those anti-Duvalier politicians in exile who had a few days ago announgod
the formation of a goverment in exile since "they are not the right
people to take over in Haiti." He emphasized that he would not under
circumstance support Duvalier with whom he is thoroughly disillusioned.
In fact, he thinks that Duvalier "went crazy and must be and will be
eliminated." He did not elaborate and stated that first he must go back
to Haiti and talk with his friends. He mentioned, however, that his
cousin, Joseph D. Charles, a former ambassador of Haiti to the US who
now lives in "forced, retirement" in Cap Haition, was ready to re-enter
the political life at a propitious mement. He believes that his cousin
will have enough Army support to become provisional President and then
with popular support will be elected President of Haiti. Upon his return
to Port-au-Prince, Charles will work toward rallying support for
Joseph D. Charles. He is confident that once in power, his uncle
would pursue a pro-US policy. At this point, Charles intimated that
"a Joseph Charles goverment could grant the US rights to establish
naval base atMole St.-Nicolas, which is about 60 miles from Cuba.'
"
1
7. We wished Charles bon voyage and, of course, promised nothing
concerning his offer to be contacted in Port-au-Prince. We merely
told him that we would report our conversation to "our mutual friends
in Washington" for their decision. Regardless of this decision,
Charles" stated that during his next trip to New York he would call
us on the telephone to discuss "things" in confidence.

Clemari Joseph CHAN FOR RELEASE.
1. On 29 April 1963 Dorothe Matlack, Domestic Exploitation
Section, ACSI, telephoned to the effect that a banter named Clemard
Joseph Charles had left Hiiti six days earlier and had Just arrived
in New York. A friend of Charles, named Joseph Dryer, 109 Lakewood
Avenue, West Palm Beach, Florida, had written to General Delmar,
former CG Antilles Command, recommending Charles as a man of great
interest to the US government in view of the events in Haiti. Charles
was described as President of the Banc Commerciale, Fort au Prince,
Haiti, who is in President Duvalier's favor. Mrs. Matlack mentioned
that she had alerted Col. Sam Kail in Miami to contact Dryer in
order to obtain more background information and an assessment on
Charles.
2. On 1 May 63 Mrs. Matlack advised that Charles was staying at
the Park Sheraton Hotel, New York, and that he had telephoned her
since her name had been supplied to him by Dryer. Charles considered
her to be his point of contact in Washington. According to Mrs. Matlack,
Charles had appointments to see Vice President Johnson, Senator Keating,
and Congressman Rogers (Florida). However, Charles was willing to talk
to representatives of Mrs. Matlack's office. Mrs. Matlack stated that
the Ilitian Desk man in ACSI was ready to go to New York to talk to
Charles and invited CIA to accompany him. Charles speaks very little
English and a fluency in French was therefore required for the inter-
view. Mrs. Matlack stated that she might be able to obtain a French
linguist from First Army, Governor's Island, but he would not be an
intelligence officer. It was decided that James Balog, New York
Office, who has a knowledge of the French language would accompany
the ACSI representative a
It was also arranged that
Balog would meet the ACOT representative (Captain Rogers) at the Park
Sheraton Hotel where Charles was staying.
3. On 2 May 63 Mrs. Matlack reported that Col. Kail had interviewed
Mr. Dryer in West Palm Beach. Dryer had appointed Charles as Director
of his bank in Haiti. Charles, according to Dryer, formerly had no
political ambitions but in view of the current political situation in
Haiti, Charles now thinks that he may some day be president. Dryer
described Charles as well-connected, politically and financially, on
both sides of the fence in Haiti. lle is also a good friend of President
Duvalier. Dryer had given Charles letters of introduction to Senator
Keating and to other officials in Washington. Charles wanted to see
President Kennedy and indeed had gone to the White House to arrange
for an appointment. No wun well received by the President's appoint-
ment secretary and invited to dinner that evening with the appointment

7. I met Mrs. Matlack in the lobby of the Hotel Willard shortly
before noon, and a few minutes later, Mr. Charles arrived, accompanied
by Mr. and Mrc. de Mohrenschildt. We lunched in the restaurent in
the hotel. Mr. de Mohrenschildt mentioned that he had been born in
Batu, Russia, but during the Bolshevik Revolution had been taken to
Poland as a small child. lie had spent approximately 20 years in
Poland prior to World War II and hnd served in the Polish Army.
He also mentioned that he had been a member of an ICA Team to Yugo-
slavin in 1957 and while in Belgrade had met Gomulka who was visiting
Belgrade at the time. He had spoken to Gomilka and was invited to
visit Poland, which invitation he had accepted. His home is in Dallas,
Texas. Ho has a Thi), in geology and has had some teaching experience.
Mrs. de Nohrenschildt was born in Peking, China. Her father was
Russian and her mother French, and she is now or has been a fashion
designer. Mr. de Mohrenschildt mentioned that he has known Charles
for sometime and that he is a partner with him ir a sisal business
in Haiti.
8. Both Charles and de Mohrenschildt were anxious to arrange
meetings with government officials in Washington. I mentioned to
Charles that a meeting; had been arranged for him at 2:15 and that a
Mr. Green would meet him in the lobby. At 1410 Mrs. Matlack, Mr. and
Mrs. de Mohrenschildt and I departed and Charles remained in the
lobby waiting for contact.
9. In the course of the luncheon conversation, Charles had
mentioned to Mrs. Matlick that he desired to see a Mr. Wise, AID, to
discuss US aid to Haiti. Later that afternoon Mrs. Matlack called to
state that she had called the State Department to pass along Charles'
request. Mr. Zagorski (State) had called her back to pass on the
Haitian Desk man's extreme displeasure that anyone in the United States
Government should be in official contact with Charles. The desk man
considered Charles to be close to the Duvalier Government, to have
been involved in several shady financial dealings, and in general, to
be an undesimble character. Mra. Matlack asked whether the Agency
had any interest in Charles which would dictate further contact with
Charles.
I
10. Mayo Stuntz chocked with WH Division and determined that as
a result of the mooling with Charles, the DD/P Haitian Doak had no
further plans to contact him. I told Mrs. Matlack that our interest
seemed to have been outisfied and that I believed we should disengage
ourselves as gracefully as possible.

Through a misunderstanling, however, Charles did not
attend the dinner but went to New York instead.
4. Charles is travelling, according to Dryer, with a Texan
geologist named de Mohrenschildt. de Mohrenschildt is associated
with Charles in a business venture in Haiti and is trying to arrange
a meeting for Charles with Vice President Johnson.
5. On 3 May 63 Jim Balog telephoned to advise that he had had a
five-hour session the previous day with Charles and that he had
obtained both personality data and views by Charles on what the
United States should do in the current Haitian situation. Balog
advised that he was transmitting the information to Washington.
Upon arrival, copies of the teletypes were transmitted to ACSI
(Mrs. Matlack), WH Division, and the Latin America Branch.
6. On 6 May 63 Mayo Stuntz, Support Branch, advised that WH
Division wished to speak to Charles and Balog was asked to arrange
an appointment. Mrs. Matlack telephoned at approximately 1715 to
advise that she had just received a telephone call from Mrs. de
Mohrenschildt asking assistance in obtaining hotel reservations in
Washington. Upon being told that we had no special means of obtain-
ing reservations, Mrs. Matlack stated that she would check with the
State Department Protocol Office to determine which hotels would
admit negro guests. Mrs. Matlack finally made reservations at the
Alban Towers. A check with Jim Balog revealed that he had arranged
for Charles to meet the WII representative in the lobby of the Willard
Hotel, Washington, D. C., at 12:00 noon on 7 May. Attempts to reach
Mrs. Matlack that afternoon were unsuccessful. At 0830, 7 May, a
call was made to Mrs. Matlack to confirm that Charles would be in
Washington on that day and that arrangements had been made for a
meeting with an Agency representative for 12:00 noon. Mrs. Matlack
retorted that both Mrs. de Mohrenschildt and Charles had called her
that previous evening to confirm a 12:00 luncheon appointment with
her. Mrs. Matlack was concerned that CIA and Army should not be
working at cross purposes. She had received authorization from
ACSI to meet Charles at lunch and felt that it would not be politic
for her to withdraw from her appointment since Army considered her
the point of contact with Charles. Mayo Stunts informed Wil Division
of the conflict and passed on the suggestion that the WH Division
representative might meet Charles and Mrs. Matlack at noon and that
Mrs. Matlack offered to withdraw shortly thereafter.
The WH repre-
sentative declined the offer and requested that a meeting later in
the afternoon be arranged. Mrs. Matlack believed that due to con-
flicting instructions, she had been placed in the middle in the
situation from which she could not graciously withdraw and requested
that someone accompany her.

And called him earlier that day to assure him that ACSI had no direct
interest in Charles and that it was acting as an intermediary at the
request of General Delmar who had panced the lead to General Fitch.
AC3I was concerned that due to the mix up in appointments to see

had obstructeu CIA contact with Charles. I explained to Nelson what
had happened and he later called back to state that ACSI wan completely

12. On 3 May Mrs. Matlack telephoned to advise that the Operational
Branch of ACSI was discussing the Charles case with DD/F to determine
future course of action. She was still somewhat concerned over her own
position in the case since Charles considered her to be the focal point
In Washington. I reiterated to her that the matter was one for either
the State Department or the operational elements to handle and that
we preferred to disengage ourselves. Mrs. Matlack mentioned that a

be overthrown. She was of the opinion that the US government should
continue to "play bill" with Charles as a future asset in Haitian

CONTACT REPORT
WUBRINY - Haitian Operation
1. WUBRINY/1 telephoned from his residence on the sterile
lim at approximately 0930 hours to report the following.
2. WUBRINY/1 said that he believed that the meeting that
is to be held by Mr. CHARLES and WUBRINY/1 plus an unnased third
party would involve a Mr. Tardieu.
}
3. I told WUBRINY/1 bere had been considerable interest
in this general development on the part of the Department of
State and cited (without identification) A-406, Amembassy, Port-
au-Prince, dated April 11, 1963, subject: U.S. Businessman Signs
Contracts with Haitian Government and Local Bank. I told WUBŘINY/1
that the Department information I had before me cited Le Moniteur
of March 13, 1963 and said that the Airgram also mentioned a
Mr. Bert Cindine TARDIEU. I also gave: WUBRINY/1 the points raised
under "comment" on page 2 of the Airgram.
4. WUBRINY/1 said that he agreed with all of these comments
he had come to the same conclusions.
5. I told wUBRINY/1 that there was obviously considerable
interet in my reporting that he can do on the subject and
requested that he let me know when the meeting takes place and
continue his detailed reporting as heretofore. He agreed to do so.

1. WUBRINY/1 telephoned on the sterile line from Chicago,
on his way to the West Coast, to report his final contact before
departing with subject.
}
2. Subject telephoned WUBRINY/1 on 1 May and said that
because of the recent unpleasant developments in Haiti he
thought it would be quite inappropriate to continue discussions
regarding WUSALINE possible investment in the area at least
until things were clarified.
3. M. CHARLES indicated that he was returning to Haiti
shortly and asked if WUBRINY/1 could visit him there.
WUBRINY/1 said that he would consider this or have one of his
representatives go, if it later seemed desirable. He indicated,
however, a continuing interest in the investment picture in
Haiti if, as, and when.

Biographics Register prepared a summary of information on
Mr. CHARLES for inclusion in the Biographic Intelligence
Report on Haitian Opposition Personalities. This summary
is made up of information obtained from several different
sources. One source classifies CHARLES as a slippery
character who is active on the Haitian scene and refers to
him as a "promoter" rather than a businessman, who endeavers
to attract United States "venture" capital for various
Haitian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of
the promotion. Biographics Register has a very high opinion
of this Source, who is the State Department's Haiti Desk
Officer. During a debriefing on CHARLES, in February 1963,
this same source stated that CHARLES is a confidant of
President Duvalier and that he has emerged as an active
businessman by virtue of his priviledged position with the
President.

PERSONS VYING FOR POWER AFTER THE FALL OF PRESIDENT DUVALIER.
THEY ARE JOSEPH CLEMARD CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE HAITIAN

HAVE THEIR SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE GOH OR DUVALIER POWER
STRUCTURES AND SOME HAVE SUPPORT FROM SOME OPPOSITIONISTS.
ALL THREE REMAIN OUTWARDLY PRO-DUVALIERIST AND THERE ARE
NO SIGNS THAT THEY INTEND TO TRY TO OVERTHROW DUVALIER
THEMSELVES. THEY ARE PRESENTLY JOCKEYING FOR SUPPORT FOR
THEIR BID FOR POWER WHEN DUVALIER LEAVES THE PRESIDENCY.
2. CLOVIS DESINOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST
POWERFUL. HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF COLONEL JACQUES LAROCHE,
ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, AND IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE
A RUTHLESS AND UNSCRUPULOUS SEEKER OF POWER. (SOURCE

Contour André remarked quite flatly that there are really only tho
banks in Haiti, the GH and the Royal Bank. The others are pretty
sad affairs. The BANQUE COLCEC-HAITI, for example, has a port-
folio of $1.4 million which is, as Andri put it, "all fraud". The
president of that bank, he said, is a rich man today. His technique,
according to André, is to find someone willing to accept a loan which
he knows carrot or will not repay on which he kicks back in some cases
more than half. André said he knows personally of one man who was
leaving for the United States who signed notes for $10,000 and ac-
cepted $2,000, the remainder going into the pocket of the bank presi-
dent.
As for reserves, the Colombo-Haitian bank has been below the
legal requirements for months and is now paying, in accordance with
law, fines of $150 daily. What will happen when depositors want
their money back ne, André, would rather not think about.
a
André said he knew the bank had tried to interest some American
investors in the business, perhaps in the hope of getting new capital
with which to keep going. He, André, however, understood that the
Americans were a rather dubious Miami group, even if they did come
in (which he did not at the moment foresee) he didn't think it would
improve the situation. The Colombo-Haitian bank, he said, was in
such poor shape it would take a major overhaul to save it.

I had led the conversation over to the Colombo-Haitian bank be-

knew nothing about banking but he was something of a favorite with
the President who gave him support. The BARH holds mortgages on the
Commercial Bank of Haiti, for example, and, since payments are now
substantially in arrears, André said, he might have foreclosed. The
President, however, had asked him not to in order to avoid a
scandal.(5).
Balance of Fayments Situation Temporarily Improved
Turning briefly to the balance of payments question, I asked
André how matters now stood (having in mind, but not mentioning, some

Fully confident in the power of the truth which cannot over be hiddon, much
more in the indisputable justnuss of the case we are endeavouring to diffuse; con-
vinced of the practical possibility to put an end to the loomine privileges of a
minority whose personal interest stands against all honest and impartial government
managements, as the son of portant, to reaffirm here our faith in the final trimph
of a true and indispensable political evolution through a broader representation of
the interest of the people, thereby assuring to our miserable co-citizens still
fighting for the noknowledgement of their most sacred rights now rozsons to believe
and to hope. In this view our istion shall tend toward the evolution of our masses
in order that they may enjoy living conditions compatible with their dignity. And
by mesnu of social productivity expressed in terms of the welfare of our rural
population, we shall formulate the economic requirements of the country within the
framework of a realist and rational program. In line with this goal we are outlining
below a program for the oconomic reconstruction and the social promotion of our
rural masses.
An objective consideration of the present condition of our country makes it
clear that the solution of the country's social and economic problem lies in the
following considerationst
1
1.- Cpention of a balanced economy adruted to the conditions of the country;
2.- Development of Industry and exploitation, of our natural ressourcen so na
to promote an improvement of living conditions;
1
3.-. Transformation of rural way of living and modernization of agriculture so
that the peasants who represent the largest portion of the country's popu-:
lation nome out of their ancestral misory and participate in the prosperity
of the nation. And then, arrive at the integration of the rural population
of the country in its economio life by means of literacy and the preparation
of skilled workers in order to inoronse the productivity of the iðultu-
Fal activition, also that of the traditional handorafts and of the manufac-
buring Industries which are still got a primitive stage.

Phose phases of eguni importance new linked together. Tharofora, they cannot
be separatod without mudongori̟py the whole pattern. of source errors have boun
mado repeatedly. However, the straightening which is a nust calls for a general
review of the principles and objectives of our economic and financial policy, which
should be considered the Pirst steps to be taken towards a true ouonomia start.
¦
For a long time, the poople responsible for our Economic and Financial Policy
had built their programs upon illusiona. The continuous demographic pressure end
the influence of social progress, together with the normal desire of the different
classes of the population to benefit a reasonable part of the national revenue,
have made indispensable the development of a well balanced economy. This develop-
ment can be conceived but in terms of industries using to the latest extent the
raw materials and the resources of the country. As a matter of fact, the mobiliza-
tion of these resources is paramount for the achievement of true progress in the
way of political liberty and for the improvement of material living. Education,
modical care, transportation facilities and the improvement of living conditions
are the primary requirements for modernizing the living conditions of the population.
To sum up, the increased production of riches through the creation of industries
and the systematic exploitation of our subsoil, added to other natural assets,
shall furnish the resources necessary to the adequate operation of our system. For
fault of considering the situation in this point of view, any and all idea of geno-
ralized social welfare and national grandour will remain purely a dream.
The modernization of agriculture, and the improvement of the rural way of living
which will result therefrom should go abrost with Industrialization. The rapid
increase of the rural population and the recession of infantile mortality, no well
as the extension of life limit obtained through the application of Hygiene rules,
make it necessary to une to the largest extent the rejects of agricultural produc-
tion in Processing Kanufactures in order to assure the surplus subsistence to the
surplus population end, through the export of the thum processed agricultural ro-
jects and products, supply the Treasury with the proper foreign exchange stock
necessary to maintain a well balanced economy.

development of the production anuets, which cannot be atteined without the impres

It may be Wall to recall that at the Confirms in Panta del Este wan emphisisod
the importance of the spamformation of the ppl in the development process of
undor developed countries.
All this lundo to consider the protection and preservation of the understructure
works of which the urgundy osmot be underestimated. slogtrio power, ronds, bridjes,
urbanism,
irrigation and drainage system ots, are the factors that the contemplated
dovelopment calls for its full realization.
Of courge the Haitian State has always cared for the undorstructure equipment of
the country. However, the investments - very important at times- to this end have
been made without an all out plen, not with a statistical and rational antimne of
the country's needs, but with such awnstos in the execution that the general problem
of the country's bisis equipment is still a matter of consideration.
5+
1 1
In Haiti, the National Capital comprises broadly the understructure equipmont
and the production equipment, as a result of the fnot that our social and Economie
System lacks a natural repartition of the functions an exist in the advanced coun-
tries where the State taken ware of the understructure equipment while private on-
terprise engages in production. The obligation for the State to dovoto its activities
to both the understracture and the production problem, the latter private initiative
cannot assume due to failure or lack of experience, compeln saw stato to build pro-
per methods and nuana to Nosolorate the formation of the National Capital through
the adequate and honnest exploitation of our financial sources.
To this and, wo propose to build a program including the execution of specifia
projects already studied and for which the financing can be obtained from abroadı

Within the framework of the objectives outlined in thin summary, we propose
the creation of an agency titled "National Planning Committed". Concurrently with
this Committee would be rented a Bank for Moonomio Development.
The National Planning Committee would build a plan of general development of
which the execution would aprond over a period of 25 yours, plot into 5 year pe-
riods. The pluns and programs applicable to each period would be executed under
the close supervision of the Committee, and modified in accordance with such econó-
mio ohunges as may happen. The program would be maintained in a pormationt basis,
In the source of its execution and aa u reguit of the possible modifications,
would follow the curve of international progress and thereby romain astual.

First of all would be prepared a priority order which would be based on the
nervous centers of the coonomy to be straightened. This priority order would em-
brace a wall door innsed and one notions, brand ipon observation and experience.

As for the gate to be given to privative towards the development
salute
of new a richltural, austrial and commercial enterprises, it will be nosessary
to reorganize our beating site by the creation of a Contral Bank Stock Exchange,
Mortgage Bank, Agricultural Rural Credit Bank and other financial institutions
such as: Savings & Credit Jank, and for Finanging low cost Housing for the people
with low revenue, oto.
Besides, negoziations shall be made with the International Financing Company
which has been orented Intely in order to finindo national private enterprises. We
will work jointly and closely with the International Monetary Funds, the BIND, and
the BID in view of obtaining the financing of a certain amount of revenuo - produ-
cing projects. At the anao time, we shall endeavour to strengthen the position of
our national currency.
In addition, the Budgetary Reform will be accomplished. A National Budgetary
policy which observos the difference between eministrative expenses and capital
expenditures chill permit a proper adaptation of the budget to the requirements of
the economy so as to make of it a true instrument of a general policy.
Also

Fiscal policy shall take into account the requirements of the economy.
A revision of the Customs Tariff shall be pursued and made. Kensures shall also be
taken to guaranty honesty and intogrity in handling the State's Funds. Just consi-
der that for the fiscal years 1949-1950 to 1956-57, the total disbursements of the
state has reached the mum of 3: 1,350,506,631.-, or around $270.000.000.-, and that
the largest portion of this sum hus gone into triple expenses or served for specta-
oular works most of which with absolutely no economic justification. In this sum
are not included neither the various financial disbursements made outside of the
budget through loans obtained during the same period and which brought the publio
dabt up to G: 249,134.000.- or 349.836.800.- nu at September 30, 1957, nor the
expenses supported by the non-fisoal accounts and the various autonomous enterprises
of the State. All this is the evidence that the formation of the National Capital..
can be worked out through sound administration.
As regard Publio Pinnico, omphania whall be made on the following points:

Harmoniantion of the budgethry polly with the economių poliuy;
3.- Improvement of our banking systum in to mainly smooth credit conditions;

8.– kemodelling our Cone of Commerce in order to give more guaranties to local and
foreign creditors, and to adapt the law to the requirements of internal exchange.
If the straightening of our public finance is of primary importance, production
and equipment are likewise necessary. Therefore, in the execution of the 25 year de-
velopment plan submitted and within the priority order to be invited out by the
National Planning Committee, serious consideration shall be given to the following
revenue producting and understructure projects:
a) Colonization and transformation of the rural centers through the integration
of the agricultural section in the economic, political and social life of the
country in order to obtain better economic and social results, and to attain
the following primary objectivans

If the competitive communition are so dynamic and impose by the rate of their
avale of evolution, it is because, to the end, their social struggles result into
economio terms through the production of valuable men superior to their consumption.
Because we failed to draw up our balance-sheet at each epoch of our life, we do
not seem to understand that we are arriving at inverse reports. Our bachwaraneus is
the result of this negative unbalance between the production and the consumption of
our valuable men.
We should be concious of the urgoney if not to change our method of struggling, at
least to come up with superior principles susceptible of making our struggles less
· nocive and much more profitable to the community. On this point, the example offered
by more advanced countries of which we are copying the bad sides can be of service
to us. To decrease the rate of consumption of our valuable men in order to increase
their production in the course of time is to learn to appreciate, them to utilise
and to respect them. We shall, thereby, create the condition that will preserve and
fecundate them.
W
We know, Andeed, that it is extremely hard to come to this reasoning, it is much
nere difficult to adopt it as the motto of our collective behavior. We are only a
fow to grasp this thruth because this phase of our social competitions results into
a mass of historic factors. The first effect of our internal divisions generated by
colsniɛlism und fed up, afterwards by the old regime of oppresion was the creation,
at the various levels of our societies of a complex of self destruction, that turned
into a social cannibalism. In the production of this event where everyons, without
undergoing in any way the influence of a mystic or of a superior principle, is moved
while believing he is moving towards his rightful interest, one has the impression
that the community is unable to find it was without the help of a trustes, homes
implicite er public acknowledgement of the superiority of the former boss.
These truths that are found in filigree' thoughout the pages of modern and continge–
Vary history of colonialism should rouse the Haitians thought in ork that they may
endeavour to increase their national potentiallities and over appreciate and respect
their social values,

shall be necessity proper communication means to use the mobility of labor aulatio-
nuate to the prios fluctuations. These mollition inako it possible to decido ɔn tho
geographic implantation of new industring and on the extent to be given to the
development of various zones in line with the all our program.
M.
These shall be considered:
f
11
a) The asphalting or momenting of all main roadn; the stonning of all secondary roads,
and the construction of new ronds.
b) The construction of telophories to join certain commodity-produsing centers to
urban conturu.
c) Organization of an adequate railway system.
d) Rationalization of general transportation (transport en commun).
As for marine transportation, our country has not yet exploited its ingular posi-
tion and its joomaphic situation. Kither than developing normally, our coasting-
vessel is jeopardy for lack of well equipel dry dooks, also duo to the insufficient
technical preperation of our sailors. Yet, the marine, way remains the cheapest in
internal trade.
We shall consider the creation of a Navigation School, the noquisition of a mer-
ohant Marine for external trudo, and we shall give such fasilition as oan facilitato
the modernization of the coasting-vessels, the opening of now ports for external tra-
'de; the construction of a modern and free port in Port-au-Frings to nerve na war-
shousing for goods sonsigned to certain south-American countries, also the repair
and modernization of our existing porto.
1
In the fiold of air-transportation, these shall be created a national airline to
link Port-au-Prince with foreign cities. Shall also be croated sirports in the lar-`
ge towns of the Fepublio.
It is obvious that the success of this program which alls for disbursementa
amounting to around one billion five hundred millions dollars ($1.500.000.000.-)
over 25 years, shall depend largely upon the compatunue of all and in the Publie
Administration.

Of course in the political, military and intellectual domain we have had real
stars. However, our economic and social history is rather poor on a certain point
of view. This means that very few are those who, in spite of numerous obstacles,
have succeeded by notably increasing the national economy and improving the living
condition of our people. Our understanding of the "Benevolent State" requires that
this objective be its main job..
There have been numorous attempts, indeed. Comes to our memory Pantaleon Quilbaud,
the tobacco king during the time of our youth, but at last! just fugitive attempts!
If this is the case and of we really love this country we wish to be fully ours, our
duty is to tie up the old man binding us, and meaning hatred, meanness, above all,
envy. Then we will limit the consumption of our valuable men.

Not so long ago, we have written an article about Dr.Day when his laboratory was
consumed by fire. We did it then because in our opinion, for two generations, this
name stood as the sumbol of continuity for the community. In the same spirit, we
would like to evoke a new name, another social value who deserves admiration. This
name is Clonard Joseph CHARLES.
{
This emersion dates back from yesterday, and yet, he is already a pioneer. Dark,'
average in sise. Quick yes under a boad forehead which is already grawed by a prona-
ture baldness. This is his phisical stature in brief. Still young, only 39 years of
age. Glenard Joseph CHARLES was born in Gonaives in April 1923 and is proud of his
peasant origin. It was in this town that he received his primary and secundary educa-
tion, at the "Frères de l'Instruction Chrétienne" and the "Lycée Geffrard" Schools.
It was also in this Artibonite that he began the struggle for life, first as a rural
teacher. His father's death in 1939 marked a stage in his life. He had to take over
the heavy responsibility of meeting his family needs. Charles then proved to be a
disciplined man and became successively craftsman, plantation supervisor, without
giving up intellectual studies; he ventured in journalism as an amateur. As a progres-
sivemind, he strongly believes in the value of effort. From one activity, he goes to
another and is never discouraged by obstacles. He is a man who searches his way and
is determined to find it. In 1947, be, was General Controller of the Banana Industry
in the south and the year after, he was appointed General Agent for a Corporation.
His numerous contasis gave him at this time sufficient business experience for his
te undertake his own businone. In 1943, he settled me Manufacturer's Agent and doalt
in import-Expert. By dint of discipline, of úrnamäom and tenacity, the little rural

teacher of the year 1939′ is already well know as an experienced businessman, and
bis relations overseas are sugh that in 1953, he was appointed as a member of an
Economio Mission sent to London by the Government. Hd did so well that one year la-
ter, he was enousted by the Government with the mission of negociating a contract
with the General Electrio of Coventry for the improvement and extension of our tele-
communication system. In 1957, as a member of another mission, he took past in the
International Conference in Brussels. In the meantime, Chemard Joseph CHARLES devo-
ted himself to various commercial and industrial activities. His life is shared
between his office in the Capital City and numerous trips in the country where he
kept inquiring on possibilities of investment. Whenever you happen to meet him, he
speaker of new projects for the development of the country. His waiting-room is
always full of people either awaiting instructions for the countries, or agents,
also of other people asking for credit. Among his enterprises we note the Universal
Enterprise Co. (USACO) the National Deutsch Associates, The Cotton Industry in the
South and Charles-News & Co., without mensionning the branches of his store, All
These activities do not hinder aim from representing the General Electpio Co.,Ltd.
of London and the Siemons Sahukart Werke Co.'
E
But the masterpiece of his life as a businessman was the creation in 1960 of
the Commercial Bank of Haiti, a project he had long been dreaming of His initiative
ranks him as a great Pioneer. The Commercial Bank of Haiti is the first private Hai-
tian Bank. When one reals that the National Bank was redeemed only in 1949 to becom
me property of the Haitian State, then one will realise the amount of daring throught,
tenacity and broadness of view it took Clemard Joseph CHARLES in such a place to
materialise this creation that will have a part in the Koonomic History of our coun
try. Glenard Joseph CHARLES is the image of a new type of businessman we did not
know before. He broke up with the low customs of tradesmen, these brokers who find
themselves zelfishly satisfied with profit margine which the accumulate in banks
abroad and who begin again the routine each year. The reason for the backwardness
of our masses is that they do not have the support of an enterprising bourgeoisie
creating welfare opportunities. Charles believes that it should not be left to the
State alone the duty of promoting the economic development of the country. He iga
well aware of his mission and he knows that he must give a hand to the less fortune
Re ones to help their evolution. Therefore, this Commercial Bank that has met with
so muali suacose in so short a time is the conter of multiple activities profitable

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
SOURCE: W citizen, former Journalist, who has followed developments in the Caribbean
eres closely for many months and maintains contact with persons directly con-
berned with the area.
Hic ecumend of French and his habit of making detailed shorthand notes enable
him to report with an unusual degree of accuracy.
1. On 2 May 63, we had a four-hour interview with Clemard Joseph Charles, president
and general ummeger of Sanque Commerciale d'isiti, Port-au-Prince, vice president
of the Emitian Chamber of Commercs, and cousin of Joseph D. Charles, former
Haitian ambassador to the 13.
2. Clamard Charles, whose PO Box in Port-au-Prince is No. 5751, told us that he was
a nan of possent stock and that while a business leader he has the full confidence
of the predominantly peasant population of Haiti, and, that with the additional
backing of forcibly retired anti-Duvelier say officers, intellectuals, journal-
ists and businessmen, he is in a position to because the head of a provisional
government siter Duvalier is removed. He believes the symn between now and 15
May when Duvalier's term expices and 22 May, when his now turn is scheduled
to commence, will be the most crucial period for biti. is believes Duvelier is
ready to institute a reign of terror, killing those who oppose him, and is
Billing to eccept Novalec help. About two weeks ag, the Polish charge d'affaires
left Port-au-Prince for Poland, and Charles believes he carries Duvelier's re- :
quest for ecomonic and poupibly military kelp.

learned that in early April 1963

Charles firmly believes this will be the last chance for the US Government to
help establish demouratie Raiti friendly to U3 and save the country for
Costro-type Comumist trisover. Although he has bean on good terms with Du-
valier, he now foold that the President "wont crazy and must be stopped before

Mr Charles that I regard as reliable. He is specifically referred to
as "Papa Doc's" beaker and financial manager. Mr Charles, as would
be expected is "very close to the Palace" and has ready access to
President. Duvalier. As for his character, he is described as “a
crook and a poor liar." In other words, Mr Charles is truly a Haitian
political character and not to be trusted under any conditions.
6. I noted that Mr Charles mentions his activity in 1954 as a negotiator
on behalf of the Haitian Government with the General Electric Co of
England for modernization of the country's telecommunications system.
As a result of this contract Haiti experienced one of its greatest
political scandals for the contract was for US$4 million, and the
actual delivery of products was only US$1 million. I, likewise,
observed that Hr Charles is president of the Haitian Banana Corp
which was originally operated by Eric Tippenhauer and Colonel Prosper,
and subsequently was bankrupt because of financial mismangement.
Still further, Essential Oils Co was at one time the exclusive domain
of Senator Louis De Joie, and since his death the company is headed
by Mr Charles.
1
7. I am personally satisfied that Mr Clésarů Joseph Charles is President
Duvalier's personal financial manager, and the companies directed
by Mr Charles are in fact owned and/or controlled for the benefit
of Haiti's chief executive. At the moment Mr Charles' principal
assistent in the tobacco industry is Henry Siclait, who just happens
to be Director of the Haitian Tobacco Monopoly and Secretary-Treasurer
of Le Tabac Haition, S. A. Siclait is believed to be Mr Charles'
"hatchet man" but I was not able to verify this allegation.
