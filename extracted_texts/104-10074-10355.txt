Ramparts' Tours New York Media Workshop's
Womens' Tour:
Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Jason
Horn, CI/SO, the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's
Tour which is scheduled to visit London, Paris (where they
will meet the DRV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May
25 June 1972 with (M)-7 and instructed her to attempt to determine
the interest in, and likely composition of, the New York
group and explore the possibility of joining such a group
and explore the possibility of joining such a group. 02 (M) 7's
first reaction to the tour was that the cost ($699, which
price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high.
It was explained to her that the cost factor should not
deter her from following through. It was the tenet C:C:C:CE:C:C:C:C:_:_:_:/
voiced some concern that the timing of the tour may Zinterfere
with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of
mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear
to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for
her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well
prove to be of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV
delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her
actual departure. 02 (M-7 said that she understood and would
look into the matter. She did not believe she would have
any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself
included on the tour.
d. South East Asia Reports (SEAR): (M)-7 produced
a copy of the first issue of SEAR, a bi-weekly newsletter
put out by the New York University Students Nobilization

staff members on the back page of this mimeographed new
left publication. A copy of this first issue is attached
hereto. One of (M_)7's articles will appear in a subsequent
issue of SEAR.

foreign assignment, the undersigned arranged for two members
