LAURICIE Information
LIFEAT has contributed materially to several matters having
LAURICLE interest.
Counter-Intelligence Information
CI/CE matters constitute a major portion of the lexico city
Stationis priority objectives. Project LIFEAT has contributed to
the attainment of these objectives. The two BGMORNING installations
have provided valuable information for the responsible Case Officer
on the matters involved therein.
Conclusion
The Mexico City Station believes that the product of the LIFEAT
Project measured against the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms
of personnel, time, security risks and finds well justifies its
renewal. The information produced by this operation has materially
contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related
Mission Directive.
Progress of the Operation
Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the
LIFEAT Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing nature
and are not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the
porcentage of coverage on each objective. A general indication of the
"coverage can be derived when it is realized that some 10,000 pages of raw
text in 10 months are the direct result of the operation from which the
statistics cited above were derived. Except, for a period in July and
August 1958, following the termination of members of the James O. AYCAL L
family, LIFEAT has been in daily operation with some 12-16 lines being
covered. These may be broken dom as follows;
Soviet Embassy
Czech Legation
Polish Legation
American Communists
- Remainder
5 lines
2 lines(moved during this period and only in
operation for approximately 2 months)
3 lines (third installed in April 1959)

Mexican Communist party and Communist Fronts
A significant mount of information concerning the Communist party
CP in Mexico and the Communist front organizations in Mexico was obtained
from LIFEAT. Information from LIFEAT has been invaluable in supple-
menting agent coverage of the front-organizations which exist here.
Examples of this type reporting include,
HMM-A-11411, The Narciso BASSOLS Family and polish Legation
HMM-A-11412, 5 Nov. 1958, Travel of Narciso BASSOLS.
American Communists in Nexico
Most of these targets have been covered at the request of ODENVY
and the production has been partially processed by them. A total of
572 reels was provided them for processing during a 10-month period
anding 30 April 1959. Samples of the reporting done from this source
includes

ABSTRACT
PROCESSING
ACCOM
PUSHES"
1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-
able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, this Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high
enough priority to cover.
2. For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue
the coverage.
3. Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred
to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro-
Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by
LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VASQUEZ Gomes.

'During the coming year Station capabilities will be expanded to permit
monitoring of approdmately 24 lines. Basic coverage of Soviet, Czech and
Polish activities will be continued to the maximum extent possible and
assets and capabilities will be maintained for exploiting important targets
of opportunity. At the present time and with the new system effected for
LIFEAT lines, Station believes that 24 will be the maximum number of lines
which can be properly handled and handled securely by the personnel cur-
rently available for LIFEAT •

performance of Agents
In general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good and
secure during the past year. The personnel from the AYCALL group were
terminated during this period and compartmentation has been employed in
the re-assignment of tasks among LIFEAT chain. In view of the high degree
of security necessary for the personnel involved in this operation, it
is planned to screen very carefully any possible candidates before they
are approached for use in this operation after prior approval has been
procured from Headquarters for an approach.
5.
Expenditures during period under Review
-
Approval was granted for the period under review, 1 July 1958
30 June 1958 to spend $159,590.00. The proposed LIFEAT budget for FY 1960
is contained in the attached Field Project Outline Part II.
6.' Status of Commitments

purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine Sino-Soviet and Satellite
plans, activities and connections with other Communist elements through the
use of technical surveillance. This purpose is in consonance with the
Related Adsion Directive for Mexico, Priority A, Objective one.
3.
Background
Project LIFEAT was initially approved on 3 October 1950. Actual
operations began 18 January 1951 and have run continuously since that time.
The LIFEAT Project was begun with the installation of one telephone tap
and has been expanded since that time to where the present coverage averages
18 lines.
Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent
from any liaison arrangement and is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract
employees with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents,
During the past eight years Project LIFEAT has produced more than
55,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support
of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed
materially to the intelligence- gathering activities connected with the
Sino-Soviet and Satellite Bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of
considerable value and assistance in monitoring the activities of Americans
residing in Maxico City in which ODENVY has major interest.

etings are held at night. All movement in and out of bases by
the Case officers and Principal Agents is done in cars ostensibly
owned by agents except in the case of LIVERY where agents are too
old to drive. one of the indigenous agents is used to contact LIVERY
base. Entrance to bases on foot is made only in great emergencies.
b. Telephonic contact concerning the Project and with agents is kept
to a minimum and code is used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agents:
c. Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged.
d. In general these systems of contact and communication appear to
be suitable for the Project and function adequately from a security
viewpoint. Locations and times of meetings are changed frequently
to prevent discovery.
Control and Motivation
Control and motivation seem to be based on two factors primarily:
ideological and monetary. A third controlling factor would be fear of
reprisal from local police should discovery occur.
lis.
Equipment and Support
It is believed probable that a great deal of replacement equipment
will be required by the Project during FY 1960 since much of the current
equipment installed and working has been in use for the length of the
project and since this equipment is no longer being manufactured, replace-
ment parts will be unobtainable soon and new units will be required.
15.
Timetable
LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception
in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

from Chief, WH/II dated 2 mly
According to a telephone call from Herb Manell of SR/10 on
23 July 1958 SR Division believes that information produced by
Project LIFTAT on the RIS and the Soviets is most valuable,
He stated that this pro bet is the chief source of information
other than physical, surveillance.
The only recommendation that SR Division would make is that
the field be more selective in the reporting that is transmitted
to Headquarters
(This recommendation has already been passed to
the field)

LITMUS Phase
2 July 1958
1. Due to a period of dormancy, the LITMUS phase of the
LIFEAT Project has furnished a relatively small amount of reporting,
during the past year, concerning REDOX officials and their
activities in Mexico. While mall in quantity, the information
furnished has been of considerable operational valuo because of
nature of the operation and the fact that it serves as a majer.
source of data on the BEDOX target. The LITMUS operation has
furnished accurate travel data, information on the function
scope of activity engaged in by the BETOX personalities we are
interested in and has helped us determine the number of contacts
the B500X installation maintains with the local citisanry in the
course of its activitias. In the last case, the LITIS operation
has linked a local citizen, long suspected of Soviet Bloc
intelligence activity, with one known and one suspected BEDOX
intelligence officer serving under diplomatic cover in Maxico.
This local citizen is now the subject of an extensive effort to
prove his Soviet Bloc intelligence role and to determine the extent
of his activity. Finally, the LITMUS operation has begun to furnish
valuable operational data on a ESDOX personality who has recently
arrived to assume a consular post. This particular BROOX official
was recommended to the field as a target of interest because of his
past intelligence background: We feel confident that the LITMUS
operation will aid considerably in our effort to monitor the
activities of this individual.
55
2. Now that the LITHUS phase of the LIFEAT operation has,
once again, begun to function, we believe that the information
obtained therefrom will show a steady increase in operational
valús during the coming year.

only changes made in the Project review - LIFEAT section was the deletion
of several examples of reports originating from several LIF AT sources.
These deletions (such as the last five examples of reverts on Soviet
Commercial Activities) were made because the reports did not originate with
LIFEAT eventhough they did concern the Subject being discussed. Part I of
the Project Outline excerpts submitted by the field was also submitted for
approval--the only change made was the omission of the field's request for
a change in paragraph 6 of the Project Outline on Objectives. Headquarters
did not think subparagraph "f" should be deleted.

Before its suspension in January 1958, the LIVERY phase of Project LIFEAT
provided biographie data on the members of the Czech Legation in Mexico City
which ER/C found
sorul in the evaluation of these individuals as possible

A. Soviet Coverage
PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT REVIEW
As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel Haison project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early
January 1962 LIFEẠT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
most active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the con-
tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Soviet contacts,
and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
renewal. As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient
time to fully evaluate its usefulness. However, It is believed that such
coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the CI
field. Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product
of this type has been obtained. Samples are as follows:
HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)
HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)
HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut
TITOV will visit Mexico)
B. Polish Embassy
LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful, continuing penetration of the target. The information provided
to the Interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and
"Invaluable". This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-
duct of this coverage are:
HMMA-17448, 28 July 1961 (Henryk POTASZ)
HMMA-17647, (LIFEAT/LAURICLE). 25 August 1961-
HMMA-17694, 1 September 1961 (Irena Halina ZORAWSKA)

order to provide more secure LIFEAT coverage, a new system of installation of

from detecting any LIFEAT lines with a voltage meter.

Soviet Comercial Activitie
During the past year reports submitted
creening the traffic of
established Soviet Commercial Cricos in Mexico have provided a great mount of
detail concerning Soviet efforts to sell in the Latin Amer can market, both heavy
industrial merchandise and movies and literature. Knowledge of their methods of
transshipping and attempts at concealment of point of origin of products has been
gleaned from this take. As a result of this knowledge, reports on the firms with
whom they are doing business have been procured and provided for background infor-

Jewish Commmist Activities:
Coverage of the Jewish Commist leader, Samual MAGIDIII Hugidin, has confirmo
the contiming decline of the local Jewish Commist i
Local Jewish Commist movement. It has also provided
the Station with information on those former members who continue to meet at
irregular intervals on an informal basis.
Conclusion:
13377
The Nexico City Station believes that the produce of the LIFRAT Project measured
against the expenditure of K/BARK asnots in terms of personnel, time, security risks
and funds wall Justifies its romeval. The information produced by this operation has
materially contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related Hission
Directive.
2. Propress of the Operation
Definite progress has been made in reporting the objectives of the LIFEAT
Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing nature and are not
designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of coverage
on each objective. A general indication of the coverage can be derived when it is
realized that some 15,000 pages of reir text are the direct result of the operation
from which the statistics cited above were derived. Except for a period from 1
February - 11 April 1958 LIFEAT has been in daily operation with some 18 to 23
linas being covered. Generally, these may be broken down as fallovní

Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet persoanel presently in Maxico
has been mintained by Station Nico. This has been the primary source of such
information. LIFEAT has enabled the Station to determine in advance when departures
can be expected for the Soviets, prior to their pertament departure, normally stock
up on clothing and occasionally other items throught to be in short supply in the USSR.
8. Soviet Embassy Contacts:
J.
Contacts reports of the Soviets are compiled and provided badquarters
necessary. These reports are of considerable operation value in identifying local
and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets are in regular contact. Following

•
LIFEAT has provided the Station with the most productive source of infor-
concerning the private and official lives of the Soviets assigned hose.
These reports have been submitted on dindividuals, e.g. HRIA-9504, Aleksey N.

Goods and Services
Periodic reports of the parsons and institutions known to be providing
goods and services to the Soviet Embassy have been of considerable value in developing
and mounting a LAURICLE operation. Information of this type has also been of con-
siderable value to the Station in the LDESA operation.
1. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:
LIFEAT material which does not fall into my one category but which deals
with the Soviets and their associates and related activities has been reported as
necessary.

The information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under review
is essentially the same as that from the Soviet Embassy. To avoid repetition, only:

has been procured from LIFSA. An exemple of reports
from this source is Bal-3161, Leon KILARSKI, Polish Commercial Attache. Another
is 1844-3130, Suspicious Contact of Edward RUDSKI Josef Isnak GENSCHAFT.
Mexican Communist Party and Communist Fronts
A significant amount of information concerning the Communist Party in Mexico-
and the Communist front organizations in Mexico vas obtained from LIFEAT. Informan
tion from LIFAT has been invaluable in supplementing agent coverage of the front-
organizations which exist here. Examples of this type of reporting are as follows:
-
R-3193 Narciso BASSOLO and Parily,
IBSL-3176

Travel of Pro-Commists
American Commists in Mexico:
One of the most extensive and productive coverages maintained through LIFEAT
during this past year was directed against American Communists in mexico. Mast of
these targets have been covered at the request of NY and the production has
been partially processed by the for the justification of one of their dota in
their local establishment. A total of 361 reals have been the result of the
coverage since 1 July 1957 until 25 April 1958.
Foreign Communists in Mexico and Nexican Communists:
LIFEAT continued to provide partial coverage of Eduardo MACHADO Morales,
Venezuelan Commmmist, until the time of his departure for return to Venezuela.
LIFEAT also provided some 50 reels of coverage on Diego HIVERA, well-known Commist
Mexican painter, until his dealth in November 1957. From this coverage it was
determined that RIVERA was sufficiently concerned over the departure of the former
Soviet Cultural Attache, Yuriy PAPOROV, that he arose from his sick bed in order to
make the trip to Verecrus by car to insure that PAPORN's departure vas vithout
incident.

C. Cuban Coverage
LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba. This technical operation not only pro-
vided initial leads which alerted the Station to these companies, but also
was able to provide continuing Information on the daily activities of the com-
panies involved. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal
transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-
tacts and general activities. Samples of the positive intelligence production
from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:
HMMA-18073, 31 October 1961 (Ruben SAUREZ Y Alvarez,
Representative in Mexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign
Commerce)
HMMA-18538, 2 February 1962 (Cuban Commercial Activities)

D. American Communists in Mexico
As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
'request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been partially processed by them.
During the period July 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
take were passed to local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable
information gleaned from the targets in this field continues to deal with con-
tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM).

2. The following have been cleared for use under LIFEAT since the
last Project renewal. Since they were not mentioned in your request for
renewal, have they been activated under Project LIFEAT and should they
be included in our request for renewal? Are any funds required to cover
their use?
LIQUATION
Subject of H94–5906:
3. The following agents were included under the LIFEAT Project
renewal of last year. Since none of them receive pay their names did
not appear on Part II of the Project Outline attached to reference.
Therefore, Headquarters does not know whether they are still active
under the Project. In our request for renewal we must indicate the
names of all agents who have been dropped from the project during the
past project, year and the present use being made of each agent. Please
indicate those agents who are no longer under Project LIFEAT and what
use is being made of each. If they are not active, please submit agent
service records on them. If they are being used for other work please
submit new PRQ II's and requests to amend their Operational Approvals.
Unless advised to the contrary, Headquarters will assume the following
are still active under Project LIFEAT:
LIMESTONE-9
LIRESTONE 10
LIQUATION-2
LIPSTICK-35
LIPSTICK-37
LIMITATION-7
4. The covering dispatch to your request for LIFEAT Project renewal
stated that LICOOL and the provision for Harvey C. MULFORD had been
removed from LIFFAT. Since MULFORD is covered by Project MKCHARITY,
Headquarters assumes you intend to carry out LICOOL operations under
Project MKCHARITY. In view of the fact Project MKCHARITY is a KURIOT
Project which supports KURIOT Staff Agents Harvey C. MULFORD and Alice
.N. HADZELLI and provides for technical equipment and technical services,
Headquarters does not believe LICOOL' belongs under MKCHARITY. If
LICOOL were included under MKCHARITY, the latter project would have to
te amanded to provide for such operational activity and to provide funds
for base houses, base house-keepers, and processors of LICOOL take.

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities
1
LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups
· active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and
not available from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this
area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more
recently Spanish Republican exiles. The product has been most rewarding in this
coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:
HMMA-17489, 4 August 1961 (Alejandro GALINDO)
HMMA-18420, 5 January 1962 (Teodora MARTEN Rodriguez)
HMMA-18468, 16 January 1962 (Travel of Salvadorans to Cuba).

Jewish Communist Activities:
Coverage of the Jewish Communist leader, Samuel MAGEDIN Magidin, has confirmed
the continuing decline of the local Jewish Communist movement. It has also provided
the Station with information on those former members who continue to meet at
irregular intervals on an informal basis.
Conclusion:
The Mexico City Station believes that the produce of the LIFEAT Project measured
against the expenditure of KUBARK assets in terms of personnel, time, security risks
ánd funds well justifies its renewal. The information produced by this operation has
materially contributed to several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission-
Directive.
2. Progress of the Operation
Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the LIFEAT
Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing rature and are not
designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of coverage
on each objective. A general indication of the coverage can be derived when it is
realized that some 15,000 pages of raw text are the direct result of the operation
from which the statistics cited above were derived. Except for a period from 1
February 11 April 1958 LIFEAT has been in daily operation with some 18 to 23
lines being covered. Generally, these may be broken down as follows:
-
Soviet Embassy

Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet personnel presently in Mexico

These reports are of considerable operation value in identifying local
and foreign Communists with whom the Soviets are in regular contact. Following
are exciples of this type of coverage:
HMM-2841
HMM-3199
-
MONTES y BRADLEY (fnu)
-
Narciso BASSOLS Contacts with the Soviet Embassy.
Personality Reports on Soviet Officials:
LIFEAT has provided the Station with the most productive source of infor=
mation concerning the private and official lives of the Soviets assigned here.
These reports have been submitted on individuals, e.g. HMM-A-9504, Alaksey N.
CHERKASOV, and also under one cover, BM-A-9856, January 1958 Report of Personnel
Activities.
h. Goods and Services: .
Periodic reports of the persons and institutions known to be providing
goods and services to the Soviet Embassy have been of considerable value in developing
and mounting a LAURICES operation. Information of this type has also been of con-
siderable value to the Station in the LDESA operation.
1. Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:
LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which deals
with the Soviets and their associates and related activities has been reported as
necessary.
The Czech Legation
The information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under review
is essentially the same as that from the Soviet Embassy. To avoid repetition, only
a brief summary or the information submitted will be given here.

nnel presently assigned here for LoFEAT.
Performance of Agents:
In general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good and secure during
the past year. It is hoped that within the coming year the remainder of the AYCALL
group will be securely and permanently removed from the Project and replaced by
well-compartmented personnel. In view of the high degree of security necessary
for the personnel involved in this operation, it is planned to screen very carefully
any possible candidates before they are approached for use in this operation after
prior approval for an approach has been secured from Headquarters.
Additional comments concerning the production, security and cover of individual
agents will be found in the attached amendment to the field outline which was submitted
with HMM-W-5708.
5. Expenditures during Period under Review
Approval was granted for the period under review, 1 July 1957 - 30 June 1958,
to expend $156,647. The proposed LIFEAT budget for FY 1959 is contained in the
attached field project outline Part II.
6. Status of Commitments
There are no commitments other than those provided for in the outline
individual contracts of several LIFEAT personnel..

Information on this installation closely parallds that obtained on the Czech
Legation and the Soviet installations. The largest amount of information concern-
ing the Polish installation has been procured from LIFEAT. An example of reports
from this source is HM-3161, Leon KILARSKI, Polish Commercial Attache. Another
is HMM-3130, Suspicious Contact of Edward RUDSKI, Josef Isnak GENSCHAFT.
Mexican Communist Farty and Communist Fronts
A significant amount of information concerning the Communist Party in Mexico
and the Communist front organizations in Mexico was obtained from LIFEAT. Informa-
tion from LIFEAT has been invaluable in supplementing agent coverage of the front-
organizations which exist here. Examples of this type of reporting are as follows:
HMM-3193 - Narciso BASSOLS and Family;
HMM-31767- Travel of Pro-Communists
American Communists in Mexico:
One of the most extensive and productive coverages maintained through LIFEAT
during this past year was directed against American Communists in Mexico. Most of
these targets have been covered at the request of ODENVY and the production has
been partially processed by them for the justification of one of their slots in
their local establishment. A total of 381 reels have been the result of the
coverage since 1 July 1957 until 25 April 1958.
.
Foreign Communists in Mexico and Mexican Communists:
LIFEAT continued to provide partial coverage of Eduardo. MACHADO Morales,
Venezuelan Communist, until the time of his departure for return to Venezuela.
LIFEAT also provided some 50 reels of coverage on Diego RIVERA, well-known Communist
Mexican painter, until his death in November 1957. From this coverage it was
determined that RIVERA was sufficiently concerned over the departure of the former
Soviet Cultural Attache, Yuriy PAPOROV, that he arose from his sick bed in order to
make the trip to Veracruz by car to insure that FAFOROV's departure was without
incident.

14. Equipment and Support
It is considered essential that new equipment be provided for LIFEAT for FY
1959 in view of the fact that much of the equipment in current use has been.
steadily in operation since the inception of the project in 1951. Also, in view
of expected expansion of the project and the possibilities of live monitoring,
additional equipment in first-class condition will be necessary. A backlog of
10 new recorders and 300 reels along with repair parts is considered a minimum
for efficient continuance of the project.

PROJECT OUTLINE
(Excerpts)
Background
75
Project LIFEAT was initially approved October 1950 Actual operations
began on 18 January 1951 and have run almost continuously since that time
The LIFEAT operation was begun with the installation of one telephone taj
and has since expanded to an average of 23 telephone lines.
Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely independent
from any liaison arrangement and it is staffed by KUBARK personnel, both staff
and contract, together with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled.
agents.
During the time of its operation Project LIFEAT has produced more than
50,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support
of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically and has contributed.
materially to the intelligence gathering activities connected with the Sino-
Soviet bloc. In addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and
assistance in monitoring the activities of Americans residing in Mexico City
in which ODENVY has an interest and also has, at the direction of Headquarters,
installed special taps on targets of opportunity.

SUBJECT
Project LIFEAT (Amendmen

tions
The attached project, originating in in! Division, is designod
determine Sino/Soviet/Satellite plans, activities, and co
ements through independent audio-ðurveillan
other Commun
oper
in Mexico. It is presented for your approval of two asent with
first, to pamit the utilisation of Roland K. WINGSESS (p)¨¨
tional Staff Agent in the project, and the second, to establish for cover
purposes a $20,000 0. S. bank account for Staff agant Danial K. PROMUND (p)
in order that he may obtain Rantinta status in Köxico.
2. Authority is requested to obligato an additional $26,493 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget for fiscal year 1958. Sufficient funds are
available in the bH Division budget. If approved, these two amendments
will raise the total amount authorized for the present project year,
1 July 1957 through 30 June 1958, to $156,647. Project AT was
renewed by the DDCI on 30 October 1957 in the amount of $130,154.
3. Attached is the LIFEAT Project Outline, which sets forth the
important factors involved in the operation; a WH Division memorandum,
dated 31 October 1957, which explains the proposal for scouring Bantiata
status for BROMUND; and a WH Division memorandum, dated 13 November 1957,
which requests authority to incorporate WINGSNESS into the project as
Staff Agent.
4. CCB/NC comments that according to Finance Division, establishing
a bank account for BROMUND is the only means of satisfying the require-
ments of the Mexican government. The Letter of Credit must be irrmocable
and allow a stated withdrawal par period (as in this case, par quarter) in
order that the full amount cannot be liquidated before the expiration of
the fantista. CCB/NC recommands approval in this connection. In addition
CCB/HC recommends approval of the proposed use of WINGSEKSS, provided that
his cover, which has not been determined as yet, be coordinated with CCB/HC
sufficiently in advance to allow CCB/NC to state any objections deemed
necessary and to take offective action toward establishing sound cover.

LIFEAT/Cuban: The most noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts
in the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
vities of Transcontinental, S. A. in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials
to Cuba via Mexico. LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican
business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones
Mexicanas, S. A. and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable
information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,
methods and contacts used in their procurement, and information on the con-
tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained.
LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
Intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-
tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when one of their CIS officers,
Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt. Through LIFEAT
"Ilvemonitoring" of both the original and followup defection attempts, the
KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts
by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapment of the KUBARK per-
sonnel involved.
LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone
tap in providing a lead which could develop into a vital penetration of the Polish
intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT
provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-
ment of the operation. It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service
by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year. (Full
information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest
to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S. and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in which
a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided not only the initial leads,
but alsɔ daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case,
LIFEAT/Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target.
Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital
data on personalities, contacts, and services obtained by the target establish-
ment must be provided. It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this
coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only
present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and wil

order to obtain Remista status from the Mexican Government, it is necessary to
show documents which prove that the applicant has an income of approximately
$350 per month for a period of five years, On approval of this amendment, it
is plamed to open an account for Daniel K. BROMUND for the amount of $20,000
against which the bank will issue him a letter of Credit which will permit his

1. Paragraph four, e, of reference contains a request for ten used EXOTAPE
recorders. However, it is not clear unsther this request is in addition
to or in place of the request ocntained in HEXI 918, dated 9 August 1957.
The recorders requested in MEXI 318 are forwarded to the Station under
cargo muabers 20369 and 20370 on 16 and 17 September 1957 (ase DIR 35369
and DMR 35748), and probably arrived at the Station after the referenced
dispatch vas written.
2. There are no used EXOTAPE recorder's available at Headquarters for ship-
ment to the Station. However, KIRIT has advised the Desk that should
any used recorders become available at Headquarters or at other field
stations, thay will make every effort to send them to Mexico City. As
the Station probably nous, MUTAYE recorders are no longer manufactured.
3. KURIOT requested that the Station informed that KURIOT appreciates
the technical Terent contained in the reference. They will investigate
further the technical probleme experienced by the Station; the Station
will be advised of any significant developments. KURIOT considers that
six months use from the Revere heads, under LIFEAT operating conditions,
is quite good.
4. In view of the unavailability of used EXOTAFE recorders and the recent
shipment of ten new REVERE recorders, Headquarters will take no further
action on the referenced request unless requested to do so by the Station.

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any
operations against the Yugoslav target.
LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-
porting information in backing Station double agent operations. In this area
the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent. LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case
officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved. LIFEAT also provides
a needed check upon the activities of the double agent.
LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles
in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the
senior ODACID official in Mexico. LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile
factions both involveu in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage
of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and
activities of the various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile
community in Mexico City.
LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the re-
porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron
Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and
Leftists, to Cuba. Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of
information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data
on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to regain their
former status in the U.S. film industry.
Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has been enhanced
through LIFEAT periodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations.
H. Conclusion
It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station
operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral
LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest

•
One of the most extensive and productive coverages initiated
through LIFT during the past year was directed against American
Communists in Mexico. Most of these targets wore conưod at thể
request of C0ENVY and the production was processed in part by
OLENVY. A total of 342 reels of information were recorded on
three separate cases. A fourth case, LCMAYFOIL, was mounted at the
sugguation of ODEWY Just 15 hours after the station received
the request from Headquarters. The Station has received three
commentdations from Headquarters on the LIP. AT coverage of the
case and Edward "På SFCHEN received a personal commendation
from the DCI for his work on this operation. Over 90 reals of
valuable information have been produced since the beginning of
this operation on 9 February 1957.
Mexican Government
During the early part of 1957 LIFEAT coverage provided the
means for the Station to assess reports from another source
concerning the hardening of the Mexican Goverment's attitude
toward foreign Comunista. LIFTAT coverage of various individual
targets provided reliable information on the arrests of the
foreign oumnists Mario SOSA Navarro, Joaquin ORDIQUI, Jacobo

Hidden Microphone Operation

against the residence of the Sovint Counselor of Embassy and has
caused a great deal of concern with the tecnical problems of
installing the equipment and recording conversations properly in
order that acceptable production of operational data night te
obtained. A TSF technician is presently at the Station correcting
these deficiencies; and, recent cable reports have provided
valuable information which tends to confirm previous tentative
conclusions that the Soviet Counselor of phassy is a suitable

currently making the necessary plans to approzen the areat,

concerned with targets located in Noxico City.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine ino-Soviet plans,
activities and connections with other communfet elements through
the use of toclinical surveillanco. This mirpore appears to be in
consonance with the Felated Mission Directive for Mexico (datod
7 May 1957), Priority A, Objective One.
3. Beckerwund
Project LIFRAT was approved initially on 3 October 1950. Actual
operations began on 18 January 1951 and have run continuously since
that time. The LIVEAT operation was begun with the installation of
one telephone tap and has expanded since that time to an averaço
daily monitoring of 23 talaphone lines and from one to four hidden
microphone installations (the microphone operations ware originally
under a separate project-LINOL),
I. :
Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation. It is completely
independent from any liaison arrangement and is staffed by Agency
staff and contract employees together with a substantial number
of local indigenous controlled avents.
During the past six years Project LIFEAT has produced more
than 17,000 pares of operational and intelligence information in
direct support of the Mexico City Station's objectives specifically
and has contributed materially to the intelligence gathering
activities connected with the Sino-foriet loc. In addition,
Project LIFEAI has been of considerable value and assistance in
monitoring the retivities of Americane residing in Mexico City in
which OPENVY has major interent.

Definite pro-ress has been made in reporting on the objectives
of the LIFEAT project; however, all objectives are of a
continuing nature and are not designed to be fully achinved. For
this reason, no statistics can be cited as to the percentage of
coverage on each objective. A general indication can be derived
of the scope of the project by realizing that aproximately 15,000
parea of mursɩary text have hoen obtained from IFAT during the
past year. An average of 23 iultaneous coverages on a 2 hour
por day lasis has been maintained during this review period,

to the liaison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel,
and security risk. As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's
envolvement in the parallel, but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in
attitude by the present local government administration or a change in govern-
ment administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project.
For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy coverage,
must be available to once again undertake coverage of the official Soviet and
Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation,
though toward supporting Station operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward
targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for
recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the
LIFEAT project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.
T. Thère is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material
during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's
prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations.
II. Progress of the Operation
The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time. For this
reason percentage figures as to completion of project objectives cannot be drawn.
However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment
of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced
in the period July 1961 through May 1962. LIFEAT has been in daily operation
during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month
being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.
III. Planning for the Future
As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion
of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so.
Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-
ment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to
reveal its interest or operations to the liaison forces involved in the LIENVOY
operation.
As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEẠT assets in "hot mike operations which require access to telephone

12. Contact and Communications
-
a. Contact and communications between the case officer
the arents and undercover personnel in this operation is maintained
in a clandestine manner. Various patterns have been established
by which the arents and the case officers follow prearranged
signals for the meetings. Then heavy or bulky material is to be
passed, the meetings are always hold at nights. All movement in
and out of bases by the Case Dicers and Principal Agents is done
in cars ostensiblyomed by the base agents, exrept in the case of
LIVERY, where the agents are too old to drive. One of the local
arents is usually used to contact the [TVERY have.
the bases by foot is made only in great emergencies.
b. Telephonic contact concerning the Project :is kopt
miniam and a code system of digits and cryptonyme has been
devised for use by the agents and case officers for phone
conversations.
Alternate and encryoney signals have been worked out,
d. In general these avstems of contact and comunication
have been in practice for over six years and appear to have been
suitable to the work. In detail, locations and times of Neetings
have been changed frequently.

that the telephone crew had the habit of putting a high lauder up to the roof of
any house upon which they wished to work, whereas in the past it had been their
custom to ring the doornell, ask permission co co to the roof and do so through
the house where they wished to work. This new custom brought about the need to
study emergency procedures and redraw them. A limited experiment was made on one
Fine with some success. This experiment consisted of leaving the hot stub of one
lins on the base roof as usual, but instead of leading it directly into th ope
tions rcom, as previously, was attached loosely to a lead-in made of sorter
wire of the type used for interior installations. In the moment of need, the base.
operator had merely to haul on the soft lead, which therewith parted from the out-
side wire. Upon reaching the roof, therefore, the telephone, men found only a stub
ending in random fashion. This emergency method is ecnsidered better than none
but is satisfactory for ro more than one line at a time. It is the further dis-
advantage in that the outside
that the outside wire stub is "hot" and could be checked by the
telephone crew who, as they have done in the past on a few occasions, might call
tre target on that hot stub to see where he was located. In general, the station
continues to recommend that when telephone crews are working near a base or along
its net, crosses should be pulled and the operation suspended till the crews have
left the neighborhood.. An exception was made in the Halperin case because it was
hoped the line would shed light on LCMAYFOWL.

:
Technical: No technical problems were encountered in June 1957.
f. Personnel and Administrative: No problems of a personnel or administra-
tive nature were noted.
g. Miscellaneous: LIFIAT Annex IV was rented early in June and is being
readied for use on three to five targets during July. LIMERICK Annex II is still
out of service owing to the absence of LIQUATION and the continuance of work in
the zone by the telephone company. LIVERY is out of service owing to the retire-
ment of LIMESTONES 1 and 2 from active duty on account of the alleged blackmail
plot of April 1957. LOTRICK Annex III is out of service and will not be recon-
missioned. One of its LIM RICK target lines was changed over to LIMERICK main
base on 28 June. The other two lines from Annex III should be installed at
LIMERICK main base during July.

centrals and cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation
has already been proven, in a recent operation with the LIERODE installation
as a target. Seven reels of "hót mike" take were obtained in test runs on
checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" instrument
in the office of the head of the LIERODE official installation) and the equipment
which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technician
assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before con-
tinuous operation could get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon
complete renovation of its telephone system, including the installation of a
switchboard. This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against
this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is
the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of interest. In
these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and series cross
maintenance, basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of take.
From the brief test runs via the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed
that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald
the Station in its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission
Directive.
IV. Performance of Agents
+14+S
The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
tinued to be good during the period of the project review, with security being
stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered
which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-
quarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will continue to be sought
on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment.
V. Expenditures
Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for FY
1962 in the amount of $98, 973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1953 is broken
down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request, Part II, and totals
$102,169.00. 95,993.001 94,000,00
VI. Status of Commitments
There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline submitted
herewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda of
oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel.

The following report is keyed to the headings required in FN 52-670 sec 3c2.
a. Processing of information: No change. The LCMAYFOWL phase of the
operation was live monitored all day and during the early evening hours. A large
number of ZONAR abstract sheets, made out by Olivia Gladmon and Alice Gailleteau,
were forwarded to Headquarters. Gladmon was also used on the processing of the
Maurice ALPERIN target. During June the new system of making numerous carbon
copies of the traffic was further developed and hence more copies were made avail-
able for clipping and putting into "p" (201) files. Routine reporting on monthly
developments, particularly pertaining to the LIMERICK phase, was continued on the
same basis as in the past.

b. Exploitation of leads: Leads connected with the visit of the alleged
Communist agent Jacobo UCHNIK, from Argentina were followed through the Maurice
HALPERIN line and were coordinated with other activities on the case. From
IFTAT coverage it was also ascertained that LCNAYFOWL was in contact with Boris
KOLAMAYAKOV, RIS case officer stationed at the Soviet Embassy. This knowledge,
obtained by voice recognition of KOLONYAKOV in a single contact with the LCMAYFOWL
target, resulted in the mounting of a physical surveillance of the LÙMAYFOEL tar-
get which confirmed the existence of the contact and enable the station to derive
further information of importance. In a third instance, LIFEAT contact between
Mexican Army officer and an RIS officer enabled the station to make plans to cover
a meeting between them scheduled for 3 July 1957. Finally, coverage of LIMERICK
targets commercial lines enabled the station to direct various investigations
which resulted in the identification of several commercial contacts of that
establishment.
C. Liaison: Not applicable.
"
d. Security: Security on the project remained without substantial change.
Nothing further has developed from the alleged blackmail plot of April 1957. On
the other hand, the activities of the local telephone company, which is now more
solvent than in many years because of a new financial setup, continued to cause
problems and temporary suspensions of work. LITHUS was not run during the entire
month and the Maurice HALPERIN phase was suspended after about a week's operation
owing to the presence of telephone crews in the same block as the base house as
well as at other points along the LITMUS segment of the net. It was observed

operations in Mexico against the Poles will now be aimed pri-
marily at the clarification of the status of the PIS in Mexico,
the recruitment of Polish officials within the Legation, and
answering the basic question of what the Fales are doing in
Mexico. It is believed that LITHUS is essential to the support
of this effort.
"
4. As an example of our interest in Nexico and LITMUS, it
is pointed out that a Satellite case officer from the EE Division
is currently preparing to depart for Maxies. It is also planned
that a Polish speaking contract agent, experienced in Polish
operations including monitoring audio efforts, will be sent to
Mexico in the near future to work on LITHUS and to assist this
case officer.

ABSTRACT
1. Project LIFEAT has been renewed for the period of 1. July 1962
through 30 June 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00.
2. Please note that this means a cut of $3,193.00 from the Station's
original request for $102,193.00 to $99,000.00. WHD was allocated $99,000.00
for this Project for FY 63.
3. This reduction was made by reducing "Miscellaneous Op Expenses" from
$4,000.00 to $807.00.
KUDESK
4. KUTURE and KUDESK Staffs concurred in recommending renewal.
reiterated that the facilities of this Project could and should be used for
the coverage of known or highly suspected agents of the Soviet/Satellite and
Cuban intelligence services in Mexico. KUDESK notes that some twenty of
these agents have been documented in detailed target studies which were
forwarded to the Station.

of the type of montiports now being sumitted relative to the diplomatic
activities of the Soet assy. These reports, based almost endrely on
LEAT, indicate some relationships the Soviets are developir with the
edcan overnment, oer Latin American coverine: ts, and with other
forcon diplomatic representatives. They also sica se light on the relations
between the Soviets, scio echs in i.cadco City; and even on the
relationships between the so.lets and Líc Yugoslavs. Reports of this type
show then tile Soviets sex to be engages in a drive to establish contacts
in various departments of the radican Government and when they appear to be
coductir a drive to cultivate Latin american plomats. The reactions of
toth the lexicans and the Latin Americans to these advances are often an own
in the corresponding traffic. The Soviets, in general, do not seem to get
a very good reception from the Latin Americans, but on the other hand, LIFFAT E
shows that they are well received by the diplomatic representatives of
India and Indonesia. The diplomatic reports have also shown an improvement
of relations with the Yugoslavs (which were non-existent for several years
here). The traffic and reports further show that the Soviets, roles and
Czechs have frequent interchange and other join in days of sport or other
entertainment.
c. Cultural and Propanda Activities
-
H1.-2329, HI. 2377 and 12-2460 are cited as examples of the monthly
summaries of Soviet cultural activities based on WAT materials. They
reflect in detail Soviet activities in connection with publication, cultural
institutes, travel of Nexicans to the USSR for cultural purposes, visits
of Soviet cultural figures to Naxico and data concerning how their local
arrangements are made. 2.2326 is cited as an example of a separate report
on the visit of some Soviet musicians to lexico.

with whom the Soviets are in contact each month, together with a description
of the nature of the contact then known.

The attached Field Project Cutline is submitted for approval for the
Fiscal Year 1958. In accordance with Held Instruction No. 236-1; 7(d),
(dated 23 October 1953), the following information is submitted.

Product of the basic project.
During the current fiscal year production from IFSAT has been
quite voluminious. The Soviet phase alone has accounted for sore 5,000 pages
of summary text and constitutes somewhat less than half the coverage yielded
by the total project. The following general categories of information have
been developed through LINAT and are citcu below with a few examples of
production (see references to specific reports and dispatches in the following
paragraphs).
2.
The Soviet Embassy
I
Information on the Soviet Embassy derived from LIFAT has been voluminous
and extensive reports have been furnished on the following matters:
8. Soviet Comercial Activities.
Reports such as #2198, 3 Hard. 1957; 10-2054, 6 November 1956;
and H.-1975, 19 October 1956 have conveyed a substantial amount of month-
to-month detail concerning Soviet econotic and corrercial policy and actions
in Nexico and to a lesser extent in adjacent arcas. This information reflects
the types of products the Soviets are selling or purchasing in the area',
the names of their intermediaries, details on prices, manier of arranging
deals, and manner of effecting shipments. This information was screened out
and briefed from extensive and prolonged coverage of Soviet Exbass: commercial
traffic and appears to be fully authentic as well as ich in detail. Refer-
ence is also made to -2476, 1 March 1957 (Tentative Deal for Ecuadorian
Coffee); HI-1973, 18 October 1956(Mexican ports to the (SSA); and HN-1760,
18 October 19-6(Sale of Soviet Ferrous Metal in the US) as examples of
specific spot reports based on information derived from the same source.
During the past year traffic concerning the Soviet commercial of Ice in Mexico
has increased a great deal and remains this Station's primary source on all
such matters.

institutions providing goods and services to the Soviet Umbassy. These
reports have been of particular interest in developing the LEVESA Project
and resulted in the maling of a contact in the cleaning business through
which this Station obtained entry for one of its agents into the Embassy.
(cf H.-A-6672).
h. Personality Reports on Soviet Officials
IEA-6651 is a sample o a series of personality reports on Soviet
officers prepared mainly from WHAT raterials, LEAT reflects varying
amounts of information on the Soviets. Some are frequently heard and much
data accumulated on their contacts, marital situations, official duties,
etc. These data have been used on occasion for studying possible defection
pitches and will probably be used more in the future. In the case of the
current Soviet Naval Attache, riori IIPODS, his habits were studied
mainly through LIFEAT and note was made that his wife might be vulnerable
because she was having anorous relations with one of her husband's subordinates.
(17X1 524; MEXI 495; MIXI 447).
1.
Movements of Soviet Officials
The arrivals and departures of Soviet officials have more often
been ascertained through LSAT than through any other source. The Station
has been able to advise of movements out of lexico rough LINA in almost
every case where such travel took place in the past five (5) years. Pre-
quently the Station has received notice of movement long before it took
place by studying contacts of the Soviets with local clothiers, etc. since
it has been the Soviet custa. to stock up on d'oking and various luxuries
prior to leaving Mexico. The arrivals of mary Sovits have been learned
of only through LIFEA?, ever. in a number of cases wen the Soviets travellid

11 March 1957)..
3. Czech Legation.
LIFEXT has provided considerable information on the Czech Legation
during the past year. The information thus octained is roughly parallel to
that obtained on the Soviet Embassy, and poriodic general aumaries have been
forwarded in 11-1505, -1632, HI-1693, IIM-1997, IDI.-1747, 21-2349 and
others.
Personnel data
Fersonnel data on staff members of the Czech Legation have been
forwarded in such reports as M-1896, H.-1959, -2330 and others. This
data has been of use not only in reflecting personality data, official functions
and domestic matters pertaining to Czech staff members but also in planning
defection approaches.
b. Spot Reports
From time to time pot reports on matters of especial interest in
connection with the Czech Legation have been forwarded, ason which referance
is made to the following entirely or partially based on LITEAT:

Counter-intelligence matters
i
Counter-intelligence matters constitute the major I portions of this
of this Station's melated Mission Directive and has contributed more
leads and general information on the Sovict aspect of this subject than all
other Station sources combined. The following reports are cited as examples
of many of this type of reports and information developed in this category:
a. 131:-1953, HMM-2266, describing contacts between Harciso LAS>OLS,
leading Nexican pro-Comunist, and Viktor GLOTOV, his Soviet case officer
who appears in LIET under the name of "LOPEZ."
b. 101-2218, H.-2262 and 10: -1336, dealing with the contacts between
the leading Venezuelan Conanist, Carlos Augusto 10 and his Soviet case
officer, Doris P. KOLOLYAKOV. A comparison of readings from LIFE/LIMERICK
with LISAL coverage on the Venezuelan Communist arty Officer „duardo
«MACEDO Morales indicates that on is probably the intermediary between
the Soviets and the Venezuelan exiles.
c. EX-2420, setting forth arrangements for clandestinc contact between
Colonel Jesus de LED Toral, of the Mexican General Staff College, with his
Soviet case officer.

7. Double Agent Checking
During the past year, as in previous years, a number of this Station's
double agents have been monitored through LIFEAT in contact with the Soviet
Embassy, thus enabling the Station to verify certain portions of their
reports and hence leading to a letter chance to evaluate the agents. Anong
those heard in the past year wore LIEEL H, LILALIR's son, WILEMONADE,
LEACE and LINSTOCK-1. In each case LINEAT tended to confirm the Station's
geod opinion of the agent. on the other hand, several recent contacts

may be "playing" with the Soviete or endeavoring to do so.

Intentions and Activities of the Nexican loverment
During the early part of 1957 LIFFAT enabled the Station to assess
reports it was receiving from another source co.cerning the changing and
hardening of the Mexican government's attitude towards foreign Communists.
LIFEAT coverage of various individual targets gave solid information on the
arrests of the foreign Communists Mario SUSA Navarro, Joaquin ORDOQUI,

the salities of tuned from Station agent 24 LAT also added
details which were not availcle to other Station sources, such as the

was learned that to Venezuolan Communist leader duardo CAD orales

of his arrest, which fact, among others, rakes AC appear to be one of
the most important forcin Communists in exico. Reference is made to the
following reports ich contain information of this general types:
6240
and 1-1-0212.
Ax
H1.-1769(p. 4) is cited as containing a seemingly reliable report to
the effect that in 1956 the Mexican president told the editor of one of
Mexico's leading newspapers that he should play down or omit anti-US articles
and opinions.
10.
Inforation on the lexican Communist Party and Communist ronts
During the past year considerable day to day detail was received from
LINEAT concerning the Herican Communist Party and its fronts. The latter
included the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (the intellectual author of which
was covered in LITENT) and the Mexican Peace Movement, Society of Friends
of China and various art fronts (through coverage of an officer of those
movements.) This information was of value in supplementing agent coverage
of those organisations and occasionally provided information unknown to
the agents. (0: 11-1657 and HMM-2285)
11. Ancrican Comunists in Mexico
One ofthe most extensive and productive coverages through LIFENT in the
1 past year was directed against American communists in Mexico. In this"
period several American targets were covered at the request of ODVY and
the production processed in part by them and in part by this Station. ODMVY
assumed the task of reporting most of the information on these subjects but
provided the station with carbon copies of their simaries of the pertinent
reels and of the reports based thereon. The subjects thus covered for
ODERIVY were as follows, with a listing of the mumber of reels passed on each:
a.
Noah SEBORER, possible American espionage agent for the Soviets
(23 reels)
b. Frederich Vanderbilt .IEW, Azerican Comminist, and his wife,
Anita Soyer FILL (254 reels)
C.
Asa 2413 Dolinski, American Communist agent (55 reels.)

13. Hiscellaneous Coverages
During the past year the following individual targets have be
covered for periods of time varying from one month to a full jar:
a. Aaron Jose PSZISA Margules; Jewish Communist leader. the coverage
reflected the decline of the Jerish Communist movement and the relative
inactivity of PSZZSA and was suspended.
b. Noah SEBOMER, American Communist, He and his wife work for a travel
agency and their traffic has reflected many details concerning the nove-
ments of Americans in and out of Nexico, many of then Communists.
c. Samuel TAGIDI: Tagilin, Jévish Communist leader. This coverage
confirmed the decline of the local Jewish Communist movement and the final
liquidation of its headquarters. It reflected the names of the New active
members who continue to meet infolally. It was of especial value in covering
the arrest of Chone SHETHAUK, member of the Jewish Communist group, and in
covering the deportation of Jacobo HURWITZ Zender, known Communist agent.

Communists in exico and to a lesser degree provided information on their
contacts with the Soviets and Mexican Communists.

f. Xavier GUERREMO. This coverage contained considerable detail on
the Communist party, Society of Friends of China, Peace Front and other
organizations of which GLERT was a member. It also contained details

15. Summary
In summary, LIFEAT constitutes one of lexico City Station's chief assets;
and it is the belief of; COS Mexico that this operation (which is wholly
BARA's and has no liaison of other service involved) is by far the best
operation of its kind RR has in the world.
a. Accomplishments
On a
jeneral average over the past year LIFEAT has consisted of
twenty-two (22) to twenty-three (23) simultaneous coverages, each of 24 hours
per day. The targets covered-have included-major coverage of all those
ich rank highest in the Station's FD(Soviets, Poles and Czechs) as well
as a large number of selected targets of opportunity. Approximately 15,000
pages of summary text have been obtained from the project. This information,
though fragmentary at times and at times difficult to understand, is
nevertheless documentary in nature. In detail, average coverage of the
targets at the Station has been as follows:
Soviets
Czeens
Foles
8 Lines
2 lines
2 lines
American Communists 3 lines

maring for the Future
Current planning calls for the continuation of about 24 lines of
coverage with bases and personnel teine assembled to permit an increase
to about 30 lines, local circumstances permitting. Lasic coverage will be
continued to the fullest extent possible on the Soviets, Poles and Czechs,
which coverage of

as to produce the greatest possible amounts of important information. At
present it is believed that 30 lines is about the taximum the technical agents

C.
Performance of Agents
While in general the performance of the LIFEAT agents has been good
in the past year, some of those connected with the group based on the family
of former head agent James O. AYCALL have not been acting in a satisfactory.
manner. These are gradually being weeded out and new, more effective and
fully compartmented base operators are being substituted for them. The
Station's problem in this connection is difficult since it is hard to
recruit persons who combine the following qualifications recessary for base

d. Status of pproved Commitments
LIFEAT Project(as approved in H.-W-3740) contains most of the
elements which will be necessary in Fiscal 1958. The main difference that
will be noted in the attached Field Project Outline is that costs will
be higher and one more base nouse will be added to the current list.

To mount various types of technical surveillance operations, mainly
telephonic, against the Soviet, Czech and olish diplomatic missions in
Mexico; against important contacts of those installations; and against leading
Mexican and non-Mexican Communists and Communist sympathizers.
3.
Background
This project was first approved 3 October 1950 and has been extended
each year thereafter. Actual operations began 18 January 1951 and have
been continuous, with small breaks for security or other operational reasons
from that date. The project was last approved in I-W-3740, 19 November 1956.
LINEAT has beer. run since its inception without liaison, and no plans
now exist to change this arrangement.
Over the past 6 years and 3 months LIFEAT has expanded from coverage
of one (1) line to average of an average of about twenty-four (24) lines,
each being covered 24 hours per day. In all, over 40,000 pages of docu-
mentary information on prime station targets has thus been obtained from
this operation.
4. Reference
--
HI-3740, 19 November 1956, contains the last renewal of this project.
a. This project has been one of the outstanding KUMAR operations in
the world. Certain elements at Headquarters recognize this. Chief, SR/CE
states to this station during his visit in January 1957 that this was the
only "LIFEAT-type" operation which was wholly HUSARM's and he said it was

PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I
=
1: Area of Operations
This operation is run from México City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City.
2. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily information on the
activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof,
as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and groups in response
to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently, LIFEAT stresses
flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and CI/CE coverage
receiving the greatest emphasis,
3. Background
Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1950 as a unilateral telephone tap
operation. Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18
January 1951, and the operation has run continuou..ly from that date. The pro-
Ject was opened with the installation of a single tap and has grown in the past
eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a given month.
The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any
llaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the mã
jority of personnel being Indigenous controlled agents.
During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 83,500
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of
Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materially to the in-
telligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite Bloc and more
recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFEAT has
been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communist
Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the exile groups and local
Communists.

official installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous
coverage of these two targets. These assets were then employed in direct
support of Station operations--a role ideally suited for a unilateral operation
such as LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of
Station operations. LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Year 1961 - 1962
programing to this new role and redirecting its assets, has now adjusted to
this role and is fully employed in this vital assignment.

tional techniques will be initiated which will necessitate round-the-

satisfactorily cover the targets. This vill undoubtedly necessitate
the sequisition of a more securely controlled base of operations. The
station does not believe such a base can be noquired other than by.
purchasing the property indianted. However, every effort will be made
to lease this property providing leasing arrangements can be made to

sponsible for the parallel LIENVOY operation,
e. Maintain LIFEAT capabilities for mounting operations against targets
of opportunity.
f. Maintain supervisior. over basehouses, equipment, and training of

8. Coordination
a. Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational sup-
port asset, is closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico City
Station. No operational coordination is required with any other geographical
area, but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may
be of interest to them.

c. Coordination with the parallel, but liaison project - LIENVOY, Is
closely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects,
particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operations,
thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered
by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation.
9. Personnel
:
;
a. Career and Contract Agents
(1) David M. WILSTED (201-009195), principal "outside" Case Officer.
(2) Wayne C. DRABAND (201-255095), outside assistant to David
M. WILSTED. DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-
tion in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B. RAFANELLI
who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961. His OA
was amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFeat
Project. Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of
clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's instruc-
tion and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity
for work, it appears he will prove a valuable addition to the
LIFEAT complex.

c. During the past project year the following personnel were dropped
from Project LIFEAT:
(1) Ralph B. RAFANELLI (201-176295), staff agent, was reassigned
PCS after completing his second tour in Mexico on 8 October
1961.
(2) Olivia N. GLADMON (201-117751), LIFEAT processor, has given
notice that due to her planned return to the United States for
necessary eye surgery during June 1962, her employment with
LIFEAT must be terminated. Agent quit-claim and secrecy
agreement have been executed.
(3) Leona C. GANDARA (201-225710), employed by LIFEAT only
for standby support during the past year and one half, now
is employed for support and clerical work for MKCHARITY.
(4) LIFEUD-20, (formerly LIMITATION-5), (201-102308), and
LIFEUD-21, formerly LIMITATION-6 (201-117981) will be ter-
minated as of the end of the present LIFEAT project year (30
June 1962). Plans for use of this couple as baschousekeepers
were cancelled when LIFEUD-22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more
desirable choices, became available for LIFEAT use. Ter-
mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,
and terminat lon arrangements were accomplished on a friendly
and mutually agreeable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminations,
separation is made on the basis of Mexican custom and/or law).
10. Operational Clearances
See Section 9 above.
11. Cover
There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously em-
ployed in the LIFEAT operation. With the new agents employed since the last
project renewal, cover is as follows:

cover employment and partakes in LIFEAT activities before
and after work and during lunch hours.
d. LIFEUD-23, the mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of
housekeeper for her son and performs her LIFEAT duties
only in their home.
12. Contact and Communications
}
Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed in
the project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings,
Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings,
When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, meetings are held at night, En-
trance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers is made only on the
basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repair, installation for
new line coverages, or line coverage cut off,
Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is kept to a min-
Imum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agents. Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged
and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.
These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints. Locations and
times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to decrease
the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residents of areas in which meet-
ings are held.

1:16. Equipment and Support
As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment is generally old
and much of it is now obsolete. With funds provided in last year's renewal,
LIFEAT (within the past month) has begun to acquire some new equipment,
particularly audio recorders. A review of the equipment situation in the
LIFEAT setup has convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer
that a near-complete-modernization program of the equipment used in
LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year. The local
KURIOT technician has on a number of ocassions expressed his amazement
at the superior product produced by LIFEAT with the outmoded and ancient
equipment (in terms of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on.
Therefore, with the funds requested in Part II of this renewal request,
LIFEAT should be completely equipped with adequate gear, particularly audio
and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of FY 1963, Admittedly, there is
Involved large, one-time expenses in complete replacement of such expensivé
items during a single project year. However, it is a necessary move, due
entirely to great wear borne by the equipment. This wear is now causing such
a rash of breakdowns that the outside principal agent must spend a dispropor-
tionate amount of his time in maintenance work,
17. Timetable
'
LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception In January
1951, and as a vital Station operational support asset, it is planned to continue
It Indefinitely.

1. The attached project, orisinating in WH Division, is
presented for renewal for the period 1 July 1962 through
30 June 1963.
The project supports a unilateral telephone tap
operation which provides daily infor ation on the activities of
official foreign installations in Rexico City and personnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected in-
dividuals and croups.
2. Authority is requcated to oflicate $99,000 from the
DD/P-WH Division budget in fiscal year 1963, outfect to the
availability of funda. Of this amount $1,80 is estimated for
administrative salaries; 843,411 for field agent salaries:
$20,928 for bagenouse rentals; $2,000 for oquipment: 72,100
for local transportation; and for miscellaneous operational
expenses.

3. The Field Project Outline and review which are forwarded
by the Division with a covering memorandum, give a clear deserip-
tion

has been in e^ntinuous operation since 19th, starting with a
In
single tap against the Soviet Relation in Mexico City and now
covering as many as thirty lines in a given month. The project

WILSTAD (p) or Project 11:04), our contract agents who do ad-
ministrative work, ond twenty-one field avents Including monitors
and Unesmen. Darin the post year the project provided coverage
of the home phones of three Soviet Intellivence offices, the
Polish Embers, the Yujo. lay nagay, major res death the
transhipment of U.C. good to bun, American Communists in Mexico,
and exile and revolutionary groupe in Mexiec. I Information
was obtained and additional security was provided Station opera-
tions. Although coverage of the official Soviet and Czech
installations peame a Jotat operation with the Mexican Government
in LIELVOY, Project LIFE Pein available to resume covera, e
of these installations should a chruge in the local government

18. Estimated Costs
"
s
The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1962. All figures are
U.S. dollars per year ($US 1.00 equals 12,50 Mexican pesos). Changes in
estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These reflect not only the
continued Inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also the shift in op-
erational emphasis from prime coverage of Soviet/Satellite activities to sup-
port of Station operations. In this latter case particular line coverage is of
shorter duration, causing greater expense in installation and removal of tap
lines and crosses. In the agent salary category total expense in contract
agent salaries has been reduced somewhat, due primarily to dropping certain
contract agents, while expenses for field agent category has risen, due to
the granting during past project year of long overdue salary raises to all but
three LIFEAT field agents.

13. Control and Motivation
Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and
financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the local
police should discovery occur.
14. Security
During the past project year there were no incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel Iminediately involved to isolate and remedy im-
mediately. In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone
work crews approaching a basehouse to check or remove the tap lines running
to that basehouse. Some of the "crosses" made in the telephone centrals
have been removed by the central's workinen, but these are of no danger to
the operation unless a full investigation is made of one of these unusual con-
nections. During the past project years no such Investigation has been under-
taken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT nemen has been revealed to date.
As for the past few years the telephone company is continuing its efforts toward
modernization of the Mexico City telephone system. This effort includes
changing from overhead lines to underground cables, cleaning off of the
unused overhead "dead lines" and installation of new equipment throughout
the city. These innovations will continue to cause security problems for the
LIFEAT complex, but it is believed that these problems are not insurmountable.
To meet this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day when
access to telephone distribution lines is further reduced by their placement
in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded in having one of its
Hnemen (LIFEUD-2) selected to artend a four month special course in cable
work. When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have
working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City.
This access will be invaluable from both the present security and operational
standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly
from the underground telephone cables. As a standard procedure the LIFEAT
personnel continuously work to devise new methods to increase security, as
well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security
enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.
15. Training
Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-
perienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer, David
M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as emergency
security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.

HHM-A-17199, 12 Juno 1961
The LIFEAT Project was renewed on 8 September 1961.
LIFEAT Project was approved for $98,973. Please note that this means
a out of $12,700 from the Station's original request for $111,673. The cut at
Headquarters was made for several reasons: 1) to fall within the approved

3. KUTUBER and KUDESK Staffs concurred in recommending renewal. KUTUBE/D
remarked that the project included coverage of highly selective KUTUBE/D interests
through technical means and stated that the project provided several items of
operational interest not otherwise obtainable, as well as operational loads and
background data useful in target assessment. KUDESK Staff reiterated that coverage
should continue to be given to carefully selected known or suspect Soviet/Satellite
agents in support of the Station's intensified KUDESK type program.

SUBJECT: Request for Approval of Project LIFEẠT
1.
It is requested that the LIFEAT Project be renewed for the
period 1 July 1961 through 30 June 1962 for a total of $98,974. This
project has been programmed for $99,000 and funds are available in Wi
Division for FY 1962. During the last fiscal year approximately
$81,000 was obligated.
2.
No training programs for any LIFRAT personnel are anticipated
for the renewal period,
3. Any number of emergency conditions could be listed which
might affect the smooth running of this operation. Among them would
be the break in diplomatic relations or hot war between Mexico and the
United States or the discovery of this unilateral asset by the Mexican
Government, Emergency recontact instructions have not been established
for the agents of this project since it seems likely that the operation
would cease in case of such conditions and the agents would be of no
further value.

4. This project was the source of 128 intelligence reports during
the past year, 85 of which were disseminated. The remainder were used
for Headquarters background only since the information was either
partially previously reported, overt, or of no interest to customer
agencies. The following evaluations were received:
.

PROJECT LIFFAT
PROJECT REVIEW
Product of the Project
A. Soviet Embassy
B.
LIFFAT technical surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and Commercial
Office telephone lines was discontinued on 22 June 1960 for security
reasons, The withdrawal of LINT from coverage of this target hinged
on the 20 June 1960 suggestion by LITENSOR to Chief of Station, Mexico
City, that the liaison tap operation LIENVOY undertake operations
against the Soviet/Satellite targets located in Mexico City. In order
not to reveal to LITENSOR that a unilateral tap operation was already
providing coverage of these targets, it was necessary for the Chief of
Station to agree to LIENVOY extending its coverage to include Soviet/"
Satellite operations. LIFEAT Immediately severed its coverage of both
Soviet and Polish phones so as not to Jeoparitze the continuing
unilateral LIMEAT operation and the personnel involved therein. No
security breach resulted from the switch from LIFFAT to LIENVOY coverage
due largely to the thoroughness and speed of the LIHAT personnel.
LIFEAT security and compartmentation was not harmed to any degree what-.
ever. (Note: LIFEAT again resumed coverage of the Polish Legation--
now Embassy--when it developed that LIENVOY did not have the ready
capacity to provide "take" from both the Crestoniovarian and Polish
official installations.)
Polish Embassy
During the past project year, LIFAT remained the primary source of
information on this target and the only successtul, continuing penetra-
tion of the target, technical or otherwise. The interested Case Officer
has described the LINEAT contribution as "unique" and "invaluable".
Examples of the positive intelligence product of the LIMEAT/Polish
coverage are:
HMA-15431, 3 August 1960 (Aleksander SFAIER)
HMM-5133, 22 August 1960 (Promotion of Polish Minister in Mexico

C. Cuban Embassy
The emphasis of the LIFEAT operation during the past year has been
placed on coverage of Cuban official, Intelligence and propaganda
activities. Direct support of Station operations in the JNZIP area
has rendered immensurable assistance to the responsible Case Officers.
On various occasions LIFFAT support has Involved extended periods of
live-monitoring target telephones, thereby providing excellent security
for Station assets taking part in sensitive operations. LIFFAT/Cuban
coverage has also enabled the Station officers to check the veracity
and activities of various penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy, again
providing increased operational security and increased exploitation of
these agent assets. Although LIFEAT has been employed primarily as
an operational support asset in the Cuban area, the following are examples
of the valuable and abundant positive intelligence production furnished
by LIFFAT:
HMM-5044, 9 July 1960 (011 From Mexico For Cuba)

the request of ODENVY, and the production has been partially processed

Mexico City area. - It has been determined through LIFEAT leads that
this cafe is headquarters for a suspected Polish technical operation
directed against an official U.S. Installation in Mexico City. LIFEAT
also provided support for a Station mounted audio operation against the
Polish Embassy in Nexico City. Through LIFEAT leads proper support for
the operation was arranged.
Coverage of a CI/CE nature was exploited in covering travel of important
Communists, particularly to Cuba, and the travel of U.S. citizens,
especially Communists and leftists, to Cupa. Travel plans of American
Communists were provided to CDIY well in navance of the actual travel.
Activities of local Communists and their pastelation in demonstrations
and CASTRO-support projects was shown through LIFFAT information.
H. Conclusion
It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE Information, and in particular the
auflity of the unilateral LIMAT operation to cover sensitive targets
without revealing Station Interest to Huison forces, well justify the
expenditure of funds, time, personnel, and security risk. It is to
be noted that even though the Station is involved in the parallel LIENVOY
liaison operation, a change in the attitude of the local government or
the change in local government administration could well and KUPARK
participation in that Maison project, For that reason WHEAT must be
available to resume the coverage of the Soviet/Satellite targets which
It previously provided. I in recone by the Station that the LIFRAT
complex, if allowed to disintegrate, could not be readily reorganized
if need for its services in the Sovies, Satellite field was required at
a Duture date. Theretore, LIFA's present orientation, though. toward
tart of a CIA eure Patter than bare providing positive
intelligence, leaves it av. file for rent to the field
of Soviet/Satellite operations, Of necesalt, LIFIAT operations in
certain areas have been curtalled to some extent and total coverage
reduced during the trial period when guide lines were being formed in
relation to operating with a parallel but Hatson operation (1.c.,
LINGVOY). However, it is the Station's o, Inion that even with the
temporarily reduced coverage provided by LIMA, this project still
provides a substantial and essential contribution in fulfilling the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

280 recis of raw "take" were passed to local DNY for their processing.
The most valuable information gleaned from coverage of the targets in
this field continues to deal with contacus, travel, and activities of the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGH). The following is a sample
of the reporting based on the LIFEAT coverage provided in this area
during the past project year:

E. Exile and Revolutionary Activities
P.
LIFEAT continues to provide data on the exile and revolutionary [roups
active in Mexico. The bulk of the LIFEAT effort in this field was
directed toward the coverage of the Nicaraguan exiles, and the results
were most rewarding in this area. Exam, les of productivity:

Counter-Intelligence Information
Mexico City Station's major responsibilities continued to lie in the
field of CI/CR matters during the past year, and LIFEAT was able to
provide a substantial contribution toward the attainment of the Station's
objectives in this field. In particular, coverage of the following known

G. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Station Operations
During the past project year, LIFFAT continued to support Mexico City
Station through the timely production of useful leads, notably in the
field of Cuban operations, and provision of continuing support to other
Station operations. The following is a selective list of the use made
of leads provided by LIFFAT:
LIMAT/Cuban: In this phase of the LIFEAT operation the most important
operational function has been the use of LIFEAT leads in checking the
veracity and activities of the KUBARK agents in the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico. LIFEAT live-monitoring was employed in the case of Guillermo
HERNANDEZ Vera to determine the queners of this suspected Cuban penetra-
tion of the ANTRON program in contacting Cuban officials or pro-Cuban
Mexican officials while he was held in custody by Nexican authorities
and Station asses. In another care LINEAT provide leads which enabled
Station assets to montior a clandestine meella between a member of the
Cusan Emuassy staff and one Manuel ROJAS Villa (akt. James Bradford
STEWART), a fugitive from ODYOKE and a potential CASTRO agent, and
ultimately return ROJAS to ODYOKE Jurisdiction. LIFAT was also able to
determine the whereabouts of another suspected CASTRO agent, Oscar
RODRIGUEZ Moruna. LIFEAT leads and support provided increased security
for Station assets involved during the defection of Jose PARDO Llada,
CASTRO "propaganda" minister, and provided leads for KUCAGE play on the
reaction to the defection within the Cuben Erbassy in Mexico.
LIFEAT/Polich: LIFEAT provided vital support in the BHCGR: recruitment
attempt which increased the security of the operation and pave a quick
and secure means of evaluating the chances of success of the operation.
In this effort, LIFFAT support included long periods of live-monitoring
three separate telephone lines. LISHAT leads also pointed out a local
cafe which is a front for much Polish intelligence activity in, the

III. Planning for the Future
V.
Following the suggestion provided by Headquarters in renewing Project LIFEAT
for FY 1961 (FY and project year coincide), the Station is expenting every
effort to maintain LIGNAT as a recure, compartmented, millateral operations:
even though on the presently reduced scale, so as to have readily available
for service this flexible support asset with its proves capacity for coverage
of almost any target in Mexico City. Also in line with Headquarters
suggestion LIFEAT will attempt to increase its coverage of those individuals
suspected of maintaining clandestine contact with the
RIS.
In the future, the unilateral LISTAT operation, with the removal from Its
responsibility the coverage of the Soviet and Czech Lines, will tend to be
more flexible, with greater percentage of its capacity available for chiftë
ing to new targets as they are presented, and able to atas minifly to
non situations, It is noted that this may result in a lower leg of
positive intelligence production, but will increase the CI/CH profiction
which has always been lasic to the LIFEAT product.
Performance of Apents
The overall performance of all agents employed in the LINAT complex
continued to be good during the period of the project review, with security
being stressed in all phases of the operation. Ho security problems were
encountered which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the
success of the LIMAT operation depends larvely upon the security of its
personnel, Headquarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will
continue to be sought on thore non additions who pass a strict ficla
nasessment.
Expenditures
Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted to Augurt 1000 for the
BY 1961 in the amount of 508,201.00. The propose budget for FY 1962 is
kroken down in the attached Field Project Outline, Part II, and totals
$98,973.00..

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I
:
12 June 1961
1. Area of Operations
This operation is run from the Mexico City Station and is concerned with
targets located in Mexico City.
i
2.
Purpose
4.
1
The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily Information
on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the
personel thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected
individuals and groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters
requests. Presently, coverage of the official Cuban and Polish installa-
tions have top priority in the LIFEAT operation.
Background
· Project LIFEAT-was-originally approved on-3-October 1950 as a unilateral
telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations under this
authority occurred on 18 January 1951, and the operation has run continu-
ously from that date. The project was opened with the installation of
ona tap and has grown in the past ten years to continuous coverage of
from 12 to 20 lines.
The LIFEAT project is a unilateral operation completely Independent from
any liaison arrangement, It in staffert by KUPARK staff and contract
employees with the greater majority of personnel bein, Inil, enous con-
trolled agents.
During the past ten years, Project LIFFAT has produced more than 76,000
pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support or
the Mexico City Station's specific objectives. and has contributed materially
to the Intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and
Satellite Bloc and more recently with the activities of the Cuban repre-
sentatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFEAT has been of considerable value
in monitoring the activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico
(ACGH), as well as the activities of exile groups and local Communists,

between Case Officers of both projects, particularly relating to
the division of coverage between the two operations, to assure that
the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered by the
indigenous personnel of the LIEW/OY operation; and, (2) the daily
processing of LIENVOY/Soviet "icke" by the LIFEAT processor and
basehousekeeper Carol K. ZEISHEISTER. The Station believes this
latter point does not "cross" operations unnecessarily since
ZINSMEISTER's long and discrete cervice within the LIFEAT complex
gives her both the sense of security and the background necessary
for secure processing of the Soviet "take". (Note: The processed
Soviet material is not returned to the liaison forces after receipt
from ZINCHEISTER, but is returned to the Station where it is mummarized
Station personnel and then passed to liaison as having come from
KUBARK Headquarters.) ZINSEISTAR is equally valuable, and indeed
essential, in her LIFEAT casehousekeeper assignement because of her
experience in dealing with the security problems arising from con-
ducting a technical basehouse, as well as her ideal natural cover as
wife of one of Mexico's foremost medical doctors.

13. Control and Motivation
Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:
ideology
and financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal from the
local police should discovery occur.
14. Security
"
During the past project year there were no incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel immediately involved to isolate and remedy
immediately. One basehouse was closed for "cooling off" after a telephone
company work party care to the basehouse to check the lines running to it.
This party was stalled long enough to cut back the "tap" lines at the
roof level and the house cleared of all compromising equipment and material.
Later the work party entered and checked the lines which proved to be
"dead" lines. The extra lines were then removed and the work party left
Was
the premises and there to further trouble. (Note: In Mexico City there is
much "dead line" running throughout the city which causes no end of
difficulty for the telephone company in installation and repair work.
Therefore, the phone company assigns work parties to various areas to
clean up the extra unused "dead lines" in order to bring a degree
organization to the telephone syster. This work is now being pursued
vigorously and is approaching completion In large areas of the city.)
The paschouse involved in the above incident has now been moved to a
different location and is back in operation.
of
At the present time the telephone company is naking; a general effort to
modernize the Mexico City telephone system. This effort includes changing
from overhead lines to underground cables, cleaning off the unused overhead
"dead lines", and installation of new equipment throughout the city. These
innovations will cause increasing security problems for the LIFEAT complex,
but is believed that the probles are not Insurmountable. Part of the
solution will of necessity involve the use of a greater number of base-
houses to diversify the coverage and to reduce the number of lines running
to any one basehouse. This will cause an increase in expense for the project,
but is considered desirable and necessary. It may eventually be necessary
for LIBEAT to enter the underground cables in order to provide access to
selected targets and maintain the security of the basehouses. The LIFEAT
personnel are continually working to device new methods as well as main-
taining training in security so as to continue the nigh level of security
enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.
15. Oraining
Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for
experienced agents is hailed primarily by the "outside" Case Officer,
David H. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with
the agents.

(2) Woodrow D. GABBOTT (201-14465) is now employed exclusively as an
outside contact for the Station's Satellite Case Officer and should
no longer be considered as a member of the LIFEAT complex.
.
(3) Wallace L. KAWOHL (201-033959) was terminated as an active agent in
June 1960 at his own request and with the concurrance of the Station.
Agent quit-claim and secrecy agreement were obtained. No security
problems are considered likely to occur since YAWOHL's parents
continue to be employed at basehousekeepers for LIFEAT and are depen-
dent upon continued LIFEAT salary for their livelihood. At the time
of the termination, it was realized that he would continue to enter
the basehouse which his parents controlled, and therefore his clearance
was amended to reflect this situation. (Reference: HTA-15046).

12.
There are no changes in the cover of the personnel presently employed in
Project LIFEAT from that noted in previous project renewals.
Contact and Communications
Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officers and the agents employed
In the project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner wilu, varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings.
Fre-arranged signals are employed in resting accomplishing the meetings.
When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, peetings are held at night. All
movement in and out of the basehouses by Case Officers is done in cars
ostensibly owned by the agents residing in those barehouses. Entrance to the
basehouses on foot by other than the baschousekeepers is made only in emergency
cituations.
Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents is kept to a
minimum. Pre-arranged
Pre-arranged open code is used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agents.
Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged and are reviewed
frequently by the personnel using them.
These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project and
function adequately from the scourity and utility standpoints. Locations and
times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed irequently to decrease
the possibility of arousing the cuspicions of the residents of areas in which
meetings are held.

As has been mentioned, in last year's renewal request, much of the LIFEAT
equipment, upon whose reliability the success of the information collection
is based, will require replacement in the near future. The great percentage
of the equipinent has been in long and continuous service, while mich of
the special equipment is no longer being manufactured. When present
diminishing commercial stocks of replacement parts are exhausted, new
units will be required for LIFEAT with the attendant large, one-time
purchase expense.

1. PI/INT files contain 37 positive information
disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT
during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned
principally with contacts between Maxican Communists or leftists
and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Bloc, and with the travel
of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barmeja,
now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Micaraguan and Spanish
exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.
2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.
It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production
of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function
as a support and CI/CE operation.

PROJECT LIFEAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART II
The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1962. All
figures are U.S. dollars per year ($1.00 U.S. equals 12.50 Mexican
pesos). Some increases in particular items will be noted. These
reflect the increased cost of living and especially the continuing
rise in rental costs in the Mexico City area, plus the necessity of
moving basehouses for security reasons discussed in Part I of this
Project Outline.

40 The station does not intend to cut down on independent LIFEAT
operations since there are plenty of targets to keep both LIENVOY and MI»
LI¬
FEAT occupied.
5. The LIFEAT Project was the source of 99 positie intelligencə
reporte, 72 of which were disseminated. Those not disse:dinated were con-
sidered by Headquarters to be of value for operational backgränd or were
outdated. KR made the following evaluations of LIFEAT reports:
#xsxica: Interest in Procurement of Kaphthalene from Czschoalo-
vakia,” of value, probably true, and of importance to receive further re-
porta.
"Soviet Commercial Activities," of value, probably trus, and of
importance to receive further reports.
"Soviet Plans to all kæmprint to Mexican Government Agancy,”
of little importance.
"Soviet Negotiations for Mexican Cotton," of average valus,
neeful as new information.
The Tepartment of State nade the following evaluations of LIFEAT reports:
*Mexloan fforts to Sell Sugar to the UR," of value, possibly
true, and of importance to receive further reports,

The Station used LIFEAT information in the preparation of mono-
randa directed to the “abassy and Fal representatives in Maxico in reply to
local requests for information. Puring the period July 1959 through Hay
1550, 154 memoranda were furnished the Embassy and 69 memoranda ware far-
nished the FHI based on LIPUT information.
7. WH Division feels that the positive and CK information received
from LIFEAT is invaluable. Most of the information is not available from
other Station assets. keports on travel and the identification of target
personalities often serve to confirm information previously received. LI-
VSAT assets also have been used effectibaly to check on recently-terīdinated
agents to ascertain that Us termination was sccuro. LIFMT also has been
used to check on reports by double agents that they have contacted or been
contacted by their respective borist or fatellite contacts.
B. Information received from LITE is passed to kill, and any oper
ations undertaken on the basis of such infurmation are classly coordinated
with that Branch.

Subsequent to the preparation by the Station of the attached
Project review and renewal request for LIFNT, the following situstion
developed in Mexico which has directly affected the entire LIPSAT Project. :
At a meeting with the Chief of station on 25 June 1960, LITENSOR asked the
Station and LIELEGINT to iTdistaly begin covering the Soviet, Polish and
Czech Pæbassy undar LINYOY. LITSH suggested that the Rexicans
late the Spanish and that the station forward the tapes to hashingtee for
translation of the lussian, folish and Czech portion. The Chief of station
had no alternative but to express great interest in the coverage of taryota
of such importanos. In order to protect the security of the LIPKAT opere-
tions, the Station stopped the LIMRICK and LITHE (LIVERY had not been in
operation for the past six months for security reasons) coverage on 12 June,
prior to the WEINOT activation. It was determined that LIBINCY would covar
5 Soviet and 2 Czech lines. The takm continue to be processed by [I]E:FIS-
TER and LIERIFE. The WIERTOY scnitors extract from the Spanish only the
most important points for the daily reswans which are ressed to LITEF R
LIELTMT has been told us will inform him of pertinent information ob-
tained (ostensibly from liaadquartern processing) of the Soviet and Crech
text for passing to LITER. LIPEAT will contimus ita unilateral coverage
of Polish and other targets of interest.
3. The Station does not anticipate any problsa connected with the
exploitation of leads since LIFT has evinced no interest in this nat-
ter. In view of the lack of language capabilities by the Mexicans and car
ahility to control what is passed (ostensibly from “sadquarters), the Sta-
tion sees no problems arising from the present arrangement.

The LIFEAT Project was approved on 26 August 1960 for a total of
$98,901. Headquarters reduced the original request from the field to bring
the total Project budget more in line in th the programmed figure of $90,000
and the actual obligations of the previous year, which were only $73,884.
The following changes were made on the field's request:

2. Staff comments on the Project renewal request ware:
9,000.00
a) KUTURE/OPS said that the Station is to be commended on its hand-
ling of the requested Bloc coverage by LIENVOY while maintaining LIFEAT
capability and limiting coverage to those lines most profitable. KUTURE
noted the increased emphasis on exploitation of operational information.
In order to continus this aspect of the operation, the Station is faced
with the difficult problem of selectivity in targeting and processing
take from these two large projects. Every possible effort should be made
to increase the efficiency of processing to maintain LIFEAT at its present
high level. In KUTURE/OPS's opinion, LIFEAT personnel and capability must
be carefully maintained in face of the easier but less secure LIENVOT.
:
}
b) KUDESK atated that this unilateral asset should be continued de
spite the fact that we are running a similar operation with the local gov-
ernment. It is hoped that the Station will soon be able to use this asset
in the investigation of individuals known to be in clandestine contact
with the RIS, for the purpose of determining whether or not they may be
recruited.
c) KUTURE/D notes that the project has been of high value.

Chorus to Mexico from Canada.
HMMA-14677, 16 March 1960, Soviet Cultural Activities.
4) Background Information on, and Movement of, Soviet Officials:
Through LIFEAT information, the Station has been able to maintain
a current roster of the Soviet Embassy personnel assigned to Mexico.
LIFEAT has been further utilized to give information on job assignments
within the Soviet Embassy, and to determine in advance departures, arrivals,
and replacements of Embassy personnel. Large quantities of background
personality information concerning the official and private lives of members
of the Soviet staff were also provided.

5) Goods and Services:
Diplomats.
Throughout the past year, LIFEAT information has been of use to
Project LIMESA. Of particular note have been leads concerning varlous
properties in which the Soviets were interested.
6) Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:
LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which
deals with the Soviets and their association and related activities has been
reported as necessary.
B. Czech Legation*
Information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under
review was essentially the same as that obtained from the Soviet Embassy.
Although this target was covered only from July 1959 to January 1960 (due
to the security problem posed by extensive telephone company cable
renovation work in the vicinity of the basehouse serving the target), valuable
intelligence was gained during the period of actual coverage. Examples

PROJECT REVIEW PROJECT LIFEAT
L
Product of the Project
A. Soviet Embassy
1) Soviet Commercial Activities:
"
During the past project year, the LIMERICK phase of Project
LIFEAT has provided detailed and continuing reports on the increased
Soviet efforts to participate in Mexican commercial markets. The
following is a partial but representative list of the reports submitted
on this subject.
HMM-4322, 12 June 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in Mexico.
HMM-4567, 6 November 1959, Soviet Commercial Activities in
Mexico.
HMM-4355, 1 April 1960, Soviet Purchase of Mexican Cotton,

HMM-4858, 6 April 1960, Soviet Plan to Sell Newsprint to Mexican
Government Agency,
2) Soviet Diplomatic Activities:
Project LIFEAT provided coverage of many of the Soviet
Diplomatic activities in Mexico. It was able to show the relation-
ships maintained between the Soviet and Satellite missions in Mexico,
as well as the increased official contact between the Cuban and Soviet
governments,
MEXI-4304, 21 August 1959, Meeting os Soviet and Cuban Ambassadors
to Mexico.

H. Counter-Intelligence Information
CI/CE matters continued to constitute a major portion of the
Mexico City Station's priority objectives during the review period,
Project LIFEAT was able to provide a substantial contribution to the
attainment of these objectives. Of particular note in this respect has ·
been coverage provided on known Communist Party members,
especially valuable being that provided on Juan Luis CAMPOS Villalobos.
1. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Station Operations
During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT. continued
to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads
which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring
the success of other Station operations. The following is a list,
necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of
other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT.
*LIFEAT/LIMERICK: 1) Of special note is the support pro-
vided to the Station's AEIMPULSE operation. Leads and
information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible
Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt
of an officer of the Soviet Embassy. Following the actual
attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device
to protect the Station assets employed in the operation. 2) As
noted in IA. (5) above, Project LIMESA was provided with
continuing support by Project LIFEAT. Notable among the
Information and leads provided were those concerning specific
properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or
buying. 3) LIFEAT has provided a check on double-agent
LITARDY-1; giving verification of his activities and contacts.
A similar check has also been provided on the activities of
informant LIPAGAN-1.
LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely
supported the projected LITACIT physical penetration operation
aimed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City. LIFEAT
provided essential information on the rosters of night duty
officers as well as background information on the target.
2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the installation of
technical surveillance against LITACH. Without the information
provided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremely
hazardous at best, and probably would have been entirely
impossible.

E. Cuban Embassy
LIFEAT has provided timely information on the activities and
personalities of the Cuban Embassy. Of particular interest has been
the indications provided by LIFEAT of closer relations and increasing
contact between the Cuban and Soviet officials in Mexico. LIFEAT was
also able to provide a firm indication of the Soviet-Cuban announcement
of resumption of diplomatic relations two weeks in advance of the actual
event. Examples of LIFEAT Cuban coverage are:
HMM-4489, 24 September 1959, Recall of Cuban Military Attaches
in Mexico.
HMM-4649, 4 December 1959, Pro-Cuba Publication in Mexico.
HMM-4907, 27 April 1960, Projected Joint Announcement by Cuban
and Soviet Governments.
HMM-4919, 29 April 1960, Travel to Cuba of Soviet Ambassador
in Mexico.
F. Exile and Revolutionary Activities
i
.
LIFEAT continued to provide information on the exile and
revolutionary groups active in Mexico. Coverage of the Nicaraguan
Communist exiles was particularly rewarding for the operational
information provided.
HMM-4317, 12 June 1959, Letter from a Guatemalan Communist
Concerning the Seventh World Festival
of Youth.
MEXI-4271, 13 August 1959, Travel of Nicaraguan Communists.
HMM-4450, 4 September 1959, Nicaraguan Revolutionaries' Efforts
to Meet a Former President of Mexico.
MEXI-4488, October 1959, Travel of Dra. Concepcion PALACIOS
Herrera, Nicaraguan Communist.
HMM-4967, 25 May 1960, Activities of Rafael RAMIREZ Delgado.
G. LAURICLE Information
During the period of the project review, LIFEAT, as in the past,
continued to contribute materially to several matters of LAURICLE
interest.

Approximately 370 reels were passed to ODENVY for their processing
during the period June 1959 - April 1960. The most valuable type of
information obtained on these targets deals with travel, contacts, and
activities of the American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM). The
following is a sample of the reports furnished through coverage of this
target group.

LIFEAT/LITMUS: 1) LIFEAT provided information which
lead to the successful recruitment of agent BEYAN who was
in a position to provide information on BESOOT. 2) LITMUS
leads also lead to the attempted, but unsuccessful, recruit-
ment of one Una WARREN, believed to have been a contact of
Polish officials in Mexico. 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the
surveillance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER,
Polish Counselor of Legation in Mexico. Due to the advance
notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was
given time to plan technical coverage of the meeting and
prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage.
4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the
location of a Polish Intelligence basehouse. This information
was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer.
LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project
leads have been most rewarding in terms of agents actually
recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided
information. (1) LIERODE produced leads which were
directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANGO-1
and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information
which have increased the value of agent LITANGO. 2) The
defections of LITAINT-1 and LITAG-1 were greatly aided by
LIFEAT leads and information. The internal reaction to
the defections in the target establishment were also readily
available through LIFEAT. 3) At present LIERODE is
providing coverage, both from à security and informational
standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as
Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intelli-
gence. This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT
leads and support for security coverage of the agent's
activities. 4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually
successful in providing information which has enabled the
Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating in
Mexico. Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,
these revelations are of utmost importance.
Coverage of a CI/CE nature was provided by LIFEAT targeted
against a recruited member of the Mexican Communist Party,
and has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of party
members behind the Iron Curtain, as well as providing a check
on the veracity of the agent.
Project LIFEAT has been employed also in support of the mes
highly sensitive LIEMIT operation.

PROJECT OUTLINE
PART I
,
This project is run from the Mexico City Station, and is concerned
with targets located in Mexico City.
2.
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine Soviet and Satellite plans,
activities and connections with other Communist elements through the use of
technical surveillance. This purpose is in consonance with the Related Mission
Directive for Mexico, dated 20 November 1959, Priority A, Objective one;
3.
Background
Project LIFEAT was originally approved on 3 October 1950 as a
unilateral telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations was on
18 January 1951, and the project has rua continuously from that date. The project
was begun with the installation of one telephone tap, and has been expanded to the
present average coverage of 18 lines.
Project LIFEAT is a unilateral operation completely. Independen: from
any liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract employees
with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents.
During the past nine years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than
64,000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the
Mexico City Station's objectives specifically, and has contributed materially to the
Intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and Satellite Bloc. In
addition, Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in
monitoring the activities of the American Communist community residing in Mexico
City as well as activities of Cubans and exiles in Mexico.

J. Conclusion
It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
to other Station operations, the CE information obtained, and the positive
intelligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of
KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time and security risk.
The information produced by this operation has materially contributed to
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.
K. There is attached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from
LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960.
(See attached sheet.)
Progress of the Operation
Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are of
a continuing nature and not designed to be fulfilled within a given period,
no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each
objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the
coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately
15,000 pages of raw text were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 period.
LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the
number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be
broken down as follows:
Soviet Embassy
5 lines
Polish Legation and Polish
Counselor
3 lines
Czech Legation (Embassy)
2 lines
(Coverage suspended
January '60 for reason
given in I. B above)
American Communists
Cuban Embassy
Targets of Opportunity
III.
Planning for the Future
2 lines
3 lines
3 lines
Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when
renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1960, the Station plans to limit its
coverage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible
exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods
SIGNET/KAPC

SECRET/KAPGY
in addition to the normal coverage. The coverage of Soviet and Satellite
installations will remain basic to LIFEAT and will be exploited to the
-
maximum degree possible. Due to the increased importance of information
on Cuban activities, coverage of the Cuban Embassy and personnel staffing
the Embassy will be increased during the coming project year. Targets of
Opportunity will continue to be exploited as permitted by personnel,
equipment, and accèss-limitations.
☐
Performance of Agents
The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT
continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the
operation. No security problems were encountered which were not readily
solved by the personnel concerned. Since a high degree of security is
required for the operation of LIFEAT, it is planned that any possible
agent candidates will be thoroughly screened and Headquarters clearance
obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use.
Expenditures During the Period Under Review
Approval for the renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted on 16 July
1959, for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960, in the amount of
$123,830. In its continuing attempt to provide practical economy without
decreasing operational efficiency, Station Mexico submits the itemized
proposed LIFEAT budget for FY 1961 (contained in the attached Field-
Project Outline, Part II) in the amount of $114, 411, a reduction of approx-
- imately $19,000 from the previous year's approved budget.
Status of Commitments
There are no commitments other than those provided for in the
project outline submitted herewith and the individual contracts of several
LIFEAT personnel.

Due to the continued rise in the cost of living, plus the fact
that the majority of the above listed field agents have not
received a pay raise in recent years even though the work
load increased and the quality of work performed has imporved,
It is anticipated that the 10% over-all pay raise provided for,
but not given, in FY 1960 will be necessary in FY 1961:
3,200.00
Christmas bonus (In accordance with local custom, this
amounts to one month's pay for each agent) and gifts

Cover
12.
The cover of personnel employed in Project LIFEAT remains the
same as noted in the last project renewal.
Contact and Communications
1
a. Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officers and the
agents in this project. These contacts are made in a clandestine manner
with varing patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and
emergency meetings. Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and
accomplishing the meetings. When heavy or bulky material is to be passed,
meetings are held at night. All movement in and out of the basehouses by
the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by
agents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are too
old to drive. One of the indigenous agents is used to contact LIVERY base.
Entrance to basehouses on foot by other than the residents of the house is

made only in great emergencies.
b. Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents
is kept to a minimum. Pre-arranged open code is used for phone
conversations between Case Officers and agents.
c. Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged and are
revieweḍ frequently by the personnel using them.
d. These systems of contact and communication appear suitable
for the project and function adequately from a security viewpoint.
Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are
changed frequently to decrease the possibility of discovery.
Control and Motivation
Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:
Ideology and financial gain. A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal
from the local police should discovery occur.
Training
Initial training of new personnel and refresher training for
experienced agents is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David
M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintainance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed
with the agents.
Equipment and Support
It is believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the
continued successful collection of LIFEAT material depends will require
replacement in the near future. The largest percentage of this equipment
has been in nearly continuous operation from the initiation of the project
in January 1951 and much of this equipment is no longer being manufactured,
When present limited commercial stocks of replacement parts are
exhausted, new units will be required for LIFEAT.
Timetable
LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its inception
in January 1951 and it is planned to continue it indefinitely.

PROJECT: LIFEAT
17. Estimated Costs
The following are the estimated costs for FY 1961. All figures
are U.S. dollars per year. ($1.00 dollar U.S. equals 12.50 Mexican
pesos) Due to the continued rise in the cost of living, and especially to
the expected increase in rental costs that is a chronic feature of the
Mexico City scene, a moderate increase in some LIFEAT costs will be
noted, even though the overall total requested is $19, 419 under that-
approved for FY 1960.

LIFEAT Project Renewal Request
1. It is requested that the attached LIFEAT Renewal Request
be approved for the period of 1 July 1962 through 30 June 1963 in
the amount of $99,000.00, all of which falls within FY 1963.
$99,000.00 was programmed for FY 1963 in the WHD allocation,
2. This Project provides the Mexico City Station with a
unilateral telephone tap operation which has been in existence
for the past 11 years.
3. While the primary object of this Project is not the pro-
duction of positive intelligence, it was in whole or in part the
source of 30 positive information disseminations. In addition˝to"
this production and support of other Station operations, it
provides ODENVY with information concerning the American Commu-
nist Group in Mexico.
Emergency recontact instructions have not been estab-
lished for the agents of this Project since it is believed the
operation would cease in case a situation should arise where they
would be applicable.
•
5. No training programs for any LIFEAT personnel are
anticipated during the renewal period,
b.
WH Division recommends renewal of the LIFEAT Project
based on the attached field request. WH Division has cut the
field request from $102,193.00 to $99,000.00.

1. The LIFEAT Project renewal submitted in A-12936 was approved on
16 July 1959 for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of
$123,830 for fiscal year 1950. The Station will note that monies requested
for the support of Woodrow D. GABBOTT (ps) were subtracted from the request
made by the Station for project funds. GAB OTT is supported by the BESHOOTH
Project, an ☑E support project.
2.
-
The following staff comments were made when the Project was submitted
for approval:
a.
"ROM has continued its rating of "C" on the disseminated positive.
information from the Froject, noting a slight increase in the disseminations,
and commenting that it provides interesting information to customers on the
nature and extent of Bloc commercial activities in Mexico, data useful in
economic analyses, and reports on exile activities in Mexico.
b. "KUTUBE/D recommended renewal of LIFEAT observing that the leads
produced by the operation have been of operational value to LAURICLE
activities conducted in Mexico City in the past year. KUTUDE/D comments
also that the Project has afforded and can be expected to continue to afford
Cotection from time to time for activities of particular LAURICLE interest.
c. "KUTUBE/OPS has observed that Project IIFAT has been a most useful
operational asset in the Mexico City Station for the past nine years,
continuously providing KUMARK with a window into important targets. KUTUBE/OPS
requests that the next project renewal point out what agent recruitments by
the Station have resulted from or been supported by the operational information
secured by the project.
d. "KUDESK commented that it well known that Mexico is being used by
the RIS as a base for third country operations directed against the United
States. Over a period of years LIFEAT has supplied valuable leads which
have resulted in the identification of a large number of persons in clandestine
contact with RIS officers; further investigation in several cases produced
information which strongly indicated that the persons involved were
actively assisting the RIS, while such information is, of itself, of interest
and importance, our responsibility in the CI field imposes the obligation to
determine what these persons are doing for the RIS and this can be done only
by recruiting and doubling them. It is therefore suggested that LIFEAT leads
and reports of investigations based on them be reviewed for the purpose of
selecting a limited number of the more promising targets. Thereafter, Station
assets including LIFAT should be used to obtain the operational data
necessary to determine that a target is recruitable, and then a pitch should
be made. Much time and effort will be required for such a program, but the
potantial rewards fully justify it, and the value of LIFEAT, as a CI asset,
will be materially increased.
3. Chief, KUTUBE, in recommending the Project for renewal to Deputy Director,
KUBARK, requested that at the time of the next Project renewal, the Division should
review the relationship and coordination of Project LIFTAT operations with those
active and proposed under Project LIENVOY.

1. It is requested that the LIHAT Project ha renewed for the period
1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of 135,145.00.
2. Attached is the Field's Project ileview, togather with a reviand
Project Outline, which clearly set forth the present status of the Project.
It is believed that the activity described herein continues to justify the
time and expense involved, and hence merits renewal for the forthcoming year.
3. In March 1959 we asked the federal Bureau of Investigation for
their evaluation of the usefulness of information on American Comunists
which originated from LIFFAT and whether they wished to contime receiving
such information. On 2 Avril 1957, the focerul fhreas of Investigation
molied that the information has been of value to them from intelligence
and invectigative visunointa and they wish to c ntinue receiving auct
information.

4. In addition to the formal coments cited above, during the process of
obtaining approval for LINSAT, the Project was subject to various and sundry
criticisms in its present form. Therefore, headquarters surrests that the
Station bear this in mind and during the coming year make every effort to increase
the operational value of this Project. If the LIENVOY Project is a success
operationally and the leads are followed up and developed, WH Division anticipates
that it will encounter difficulty in obtaining approval of a similar Project as
large and as expensive as LIF AT unless it is demonstrated to the completa
satisfaction of Headquarters that the expense involved in the LIFEAT Project is
justified and that the results of the exploitation of project developed leads
prove useful in attaining the Station CS objectives. Among the comments received are:
Although the purpose and objectives of the project as stated in
304
the FPO call for the collection of information, the operational intent is
to make use of this information for an eventual recruitment of Sino-Soviet
and Satellite diplomats and/or their contacts. It is realized that diplomats
who are susceptible to defection or recruitment in place are few and far
between and that the Station is always alert for such targets and is
conscientious in their develorment. However, the Case Officer should keep
in mind the more easily accessible and more vulnerable (though secondary)
targets, i.e. the many contacts, friends, employees, etc. whose development
could well lead to the primary targets. Headquarters feels it is this
secondary category where more emphasis can be made. The recruitment in
place of such individuals could be extremely valuable for the entire
CI/CE program of the Station.
b. The lack of development and exploitation of leads from LIFEAT
In view of the limited reporting
operations has been raised many times.
to Headquarters on the exploitation of operational leads, it has been
difficult to state whether the leads are being followed up, who the
targets are, and whether consideration is being given to recruitment
approaches. Headquarters requests that in each monthly summary the
Station supply more info under the section labaled "Exploitation of
Leads". The statement "leads resulting from LIFFAT information are
followed up by other Station assets" is meaningless without some
explanation of the lead follow ups. Headquarters would like to know
the names and some operational information concerning the persons who
seem to be of most interest and who have been under investigation during
the period covered by the monthly summary.
5. On page 6 of your covering memorandum on the FPO (MMA-12936), you indicate
that during the coming year the Station expects to expand its coverage to
approximately 24 lines. Headquarters would like to suggest that consideration
be given to limiting coverage to a number of lines which can be effectively
exploited.
6. It is requested that Headquarters be informed in more detail in all cases
where information obtained through LIFEAT has been used to support other important
Station operations.

There is attached a Review of Project LIFEAT for the period
1 July 1958 to 30 June 1959.
2. Part I of the Outline has been revised this year. Station Mexico
felt that with the number of revisions which have been made since a
complete project renewal request was submitted for FY 1958, this was
warranted. It should be noted that for purposes of uniformity all
indigenous personnel in the LIFEAT complex have now been given on
cryptonym and at present this breakdown goes from /1 to /16. Any future
personnel changes will be added to this numbering series.

d: Movement of Soviet officials;
Through LIFEAT coverage a roster of Soviet personnel currently in
Mexico has been maintained by Station Nexico. This has been the
primary source of such information. LIFEAT has enabled the station to
determine in advance when departures can be expected and has also been
a factor in determining job assignments and replacements for departing
personnel.
e. Soviet Embassy Contacts;
Contact reports of the Soviets are compiled and provided for Head-
quarters as necessary. These reports are of considerable operational
value in identifying regular and/or occasional local and foreign
contacts of the Soviets. Following are examples of this type of
coverage:
