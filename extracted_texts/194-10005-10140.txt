ARMED FORCES SECURITY QUESTIONNAIRE
I.—EXPLANATION
1. The interests of National Security require that all persons
being considered for membership or retention in the Armed
Forces be reliable, trustworthy, of good character, and of com-
plete and unswerving loyalty to the United States. Accordingly.
it is necessary for you to furnish information concerning your
security qualifications. The answers which you give will be used
in determining whether you are eligible for membership in the
Armed Forces, in selection of your duty assignment, and for such
other action as may be appropriate.
2. You are advised that in accordance with the Fifth Amend-
ment of the Constitution of the United States you cannot be
compelled to furnish any statements which you may reasonably
believe may lead to your prosecution for a crime. This is the
only reason for which you may avail yourself of the privilege af-
forded by the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer questions
under Part IV below. Claiming the Fifth Amendment will not
by itself constitute sufficient grounds to exempt you from mili-
tary service for reasons of security. You are not required to
answer any questions in this questionnaire, the answer to which
might be incriminating. If you do claim the privilege granted by
the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer any question, you
should make a statement to that effect after the question involved.
II.-ORGANIZATIONS OF SECURITY SIGNIFICANCE
1. There is set forth below a list of names of organizations,
groups, and movements, reported by the Attorney General of the
United States as having significance in connection with the
National Security. Please examine the list carefully, and note those
organizations, and organizations of similar names, with which you
are familiar. Then answer the questions set forth in Part IV below.
2. Your statement concerning membership or other association
with one or more of the organizations named may not, of itself,
cause you to be ineligible for acceptance or retention in the
Organizations designated by the Attorney General, pursuant to Executive Order 10450, are listed below:
Armed Forces. Your age at the time of such association, cir-
cumstances prompting it, and the extent and frequency of
involvement, are all highly pertinent, and will be fully weighed.
Set forth all such factors under "Remarks" below, and continue
on separate attached sheets of paper if necessary.

sidiaries and affiliates.
Communist Political Association, its subdivisions,
subsidiaries and affiliates, including—
