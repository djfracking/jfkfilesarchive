1 The purpose of this dispatch is to raise what we believe
to be an operational prospect worth careful study. The proposal
is necessarily somewhat tentative at this point, but we believe it
is desirable to share it with Headquarters now in order that its
early consideration may be facilitated.

2. As you are aware, RODIGAST has developed excellent contacts
with individuals active in the Paris SNCC group. Identity A, who
is one of these, has recently become increasingly active in the
affairs of the SNCC group (which largely centers around several
young girls recently arrived from the US) and has come to play a
rather important role since she brings to it a sophistication and
articulateness which the “natural” lendas of the group locks.
Identity A would not normally have become active in the SNCC group.
She is older and holds "moderate" views of the sort held by the
late Dr. Martin Luther King. However, she recently took a rather
militant position at a public discussion of civil rights (primarily
to avoid confrontation with and criticism by the SNCC girls) after
which she was admiringly besieged by the girls who were anxious to
have her assistance in preparation of speeches, etc. In this
regard please see Reference. Partly because she has the time and
partly because she was flattered, Identity A) accepted and has grown
daily more involved in SNCC matters. At the moment she is devoting
virtually full time to this.

3. RODIGAST reports that Identity A is charming, highly female,
definitely intelligent and something of an "actress" in that she is
often willing to tell people what they want to hear; indeed, this is
what she did at the public discussion mentioned above. At the same
time she is committed to the civil rights movement. You will note
from the biographical data which we are forwarding under separate
cover, that she has worked in civil rights activities before and at
one point assisted in the organization of a march led by Dr. King.
RODIGAST, who is a personal friend of the family (she is divorced
and has a teen-aged girl) in addition to being the representative of
her publisher, has gotten to know her very well over the past years.
He reports that she is basically a loyal, moderate and anti-Communist
person who comes from a middle class family in Detroit where her
parents were active in the anti-Communist activities of the United
Auto Workers. At one point RODIGAST had proposed her for possible
use since she might be able to gain access to North Vietnam. This
was rejected, however, because she was thought to be too moderate,
respectable and pro-American to be of interest to the North Vietnamese
4. All this has been altered by her recent involvement in the
SNCC activities, and it is now RODIGAST's opinion that she offers
what may be a unique opportunity to obtain the collaboration of
someone in a position to report on the attempts by Communist, Castro-
ist, and radical forces to influence and use the civil rights move-
ment. Through her involvement in SNCC she has developed contacts
with various groups which are flirting with SNCC such as the French
Vietnam National Committee, Vietnamese student groups and the Che
Guevara Circle all targets of WOFIRM.

5. At the ment she is the most glamorous figure the SNCO
returns to the US this Spring, Identity A could easily develop into
a leading public representative of SNCC. Another candidate for a
leading roky in SECC following the departure of Identity B is the
Marxist oriented Identity C-although she is somewhat shy and prefers
to operaty behind the scene. Thus we can envision a situation where
Identity à might become most influential, if only by default.
6. RODIGAST is convinced that Identity A would be willing to
collaborate with her government but stresses that the approach to
her would require great skill and must be done by an individual with
whom she could feel rapport. He reiterates that she is sincerely
anti-Communist, and that she does not share the beliefs of the
militant black racists, although she certainly is a convinced ad-
vocate of the civil rights struggle. RODIGAST suggests that any
approach to her must stress respect for her commitment to the civil
rights movement. This approach should emphasize that Communist
exploitation of the movement is in the interest of neither the move-
ment nor the nation and should request her collaboration in report-
ing on foreign (and only foreign) attempts to exploit the situation.
As an alternative to this direct approach, we believe that consider-
ation should be given to the desirability of merely stating that
because her activity in the civil rights movement she has been
thrown into contact with Vietnamese, Cubans, etc. of interest to
WOPIRM and on whom we would welcome reports. This line has the
virtue of having less blow-back potential should our approach be
declined and we would hope that once a relationship with her had
been established she would volunteer information on SNCC and its
foreign involvement. Reinforcing the approach RODIGAST suggests.
that she be offered a small payment of, say, $200 per month to assist
her in meeting the obligations of living abroad. This payment will

be attractive to her since she is somewhat lazy. She is now living
on a grant from Identity D which is designed to give her the finan-
cial independence to write another book. However, she has done no
writing yet and is begiming to be concerned regarding her source
of income when the grant expires at the end of the year.

7. Time is of great importance in any approach to Identity A,
in RODIGAST's view. He stresses that she is becoming concerned
regarding future income and may soon begin withdrawing from SNCC
activities in order to begin writing. More importantly, her normal
instincts may soon lead to a falling out with Identity C and other
radicals who are active in SNCC. If this happens it can be expected
to severely reduce her access. Were she in contact with WOFIRM,
however, such arguments with target personalities could be avoided
through careful WOPIRM guidance.
8. Thus we are presented with what appears to be an opportunity
to gain a collaborator who might be able to provide information of
the highest interest regarding Communist efforts to use SBCC, and
who might be able to gain access to various other radical group.

opportunity may be almost unique. At the same time, there appears
to be a rather critical time factor operative here.
We
9. In addition, rather fundamental questions are raised by
this possibility, which will certainly require careful consideration
prior to any approach to Identity A. We are impressed with the
thoroughness of RODIGAST's assessment of this operational possibility,
and believe it warrants serious consideration by Headquarters.
have no reports regarding the impact of the assassination of Dr.
Martin Luther King on Identity A and the other members of the SNCC
group-although our guess is that it will only accelerate forces
now in operation and render more important, even critical, the
consideration of this proposal.
10_ We request that an appropriate clearance of Identity A be
expedited and that we be advised as soon as possible whether or not
Headquarters wishes to pursue further the exploration of this
_ proposal.
