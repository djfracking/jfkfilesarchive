MR. OLSEN: To use the house term, he was a spook?
MR. MARCHETTI: Yes. He was a very exotic character.
And all kinds of stories float around about Jim Angleton. And
I am sure that some are nothing more than apocryphal and some
are pure rumor.
What intrigued me about this Runge thing is that

the man he had been

that Harvey said to

to dig deeper, Harvey held him at arm's length.
MR. OLSEN: Who is Harvey?
MR. MARCHETTI: Bill Harvey was a scenario officer.
He had been, among other, things Chief of Base in Berlin during
the Cold War. He had been Head of the Cuban task force.

MR. MARCHETTI:
Well, they would turn up from time to
time. Usually I didn't have any direct dealings. They were
handled by the Clandestine Services. But you would know the
case. There is the famous case of olenevski (?), who is this
¿Polish intelligence officer who said that he was a KGB plant
the Polish service, and he is the one that many people on the
extreme right like to point to as having identified all kinds
of agents within the US Government. Eventually I got to the
point where he was taking out ads in the newspapers to the

and the legal claim and the throne.
At this point you don't know if the guy was nuts all
along, and I don't know what the official thinking about it
at the Agency is.
But there have been anumber of others over the years.
There is Colonevski
MR. OLSEN: How do you spell his name.

And I am wondering what
kind of use in the US you might be aware of?
MR. MARCHETTI:
That wasn't what I meant by that.
What I meant was, it worked good under laboratory conditions
here, but when I would take it out to the field, it wouldn't
work.

MR. MARCHETTI:
No, I was not.
But that is that system that people are talking about
now, the laser people bugging system, where they can get a
building across the street there and direct a beam here and
pick it up. It has become quite popular in recent years, at
least they talk about it.
MR OLSEN: You mean in the spy literature?

MR. ROETHE: There is one reference to breaking into:
embassies at page 199. And there is no reference to any
particular embassy. Are you aware of any activity where the

CIA was actually implicated in breaking into an embassy?
You

have already talked about the Cilean Embassy.
MR. MARCHETTI:
This was based on information that was

availabe in the Houston Plan, which by that time had become
public. And also certain background information about the
_capabilities of the NSA in its technical field, and certain CIA

supposition.

As I say, I have no first hand

You remember the fine-Rouse case?

believe, don't you?

This happened to be a case where Rouse under Agency
orders, was directed to Mine as being a Soviet agent in the
L.Estonian group. And Juney apparently to this day claims
absolute innocence, and said that he was framed, and it was
done for other reasons, because he didn't see eye to eye with the

submitted some sort of affidavit which the judge accepted, and
on the basis of that the case was resolved in favor of Rouse.
He had to idneitify Rouse as being in the Agency's employ and
acting under orders from the Agency. The reasons why, they are
