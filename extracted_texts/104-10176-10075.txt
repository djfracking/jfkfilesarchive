1.
Pursuant to a meeting held on 14 November 1963 amongst personnel
of WH/3/Mexico, B. Reichart, R. Scott, H. Mulloy, J. Mamming and of CI/OA,
B. P. Brown and J. Lally, it was agreed that the case of LITAMII/9 comes
under the purview of CSI-F No. 10-5, Section 18a. As such, this requires
Headquarters approval, i.e. that or wh Division, ior the recruitment of a
government official of a denied area country.
2. As described in MEXI-6696, LITAMIL/9 "serves as invaluable eyes
and ears inside target establishment" reporting on information received
in his government position. It was agreed such activity does not require
a Provisional or Operational Approval since LITAMIL/9 is a government of-
ficial of a denied area country. Under these conditions, the processing
of an Operational Approval should not and will not be effected.
3. It was also agreed that if LITAMIL/9 should be employed for ope-
rational use other than reporting information received in his government
position, the usual Operational Approval or Provisional Operational Ap-
proval procedure will apply.
4. It was agreed that CI/CA would take no further processing action
at this time based on the above information. However, as in similar
cases, CI/OA will forward to the desk such information made available to
it which might aid the Station in its handling of LITAMIL/9.

7. Although at first appearance, and according to
his own opinion statements, LITAMIL-9 appears to be extremely
nervous because of his clandestine activities in behalf of
KUBARK and against Cuba, after some discussion it was apparent
that he actually relishes these clandestine actions that he
would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he
would have continued a covert relationship with KUBARK even after
Castro falls, serving either in Mexico (where he has many
contacts of interest to KUBARK) or in Cuba in some post in
some future government. He has excellent rapport with his
present KUBARK case officer. He states that as long as KUBARK
remains willing to accept that he has definite personal limi-
tations, (since he can perform only those clandestine tasks
related to his cover and cannot be trained or induced to do
anything else) he will gladly continue collaborating with
KUBARK as long as desired.
8.
Actually, PARMERS feels that LITAMIL-9 would
do most anything we would desire if KUBARK would someday
establish some control over him. His present remarks concerning
his moral qualms are artificial. He has great appreciation
for shrewdness and double play, and openly admits having
engaged in it all his life. On many occasions he admits that
he has accomodated himself to a situation for profit or because
he knew that he could turn the tables eventually on his ad-
versaries. When he is off-guard he admits to being a cool
operater who can scheme and work behind his adversaries' backs.
He shows many signs of enjoying doing what he does for and
with his present KUBARK case officer.
9. In summary, although LITAMIL-9 did not accept
training or SW in the standard sense, PARMERS believes that the
agents reluctance was based on his desire to take few risks.
The agent is competent, his moral inhibitions are probably
faked. He is convinced that he will return to Mexico soon, and
desires to continue serving KUBARK if no greater risk is in-
volved. Since ZUBARK at present has no clear control (monetary
or ideological) over LITANIL-9, it was difficult to impose
KUBARK's will over him. But he is very willing to perform for
KUBARK within the limitations he gets, and if someday we can
satisfy some personal need he might have, he has the potential
of becoming a good controlled agent for KUBARK. He is intell-
igent and by nature ho seems to instinctively conduct his
clandestine operations in a secure manner.

3. On Friday, 24 February, PARKERS spent most of
the day visiting alone with LITAMIL-O at the latter's apart-
ment. By the end of the day LITAMIL-9 had softened a little
and had revealed some of the personality traits mentioned
LITAKIL-9 also agreed to communicate with his Case
Officer through open code in letters to his brother in Mexico
City. He also was willing to meet inside KUBARK; preferably
if the contact was a diplomat but not Cuban. He agreed to
take a set of cuff links as bona fides. As a suggestion, he
mentioned that his friend. The Swiss Ambassador, now serving
in Madrid, Spain, would be an ideal contact. In revealing how
such a contact could be performed and in discussing LITAMIL-9
modus vevendi in Cuba, there was considerable discussions
concerning operational Security and clandestine procedures
LITAMIL-9 can apply while in Cuba.
LITAMIL-9 during this meeting also presented.
in logical sequence, his reasons for believing that he will
return to Nexico City. Rasicaliv, ha fucle that hetween the
fact that he has many contacts in Mexico City (where he was
lived and worked for many years) and the fact that his sister-
in-law in Cuba has a responsible position with considerable
influence in the Castro Government, he LITAMIL-9 will be re-
assigned to his present post in Mexico City after three months
of leave, consultations, and training in Cuba.

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of
25 Februar., in a car pick up situation, with the Case Officer
This time. LITAMIL-9 was less willing to communicate
with KUBARK while in Cuba than he had been during the previous
meeting, but with some reluctance, agreed to the use of open
code and to be contacted by some diplomat. This meeting. there-
fore, was a routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer
in charge.
6.
Based upon their three meetings, PARKERS formed
the following opinions of LITAMIL-9: He is a shrewd oppor-
tunist, willing to colloborate with KUBARK against the Castro
Government, but not to the point where his personal security
is endangered. He dislikes the Castro Regime because it has
fumbled so badly, and because the current Cuban officials are
crude and incompetant. He greatly admires the American people,
but definitely feels that we are merely concerned about our
own national security and well-being. LITAMIL-8 owes his
first loyalty to the fine arts, has little Patriotic feelings
towards Cuba, since he has lived in Mexico for so many years,
and has declared himself to be a resident of Mexico. He is
now serving the Cuban Government simply because he had an
opportunity (through his sister-in-law) to achieve official
status and income and still remain in Mexico where most of his

KEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LITAKIL-9, Report of TDY, Andrew S. Parmers
1.
During 21-26 February 1963, Andrew S. PARMERS
travelled from Headquarters to Mexico City on TDY to train
LITAMIL-9 on various clandestine, operational, techniques,
including SW. Upon arrival in Mexico City PARMERS ascertained
that LITAMIL-9 allegedly became of moral imbibitions, was
unwilling to receive training and also unwilling to accept the
SW systmes Headquarters had issued for him, and which PARMERS
had carried to Mexico City. Nevertheless, PARMERS met LITAMIL-9
three times to determine the agents precise objections and to
overcome them if possible. Although the agents general
resistance was not overcome. PARMERS did review with TTTANTT_ Q
clandestine methods and techniques in a general way.
2. The first meeting was held at the Station case
officers home, with the Case Officer present. LITAMIL-9 ex-
plained his reasons for refusing to be trained and for not
being willing to communicate in Sw with KUBARK while in Cuba.
Generally LITAMIL-9 claimed that he is very nervous, and
incapable of performing clandestine tasks without having a
nervous breakdown and at the sam time getting himself caught
in the act because of his general incompetancy. Also, LITANIL-9
was planning to stay at his brothers home in Cuba, and felt
it would be unethical and immoral for him to be communicating
clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting the hospitality of
his brother and sister-in-law who are staunch supporters of the
Castro regime. These agreements obviously had already been
presented to the Case Officer who had already concluded that
LITAMIL-9 could not be moved from his position. The agent
furthermore, felt that there was no need for training or SV
since he would be returning to Mexico after only three months
in Cuba. He displayed a cable he had just received from his
father answering LITAMIL-9's query as to what might be his
next assignment. The cable stated that LITAMIL-9 would most
likely return to his present post in Mexico. The agent thre-
fore felt that upon his return to Mexico City, he could be
debriefed by his Case Officer. LITAMIL-9 rejected all attempts
to convince him of our need for current info from inside Cuba.
He was adament when we pointed out that he might not return
☐ Xexico City as hoped, but might have to remain in Cuba having
no means of contact. If this happens he plans to resis his
position and return to Mexico as a private citizen,
already is a registered "resident" of Mexico.

~
8 November he was contacted and debriefed by Mexico City Station.
Throughout the month of November be debated the question of whether
or not he should return to Cuba. In the first week of December 1966,
be decided to remain in Mexico.
2. Since it was believed that LITAMII-9 would have little ac-
cess to LR or to persons of interest in Mexico, he was terminated
and the balance of his escrow account was paid to him on 9 December
1966. However, it has since become apparent that from time to time
it would be valuable to WOFACT to contact LNL-9 for information
on PERUMEN personalities. He is acquainted with a large mumber of
persons who themselves are of interest to OFACT or who could supply
information on third persons on whom information is needed.
3. Therefore, provisional operational approval and subsequent
operational approval for such occasional contact with LITANL-9 is
requested. It is not planned to pay him a salary or formalize an
agent relationship. LITAMIL-9 would only be contacted when specific
needs for information arise and the possibility exists that he has
or could obtain the information.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA
SUBJECT
: Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.
2. In discussions with the field case officer for this
operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no way to
determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will again leave Cuba.
For reasons of personal security, LITAMIL-9 has not been
able to function as a reporting Die sint 115 return to
Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother, LITAMIL-17,
and reports from occasional Cuban official travelers transiting
Mexico indicate that LITAMIL-9 is well and is employed by the
National Cultural Council.
3. LITANIL-9 is now an inactive agent. The Station
has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating
as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages to leave
Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessment of his
future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact that his
sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is expected
that he will be a valuable source of information, at lea
for an initial debriefing period.
4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITAMIL–9
could be extended for six months. If at the end of tha
time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that the
POA be allowed to expire.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CI/OA
SUBJECT
: Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9
1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAMIL-9,
who has recently returned to Cuba, and has accepted an FI
mission from Nexico Station. The Station has expressed its
reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged in
1959 that LITAMIL-9 was a Communist, since this course of
action would unnecessarily draw attention of this officer
to our interest in LITAMIL-9. WH/1 has concurred in this
decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory
information on ITMANTY O n
--
mance record.
--
2. Realizing the risk involved in working with any
Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent record
of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued
cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of an
Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audio
coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for
the past two years or more, and during this time the Station
has used the installation for spot checking his information,
and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his
veracity and security or suspect that he is under control
of the Cuban service.
3. Attached for your review are several contact
reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally. Their
prompt return will be appreciated. This office will be
pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case
which will facilitate the OA.

1. LICOZE CASE REVIEWED THOROUGHLY BY SHRYOCK WHO HANDLED
IN MEXI. SHRYOCK COMMENTS HOLLOW: LICOZE WAS DIFFICULT TO
TRUTHFUL
HANDLE BECAUSE WHILE TRUTHČUL IN ANSWER TO ANY SPECIFIC QUESTION
HE SELDOM ELABORATED, SELDOM VOLUNTEERED INFORMATION AND
GENERALLY WAS RELUCTANT TO FURNISH INFO WHICH DID NOT CONCERN
PEOPLE WHOM HE CONSIDERED COMMES.

2. REVIEW ESTABLISEEN THAT LICOZE AT TIME WHEN HE SAW
FERNANDO AVILA AT HAGANA AIRPORT SENT MESSAGE THROUGH LITAMIL-9
TO AMBASSADOR ANTONIO PORTUONDO THAT AVILA WAS AN AMERICAN AGENT.
THIS INFO CAME FROM LITAMIL-9 WHO IS CONSIDERED COMPLETELY:
RELIABLE. GRANTING MEMORY LAPSE ON PART OF LICOZE AS RESULTS
OF PASSAGE OF TIME AND PSYCHIATRIC DIFFICULTIES, IT STILL IS
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT HE DID NOT RECALL ABOVE WHEN DISCUSSING
AVILA CASE. DO NOT REPEAT NOT RECOMMEND STOCKWOOD MENTIONING

ON CURRENT REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN DELVE FURTHER INTO PAST
LICOZE ACTIVITIES WHICH ALREADY HAVE BEEN COVERED IN SOME
DETAIL AND IN WHICH LICOZE APPEARS HONESTLY TO HAVE FORCOTTEN.
SHRYOCK IN REVIEWING LATEST INFO FROM LICOZE FOUND IT TO CORRESPOND
WITH INFO KNOWN TO HIM I DURING TIME HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH LIOOZE.
