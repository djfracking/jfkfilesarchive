Although source saw Julian NOVAS Fernandez at the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City in March 1964, the records of this
Agency reveal that source was probably in error in
assuming that NOVAS was assigned to that Embassy and
it is more likely that he was just passing through.
The following traces by this Agency is the basis for
this conclusion.
An official Jamaican source, in a report dated 24 March 1964,
stated that Julian NOVAS Fernandez arrived in Kingston,
Jamaica, on 18 March 1964, to take up his duties at the
Cuban Consulate in Kingston as Commercial Attache: Source

speaks excellent English. Since his arrival he has been
especially occupied with girls. It should be noted that
