ROBERT SMITH

YEZ IRYS
In observance of the tenth anniversary of President Kennedy's death,
the Committee to Investigate Assassinations is sponsoring a two-day
Conference at Georgetown University on November 23rd and 24th. A
brochure describing the Conference and its program is attached. As
you will note, several of the Nation's prominent writers and investi-
gators of the assassinations of the past decade will speak.
"
While a number of different points of view on the subject will be
represented, there is general consensus that the Executive Branch has
failed to make known all the relevant facts of the assassinations..
We believe that the Congress must ultimately take the initiative if
the public is to learn all of the facts, and that Watergate has shown
us that Congress' action depends largely on disclosures by an informed
press and other news media.
A press pass will be available for you at the Conference registration
desk. For further information, please contact:

Richard Ober, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
furnished the following to the Liaison Agent on April 17, 1968:
A CIA source, characterized as being very reliable,
advised that on or about April 15, 1968, an individual identi-
fying himself as Gerald Lee Richards, a U. S. seaman, called
at the Tokyo, Japan, office of the National Maritime Union and
asked to be signed on a ship as soon as possible. (It should
be noted that reference is being made to the office of the U.S.
National Maritime Union.) He was asked to furnish his local
address in Tokyo, and he refused to do so. He became very
agitated and then left. So far he has not returned to the
aforementioned office. CIA's source stated that Richards ·
answers, the general description of the suspect in the instant
case. as reported in newspapers.
Richards volunteered information indicating that
he applied for seaman's papers in San Pedro, California, on
June 16, 1964; and that he registered as a member of the
National Maritime. Union in San Pedro on February 21, 1968.
