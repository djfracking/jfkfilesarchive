ramifications, and the Department still has a copy in its
possession: Major Miles advised that the White House is in
possession of a copy of this document and it was his impression
that Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the
President, is aware of its existence. He also advised that
members of the SSC, with the knowledge of CIA Director Colby,
have had access to this document if not a copy of same in
their possession. Major Miles, upon instruction of John Clarke,
is visiting the various members of the intelligence community
mentioned by CIA in the document for the purpose of briefing
them concerning its existence and those portions which may
pertain to those agencies. He indicated that he had the
previous day briefed General Allen, Director of National
Security Agency (NSA), and Mr. Benson Buffham, Deputy Director.
From the document which Major Miles kept in his possession
at all times, he cited numerous pages which made reference
to the FBI. The following items

Director Sec'y
To advise that Senate Select Committee (SSC) has been
given access to a CIA "Secret" document prepared in May, 1973,
containing information concerning questionable activities
in which CIA has engaged, a number of which activities involve
the FBI and which are the subject matter of current SSC
inquiries of this Bureau.

On 6/20/75, through prior arrangement, Major Perry
Miles, USMC, Intelligence Community Staff, upon instruction
from John Clarke, Associate Deputy to Director of Central.
Intelligence for the Intelligence Community, appeared at
Headquarters for the purpose of briefing Intelligence Division
personnel concerning possible problems which may have arisen
in connection with captioned matter. Present at the briefing,
in addition to yourself and me, were the following personnel
familiar with CIA and Senstudy matters: Special Agents
Leon F. Schwartz, John P. Thomas, Seymor F. Phillips, Fred J.
Cassidy, * and Thomas J. McNiff.
Major Miles brought with him a 693-page document,
classified "Secret", containing information concerning ques-
tionable activities in which CIA had engaged, which document
was prepared in May, 1973, by CIA under the direction of then
CIA Director James R. Schlesinger. This document consisted.
of numerous memoranda relating to a wide variety of operations
in which CIA had engaged. Sometime after its compilation,
date unknown, the document was turned over to the Justice

Pages 457-458 - Information concerning CIA counterintelligence
operation including forcible entry and removal of
documents in 1962 against an unnamed foreign establishment
in the United States. Top United States officials,
including President Kennedy, were briefed concerning
this operation. Then Attorney General Robert Kennedy
after being briefed stated the operation was not to be
called to the attention of the FBI unless FBI first
initiated inquiry. It is to be noted former Bureau
Liaison officer Sam Papich was queried concerning this
matter in recent interview by SSC representatives.
Page 459 - Information concerning controversy between former
CIA Director McCone and Bureau official Mr. Belmont
regarding Bureau's opposition to CIA recommendation that
there be an extensive broadening of counterintelligence
activities against diplomatic establishments in this
country.
OBSERVATIONS:
Contact this date with Department officials elicited
that four Department attorneys, including K. William O'Connor,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Office of
Deputy Attorney General, have reviewed the above 693-page
document and have furnished additional sanitized documents
of interest from a prosecutive standpoint.
From the above, it is obvious that this Bureau, in
order to be in a position to knowledgeably and accurately
reply to SSC inquiries and to fully identify operations listed
above, should first obtain a copy of the above 693-page
SECRET...
