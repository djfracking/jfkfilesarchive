1962. He was under consideration as on "external coordinator"
in the Evelio Duque exile group.
BOSCH was to assist the
Agency and Duque in formulating operational plans for infil-

procured food supplies for the teams. Available information
does not indicate any Agency contact with BOSCH for this
purpose subsequent to November 1962. Later, on 31 October

New York City with BOSCH twice. These two meetings were in
connection with efforts by BOSCH to secure financial backing
for air strikes (mounted from Central America) against Cuba.
BOSCH at this time was the General Coordinator of the in-
surrectional Movement of Pukule (japury Rechercy (MIAR).
BOSCH was informed through on intermediary on either 2 or 3
November 1963 that no financial backing would be forthcoming.
There is no available information to indicate any Agency
contact with BOSCH subsequent to 1 November 1963.

for the Bay of Pigs invasion. POSADA received at least
rudimentary familiarization training in demolitions, and was
trained in usage of various hand-held weapons, in Guatemala.
From March 1965 until March 1964 POSADA was in the U.S. Army
at Fort Benning, Georgia, finishing up as a Second Lieutenant

RYBAT KMSTONE VWOCK/NOC Byron W. GUTRADT's East Contacts with_
Orlando Bosch and WKSCARLET-3
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS INVOLVED
1. We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch,
WKSCARLET-3 and several other Cuban exiles were recently arrested
and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on
6 October. After having read these accounts NOC Byron W. GUTRADT
reported, for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3
in the early 1960's. GUTRADT met WKSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both
were enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. GUTRADT at that
time had already terminated his relationship with BKHERALD.
While at OCS GUTRADT was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3
but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledgeable of GUTRADT's back-
ground and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen
WKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and
doubts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would remember him.
i
2. GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was
training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored program. Bosch only knew
GUTRADT in alias. GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since completion
of this training.
3. Given the length of time that has elapsed plus the lack
of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Bosch, GUTRADT and the
Station do not believe that their knowledge of his past BKHERALD
activities presents any security problems today. GUTRADT, of
course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and
was surprised to hear of the bombing of the Cubana airliner.

RXE COMMENTED THAT CRASH GAVE RISE TO GREAT DEAL OF EMOTION WHICH
FOR BURNHAM WAS VERY STRONGLY REINFORCED BY DISCOVERY OF JOE LED'S
NAME IN SUSPECT'S DIARY. FOR BURNHAM THIS INDICATED A PRESENT USG
ASSOCIATION WITH SUSPECTS EVEN IF WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN AIR CRASH.
R/3 SAID THAT IN MEETINGS PRIOR TO BURNHAM'S SPEECH FORMIN WILLS
WAS NOT ANXIOUS FOR CONFRONTATION WITH US. HOWEVER, IN HIS AND
WILLS' ATTEMPTS TO DISCUSS BURNHAM'S SPEECH APPROACH, BURNHAM
WOULD NOT COMMIT HIMSELF AS TO HOW FAR HE WOULD GO. R/3 THINKS THAT

Data for Inclusion in Draft Memorandum
To Secretary of State
LDX-0714, 19 October 1976
1. In response to the queries posed in the
Reference, there follows below amplification of information
concerning Luis Pesada.
2.
The Agency has had no relationship with Luis
POSADA's Investigative Agency or any other business venture
he may have had in Caracas.
3.
The decision to terminate the relationship with
Posada was taken in carly 1974. Our only reason for
continuing the contact beyond date of that decision in 1974
was to resolve certain outstanding federal income tax mat-
ters, and we tried to keep these sessions as infrequent
as possible. Because Posada had high local profile, we
waited for his periodic non-scheduled call-ins to receive
and convey any news concerning tax matters.
4. Contacts with him subsequent to February 1976
were at Posada's own initiative (except as indicated below)
and were for the purpose of volunteering information on
significant exile extremist plans, to solicit aid for re-
tention of his resident alien status, and for help in
obtaining U.S. visitors visas for self and family. Posada
was not tasked to provide information beyond specifics of
extremist planning which he had reported on own initiative.
S. Posada recontacted the Caracas Station in mid-
February 1976 to volunteer a report on the whereabouts of
Orlando BOSCH Avila, Frank CASTRO. and the threat to the
Life of Salvador ALLENDE's nephew. He was contacted a day
or so later by Station Buenos Aires to debrief him on any
possible information concerning the security of Secretary
Kissinger's visit. At this time Posada was travelling with
former DISIP Chief Remberto UZCATEGUI (his client) and
investigating the authorship of a letter bomb sent to Cuban
Ambassador in Caracas.

6. On 22 June 1976 Posada again contacted the
station and requested visa assistance, for his wife and
himself.
7. The Caracas station has no reason to believe
that the source of TDFIRDB-315/10256 deliberately delayed
passing on Bosch's and Posada's remarks about hitting a
Cuban plane until after the incident. When Posada made
the statements to the subsource he was not specific as
to any time or place for the incident. When the subsource
reported this information to the source, the subsource
had no reason to believe the information would be passed
on by the source to this Agency as he is unwitting of the

SUBJECT
: Previous Agency Association with Persons
Allegedly Responsible for Bombing of
Cubaña Airlines Flight
1. On 6 October a Cubana airlines flight crashed
shortly after takeoff from Seawell airport at Barbados.
Seventy-eight persons aboard were killed in the crash.
The passengers were mostly Cuban, but also included a
North Korean delegation and the wife of the Guyanese
DCM in Havana.
2. Following the incident the Trinidad and Tobago
police detained two Venezuelan citizens who they believe
are connected with the bombing. The suspects are Jose
VAZQUEZ Garcia and Freddy LUGO, both holders of Venezuelan
passports. On subsequent interrogation by the Trinidadian
police it was learned that Vazquez is an alias used by
Hernan Ricardo Lozano.
3. There are no Headquarters traces on Lugo, Lozano,
or the alias Vazquez. According to the Legal Attache in
Caracas, however, both Lugo and Lozano are employed as
investigators by an industrial security firm operated by
Luis POSADA, Carriles. Posada is a former salaried agent
of the Agency. He is a Cuban exile, naturalized Venezuelan,
who was formerly head of the counter-intelligence division
of the Venezuelan civilian security service. Posada loss
his job with the security service in March of 1974 and was
omicably terminated by the Caracas Station in June of 1974.
The Station continued in occassional contact with Posada
pending resolution of problems concerning his U.S. income
taxes. His last reported contact with the Station was in
June 1976 when he unsuccessfully sought Station assistance
with a visa problem.

1. Salvador ROMANT ORUF Garcia, a Cuban exile
who is a journalist in Caracas, has been reported by an
untested Caracas Station source to be suspected by Cubán
Embassy officials as involved in the plane crash. Their
suspicion is based on the fact Res:cufi” was seen surveilling
a Caracas hotel occupied by members of a Cuban fencing
team, who ubsequently were killed in the crash. Remani
was employed by Caracas Station from September 1960 until
December 1966 as a writer and press placement asset in the
Station's anti-Castro propoganda campaign. His termination.
was somewhat less than amicable, but in March of 1967
Romani was paid a termination bonus and signed a quit claim.
5. Caracas Station and Headquarters have no further
information of Agency association of any of the other
individuals thus far mentioned in connection with the
Cubana crash.

2. I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims I may
have against the Organization or our government which may in any way
necessitate the disclosure of information described herein. I have
been advised that any such claims will receive full legal consideration.
In the event, however, that I am not satisfied with the decisions of the
Organization concerning any present or future claims I may submit, I will
not take any other action to obtain satisfaction without prior written
notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance with such legal
and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.

the Organization I have been given an opportunity to report all informa -
