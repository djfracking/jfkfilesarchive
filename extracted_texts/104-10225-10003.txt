1.
Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category
Evaluation Board Precepts for Your Grade
Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category
for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-
fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STH THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.
il.
2. In general, you should consider the following;
Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between them. Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS.
3.
b.
C.
A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.
A category change should not be initiated for
the period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.
If you believe that this is not the correct category for
: you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category,
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.

4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
Liaison officials join station in extending appreciation
to Joseph Piccolo for his outstanding contribution to the
current task of moulding the KDSLEUTHS into an effective
counterintelligence organization.
Their high degree of enthusiasm was matched only by the
professional way in which they prepared their instruction
material, the ingenuity of their delivery, and above all the
high impact that they had on the students and their superiors.
Wish to complement the above two colleagues for a job
well done and for having upheld in their own respective
fields the high standards and prestige of the Agency in our
eyes and in those of our liaison counterparts.
Request that a copy of this cable be placed in their
respective personnel files.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
:
Career Management Staff
Request for Change of Career Designation
to B/OS-Operational Specialist from B/OG-
Operational Generalist
1. It is requested that my career designation be changed
to B/OS-Operational Specialist from that of B/OG-Operational
Generalist. It is believed that the career activities and
recent events described below clearly meet the criteria set
forth in the Career Service Personnel Evaluation System Hand-
book,
2.
In July 1977, I changed my home base from Latin
America Division to the Counterintelligence Staff. This
change of home base was precipitated by the cancellation of a
planned overseas tour in Latin America which was scheduled to
begin in July 1977. The cancellation of the tour was caused
by State Department objections to my assignment because of
publicity accorded me by Philip Agee and Counterspy Magazine.
3. The following is a career summary noting Operational
Specialist related activities only:

DEC
AM
Mr. Piccolo's 12 perience in LA Division and Cuban operations, his inquisitive
w
instincts, his activist style and his keen analytical skills, superbly qualify him
to serve as the senior CI Staff coordinator for LA Division.. One obvious measure of
his strong, continued effectiveness, is that in any given week he receives more
requests for guidance, CI file reviews, and other forms of CI support, than any of our
other area division coordinators.. On the other hand, because of his in-depth, across
the board knowledge of LA's operational activities, he represents a unique resource
to C/CI when the latter has to respond knowledgeably and rapidly to inquires from the
DDO level on LA related matters. On that score alone, C/CI has commented on his deep
satisfaction with Mr. Piccolo's impressive performance.
During the year, Mr. Piccolo led the team which conducted an in-depth.CI and
Operational Security. Survey of Brasilia Station and its two Bases. The final report
was well received by the Division and the Station, which began implementing certain
of the team's suggested recommendations before its return to Headquarters. As with
other CI survey reports, the Brasilia study was forwarded to the DDO and the OCI for
their information. Mr. Piccolo is one of the more experienced survey officers, having
participated in or led five station survey exercises in AF and LA Divisions.

The operational traffic Mr. Piccolo screens for the "front office" is usually
accompanied by pertinent insights on the significance of the development or event
reported. He has been praised more frequently for his commentaries than any of our
other coordinators, which is another reflection on his intimate familiarity with
the LA operational scene. Numerous examples of his productive and versatile service
to the Division and Staff can be cited but we will note for the sake of brevity only
three to underscore out point. (1) For the past two years he has been the guiding
and principal referent on a joint Agency/FBI proposal which would enable the FBI to
engage in foreign CI operations against the Soviet intelligence services on the
Mexican side of the border. His perseverance, in shepherding the instrument through
its various approval stages in the Agency and the Department of Justice, is finally
paying off with the recent notification that the SCC/CI had informally approved the
agreement. (2) This past summer Mr. Piccolo was temporarily assigned to assist NE
Division as a consultant, because of his Brasilian expertise, in a case involving
a Brazilian walk-in who claimed PLO connections. Ultimately Mr. Piccolo participated
directly in the interrogation assessment process, and was a key factor in finally
persuading the Brazilian to return to Brasil to work in place against the PLO.
Finally (3), he has quite justifiably earned the reputation (per student critiques
and faculty commentary) as one of the most effective instructors on the CI Staff. He
lectures, regularly in the CI and BOC courses, and participates in the Walk-Ins and
Doubled Agent seminars for our military and FBI colleagues.
Again, Mr. Piccolo's performance during this past year, as in previous years,
reflected a sustained superior effort, which, I am convinced, will continue to be
the pattern in the future.
SECTION E REVIEWING COMMENTS (continued)
Rating officer properly highlights Mr. Piccolo's determination and perseverence
in pushing a major joint CIA-FBI program through Washington's often unbelievable.
bureaucracy. A lessor man would have thrown in the towel long ago. Mr. Piccolo,
understanding the importance of this proposal, was determined to "hang in there;
success resulted.
A veteran CI survey officer, Mr. Piccolo headed a team inspecting Brasilia
Station during this year. Perceptive identification of a number of potential
counterintelligence and operational security problems, have induced this Station
to take certain corrective action and its future operational programs will surely
benefit from these.
Major contamination via Philip Agee has severely limited this officer's
ability to serve in his area of specialty, Latin America, Nonetheless, we need
to identify in the not too distant future a challenging overseas assignment that
will take advantage of his impressive operational skills and experience, No is
patently an officer with highly developed on-the-street instincts and, if he is
to achieve his considerable potential, needs additional overseas postings.
In the meantime vo are fortunato indeed to have him on out Staff; he is ona
of our best. 1 unhesitatingly concur in the Rating Officer's letter grados and
narrative comment,

During the period under review Mr. Piccolo was the senior referent
in the Branch for LA Division affairs. In this capacity he functioned
most effectively and efficiently, and fully exploited his more than 17
year's association with LA Division.
With respect to Specific Duties, No's 3 and 5 are pretty much self
explanatory and are the bread-and-butter type activities that provide you
a data base for approaching other responsibilities and keep you au
courant of operational conditions. There is no rating for No. 4 as this
activity this year was handled by O/C/CT.

In terms of Specific Duty No. 1., Mr. Piccolo has had several field
station assignments in LA Division plus several at Headquarters. He
maintains close and continuing contact with country desks and staff offi-
cers and when appropriate has initiated operational comments and sugges-
tions. For example, when reviewing the traffic from an on island Cuban
reporting source he noted indications that the source might be under
hostile control, and sent forward a memorandum outlining these indications
to COG while defering to them for further action. On another

This Fitness Report is one of the most thorough and balanced from a substantive
view which I have reviewed in some time. I find it to be accurate from my perspective
and reflects my own contention that Mr. Piccolo is for his grade one of the most
productive, aggressive and versatile officers we have in the DO.
Earlier this year Mr. Piccolo received a QSI in recognition of his fine performance
on the CI Staff during the previous year. There is no question that a sustained
superior effort on Mr. Piccolo's part will continue to be the pattern in the future.
He has a prosperous career ahead of him.

and outlined to them the reasons he believed the walk-in was a provo-
cation. COG agreed to withold any attempts at operational exploitation
until the walk-in's bona fides were better established. The walk-in
subsequently failed a polygraph on the question was he being directed
at us.
With respect to Duty No. 2, usually focused on the activities of
USAINTA while his colleague focused on those of OȘI. In any event,
each could readily fill in as substitute if the other were absent. The
range of operational initiatives available to us in these cases is, for
the most part, limited and our main in-put is in terms of area knowledge
and operational experience, Nevertheless, Mr. Piccolo did address him-
self to the problem of coverage of controlled U.S.: Person double agents
when travelling overseas and drafted a general consent agreement for
agents to sign permitting us CI coverage of them while abroad. The
suggestion is in the hands of the military services the FBI and Agency
legal authorities and its ultimate fate is not known.
:
In terms of ad hoc assignments Mr. Piccolo has participated in two
CI Operational Surveys, namely Buenos Aires and Bogota. In both instances
he was the team leader. A CI Survey is defined as an in depth review
of a Stations operational activities designed to detect efforts by and
determine the capabilities of foreign intelligence services to carry out
recruitment, penetration, provocation and deception operations and to
evaluate the threat these pose to the Station. The Surveys are time
consuming and taxing, requiring a review of all pertinent Headquarters
files, a visit to the Station to review field files and interview all
operational personnel, and then return to Hqs. to compile a report that
may run as few as fifty pages or more than one hundred. The reports
are addressed to the COS and the DDO, although the DCI has instructed
that he be routinely included on the distribution of each report. Mr.
Piccolo's level of performance is reflected in the fact that Bogota was
his fourth survey.
In another ad hoc activity Mr. Piccolo was responsible for retriev-
ing a proposal regarding joint activities with the FBI in a very sensitive
with the Pol in a very
area from the Bench Mark paper being submitted to the National Security
Council/Special Coordination Committee NSC/SCC) on counterintelligence
programs, and suggesting that it be submitted jointly with the FBI to
appropriate USG authorities. This suggestion is currently being imple-
mented and in so doing has required consultation and meetings with the
FBI from the working level to very senior officers.

Mr. Piccolo is an experienced and professional officer requiring a
minique of supervision. He is aggressive, imaginative and has demonstrated
his initiative. He writes well and is even stronger in his verbal skills.
He can defend his position vigorously and skillfully but is disciplineð
and will accept the final decision if contrary to his own view without
prousing. He has an empaging personality, I would be happy to serve
*ith him again either at His or overseas,

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

/Continued/

L
In addressing the specific duties, Mr. Piccolo has
been engaged during the past year in the exploitation of
a sensitive multi-lead CI Project which has resulted in
a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad.
In the furtherance of this project he supervised, with an
even hand, one intelligence assistant. Mr. Piccolo has
been called upon to support CI activities requiring
extensive travel abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI
objectives. He executed these assignments with a singular
degree of professionalism. Recently he organized and ran
a CI training course for foreign liaison. This required
the preparation of course material in Spanish and person-
ally delivering lectures in the Spanish language. The
Station described this effort as an outstanding contribution
to the current task of molding the liaison service into an
efficient and effective counterintelligence organization.
More recently, based on previous experience and partici-
pation in CI Operational Surveys, he has been designated
to head a CI Survey team going to Latin America. Finally,
during the period of this report, due to the absence of
the Branch Chief, Mr. Piccolo has served well as the Acting
Branch Chief and during his tenure kept work flowing
smoothly, efficiently and without change of pace. To sum
up, Mr. Piccolo is in the opinion of this rater a solid
first class officer whose judgment is totally dependable
and whose accomplishments have been significant. We would
commend Mr. Piccolo for any assignment in field operations
above any of his peers.

Indicațe significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State
suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training Comment on foreign language competence, if required for
current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section C to provide best basis for determining future personnel extion. Manner of performance of

"
Mr. Piccolo is an integral part of the Special Operations Branch
which, in way of explanation, is charged with undertaking certain sensi-
tive operations assigned by Chief, CI; it is also responsible for a
variety of ad hoc requirements not normally found elsewhere in the DDO
which require the handling of off beat but CI related investigations;
and in rendering support to the FBI in its cases abroad. Mr. Piccolo
in the fulfillment of these assorted tasks of the Branch has demon-
strated discretion, tact, flexibility, open mindedness, operational
knowhow and good common sense. He is viewed as a highly experienced,
completely dependable officer, requiring a minimum of supervision. He
does, however, know when to seek guidance and accepts it with good
cheer. His approach to operational problems is based on a solid
appreciation of what is required and is not afraid to express his views
on a problem when necessary, but he will implement a decision once made.
These attributes coupled with his fairness, single minded approach to
his work and dedication, mark him as a professional in the true sense
of the word.

I have known Mr. Piccolo since early this year and have been much
impressed by his professionalism, conscientiousness and capacity for
just plain hard work. He has done everything that we have asked him
to do quickly and well. His work both on the sensitive and productive
CI project mentioned by the rating officer and on several counterintelli
gence surveys has been consistently first-rate. He thinks well and he
writes well. Based on his broad field experience, his language skill
and his deep dedication to the Agency, he would appear to have consider-
able growth potential. He is one of our very best officers. I unhesi

Mr. Piccolo joined the CÏ Staff at his initiative and has served in several
different roles in the period of this report. These included positions as survey
officer in the Area Operations Branch for six months, operations officer in the
Special Operations Branch for three months and then acting chief of that branch for
two months. Overall he has performed his duties in these positions with efficiency
and thoroughness.
During the six month period Mr. Piccolo was assigned to the Area Operations Branch,
his duties consisted of participation in CI operational surveys of two countries,
e.g., Ethiopia and Peru. By way of explanation, CI operational survey is defined
as an in-depth review, both at Headquarters and in the field, of a Station's opera-
tional activities in order to detect efforts by and determine the capabilities of
foreign intelligence services to accomplish recruitments, penetrations, provocations
and deception operations plus an evaluation of the threat these pose to future
operations and assets. The surveys are conducted by a team of two or more operations
officers and their final report may be 100 or more pages in length. The report is
addressed to the DDO and the Area Division Chief and gives them a detailed CI profile
of the Station.

I fully concur with the comments of the supervisor. I have been most pleased
with the manner in which Mr. Piccolo has moved in and taken over the management
of his branch in the absence of the branch chief who departed with little warning.
Mr. Piccolo is a hard-nosed, honest evaluator of CI problems. He has, however,
the ability to manage problems and people with tact and professionalism.

The two countries which Mr. Piccolo helped survey represent widely
varying operational and social environments. In both instances, however,
the Station Chiefs cabled Headquarters at the end of the field aspect of
the survey complimenting the team on the thoroughness and understanding
with which they conducted the survey, and commented on the usefulness and
practicality of the team's recommendations. It should noted that these
cables had considerable impact on DDO management and were used widely in
the extension of the survey program into other areas.
Although Mr. Piccolo's field exposure has been exclusively in the Latin
American area, he has a widely varied operational background, having served
in varying operational capacities in several stations, and he is perceptive
in his understanding of operational realities. His personality is positive
and outgoing, and in most instances he is able to initiate very quickly a
responsive dialogue with fellow officers. He is adaptable in outlook and
reads quickly and with understanding; qualities almost indispensible in an
activity of this kind. Im sum, Mr. Piccolo approached both Surveys with
enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility, completed his written report
(he had a different partner in each case) promptly and accurately. He un-
doubtedly would have been engaged in a third survey except his temporary
tour ended and he was assigned permanently elsewhere in the Staff.
'
In his duties in the Special Operations Branch, Mr. Piccolo, has excelled
in his management responsibilities in the sense of both getting the work
out of his people and in getting along with them. He is on good terms with
all of them. He has shown good CI mentality and a thoroughness which is
essential to good CI work. His dedication to his work is shown by his
punctuality in the morning and his presence in his office well after five
most evenings. His production as operations officer has been steady and
thorough for both of the projects for which he has responsibility. Unfortu-
nately, he experienced a period of ill health following a hectic TDY;
however, he returned to duty at the first opportunity and resumed his duties
with vigor. His versatility was recently demonstrated by his participation
in a joint meeting with representatives of a foreign service over a period
of several days and evenings during which he proved fully effective in
achieving Agency objectives in a liaison and social environment.
The most impressive aspect of Mr. Piccolo's performance and one deserving
special mention in this fitness report is his ability with the written word.
It is fully accurate to say that the survey reports to which he contributed
were much better written than were those of his peers. He has the ability to
describe an operational situation in terms which are at the same time mean-
ingful, concise and easy to read. It is a pleasure to read his material and
to compliment him on this ability in this report.

the activities, personnel and political factors affecting the
hostile opposition as well as problems which confront friendly
liaison services and Agency installations overseas. It is further
expected that you will contribute sound operational planning and
participate actively in decisions reached concerning those
counterintelligence operations assigned to you. You will also
be expected to keep your immediate supervisor fully informed
of all major developments and problems of an operational or

from agents than most Case Officers. His two new recruitments
represent the Station's most promising propects against the
FSLN in the long history of FSLN operations in Nicaragua. It
is suggested that this Officer's contribution of only two
recruitments (at the very end of his tour of duty) could well
be more meaningful and productive than the efforts of a
super-salesman whose acquisitions later prove to be marginal
or useless.
DUTY NO. 2
Subject conducts Station liaison at the working level with
two contacts. His main job is the maintenance of the relation-
ship, an effort handicapped by political considerations which
oblige him to take but never give, to cancel scheduled training,
and to maintain a low profile. Nevertheless, he does manage
to extract information of interest on the terrorist and political
targets, and the relationship does provide him with access to
certain military officers who are being assessed and developed.
Additionally, this Officer shares the task with the COS of
conducting liaison at the policy level, an even more difficult,
and less productive effort. Subject's warm and winning personal-
ity and extensive experience are key factors in his ability to
maintain the relationship at all, which results in clear net
gain to the Organization.
DUTY NO. 3
Subject has done exceedingly well in the development and
cultivation of ERLANK-1 for gradual recruitment as an agent of
influence. PRQ Parts I and II have been submitted, and ERLANK-1
is responding to Subject's overtures of friendship. ERLANK-1
has agreed to a turn-over, and this was accomplished very recently.
DUTY NO.
In this very small Station, the DCOS function is not a
critical one, but when obliged to exercise his authority in this

function, Subject has done very well. More importantly, in
his several stints as ACOS (during COS illness which required
hospitalization and medical consultations out of country),
Subject really shone in his performance. He was obliged to
deal with the most difficult Ambassador ever encountered by
this rater, and represented and protected Station interests
with skill and dignity.
Subject requires little supervision, by virtue of his
thorough knowledge and extensive experience in practically
every aspect of the mechanics of clandestine operations in
Latin America. His avocation is "Administration", in the full
sense of the word, and he administers his work load impeccably.
The assignment just completed was his first command job, and he
has acquired the additional managerial skills necessary for him
to progress in his career. There is no question of his
additional potential, and it is natural to envision him as a
Deputy Chief of Station at a larger Latin American Station,
or, better, as a Chief of Base in his next field assignment.
He is above average in security and cost-consciousness. He
is fluent not only in Spanish, but also in Portuguese, and
more importantly, in human reltions. He can establish rapport
with people at all levels of society.
His personality is a pleasant one. He is low-keyed.
soft-spoken, sincère and methodical and establishes natural
excellent rapport with his co-workers, both subordinate and

He handles a contract agent who, in turn, handles a low
level penetration of the orthodox communist party. This
marginal asset is kept on the payroll at a modicum cost for
the purpose of filling gaps, and for spotting, until better
coverage can be developed. The contract agent, whose
administration is almost identical to that required for a NOC,
also produces information on the extremist target through his
marital connections.
Also handled under Duty No. 1 is a high level member of
a legal political party of socialist persuasion, which has
traditimally demonstrated a propensity for cooperation with
the communists and/or extremists in Nicaragua. This paid agent
produced twenty eight intelligence reports with a Value Quotient.
(VQ) average of 4.07 over this period. This agent, handled
directly, requires and receives close and alert guidance. He
has provided valuable spotting information, which the Case
Officer has followed up, accomplishing the full cycle of assess-
ment, development and successful recruitment of a member of the
communist youth organization, who will be targetted against both,
the communist youth, the orthdox party, and hopefully, into
party
the FSLN (terrorist organization.)
Acting upon a lead from ERHATCHET-2, a former media asset,
this Officer also contacted, assessed, developed and recruited
a student who was formerly with the Revolutionary Students
Front (FER-support arm of the FSLN terrorist organization.)
This asset is being targetted against the FER and FSLN.
Considering the paucity of leads available on the elusive
but important FSLN target, (a Priority 1 Objective of the
Station), these two recent recruitments are judged to be very
significant achievements, attributable to this Officer's
language fluency, sincerity, experience and style, which makes
it all look easier than it really is.
Subject has been criticized in his last two Fitness
Reports for not developing new assets into the key target area
(terrorists). It is important, therefore, to recognize his
efforts and achievements now, as detailed above. He had never
been a strong recruiter, but had always been an above-average
agent handler who could extract more information and services

This is an end of tour report covering the fourteen months in
which this Officer has been under my supervision. Managua Station
has just submitted its first Statement of Accomplishment Goals under
the newly-established MBO reporting system and schedule. Consequently,
this report combines Subject's duties as specified in two previous
LOI's which run from 1 June 1974 to 30 May 1975 and from 1 June 1975
through 31 July 1975. The duties listed are therefore broader than
those to be reflected in the latest LOI now being formulated as a
logical adjunct to the new MBO format and content.
(*) (On specific duties No. 5 and 6, there is so little content
or substance associated with these duties as to make a Letter Rating
meaningless. The Narcotics target in Nicaragua is practically non-
existent and there is no current need for technical operations to
support approved operational activities. The duties are listed only
because they were included in the LOI.)
DUTY NO. 1
Responsible for the operational program against the communist
and extremist target, this officer handles three agents and a
contract agent in a highly proficient manner.

The assessment given above of Mr. Piccolo's performance seems to be well-balanced
and generally fair. His performance as described fits with my knowledge of it. It
should be noted that it is very difficult to establish much of an operational record in
Managua because of the lack of intelligence targets and the low level of community
interest in developmenta in Nicaragua, It is to his credit that Mr. Piccolo was able
to recruit in the only target available--the terrorist FSLN.
Mr. Piccolo is poised and quiet in demeanor. He is a reliable, dependable officer
of good judgment.
I agree with the rater that Mr. Piccolo should be given the opportunity to do some
thing different. A rotational tour to another DDO component would probably be very
helpful to his overall development and motivation at this time. I concur in the overal

NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)
If forced to search for a deficiency in his performance
over the past fourteen months under my supervision, it would
be necessary to point to a weak showing in operational and
representational entertaining. In the former category.
particularly, he could have spent more of his weekend and
night hours with Liaison/Military and other contacts for
developmental purposes. In his regular work hours, however,
which included some nights and weekends, he was more than
gainfully employed in the accomplishment of his assigned
duties. He is not a clock-watcher, but stays with the Liaison,
and agent meetings, as well as with the paperwork until they
are completed.
This Officer is the victim of personnel requirements,
which has resulted in an Organizational failure to challenge
his talents and ingenuity. "His re-assignment to the Cuban
Operations Section next, for example, will be his fifth
assignment in that area in 15 years. It is recommended that
he obtain rotational experience in another geographical or
functional area, to broaden him.

Section C - Naurative Comments (Continued)
Subject's performance is strong in handling the present unilateral sources
directed against the internal domestic target. Specifically, he has a thorough
understanding and knowledge of the Christian Socialist and Communist Parties. Subject,
however, has not made an effort to develop new potential sources.
In summation. it is clear that Subject has the background, experience and
knowledge to perform the tasks in an outstanding manner. Some of these tasks, those
that interest him most, he does very well now, Others, that he has determined are
not of sufficient value or interest, he disregards. Where Subject must take stepe
to improve is in his overall attitude towards work to be accomplished. This being
a very small station can be a handicap to an officer who must work harder to
produce the little intelligence of interest that is available. Subject must spend
more of his free time among the local community in an attempt to expand his contacts,
contacts that could result in the development and recruitment of now sources.
Subject is well liked and accopted by the American Community. He and his
wife entertain well and his good command of the local language makes him a strong
member on this very small team.
Subject keeps excellent records and has done much to improve the records
management of the Station. He is careful with organizational funds and his
bookeeping is consistently up to date.

(The following is directly keyed to Subject's "Letter of Instructions")
As ACOS he has demonstrated a thorough understanding of Agency policies and
regulations. He works well with those he supervises and has exhibited unusual patience
while diligently instructing and correcting employees. During my absences, he has
worked well with Senior members of the Embassy and has been accepted by Embassy and
Station personnel alike as a mature, sensible and experienced officer.
As Liaison Officer for the Station, hohar done an excellent job of improving
the effectiveness of the "Special Unit" by offerring his expertise, imppoving their
physical working conditions and convincing them to expand their horizons. The unit
appears to be responding well to his leadership and should prove more productive
in the future.
His handling of a sensitive unilateral contact in Liaison has resulted in
obtaining what information the contact is willing to disclose. Although categorized
as a ponotration, the oporation is more that of a contact who is willing to provide
inside information to clarify certain situations and events rather than an agressive
penetration seeking all that lies behind the sconos. This is a principal liaison
contact with whom a good working relationship must be maintained and such a relationship
does exist.
He has made very little progress in operations against the Narcotics target. Subject
inherited very little in sources and has not developed any new prospects. (Continued)

:
This sooms to be a fair report which rates Subject about the same
way that I would, based on my understanding of his performance. Subject
is a mature and competent officer who does a fine job of handling existing
operations and administrative tasks but has not been very aggressive in
developmental work. The sleepy tropical atmosphere of Managua may not
be very inspiring operationally, but new business is needed and Subject is 13
believed to be capable of turning in a stronger performance in that area.
He has the potential for further career advancement.

new initiatives during these occasions, after due thought and
consultation, if he thought they were warranted. And he has been
an excellent judge of men (and women) and their quality. In his
dealings with LNFALL, its various LNBUZZ agencies and their
directors he has held up the Base's interests and image well while
seeking fair and practical answers and solutions. He has a good sense
of economy in monetary as well as other affairs. As he becomes
more sénior and more exclusively a supervisor and executive he should
become more and more effective.
Subject is an excellent operational manager and agent
handler who gets the best out of his assets. He is probably not
so strong as an operational starter and developer and this appears
to be due in part to an instinct to avoid exposure and eschew the
glad hand. On the other hand, he has undertaken two rather
difficult developmental operations starting from scratch during
the past six months and has at least proven that he can do this kind
of work when it is necessary. In both these cases he may have
- tried to move too fast in order to reach recruitment point before
his departure but this is understandable. His written work is
well conceived and conscientious and perhaps even somewhat above
average for case officers of his grade and experience. Like most
BKHERALD officers, however, he does not take sufficient pains to
achieve simple, clear, forceful expression with the result that,
while his best efforts are effective his second best is apt to
result in lack of organization and clarity. He should work on this
a suggestion might be that he practice avoiding metaphors and
adopt a straight declarative sentence style.
In conclusion, Subject's performance has been first class
in the most important respects and his relatively minor weaknesses
are not incurable. He should have an excellent futuro as a senior
caso officer and supervisor, particularly if he attacks and cures
these weaknesses. His overall performance in his present tour
has been very strong indeed.

plotting operational strategy (another very strong point),
advising less experienced officers (he demonstrated considerable
talent here) than he is going after new assets. Subject clearly
has the brains, the poise, the empathy and the all-around appeal
to do so. There is no doubt about his being able to devise and
execute sound recruitment scenarios and pitches. He did not, however,
get to the "critical" point during this past year and he understood
the priority which Division and Station management was attaching
to new recruitments. Subject more than earned the promotion to
GS-13 recently accorded. In my judgment he should be given the
opportunity to move quickly to the next higher grade.
In many
aspects of the Base/Station mission he has already demonstrated
to my satisfaction that he has the ability to become a valued
senior officer of our organization. At an appropriate point he
should be a candidate for senior school training.

The rating of Strong is deserved. This is a really fine officer,
very corebral, experienced and skilled in the basic craft of our
business, linguistically talented, toughminded and agrossivo in agont
handling and exploitation. His lack of development/recruitment activity
during the reporting poriod reflects to some degree a deliborato
decision to keep a low profile in the Mission and in the city due to
the particularly sensitive nature of ongoing projects handled. This
still applies to some degree but we all now agree that during tho
remaining months of his tour an effort can be made to exploit this
officer's considerable tulents in the crucial area of creating now
assets. I strongly endorse the recommendation for promotion.

Subject is perhaps the most mature, dependable and competent
case officer we have. He has excelled in the handling of intricato,
sensitive penetration oporations with highest professional
standards are demanded. He carries a very heavy work load lightly
and is a prodigious contributor in both operational and information
reporting. His performance as a supervisor has been characterized
by conscientiousnoss, a good sense of detail, perceptiveness, fairness
and firmness. llo is at his best in practical situations, however
complex and obscuro, rather than in dealing with philosophical or
theoretical problems but this is obviously more a matter of inclination,
than of intellect. Ho is highly respected and appreciated by all his
colleagues and especially by this supervisor,
Subject is under grado for his porformance, experience and
responsibilities. He is of all the Baso officers most deserving of
a. promotion. A separate recommendation to this effect is being
forwarded. -

The COS concurs emphatically with this well-written evaluation.
The subject is vastly under-rated in JKLANCE, perhaps because of his
quiet, unassuming porsonality. But ho is a strong, very strong,
officer. His ability to handle the most difficult detail should not
detract from his overall capabilitios. llo is sound as a rock, and
merits a promotion, which is recommended by the COS.

Spanish, Subject speaks Portuguese well after only a few:
months in Rio de Janeiro.
In short, Subject is a solid, professional officer, with
his eye and his actions always on the target. He maintains
his forward thrust within a framework of prudent judgment,
and is maturely deliberate in deciding to take a risk. That's
the name of the game.
It is requested that Subject's name be placed on the list

In my judgment, the student already has the ability to use the language
effectively in basic, every-day situations. After a matter of months in the
foreign environment he should be able to function effectively in all job-
related situations. Because he was extremely diligent and conscientious, he
would be an excellent candidate for further language training.

This rating officer has worked with Subject on a number of assign-

junior position to his present grade and responsibility due to steady,
solid performance oriented towards operations; i.e. he gets out into the
street to practice what he has learned.
Only a few days before this report Subject was on-the-scene super-
visor of a professionally conducted recruitment attempt. In such opera-
tions his experience against a hard target (PBRUMEN) has been evident.
Subject is a good manager of JKLANCERS, including one on his first
overseas tour, and indigenous agents, including one of considerable
international access. He makes them all work on target. Under his
supervision one of the Station's moderately useful agents has success-
fully been moved into the extremely important terrorist area. Subject
uses imagination in his day-by-day work (and handles Station JMROD
assignments).

LANGUAGE TRAINING DIMS AND EVALUATION APATERIA
The general aim of this course of study was to provide the student with a command of
a foreign language in a skill and at the level set by the sponsoring office. Speaking,
aural comprehension and reading comprehension, as required, were emphasized. Fluency
and accuracy were given equal importance in training and in evaluation of the student.
Cultural matters were covered only incidentally.
This student evaluation is based on (1) Instructor and Linguist observations;
(2) regularly administered oral and written achievement tests; (3) a final comprehen-
sive achievement examination. The achievement rating reflects only performance and
achievement in the course and is conditioned by the length of time the student spent
in training, achievement potential based upon his or her aptitude for language study
and upon motivation, This rating should not be confused with the Proficiency Rating
which is submitted separately on Form 1273, Certification of Language Proficiency.
PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING COUPLE AIND
Overall progress in the crurse is shown as unsatisfactory, marginal, satisfactory,
above average, superior when compared against established standards for such training).

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
ABOVE AVERAGE
This student, with no experience in Portuguese, held his own extremely
well in a class with three other students, all of whom had had previous
training in the language.
He did especially well in pronunciation and soon succeeded unusually
well in eliminating any interference from Spanish. Because of his knowledge
of Spanish, the student's ability to read and understand is greater than
his ability to speak.
His mastery of the course material was very good. His oral use of the
language was generally limited to short sentences. In longer sentences he
Thad a tendency to get lost in mistakes of syntax. He was almost always
aware of his mistakes and would correct them himself, at the completion of
a sentence. He always responded well to correction.

It does not appear that liaison with the representa-

operational matters has been used to its fullest
potential, although it should also be noted that
this responsibility is not purely Subject's.

SECTION C, continued
(when serving as Acting Chief of Station during the COS'
absence on home leave. He has rare ability to see the relevant
and has the courage of his convictions--will argue a point.
Physically slow moving--given to ambling like a tired old
-bear--he can be quite deceiving in an age which seems to
specialize in rapidly moving young men-on-the-go. There is
no wheel spinning about this officer and no sham. He has his
eye on the future and moves along relentlessly in that direction. .
Obstacles bother him but don't deter him. He is in short a
steady, dependable man with forward momentum.
One area in which he could use some improvement is in his
writing. This has been discussed with him. The rating officer
has recommended that he take a course in effective written
English. His writing is at times vague and convoluted.
His fine performance was rewarded in September 1968 with
a much-merited grade promotion so he cannot be recommended for
promotion at this time. It is recommended, however, that
he be given a position with head room to allow for advancement
to higher grade as soon as he is eligible. The rating officer
would be pleased to serve with this officer at any time,
any place.

Deputy Director for Operations
Appointment of Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo,
GS-13, as Deputy Chief of Station,
Managua, Nicaragua
The appointment of Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo, GS-13,
as Deputy Chief of Station, Managua, Nicaragua, effective
on or about 15 September 1973 is recommended. Mr. Piccolo
would be replacing Mr. Ralph G. Seehafer..
2. Mr. Piccolo entered on duty with the Agency in
February 1957. His Agency employment has been exclusively
in the Western Hemisphere Division with field tours in
Mexico City and Managua. He is currently serving in
Rio de Janeiro as Chief of our FI Section. Mr. Piccolo
has a very good command of the Spanish language.

regarding his Agency employment and training, is attached.

on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings'given in Section B to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if
applicable. This officer made excellent progress in working with the
liaison service and was notable in his effort
and direct rather than simply sit back and a
product. His liaison operation is the single most important operation
of Station Managua and it could not have been in pettop hands. His
working relationships with personnel of the liaison service were
based on mutual friendship and respect and that service was assorry
to see him leave as was the Station. He also earned the friendship
and respect of his colleages and cover facility personnel of all
levels and had rare success in his dealings with administrative
personnel of the cover facility, a most uncooperative lot.
It is difficult for the rating officer to stand back and be
flatly objective about this fine employee who is a friend of many
years standing and who impressed the rating officer years ago as
an officer of rare potential. His tour in Managua was cut short
by a personal tragedy (illness and death of a minor dependent)
which set into motion a transfer which could not later be reversed.
Despite the pressures of this tragedy, this employee performed at.
a high level throughout this service in Managua and both he and
his charming, wife proved outstanding examples of "true grit." His
tour in Mañagua proved him once again to be a mature, competent
professional who should be able to advance to high positions in the
organization. ile accepts responsibility_well--acted without hesitation

(This report is being written not by, but after consultation
with, Subject's immediate supervisor, who is temporarily assigned
elsewhere. The writer is one step removed from Immediate super-
vision of Subject and has worked with him only since October 1969.
In what follows, there is no difference of opinion between the
supervisor and the writer, and statements not specifically at-
tributed to one or the other represent the judgment and obser-
vation of both.)
Subject is an experienced officer whose primary field,
on-island agents, is by definition difficult and frustrat-
ing and has recently become more so owing to developments
beyond his control. Despite this situation he has continued
to support successfully the most productive Cuban in-place
FI agent that the Agency has.
The compromise of a major on-island operation during
the reporting period was due not to any deficiency on
Subject's part but rather to a general lack of Agency
control over the operation from its inception.
In any
case, it is to Subject's credit that he wrote a candid
and thorough analysis and damage report on the case (Writer).

Based on 3 months experience in dealing with subject I have found him to be a
thoroughly professional operations officer who shows good judgement and makes
good use of his field experience in carrying out his function as COG's on-islands
case officer. He performs with a minimum of supervision and is most perceptive
in monitoring activities and events related to his area of activity. I believe Mr.
Piccolo has considerable potential for moving up to more important positions.

This young case officer has displayed considerable professionalism
after only a relatively short time in the clandestine operations
field. He is very versatile and resourceful and has shown a high
amount of initiative. He is at his best as an agent handler and has
developed close relationship with the assets entrusted to him. He
has been helped in this by a high degree of fluency in Spanish and
his pleasant personality. His reporting, particularly his calbo
writing still leave room for improvement, but on the whole, this
officer has been one of the mainstays of the PBRUMEN Section during
his tour, which unfortunately has been marred by poor health.

Dispatch HMMT 5685 dated 13 August 1965 form Debs Mexico City
-
" In view of the fact that Subject's recend service Nexico Station
was done while he was on TDY, this Station is not in a position to prepare
a fitness report covering Subject's performance for the period. Since he was
absent from Headquarters, it is felt that he might possibly not be credited
for his fine work unless the Station expresses its views.
1
# Subject plunged into work with the PERUMEN Section immediately upon arrival
and was given a wide variety of assignments ranging from surveillances on a rainy
street at 4:00 a.m. to the preparation of operational reviews. He was given a
number of existing agent assets to handle with a minimum of overlap with the
previous case officer. He performed very well in every instance. He is able,
enthusiastic, and capable of carrying a large work load. His colleagues in the
office and his agents and contacts outside found him a pleasure to work, with.
The only weakness noted during his TDY assignment was in his written work--a
tendency to be unclear but this is something the Station is certain he can
work out satisfactorily and it is not a cerious shortcoming."

This employee has turned in a consistently fine performance once his assigment
to Mexico City. Every going operation assigned to him has shown marked improvement
under his tutelage, most notably the PERUMEN refugee ringing operation which has
finally developed into a highly productive enterprise under the uidance of this officer.
He is handling a sensitive PBRUMEN double agent case in a most professional manner.
His operational reporting, is exemplary and his writing style, once somewhat obtuse, has
shown steady improvement. Despite a relatively short period in the role of field case
officer, he has won the admiration and respect of colleagues and agent assets alike.
He has a winning way with people
He
a reflection of his sincere interest in them.
has a high degree of initiative and drive, is imaginative and resourceful. In operations
he shows a welcome degree of agressiveness. His supervisory ability, except as exercised
indirectly through others, has not yet been sufficiently put to the test to emble the
rating officer to make a determination, but it appears that he already possesses the
essentials of a good supervisor. He has had some health problems in Mexico but in spite
of these has not let up in any way in his work. Indeed, one wonders what he would be
capable of if he were in perfect health given the high level of performance to date.
It is a pleasure for the rating officer to go on record as stating that never
in his 18 plus years with the organization has he had the pleasure of serving with a
more promising young case officer.
It is recommended that he be promoted to GS-11 as soon as eligible.

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL
The reviewing officer concurs in the comments of the rater. I have
observed this officer closely during his tour at the Station. He
has largely overcome a tendency to freewheel somewhat and shows an
increasing willingness to accept guidance from more experienced
officers. Compared with other officers of the same grade at this
Station, it is my belief that his overall performance should be
rated O rather than S.
In the Station's view he is a young officer who should advance
steadily and with more experience should be able to handle a demanding
deep cover assignment.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Significant strengths and weaknesses and their relationship to
overall performance in the Operations Course. This section amplifies
and explains, as necessary, the rating letters given above.
Mr. Piccolo's performance throughout the course seldom deviated
from the "Proficient" level. His strongest showings were frequently in
areas where he used knowledge gained from previous Agency experience
together with his natural ability to get along with people in face-to-face
Isituations. He excelled in agent handling because he made an extra
effort to establish and maintain rapport, was competent in solving
operational miministration and support matters with a minimum of guidance,
and was imaginative in devising cover and in establishing clandest ine
communications. Shortcomings, however, arose in other areas because he
“occasionally relied too much on his ability to improvice, rather than
to spend extra time in analyzing, planning and otherwise preparing for
agent meetings.
Mr. Piccolo casily recognized lends of operational or intelligence
value, and as the course progressed, displayed marked improvement in
his writing of cables, dispatches and reports.
Mr. Piccolo acquired a more than satisfactory knowledge of the
principles and techniques taught during the course.

:
1. Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo entered on duty with the
Agency in February 1957 as a file clerk. He progressed
rapidly from that position to that of Intelligence
Assistant and subsequent acceptance into the Agency
Junior Officer Trainee Program. In addition to
Headquarters assignments he has served as operations
officer in Mexico City Station (1965-1968) and Managua
Station (1968-1969). Since February 1970 he has been
assigned to Brasilia Station, Base Rio de Janeiro, where
he is serving on an extension of tour until June 1973.
He has been in grade CS-12 since September 1968.
2. M.. Piccolo has been consistently evaluated as a
very Strong performer in his current grade and this in
a variety of assignments which have progressed upwards
in responsibility and have included field FI and liaison
responsibilities, Headquarters desk officer and liaison
officer; up to his current assignment as senior officer
in charge of one of the Station's major operational
programs, Communist Party and terrorist operations
including direct handling of the Station's most sensitive
CP agent. He has been evaluated by the Rio de Janeiro
Base Chief as the most mature, dependable and competent
case officer at the Base. He has excelled in the handling
of intricate sensitive penetration operations where the
highest professional standards are demanded. He carries
a very heavy work load lightly and is a prodigious contributor
in both operational and information reporting. His performance
as a supervisor has been characterized by conscientiousness,

The RATING LETTER reflects the over-all performance of the student in the course and is thus a measure of
the extent to which the student possesses the skills and techniques required in the production of finished in-
telligence. The rating is not necessarily arrived at by mathematically averaging the in skills ratings, but
takes into consideration any outstanding strengths or weaknesses that should be reflected in an evaluation of
the performance of the student as a whole. The RATING LETTER is a consensus of the view of the faculty.
REPORT OF OBSERVATIONS, JUDGMENTS AND IMPRESSIONS

Employee returned to duty with the Agency in September 1962 after com-
pleting a tour of military duty. At that time he was assigned to TFW/CL.
Although employee expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he
agreed to perform the duties outlined in Section B. He was called upon to
perform these duties because of the dire need within TFW/CI for someone
with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mail routing-
control and files. Employee was promised an operational assignment as
soon as the systems were established and functioning in an orderly and
efficient manner. Employee has performed his duties exceptionally well
and has established systems for mail routing-control, and files for the
Branch which are functioning well. It is strongly recommended that this
employee be assigned to duties of an operational nature and relieved from
his present duties as soon as possible. Employee has the capability of assuming
more and greater responsibility.

The category checked below is an interpretation of the scores made by the person nare
above on a battery of foreign language aptitude tests. The relationships betweet. test
performance and subsequent training performance of trainees in Agency language training
courses are indicated by the graphs next to the aptitude categories. The graphs to the
left are for women and the graphs to the right are for ren. From these graphs you can read
for each aptitude category the probability that a person in that category will perform
an Agency foreign language training course at an average or better-than-average level.
example, 22 percent of the women who obtain an aptitude rating of "8" can be expected to be
average or better in course performance, while 5 percent of the men with ratings of "g" est
be expected to be average or better in course performance. A man needs on, aptitude rat
of "E" to have about the same expectation of success in language training as a woman with a
rating of "8." At the other end of the scale, 80 percent of either men or women who obtain
aptitude ratings of "2" can be expected to do average or better-than-average work in train-
ing. The differences in relationship are due to differences between men and women inboth
training performance and test scores. On the average women are somewhat higher on both.

better than would be expected from their test scores, just as there will likely be some
whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION. FRIOR FXFFRIENCE WITH
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for langur
training and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of lan-

learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probabl
[success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language se
[the one to be studied or in a different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

His
high evaluation placed on Mr. Piccolo's performance.
current COS has especially commended him on his handling
of a complex current case involving liaison in which
Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an unusual grasp of detail,
excellent judgment, poise under pressure, and extraordinary
stamina. The cos has stated that Mr. Piccolo is already
performing well above the GS-13 level.
3.
Several supervisors have commented on Mr. Piccolo's
quiet unassuming personality which belies the intensity
with which he approaches his work. Underlying the quiet
manner it has been noted that he is tough-minded and
aggressive in his agent handling and exploitation and is
highly experienced and skilled in the basic craft of the.
intelligence business. He is linguistically talented and
can function in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages.
He has had the basic Agency operations courses including
some in technical operations. He is also an intelligent
supervisor with a capability for lighting fires under his
charges when necessary. He is highly respected and
appreciated by all his colleagues and though he maintains
a low-profile he moves easily in his official cover circles.
4. Mr. Piccolo has already proven his ability to
perform at the next highest grade. Most supervisors have
emphasized his potential for assuming ever increasing
responsibilities. He has realized this potential with
each succeeding assignment and particularly in his current
one. He fits both the general and specific criteria for
promotion. He has shown himself in possession of the
requisite qualities of reliability, seriousness of purpose,
imagination, and dedication. He has personally applied the
specifics of his profession in a successful manner and
has demonstrated his ability to supervise and inspire others in
their application as well.
5. Mr. Piccolo's request for a one-year extension of
his current tour has been approved. At the culmination of
that period an appropriate assignment will be arranged for
him commensurate with the Agency's needs, his desires and
the continued furtherance of his career.

During the rating period Mr. Piccolo has been performing tasks that are

Without
exception he has performed each of his assignments expeditiously and thoroughly. In
addition to his normal administrative functions Mr. Piccolo has been acting as a case
officer on certain sensitive and complicated clandestine operals. He has performed
these duties in a superior fashion. It is my unqualified opinion that Mr. Piccolo
should receive at least a two-grade promotion immediately. However it is
recognized that this is contrary to current Agency policy and therefore it is strongly
recommended that he be promoted to the grade of GS-7 immediately. Mr. Piccolo
is intelligent and extremely industrious. He has worked long hours performing a
variety of important tasks. It is my opinion that Mr. Piccolo has the attributes
required of career personnel working in the Foreign Intelligence area and that he
should be permitted to have his career designation changed to Fl. Mr. Piccolo should
also be given the opportunity to receive Agency training so that he might be better
qualified to perform tasks in this area of activity. There is no question that he would
become a professional case officer. The Section C rating has been given after careful
consideration of the rated individual's grade and grade level performance.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current posites. Indicate suggestions mode to employee for improvement of his
work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if eperopriate, his potential for development and for assuming grønter res
sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining
future personnel actions.
Since the previous Fitness Report, employee has been designated as the alternate
to the Station's Records Officer. During periods when the Records Officer has
been on duty elsewhere, this employee has assumed responsibility for the Station's
records establishment and performed his duties in a competent manner. Based on
these considerations, the ratings contained in Sections B, C, and D were determined,
(Note Section D, items 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10.) Employee needs more experience in
the following:
1. The analysis of intelligence material for file categorization (note Section
D. Item 4);
2. Records Management techniques;
3. More experience in the interpretation of data in memoranda preparation
(note Section D, items 7 and 9).
+
His supervisor feels that considerable progress has been made on the points
enumerated above, and as the employee gains experience, these weaknesses
should reconcile themselves. His supervisor will continue to assign him duties
designed to broaden his knowledge and effectiveness in records management. (Cont'

MEMORANDUM FOR: Joseph S. Piccolo
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
: Acknowledgment of Evaluation Board Functional Category
: Evaluation Foard Precepts for Your Grade
1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering likely future assignments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category DOG for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the valuation Board precepts for your grade. This place-
ment is made in order that your performance, growth potential, and
career planning may be judged against officers similarly placed pro-
fessionally. YOU ARE URGED TO STUIT THE PRECEPTS AND CONSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.
2.
In general, you should consider the following;
Categories are sharply defined. Competition
a.
is within categories, not between them. Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS.
b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.
C.
A category change should not be initiated for
the period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.
3. If
If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi -
mates another category or because you have made a permanent changé
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category.
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.
4. Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and return it to your Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to
your Personnel Officer.

1. WISH COMPLIMENT MESSRS. PICCOLO AND SILED ON THEIR
HANDLING OF CI SURVEY AT LIMA. THEY WERE WELL PREPARED IN ADVANCE,
WORKED HARD HERE, AND WERE VERY SELF SUFFICIENT, CAUSING MINIMUM .
DISRUPTION OF STATION ACTIVITES. THEY DUG DEEPLY BUT MADE A GREAT
EFFORT TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE AT ALL TIMES, RATHER THAN JUST PLAIN..
CRITICAL. ONCE WE GUT GOING THE FEELING THAT WE WERE BEING IN-
SPECTED QUICKLY DISAPPEARED AND WAS REPLACED BY ONE OF TEAMWORK.
2. ASIDE FROM PROVIDING HOS WITH OUR CI PROFILE, BENEFITS
ACCRUED TO THE STATION FROM THE SURVEY. IT MOTIVATED A USEFUL SELF-
ANALYSIS BEFORE THE TEAM ARRIVED. THE TEAM'S STUDY OF HOS FILES,
WHICH MOST OF US HAD NEVER READ, UNCOVERED VARIOUS INDICATORS WHICH
GAVE BETTER PERSPECTIVE TO MANY OF OUR CASES. THE INFORMAL FRANK
DISCUSSIONS RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF IDEAS FOR CHASES WHICH HE WILL
MAKE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE TEAM'S FORMAL REPORT, AT
N
WHICH TIME WE WILL COMMENT ON ACTIONS TAKEN AND PLANNED. AND
PROVIDE A FEW IDEAS MHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE SURVEYS.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division
SUBJECT
: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo Completion of Senior
Operations Course #2/76
1. Mr. Piccolo attended the Senior Operations Course from 3 November
to 12 December 1975 (SOC #2/76). Individual student grades and class rankings
have not been used to evaluate student performance. The diverse background of
the students and the nature of the course material used in the SOC preclude
formal testing. This memorandum attests to Mr. Piccolo's satisfactory comple-
tion of the course.
2. During the six weeks of the course, 59% of the time was devoted to
subjects and activities directly related to operations, including 30% devoted
to "hands-on" time with technical equipment and "on-the-street" practice of
tradecraft. 31% of the time was devoted to material broadly categorized as
"ops management," including about 10% on the Soviet and China targets. The
final 10% of the time was, devoted to subjects categorized as "management over-
view and ops. support," which consisted of meetings with DO division and staff
chiefs and visits to labs and other ops support facilities in the Headquarters
The ten officers in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to GS-14
(average grade 12.9), average age was 43.6 (Mr. Piccolo's age is 40). The
class members' average years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average
years of overseas service was 9.2.
area.

}
The six weeks, normally 30 days of instruction time, was shortened
to 28 days by the Thanksgiving Day weekend. Of these 28 days, Mr. Piccolo
spent six days in intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills as
taught in the SAI system. He spent approximately another eight and one-half
days on technical tradecraft (photo, audio, and commo equipment familiarization
and usage) and street tradecraft (surveillance, car toss, dead drop, brush
pass, etc.) including three days intensive practice of these skills in a live
exercise conducted in Richmond. Another five days were spent at Headquarters
meeting with the chiefs of all DO divisions and staffs, and visiting three
operational support laboratories in the metropolitan area. The approximately
eight and one-half remaining days were consumed by a combination of miscel-
lancous operations management subjects, student seminars, and term paper
writing (though the latter was accomplished mostly on the students' own time).
This running of the course was keynoted by remarks by the ADDO, and the
Headquarters week was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDO.

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo
-
Completion of Senior Operations Course #2/76
4. Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-old CS-13/4, was at about the average age
for this class and slightly above average in grade. Although formal grades
are not given to graduates of the SOC, it was the consensus of DTS staff
Instructors involved in SOC #2/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly
rank number one in this particular group. Bringing to the class broad opera-
tional experience and understanding, Mr. Piccolo was an active participant in
the six-day SAI block of instruction and made contributions based on his own
operational past. The tradecraft instructors who conducted the live problem
in Richmond described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft.
One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more
than any of the others, the ability to lead the group." Mr. Piccolo's term
paper on the subject of how a NOC station might be established in Rio de Janeiro
was careful and thorough and was described by the panel as "an excellent overall
plan." To a man of Mr. Piccolo's experience, at least some of the course may
have seemed a little basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always
took part with the same enthusiasm as the more junior members of the class.
5. A copy of this memorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo's official
personnel file.

Base Rio de Janeiro for the last 10 months of my tour in 1972-73 and
present assignment as Deputy Chief of Station Managua, I request assign-
ment to a position which entails supervision of several employees and
requires exercise of managerial skills and judgement. If assigned to
another tour overseas a position as Deputy Chief of Station in a medium
to large size Station would be preferred, If assigned to Readquarters,
I would like to work where an overview of the related operational and
managerial activities can be experienced. If the above assignmentssare
not available, a tour which would

IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYEE AND. HIS PREFERENCE FOR NEXT ASSIGNMENT,
INDICATE YOUR RECOMMENDATION FOR HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT AND TRAINING:
Given his steady, reliable and productive performance, every effort
should be made to accomodate his expressed preferences. There can be no
'doubt that by temperament and experience he would be of greater value to
the Organisation in the field rather than at Headquarters, but a tour at
Headquarters does appear timely now, following the past 5 years in the
field. I do not honestly know how he will perform in Staff work, being a
Field Station activist, but the experience should have a further
broadening effect upon him,

ment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred
to as "your cover facility") effective as of

organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies
of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional member of
that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being
effected at

ing emoluments paid by your cover facility.

duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organi-
zation in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour

assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circum-
stances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control
or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organiza-
tion before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed
above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will
not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your
_ dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request
termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience,
unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization
to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the
regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year
of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty,
you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses
for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from
the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
THROUGH
:
Chief of Station, Mexico City
SUBJECT
: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization
Retirement and Disability System
REFERENCE
: Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965
1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 7 May 1967
2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.
3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your
designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
CS/CS Panel C
SUBJECT
Proposed Nomination for Promotion to GS-10
Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo
I
1. Mr. Piccolo's work since completion of the Career
Training Program has been reflected in a scrios of progress
reports.
2. At this time, in view of his pending transfer and
my own, I should like to recommend him for promotion. His
performanco to date merits it.
3. As I have stated in his fitness reports and in
recommending him for the Career Training Program, Mr. Piccolo
already is a capable operations officer and has unusual potential.
His experience, common sense and flair for operations make him
even now the equal of most officers who are serving in grades
considerably higher than his.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career
Service Panel
SUBJECT
: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.
Joseph S. Piccolo.
1. It is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted
from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960
and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Staff (formerly
Task Force W) on 27 August 1962.
2. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo
was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency
policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-
sidered for GS-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July
1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion
to GS-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order
to comply with his obligation for military service. The recommendation
was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.
Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and
27 August 1962 when he returned to the Agency and began working in
the CI Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.
3. Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI
operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI
Branch. His performance since returning from military service has
been superior in all respects.
4. I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

Dear Joseph,
Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April
through 19 May 1978.
I well recognize the complexities involved in the
comparative evaluation of 560 clerical carcerists
--
a task further complicated by this being only the second
year it has been undertaken. Your deliberations were
vital to the Directorate's determination to bring to this
group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit
system.
Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management. Not
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training
were also extremely helpful.
I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware
of our need for complete, careful and candidly written
appraisals of our employees.
Sincerely,
✓ John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations

Dear Mr. Piccolos
We have reviewed your Agency personnel file in connection
with your military separation which was effective 4 October 1961.
Our interpretation of Comptroller General rulings indicate
that the provisions of Public Law 87-370 would preclude any further
military leave for employees in your category during the calendar
year 1961. However, this is not viewed as erasing your entitlement
to military leave in 1962 for this period of active duty.
Our records reveal that you were granted 3 days military
leave in October 1961 for this tour of active duty, and accordingly,
we believe that you are entitled to an additional 12 days of
paid military leave.
be have enclosed an Application for Leave (Standard Form 71)
for your signature and return to us. we will complete the form
for you and forward it to your office for their approval.

2.
The problem of effective management of the operational records
of the Clandestine Services is one of our most important responsibilities.
In this connection, you have been selected by your Division, and
authorized by the Clandestine Services Records Committee, to act as
Records Officer for your component. Your selection is based on your
professional qualifications to carry out an assignment requiring
experience, judgment, and a knowledge of the objectives of the Clan-
destine Services. A copy of this memorandum will be placed in your
official personnel folder to record your appointment as Records
Officer.
2. You are to act on behalf of your Division or Staff element
in authorizing the destruction of material of no value to the Clandestine
Services in accordance with criteria established for this purpose. You
are empowered to authorize the destruction of documents and index
cards recommended for destruction by other members of your Branch,
and to desensitize KAPOK and RYBAT material which is no longer sensitive
or which has been restricted in error. Your signature will be recognized
by RID as that of an officially appointed Records Officer.
3. At the meeting of 15 March 1960
, you were briefed on
the details of your duties as Records Officer. It is now considered
that you will be able fully to execute your duties as Records Officer
and thus make a real contribution to the CS Records Management Program.

23 February 1978
: Wesley L. Laybourne
A/Chairman, DO Personnel Evaluation Boards
Chief, Career Management Staff
Recommendation for Quality Step Increase
for Joseph S. Piccolo (CI)
1. Mr. Piccolo joined the Agency in 1957 and since then has served
12 years as a field case officer in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil as well
as tours at Headquarters in LA Division and currently on the CI Staff. He
was promoted to GS-13 on 4 February 1973.
2. Mr. Piccolo has performed in a strong to outstanding manner
during the past year as described in his fitness report covering the period
October 1976 to September 1977. He was engaged during this period in a
number of CI projects, including "a sensitive, multi-level project which
has resulted in a neutralization of some Soviet espionage activity abroad, "
He also was called upon to support Cl activities requiring extensive travel
abroad in support of joint Agency and FBI objectives and "he executed these
assignments with a singular degree of professionalism." He recently also
organized and ran in Spanish a CI course for foreign liaison and the Station
involved described the effort "as an outstanding contribution," During the
previous mess report period he participated in two CI surveys in Africa
and Latz America and because of this experience he was recently named
to head another Cl survey to take place in Latin America in the future.
3. This the view of the Fiscal Year 1978 GS-13 DO Personnel
Evaluation Board that Mr. Piccolo has performed in a sustained high
manner which exceeds the normal requirements of his position and that
this sustained high performance promises to continue. He is, therefore,
recommended for a Quality Step Increase.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.
WASHINGTON 25, D. C.
Applicant Information
Sheet No. 1
To all persons¨applying for employment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:
This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed
beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the
conditions stated below:
General Considerations:
1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the
Agency the responsibility:
a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such.intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;
b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national
security;
c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government
•
d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National
Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished
centrally;
e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to
intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct."
7
I

--- Image 104-10225-10003_page_91.jpeg ---
14-00000
}
$
}
The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency
to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res-
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the
investigation of applicants, prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-
consiining process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,
includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and
`availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.
This is called "clearance" of an applicant.
2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware,
perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-
clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of
specific reasons is made to the applicant.
3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,
taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants
are not cleared,
Statement of Understanding
and Agreement
I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-
erations.
I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Draft classification: 1-D.
1953 Present, Georgetown University (School of Foreign Service), Diplomatic &
Consular, grade average: "75".
August 1953 – September 1955, F.B.I., Clerk, 05-4 ($3150.), to attend school full time.
Mr. Piccolo is of medium height and weight, dark hair, and rather quiet, pleasant,
not very talkative and does not give one the impression of being a Ball-of-Fire. Has
no area knowledge. Has had slight knowledge of Spanish of which he is taking at the
present time in school. Claims good health.
Although has had some nervous disorder which were aftereffects of a gland virus, he
had psychiatric consultation for about five months but no treatment. Apparently after
this disease (this virus) he couldn't concentrate on his studies and consulted a
psychiatrist to obviate the situation. Claims no restrictions otherwise. Tentatively
planning to go to law school. Really isn't certain what to do in the future. No 10-9
that he knows of. Several years clerical experience with FBI. Based on past government
alerical experience, believe he is worthy of consideration. Might be possibility for
regular FI/RI job.
Scheduled him for the 08-4 clerk test on 5 June 1956 and gave him forms.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Personnel
SUBJECT:
1
SSS Form 300 for Joseph S. Piccolo
While
1. Forwarded is SSS Form 300 for Mr. Piccolo.
the Director of Selective Service has issued this permit for a
period of two years, the files of this office and the office of the
Director of Selective Service reflect a termination date of his
overseas service of at least December 1960.
2. As we discussed earlier, this termination date has
been set to avoid the possibility of Mr. Piccolo's authorized
absence placing him in a position which might preclude the
necessity of his meeting his military obligation as established
by his local board.

Subject was advised this date that the Agency would request a
directed deferment. He was told the meaning of a "directed deferment'
end advised not to contact his local board and they will not contact him.
He was sent to see Captain Noble in Reserve Affairs Branch. Captain Noble
• was not in and subject was interviewed by Sgt. MacKenzie. I talked to
MacKenzie and stressed the fact that subject should be advised to be sure
to drop out of the National Guard. MacKenzie said that he would have to
request to be put in a standby reserve status. This seems to be a satis
factory arrangement, since we are requesting a directed deferment, the L.B.
will not contact Piccolo.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Personnel
SUBJECT:
Mexico City Clerical Requirements
1. PAD has attempted to locate two suitable candidates for
the WH vacancies who will not be eligible for the draft. Machine
runs were used; as were file referrals, checks with approriste
Administrative and Personnel representatives in Agency components,
and a thorough screening of Tables of Organization. A total of 25
individuals at the GS-5 or lower level were checked out. One
candidate was located, a Mr. William G. Rawls, Clerk, GS-4 with WB.
He has been accepted by the Division for the January requirement.
The January deadline was chosen for him because he will be able to
pass the typing requirement for State integration. We had no
success in finding a candidate for the 1 November deadline. All
of the others were disqualified, largely because of marriage, un-
willingness to accept the assignment.
-
2. Under the circumstances, it is recommended that Mr. Rawls
be processed against the January requirement and that Mr. Josaph
Piccolo, who was originally submitted for the November departure,
be processed for the assignment, and that a directed deferment be
requested for him.

Dear Colonel Wallı
Reference is made to our letter of November 18,
1957, advising you that the Director of Selective Service
had directed that the above-named registrant be classi-
fied in Class IV-F until further notice, under section
1622.60 of the Selective Service Regulations.
Mr. Piccolo has now received 858 Form No. 80
(Standby Reserve Questionnaire). Due to circumstances
beyond his control, Mr. Piccolo is unable to complete
this form, which is enclosed. Please return it to the
local board with the instruction that it not be re-mailed
until such time as the Director withdraws his directed
classification of Mr. Piccolo under the Universal Mili-
tary Training and Service Act, as amended.
For The Director,
