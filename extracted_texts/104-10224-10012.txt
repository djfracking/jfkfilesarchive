Dear Mr. Nelson:
25 JAN 1374
(c) It is a distinct pleasure for me to express my sincere appreciation
to Messrs. Raymond Rocca, William Decker, William Donnelly, John Bogart,
Joseph Flaherty, Lee Wigren, Robert Thomas and Paul Johnson, all members
of your staff, for their outstanding participation and support of our
new "Soviet Intelligence Elective Seminar." This seminar provided an
in-depth examination of the Soviet Intelligence and Security Services
for twelve graduate degree candidates enrolled in the School's new Master's
Degree Program in Strategic Intelligence.
(U) Each Agency participant displayed a thorough knowledge of the subject
interlaced with personal experiences and analyses which made each presen-
tation unique and extremely valuable for the seminar members, In addition
to the participants' formal presentations, they also spent valuable time
informally talking with individual members of the seminar and faculty,
Our students and faculty were enthusiastic in their praise of all aspects
for the program; and they especially appreciated the candid discussions of
the problems Soviet intelligence poses both for the Agency and the Intel-
ligence Community. Please convey to each participant our sincere thanks
for his outstanding presentation and his interest in the School's Graduate
Program.
(U) Your continued cooperation in assisting this School to educate students
whose intelligence capabilities will be an asset to the Services and
Intelligence Community is deeply appreciated,
Sincerely,
W. J. Fus

In August 1976 Mr. Wigren agreed to be responsible for establishing and managing
a counterintelligence production element for the CI Staff. He has continued in
that capacity up to the present time, in addition to serving as the nominal focal
point for one of our more important C defectors. Although he took the publication
assignment with some reservations, he has done an excellent job of sponsoring,
processing and publishing a variety of important counterintelligence documents for

of the widespread respect and admiration for his achievements in this position,
both in the processing of written studies and presentations which he makes based
on his extensive counterintelligence background and knowledge. While he might find
better acceptance with some operational background, there are also special advantages
and strengths which derive from the depth of headquarters staff experience which
constitutes. his career. He is a very cooperative and responsive officer and is now
felt to be the best candidate to take over counterintelligence training for the
Agency, which he will phase in to in the near future.

I endorse the rating officer's comments on Mr. Wigren's performance. One of the
things that has impressed me most during my nine months as Chief of the Counter-
intelligence Staff has been the impact of the publications program on the intel-
ligence community at large. In the CI field, there is nothing in the U.S.
Government comparable to it. With the current intensification of interest in
counterintelligence, it affords the Agency a means of speaking to a wide audience

Mr. Wigren received a well-deserved prometion during this reporting period and
moved in August to become the Staff Publications Officer. He made solid progress in
the early part of the reporting period in making the transition from the narrow
sphere he occupied in the previous Staff organization to the much more varied and
challenging duties of the External Branch. By the time he left that position he
had mastered its peculiar problems and proven his capability to manage its unusual
personnel effectively and productively. He has retained responsibility for exploita-
tion of the most useful asset in that branch and recently conducted the asset on a
series of liaison visits which has resulted in a significant advance of our CI rela-
tions with the services concerned.
-
He has moved vigorously into the function of Publications Officer, which is one
of the most important activities in the Staff. He was selected for this assignment
because of his deep CI experience, writing ability, and his mature judgment in
Cost-
selecting and preparing CI information appropriate to various audiences.
effective influences which he faces by participation in local government are also
applied in his Agency work. He deals confidently with senior officers of the Staff
and other components and gets the best effort out of his subordinates. His present
assignment is tailor-made for him, and he exhibits no significant weakness in per-
forming it.

I concur with the present assessment of Mr. Wigren's performance by
the rating officer. As chief of the External Branch he turned in a
highly satisfactory performance. In his present capacity, Staff
Publications Officer, he is off to an excellent start. I believe the
passage of time will demonstrate that Mr. Wigren's strongest points
never heretofore fully exploited, are in writing and supervising publi-
cations of counterintelligence materials. Already one of the new CI
Staff monthly publications which he initiated some time ago is earning

Mr. Wigren. is doing a quite satisfactory job of running the R&A External Research
Branch. When the Group was reorganized he was almost fully committed to Duty No. 3
above. While maintaining that function at a conamendable level of performance, he
has accepted the assignment of running a new branch which is an amalgamation of
components of several previous R&A branches. Comprising, as it does, the disparate
clements of defector, contract, and staff officers, Mr. Wigren has done a very
good job of assigning work and getting it done by this branch. He gets
with the personnel and seems well-suited to the kind of bread-and-butter research
He gets along well

approach and can be relied on to carry out assignments effectively and on time. His
long experience in CI matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the
Staff are a valuable adjunct to the branch chief function which he now fulfills:
He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have been selected to par-

by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to the
present Staff requirements in terms of methodology and intellectual approach.

I concur with the assessment and evaluation of Mr. Wigren as set forth
in this Fitness Report. He found himself in the midst of a changing
situation and not only has adjusted well but also has made a useful con-
tribution to the reorganization and redirection of the Counterintelligence
Staff. His current assignment requires a good deal of common sense,
understanding of human nature and the ability to devise meaningful projects
for individuals whose expertise and capabilities are quite circumscribed
and limited. Success in that respect is important to the Agency for
reasons not necessarily associated with the value of the product which
emerges from these projects. In his frequent contacts with representatives
of foreign liaison officials, Mr. Wigren has invariably created a favorable

I endorse Mr. Hood's Section D evaluation. I have found Mr. Wigren to be a
very
wary dependable and resourceful individual in undertaking the extensive research
commitments that the staff has undertaken in meeting very heavy obligations of
sensitive liaison exchanges over the past year. Mr. Wigren is above all a gentle-
man in his attitude toward and treatment of others. I would say in the long run
this works to his disadvantage because his contribution and his modesty tend to
be overridden by the pretentions and bluster of others. Mr. Wigren has what has
now: become a most precious commodity to the DDO in counterintelligence and that is
a grasp on many of the aspects of the collegial memory. He is therefore in a
position not oply to contribute useful ideas for new projects, but to correct,
anend, and modify suggestions and courses of action put up by others who do not
have the facts. In other words, this is a man whose continued utility and
accential are considerable in my judgment. 17Jan75/ADC/CIOPS Raymond G. Rocca

Y
In the past six months the compartmented nature of Mr. Wigren's work
has brought him more directly into the DC/CIOPS' cognizance rather than the
Chief of the R&A component as has previously been the case.
1 think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have been winnowed
thoroughly in previous reporting. He is a recognized expert in his topic and as
such he represents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind
of expertise. He can write and he can speak with unusual fluency on his specialty
and in consequence is a key man in the ongoing research and study of sensitive
Soviet intelligence and security organization and operations, particularly pene-
trations and disinformation. This statement is backed up by the production, in
the form of briefing papers, memoranda, and other production, which goes out-
side the Agency. I have found his work to be extremely satisfactory, and more
particularly, it is if he is given the time and specifications which are ingredients
of his meticulous and thoroughgoing approach to his work. Mr. Wigron could
carry on in his specialty at a very high level of competence in any other part of
"the Agency, or for that matter anywhere in Government where there is any interest
in Soviet intelligence and security. I am firm in the view that he merits the overal

During a recent conversation with one of my officers in connection with tho
vinit of Mr. Henry Planko and Mr. Lee Wigren, ft: suddenly dawned on mo that although
I had, at the time, requented both Mr. John Mertz and Monara. Pinnuko and Wigren' to
convey my sincere thanks and good wishes to you which I am sure they did I had not
yet written to you personally in connection with the matter.
Hank and Lee, as we affectionately remember them, proved themselves to be
most worthy ambassadors of your country, as well as your service and I feel convinced
that they left behind them a number of sincere new friends. They are both obviously
experienced officers with a wide and thorough knowledge of their respective fields and
wo found their lectures highly instructive.
Fortunately, circumstances permitted the majority of my senior cfficers to
attend the course in Pretoria and the lucid manner in which Hank and Lee delivered their
lectures, brought us all under a new and deeper awareness of the vital role being played
by the United Statee in the struggle against international communism, and for the very
great need of unity and closer co-operation amongst the peoples of the free world if the
communist onslaught is to be successfully withstood.
Please once again accept my sincere thanks for having made two such able
und experienced officers as Hank and Leo available for the purpose of lecturing to us.
Kindest regards
Sincerely,
H.J. VAN DEN BERGH,
/RVZ
Major-General.

As was noted in the preceding fitness report, Mr. Wigren has a solid and
broad knowledge of the USSR: its history, government, and intelligence services.
He also has a useful working knowledge of Russian, Consequently he serves in
CI/R&A as senior referent on the RIS, against which target most of the group's
work is directed,
as
A key responsibility in R&A is to serve/the Staff's repository and memory
for essential elements of information about the RIS. Mr. Wigren has organized
this abundance of material effectively, has ensured its retrievability, and con-
tinues to update it.
Mr. Wigren consistently shows sound and dispassionate judgment. He does
not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent facts and brings them into
proper focus, He is skeptical without being negative. He accepts tasks and
responsibilities without quibbling, and he carries out these assignments suc-
cessfully without needing further consultation or guidance.
He is a quiet person who keeps a low profile; but when a significant issue
is at stake, he is firm, even tenacious, when persuaded that the facts are on
his side.

Mr. Wigren's responsibilities have broadened during the reporting per-
iod and will continue to grow. In part this change has resulted from the assign-
ment of Mr. Edward Knowles to CI/OPS, but in equal or greater measure it is
the product of Mr. Wigren's demonstrated ability to carry added responsibility
with equanimity and resourcefulness,
Mr. Wigren has a very sound knowledge of the Sovie: Union: its history,
government, intelligence services, etc. He reads widely to keep his knowledge-
current. He maintains an excellent balance between a respect for the impor-
tance of facts and a creative faculty. Recently he has been increasingly con-
cerned with ways to ensure a more regular, orderly flow of essential counter-
intelligence into this office and with restructuring the organization of this in-
formation to make it more readily responsive to our needs. His approach has
been both imaginative and sound.
His work shows a very high level of organizational ability. This is re-
flected in his structuring of a report or speech, in the lucidity of his ex-
pression, and in his grasp of the inter-relatedness of the functions of this
group. He is thoughtful and temperate; he does not jump to conclusions, show

is his first in his present assignment. Consequently a significant
part of his time has been used, during the period of this report, in

nonetheless, has been consistently strong.
He brings to his assignment an excellent background, both academically
and in terms of Agency experience. He shows consistently sound judge-
ment and equanimity, an ability to sort out facts and to reach
decisions on a factual basis. Ho secks and welcomes guidance but is
also fully capable of acting independently within his limits of

Dear Mr. Richardson:
It is a pleasure, to express the appreciation of the
Staff and Faculty of the U. S. Army Intelligence School
for the presentation by Mr. Lee A. Wigren, at Fort Holabird,
on 8 March 1967, to personnel attending Class 67-SO-2 of the
Senior Foreign Officer Intelligence Course. ·
Mr. Wigren's discussion of current trends in Soviet
foreign policy was factual and timely. His examples of
Soviet activity in the foreign policy sphere in Vietnam,
the Middle East and Africa were of definite value to this
class. The talk was highly interesting and was enthusiastic-
ally received.
Thank you for your continued cooperation in our guest
speaker program. Would you please convey to Mr. Wigren
the appreciation of the Staff and Faculty.
Sincerely,
RICHARD S. SMITH
Colonel, AIS

SUBJECT
Notification of lion-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
1.
As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service.
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
If the Head of his
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
to me.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record It appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643. The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case he formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made with-

12 PM 64
Mr. Wigren is a conscientious and capable research officer
with a good grasp of his material and is able pent it
effectively to audiences of widely varied sophistication. Since
his last report, the basic orientation of SR/CI has changed, and is
now directed almost wholly to the creation and exploitation of opera-
tions. The organization thus needs more urgently than ever the
digested operational experience which it is Mr. Wigren's job to
produce. This has made it necessary to apply strict priorities
based on operational need and relevancy, which has been difficult
for Mr. Wigren, who has no direct operational experience. He
has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them
the sort of close and consistent guidance which some of them require
in the face of changing or sudden requirements. He has a tendency
to be over-concerned with organizational and bureaucratic exercise
to the expense of substantive production. Nonetheless, his real
qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used
his staff effectively on an important and complicated project.
He is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.
Mr. Wigren performs his duties with maximum economy.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Mr. Wigren is extremely proficient in handling his section from both the
personnel and managerial standpoints. In addition, he is an expert on Soviet
Intelligence in his own right and lectures on the topic to officials of this
and other governments. He is particularly capable at training new researchers.
In reviewing his file today, I note that the Revieving Official for his
fitness report of a year ago noted his opinion that my ratings of Mr. Wigren at
that time were too high. That opinion was not discussed with me or with
Mr. Wigren. Perhaps the ratings were indeed too high, but I must say that
considering the Fitness Report form and criteria in use at that time and his
performance in relation to that of other officers in this branch and outside it,
I would give him the same ratings today for that period.
The ratings in this current report will appear slightly lower than those
of the last report. This is not entirely due to the different report form.
Mr. Wigren's problems increased in both intensity and complexity during this
period, and I do not feel that he met the increased burden with as much of an
increase in performance as was necessary. This should not at all detract from
my rating of his overall performance, which is still exceptional and only
slightly less than outstanding.

While I quite agree that Mr. Wigren-has done a very fine job, I consider that the
ratings in Section_E-are overly generous. I base this on the fact that I know of no
other highly-competent officer who has received 7 ratings on two-thirds of his specific
duties; and I do not believe that Wigren's performance is better than any other officer's
I know. There is no question in my mind that Wigren's performance in this job has been

As Chief of SR's Research Section on Soviet Intelligence, Mr. Wigren's
performance han continued to be superior in the same manner as described
in Section E of last year's report. In addition to this he has worke
closely with OTR on the revamping of the CI Operations Course. He has
been particularly effective in organizing and leading briefings on the
RI3 given to chiefs and operations officers of foreign intelligence
services during their visits to Washington, and in leading a seminar
designed to assist SR personnel in handling liaison briefings.
His success is carrying out a planned approach to SR's CI research
problema, using personnel who have relatively little substantive
experience, has been especially gratifying.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
--
Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his
work. Give recommendations for his training: Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater re-
sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining
future personnel actions.
Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Soviet Union and,
except for a two year period on a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire
9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another.
His performance for the past year in a job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's
can only be described as superior. He has not only assumed responsibilities
greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with
a minimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which has earned
respect on all sides. Although his analysts have often been relatively
inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and
subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-
bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of
research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-
ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program.
-
Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an
operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of
research and support of operations he is presently performing. I would therefore
recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly
operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should
emphasize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with
other specialists in a "liaison" relation.

OFFICIAL: RECORD ANY SUBSTANTIAL DIFORDINGL 1) F OPINION WITH THE SUPERVISOR, OR ANY OTHER IN
FORMATION. WHICH #ILL LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS REPORT.
I have discussed this report, and his general situation, in considerable detail with
Mr. Vigren. He felt he did not wish to challenge the critical comments of the rating
officers (I had two officers work together in that capabity), but felt that a rating
of 3 under specific duty No.2 did not do him. justice. I think he right on this score
and would raise that rating to a 4. I would say there has been an improvement in Mr.
Wigren's performance within the last year, and I have raised with the Division
Personnel Board the subject of a promotion for him to GS-12. The Board recommended
deferment of his case for a fewmonths.

In view of his relative strengths and weaknesses, Mr. Wigren would seem
better fitted for work requiring studious and methodical application to one or a few
activities or projects, rather than as an across-the-board operations case officer,
either at Headquarters or in the field.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE.
DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.
Most notable among this officer's strong qualities are his intelligence, inquisi-
tiveness, emotional stability and good judgement. Ho comprehends and analyzes situa-
tions and problems readily and in the latter seems very able at finding logical
solutions. Ho expresses himself woll orally and in writing. He is neat in both
personal and work habits. Such weaknesses as Mr. Wigren seems to have lie in the areas
of social relationship and motivation. He is calm and introspective, not gregarious
mor easy to know. Though he is always polite and even tempered he seems at the roots,
perhaps, unduly sensitive to criticism. In his attitude towards and the performance of
his job he seems to do what he likes well, but to let the lessagreeable things slide.

2. For the Reviewing Official (continued).
Mr. Wigren has also asked that it be made a matter of record that, for
a period of three months In. 1956, he was acting chief of the Swedish Doak
and handled these responsibilities effectively. I have agreed to cite the
extent of his responsibilitios. Certainly the routine business of the
desk was kept moving during this period. I have pointed out with respect
to the manner of his performance of his duties that his fitness report is not
an unfavorable one. The factors which have turned this annual fitneso
report into a porsonal crisis for him are the simultaneous deferment of
his hoped-for promotion, and the deferment of an overseas assignment for
him both of which actions naturally reflect on his past performance.
I have pointed out that we have to requiro appreciably better than
average performances from officers we send overseas, that I believe we
have in the Branch at least one bettor qualified candidate for the
overseas assignment in question, and that I am obliged to give the
assignment to the person I feel is best qualified.
diy
'
Perhaps understandably, Mr. Wigren continues to believe that this
report is not a fair reflection of his performance, I have told him
that I can go no further in attempting to explain my judgement and havo
asked that he discuss his situation with the Deputy Division Chief
and/or the Division Chief. He agreed to do so.

Promotion Recommendation for Mr. Lee H. Wigren
.>
In recommending most strongly Mr. Wigren's promotion
from GS-12 to GS-13; I feel it is only necessary to emphasizo
Mr. Wigren's educational background at Yale and Harvard, whore
he received a B.A. and M.A. in History and Russian; his ten
years of work in the Agency on Soviet intelligence in the CI
Staff, FI/D, and SR Division; his ability during the past three
years in SR to superviso a group of over twelve people performing
a varioty of research functions, ranging from major studios to
operational aids, on the RIS; his appreciation of the counter-
intelligence role of the Agency and his furtherance of our
mission in that respect by the high standards of excellence of
his production; and his vigor in assuming and carrying out the
duties of a job formokly hold by a G8-15.
2. Mr. Wigren has been in grade for almost four yours.
He has had responsibilitios and performed duties far above his
grade level for three of those years while dealing with practically
all of the DD/P, other agencies of the government, and foreign
intelligence and security sorvicos. He is an acknowledged oxport
in his field and equalled in it by no one else in the Agency, and
possibly in the government as a whole.
reflected superior performance in every important respect and out-
His fitnose reports havo
standing performance in many ways, with the highest personal char-
acteristics possible, doing a job on a uniquely difficult subject,
while using and training personnel who all too ofton have had
little or no background for their positions.
3.
In my opinion, Mr. Wigren is the most qualified GS-12 in
the Division for promotion to G3-13, and I believe that the
above comments and our four previous promotion recommendations
amply support me.

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job,
A large portion of Mr. Wigren's time is taken up with the processing of field information
reports and the handling of administrative aspects of various FI projects, both of which
he performs efficiently, although he requires supervision to ensure the prompt completion
of project details. In the area of operational support for the field, which includes
providing the station with requirements, with name traces; oporational appraisal and
operational guidance, Mr. Wigren, performs acceptably but occasionally shows a lack of
initiative and originality of ideas such as would be required to raise the rating in
this category. As regards preparation of correspondence for the field, Mr. Wigren here
again performs acceptably, but occasionally shows of a lack of observance and attention
to detail.

MANAGEMENT FOR EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY (MFO).
Student: Lee H. Wigren
Employee No.: 006198
Service Designation: D
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Dates: 12-14 Sept 1977
Office:
DDO/CI
The course is designed especially for people in managerial and
supervisory positions. It is based upon the assumption that the
Agency's ability to promote full utilization of all employees regard-
less of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or age, depends
upon the awareness and behavior of managerial/supervisory personnel.
They have a critical role in making the decisions necessary to climi-
nate real or apparent discrimination and to promote productive work
relations among employees who differ in race, sex, or culture. In
fact managerial awareness and decisions have a great impact on the
recommendations and efforts of BEO, EMP, Upward Mobility and other
employees concerned with compliance and affirmative action.
OBJECTIVES
'
Through lectures, readings, films, group discussion, workshop
exercises, and case studies, each supervisor, at the conclusion of
the course, should be able to:
1) Identify some of the more prominent patterns of dis-
crimination and describe their impact upon supervisory
processes; 2) Have had the opportunity or been able to
critically evaluate his or her own attitudes towards equality
of opportunity: 3) Better contribute to the effective
utilization of all employees by being aware of and sensitive
to several creditable approaches to management behavior and
actions; 4) Explain the historical background which gave
rise to today's Equal Employment Opportunity Programs;
5) Articulate the Agency's progress in Equal Employment
Opportunity Programs; 6) Describe what efforts the Agency
is making to be fair to all employees, including describing
such programs as the Upward Mobility Program, Federal Women's
Program and the Hispanic Program: 7) Be responsive to the
complaint process and know what he or she, as a supervisor,
should do when faced with a complaint from an employer; and
8) Articulate the significance and importance of major
legislation, executive orders and internal CIA policies which
affect the management of quality Opportunity Programs.

contained in the Evaluation Board precepts for your grade. This place-

is within categories, not between them.
Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifying it as B/OS.
A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.
A category change should not be initiated for
the period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow.
If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your job more closely approxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter ip through your command channel
to secure the concurrence of your component of assignment or of your
home base component, as appropriate, to a change of your category.
Previously assigned and acknowledged categories will remain in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgment of change is received by the
Career Management Staff.

Chief, SR/20
1 Promotion Request,
Loc H. WIOREN
'
2 September 1959
'
2.
It is requested that Mr. Higren be promoted to C-1].
2. Mr. Higron received his BA from Yale in 1947, majoring in
history ami Russian language ani area studies, and his MA from Harvard
in 1948 in history. He came on duty with the Soviet Intelligence
Branch of what was then Staff C in March 1951, and stayed with that
branch as a research analyst on Soviet Intelligence until after its
transfer to BP/CE in early 1955, when he transferred to WE Division
in search of a field assignment. Zuch assignment having become
increasingly doubtful by 1957, he transferred to FI/D where he re-
mained until assignment to this Division in April 1959 as Chief of
GR/CE/Research.
3. I might as well admit at the start that I have incan Mr.
Wigren since we were in high school together and I have always been
impressed with his ability, particularly in the research field.
Additionally, be has been in or close to research on Soviet Intelli-
gence for the past 8 years. This, combined with his academic
background in research methodology, history in general and Pussian
history in particular, made him my natural choice for his present
Job although I had never worked directly with him before. In the
past five months, I have had reasca to be happy about my choice.
The main need in BR/CH/Research has been for an established program
of studies which we might expect to be produced in regular order;
this has been a need, to my persoal knowledge, since 1955. Mr.
Wigren has quietly set up such a schedule with realistic target dates,
in in touch with each study at each point during its production, and
shows every indication of meeting his deadlines. He has a long-runge
interect in counter-intelligence, knows what he is doing and why, and
is able to orient his subordinates properly and direct their efforts.
•
4. Although Mr. Wigren has been in grade only a relatively abort
time, since April 1958, I feel that he is doing a difficult job
excellently and that his promotion is justified on the basis of
academic background, Agency experience and current performance.

3 December 1959
:
SUBJECT: Praining program for three Swiss Federal
Felice officers.
1. The Swiss Branch of the Eastern European
Division wishes to express its appreciation to
SR Division for its cooperation and support, in
particular for the personal contribution of four
of its officers, Mr. Lee Wigren, Mr. Joseph Evans,
Mrs. Kay Grady, and Mr. Edward Knowles, during the
recent training program for three Swiss Federal
Police officers.
"
2. Mr. Wigren's, Mr. Evan's, Mrs. Grady's,
and Mr. Knowles's uniformly excellent briefings
on the Soviet Intelligence Services, their legal
and illegal support structures, and their modus
operandi contributed significantly to what we have
reason to believe was a successful training venture.
To this must be added the comments of the Swiss
officers who pointed out that they were most
impressed by the comprehensive and systematic
development of the various themes which Mr. Wigren,
Mr. Evans, Mrs. Grady, and Mr. Knowles presented
and admitted that the briefings added a good deal
to their knowledge of the subject.

Displays consisted of pictures, posters, maps, and, explanatory
material dealing with various tebics such as: The German Army,
Growth of the Japanese Empire, Naziium, etc. Their purpose
was to give a graphic presentation of background information
concerning the war. The dicolay at most Leadquarters also
had maps and news items Wenling with battle areas
5. Compiled and edited daily news sheet, broadcast daily news BUMB-
maries, and wrote articles on current events for camp newspaper.
At my supreation, the news disseminating medis at Camp Pickett,
were expanded by establishment of the news sheet and newg
broadcasts. The news sheet contained late news bulleting,
factual background material, and some editorials. The news
sheet and broadcasts were necessitated by the remoteness of
the camp.
6. Did educational counselling and encouraged enrollments in cor-
respondence courses offered by United States Armed Forces
Institute.
7. Maintained clote cooperation with camp nerepoper staff, Public
Relations Office, the Special Services Office, and the Intelligenc
Officer.
I believe that my work as Non-Commissioned Officer in the Post
rest
Information & Education Office at Camp Pickett, Virginia, from August
1944 to February 1946 would be valuable to the Central Intelligence
Agency.
The job was given to me as a promotion. I received special
training for it at the School for Personnel Services, Washington and
Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. While performing the duties of
this job, I received promotions in rank from Private First Class to
Staff Sergeant. During the closing months of my service, I was in
com lete charge of the office in the absence of any full-time Info &
Education Officer.
As the result of my work, I was invited to attend a conference
of the Info & Education officers and non-commissioned officers of the
Third Service Command at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and to address
that conference on educational and counselling problems. Since my
discharge was in process at that time, I was unable to attend. Upon
discharge, I received a special commendation for my work from Colonel
H.G.Paullin, Commanding Officer of Camp Pickett, and a letter of
recommendation from my superior.
(Copies of these letters, orders, and commendations will be
submitted if necessary.)

C10th Infantry, 7867 Division, Comp Pickett, Va. while there, I con-
ducted orientat lecturis covering world more and beakground
intorial on the raz M-1844)
--
(2) Because of my limited-service status, I was transferred to the
Supply Section, 1816 DCU, at Camp Pickett. I performed the duties of la
Hit Info & Education lecturer lecturing on history and current
evente, maintaining seps and bulletins on battle area, enrolling
and
soldiers in USAFI correspondence courses (Max-July 1944). As a result
of this work, I was promoted to the Post Info & Education Office.
(3) The Post Information & Education Office had to plan, produce, and..
disseminate rur information and non-military education for all troops
permanently stationed at Camp Pickett, and for a hospital on the
grounds. The purpose of that program was to help troops to understand
why and what we were fighting, and to understand their role in that
fight. It was morale building through information,
/
As Non-Commissioned Officer for the Info Education Office, I
performed both administrative and functional duties. I aided in the
development and execution of the policies and content of the education
program, and was in imediate charge of the weekly instructional
program.

Sir:
I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the

carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to
devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make
a career with the Agency."
In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faith-
ful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the
obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essen-
tial to the furtherance of its mission.
'
:
I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue
of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will
be my obligation to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty
as determined by the needs of the Agency, and I have been assured that in
_ order to carry out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this applica-
tion for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured
that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part,
just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my
tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory com-
pletion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compatic
ble insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall

Dear Mr. Wigglesworth:
This will acknowledge receipt of your letter
of 10 February 1951, in behalf of Mr. Lee Wigren,
who has applied for a position with this Agency,
We are seriously considering Mr. Wigren
for employment; however, security clearance neces-
sary for this agency is of such a detailed nature
that considerable time is necessary before the checks
are completed. On the information available to me
I would say that it will take approximately three more
weeks before the necessary checks will have been
completed in Mr. Wigren's case,
Thanking you for your continued interest in
the Central Intelligence Agency, I am

No have just completed a high level, sensitive
conference of considerable importance to both this
Directorato and the Agency. You had the responsi-
bility for virtually every aspect of its organization
and administration. The planning and execution had
to be done with comprehensive attention to detail
without losing sight of our overall objectives.
weeks in advance and, particularly, during the
conference itself you carried out your duties with
energy, skill and competence which have reflected
very croditably upon the Agency. You showed consid-
erable tact and alertness in anticipating problems
before they could ariso. The close and cooperativo
relationship you established with the command and
support personnel at the meeting site, and your
obvious rapport with our various guests, also
contributed to the efficient yet cordial environment
in which the conference was conducted. You faced
demanding and often complex responsibilities, and I
commend you for your excellent performance in meeting
them.

Dear Sir:
k16 Belmont Avenue
Prockton, Pannachusetts
September 11, 1940-
44063
#
I wish to inquire about opening with the Central Intelligence
Agency for a man of qualifications..
I am a graduate of Yale University (A.B., 1947), and have an
M.A. degree from Harvard University (1948). In addition, I have
completed two years of work toward a degree of Ph.D. at Harvard,
My major studies have been in history, government, and related
subjects, with concentration in United States history. Part of my
work at Yale vas done under the wartime Army Specialized Training
Program in Russian area and language studies. The graduate work
which I have done has included research and writing in seminers
as well as clase study.
During World War II, I had approximately two years of admin-
istrative and teaching experience the Information and Education
it
Branch of the Army. After serving a lecturer, I was sent to the
e
School for Personnel Services, Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, Virginis, and was promoted to Administrative Non-
Commissioned officer in the Information and Education Office, Comp
Pickett, Virginia. For one and one-half years in that position, I
aided in the development of an education program for all permanent
personnel at that camp. I was in direct charge of the program of
weekly classes and discussion groups or history and current events.
These clusdes covered such topics as : the progress of the war,
the U.S. and its allies, and information about the enemy. My.
duties included supervising and inspecting classes, training in-
structors, doing research and preparation of class material,
lecturing, planning displays, developing new dissemination media,
and doing educational counselling. This work necessitated close
cooperation with the Intelligence and Security officers of the camp.
I am twenty-six years of age and unmarried. I am a veteran
of World War II, but not a member of any reserve
sho
I should prefer a position involving historical research or
some related field, but would be interested in any opportunity
that might be available. If there should be an opening for which

Chief, Counterintelligence Staff
: Promotion Recommendation for Lee H. Wigren
:
:
1.
I recommend that Lee H. Wigren be promoted from GS-13

now a GS-13, Step 8. He currently occupies a GS-15, Operations

He
-2. Mr. Wigren was born 1 December 1923. He received a
BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and.
an MA degree in History from Harvard University in 1950.
entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 1951.
subsequently attained professional status as an Intelligence
Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as
Intelligence Officer, Area Operations Officer, Biographics
Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe
Division, SE Division, OTR, and since 1968 the Counterintelli-
gence Staff.
3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI
matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects
of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of
SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff.
In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a
broad and deep substantive knowledge of the Soviet intelli-
gence and security organs and their activities which has made
him one of our more knowledgeable and effective CI analysts.
He is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well,
and he has an established reputation within and without CIA
as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counter-
intelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently
professional performance of above-average quality in his vari-
ous CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented
by several letters of appreciation from other US Government
agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly profes-
sional assistance provided them by Mr. Wigren in the counter-
intelligence field.

Mr. Wigren is currently Chief of the External
Research Branch of the CI Research and Analysis Group. le
is performing the duties and responsibilities of this GS-15
position in a satisfactory manner. He manages the complex
activities of six staff officers and nine contract person -
nel associated with this Branch and is responsible for the
several research programs in which they are involved. He
strives to direct and combine the best talents of the person-
nel under his supervision toward the achievement of his
Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal
and career interests of his employees. He is especially effec-
tive in dealing with the several contract personnel (including
former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment.
5.
In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized substantive knowledge
and the ability to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above-
average level since his last promotion clearly merit his
promotion to GS-14 at this time.
