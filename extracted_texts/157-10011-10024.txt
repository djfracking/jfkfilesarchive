Mr. Harvey was given the responsibility of this by Mr.
Bissel and originally it continued as a separate action from
the Castro operation, but Mr. Harvey was also given that
responsibility, and for all intents and purposes they became
wedded.
Mr. Helms was the person who formally approved ZR Rifle
as a project. ZR Rifle had a dual purpose that has not been
clarified by our inquiry. It apparently was in fact used for
the stated purposes, as far as organizational activities went
along, which was to steal codes, and Mr. Helms, when he
approved the project, authorized accounting on certification,
which meant that rather than the usual vouchers supporting
expenditures, that the officer involved would simply certify
that the money had been spent and this would be accepted.
It had a project amount of some dollars, $7500.
$10,000.
some of it to include the salary of an agent, some to include
operating expenses.
So Mr. Helms' main appearance in the approval of ZR Rifle
does not necessarily equate with the date when he became
familiar with the Castro operation.

I think that is probably correct. It
was in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Harvey was given this assignment
by Mr. Eissel. I think Mr. Bissel left in 1962. I am not sure
of the dates, So Mr. Bissel would have known at that time.
But I am not sure after that.
Chairman Church. Helms succeeded Mr. Bissel as chief
of operations?
Mr. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.
Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.
Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the ZR Rifle
operation, which, among other things, was to develop an executive
capability whatever that means. Presumably that means a
capability to conduct an assassination if and when authorized

Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
discussing.
It was not to be put on the record although to be
done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,
but to say that the code stealing was only a cover I think is
probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding
of $7,500 to $10,000?
Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of

Before you do, would you just explain

Would you develop for the Committee that whole relationship?
Mr. Breckinridge.
Robert Maheu used to work for the
FBI and he resigned from the FBI and opened a private investiga-
tive firm here in Washington and CIA used him from time to

didn't do much to earn. He later got involved representing
one of the Greek shipping interests and we were given the
results of some of the information that he obtained from that
where there was a fight between Niarchos and Onassis. We
think he may have had some involvement in another foreign

Mr. Schwarz. I would like to pick up on the discussion
we had.
Chairman Church. Mr. Schwarz has five minutes more, and
we will conclude, and I would like to ask the Committee to stay
on for ten more minutes for an executive session.
Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of
7 criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.
In the middle of the book supplied to us by Mr. Breckinridge
earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumba

Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,
however you would refer to him, who apparently was considered
for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never took place;
is that right?
Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, is it accurate that Q. J. Win operated
in Europe trying to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency.
could use in safecracking operations?

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with
ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was
1(B)
a multi-purpose operation, including stealing codes, and the
development of the capability of what euphemistically is called
executive action.
In your professional judgment, and with your history of
your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that
a major operation, a major intelligence gathering operation of
10 the sort of stealing codes, which. I assume means from other
governments, would be mounted under the direction of a man
about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of
something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,
I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?
12
Does it not suggest to you that stealing codes was in

In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was
one of our major successful intelligence operations.
Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle
which is different than some others, but he had been very
effective at that, and very adventuresome in that category
signals intelligence and a very venturesome idea of that nature.

codes and ciphers, and in the process, you obviously work up
some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is
quite different from the normal life style of most of us.
Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the
past. He was responsible for the Berlin tunnel. And he was
sent down to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the
capability of -- he was given by Mr. Bissel this chore of
carrying on this particular operation as well.
Mr. Schwarz. Had he been the person who had, in
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,
hired an agent for that purpose?

references that an additional assignment was to look into the
possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba.

the facts of that case were that I had had some professional
differences in the organization with Mr. Angleton as to the
way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the
Israeli maccount was handled. I believed that it required a
higher degree of coordination of the other elements of the
Directorate and of the Agency. We had debated this on various
occasions in the past. I did reorganize that staff in 1973 and
took a number of functions away from it. The liaison with the

Chinese Communists subsequently blamed the Chinese Nationalists
and the US for sabotaging the aircraft. The aircraft employee
had fled to Taiwan. We had nothing to do with that incident
and frankly heard about it after it occurred.
In the fall of 1956, a senior Chinese Nationalist official
informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National planned to
assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in
November 156 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of
the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to Phnom Penh to supervise
the attempt. We learned of this after it had happened and we
had nothing to do with it.
