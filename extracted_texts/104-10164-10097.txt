Re:
EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA
(SECRET ARMY OF CUBA
-
USA)
Dear
arther..
My Headquarters advises that the above captioned
faction, which is Miami based, has been sending what
appears to be warning letters to several Canadian establish-
ments, public and private, at home and abroad. We had the
handwriting analyzed and our expert stated that those
letters we do have were all written by the same person.
1..
Recently the EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA (ESC) has
come to our attention again and we are speculating that
it may be tied in with the UNITED REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION
(URO), headed by Orlando Bosch AVILA, and composed of five
anti-Castro Cuban exile (ACE) terrorist groups: ACCION
CUBANA (AC), FRENTE NACIONAL DE LIBERACIÓN CUBANO (FLNC),
MOVIMIENTO NACIONALISTA CUDANO (CNM), BRIGADE 2506, and
THE 17th OF APRIL MOVEMENT.
=
URO came into being in June 1976 and since that
time has claimed responsibility for several terrorist
attacks, 1., the airport bombing in Kingston, Jamaica,
the attempted kidnapping of the Cuban Consul in Merida,
Mexico; and murder of an official of the Cuban Institute |

in the name of Carlos Luis PANIAGUA Mendez. The passport was
obtained and Xeroxed by EMCLIPPER-1 who provided a copy to the

Rican passport in the PENA name, it appears that he entered the
Dominican Republic with the PANÍAGUA passport. The PANIAGUA
passport forwarded herewith shows the following:
;
A. The Department of Migration of Costa Rica issued a
visa on 24 March 1976 for travel to "C.A., Republica
Dominicana" (p.13).
BOSCH departed Costa Rica at Pena Blancas on 26 March
(p. 11) and entered Nicaragua (p. 9).
and
C. The Dominican Consulate in Managua issued a one-trip
visa for the Dominican Republic on 30 March (p.14)..

Orlando BOSCH Avila
According to a reliable source in Santo Domingo,
the Government of the Dominican Republic has decided to
deport Orlando BOSCH Avila as soon as security officials
can locate hin. BOSCH may be deported using a Costa Rican
passport in the name of Pedro Antonio PENA or Carlos Luis.
PANIAGUA Monden. We suspect that the Dominican Government
will insist that BOSCH depart from the Dominican Republic
in the name of PENA since this is how he entered the country.
There is to date no evidence as to what country BOSCH will
be deported.

"Miami Called Base
Of Cuban Terrorists
United Press Internations!
Militant pro- and anti-Castro
Cuban groups in the Miami area are
engaged in terrorist activities both in
and outside the United States, ac-
cording to closed-door testimony be-
¡fore a Senate subcommittee released
yesterday.
L
The testimony came last May be-
fare a Judiciary subcommittee on
Internal security chaired by Sen.
James O. Eastland, D-Miss. It said
'that as many as 50 different Cuban
groups of various shadings have
been operating in Miami at any one
time, many of them engaged in vio-
lent plots involving local actions and
activities in Mexico, Central and
South America and Cuba itself.
Lt. Thomas Lyons, who has been
with the Dade County, Fla., Public
Safety Department for more than
nine years, and Raul J. Diaz of the
Capartment's organized crime, ter.
rorist and security unit, told of ef-
forts to track down terrorist ele-
ments in the greater Miami area.
LYONS SAID MOST Cubans in the
grea are hard-working and industri-
Sas, but some individuals "use Dade
untry as a base for international
terrorism against allied govern-
Monts of Cuba, Cuban shipping,
Communists, purported Communists
and individuals who take a stand

Two weeks ago, the body of under

Giancana was killed by unknown

IT WAS LEARNED yesterday
lawyer for Roselli told the FBI in
1967 that the underworld figure, re-
cruited by the CIA to kill Castro, be-
lieved agents of the Cuban leader
were involved in slaying President
Kennedy.
An FBI "blind memorandum” on
an interview with Edward P. Mor-
gan, Roselli's former lawyer, was in-
cluded in last June's Senate intelll-
gence Committee report on the role..
of the intelligence community in the
Kennedy assassination investigation.
But it did not identify Morgan at the
Interviewee.
Morgan told the FBI, according to
the summary, that Rosell and
another client were called on to par-
ticipate in a government-approved
project aimed at assassinating Cao-
iro. He cald Castro employed "toams
of Individuals who were dispatched to
the United States for the purpose

Plot to Assassinate Kissinger
A reported plot to assassinate Secre-
tary of State Henry A. Kissinger in
Costa Rica six months ago was blocked
by U.S. and Costa Rican authorities
four days before it was to have been
carried out.
We have pieced together the story
from secret testimony before the Sen-
te Internal Security Subcommittee
and from interviews with Cuban exiles
and U.S. Intelligence sources.
A Cuban terrorist named Orlando
Bosch Avila was reported to be gun-
ning for Kissinger. The attempt on Kis-
singer's life was expected, according
to reports, during his visit to Costa
Rica in February.
Shortly before Kissinger's arrival.
Beach slipped into Cost Rica on a false
sport. But the FBI and the Secret
ervice had been alerted. They traced
Josch's moverments and notified Costa
Ricea authorities. Bosch was arrested
nd put in all four days before Klasin-

plot to kill Kissinger apparently
out of his overtures to prove
with Cuban Premier Fidel
astro in 1972. This reportedly upset
and Castro terrorist band, Cuban
ction, which Bosch neaded.
We reported part of the story in 1974
in Miami's Little Havana. He later re-
defected to Cuba where he gave a fas
cinating interview.
"I have known privately since 1972,"
he said about "the plan to assassinate
the U.S. Secretary of State." He said
the plot had taken "certain form" by
1973 and Lad been “actualized” by
1974.
In a reference to our 1974 columns,
he added: “This fact, which, I repeat,
I've known privately, has been corro-
borated by the U.S. journalist Jack An-
derson."
Rivero named Bosch as one of the 18
anti-Castro leaders who had conspired
to kill American and other icåder:
promoting a Cuban-American detente
Bosch had been convicted in 1968 of
shelling a Polish freighter with a ba
zooka while it was moored in Miami.
He jumped federal parole and fled to.
Venezuela in 1974.
Forida's Dade County Public Safety
Department, because of the huge Cu-
ban population in Miami, has excellent
ties throughout Latin America. In
early 1976, the county's terrortst ex

charges that the Republicans find
cushy jobs in the bureaucracy for de-
feated GOP legislators.
Johnson, a forme; Iowa congress

Nixon to head the Veterans Adminis-
tration. But he was forced out of office
when he proved to be a lackluster
leader. So he was shuffled over to the
Commerce Department, where he has
been ensconced as deputy assistant

Terrorist Plot by Rightist Cuban Exiles See
By Joanne Omang
Washington Puso Peresin lervice
CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 19
Venesuelan police have uncovered
what they believe to be wide-ranging
plane by right wing - Cuban exiles to
varry out terrorist attacks in the
United States and sixther: nations,
according to a newspaper report here.
The respected Caracas newspaper
El Nacional said today that the al-
begon terrorist arts by anti-Castro
agents included the killing of Orlando
Latelier, the former Chilean ambassa.
dor to the United States. in Washing.
tan last month, and the bombing
of a Cuban airliner off Barbados Oct.
& The plane crash killed 78 persons.
Venezuelan police have already ar-
rested a Toup of anti-Castro Cubans
including right wing Cuban exile
leader Orlando Rosch, in connection
with the Cuhan plane crash. At least
14 persons have been arrested by Ven-
ezuelan erity agents and about 30
other Cuban refugees- called-in for
questioning, according to United
Press international.
In Washington, sources rinse in the
investigation of the bombing death of
former Ambassador Leter have said
that Bosch is wanted for questioning.
Bosch is not, however, regarded at
this time as a target of the Letelice
investigation, the sources said.
1 Nacional said that the rightest
Cuban terrorist plans were discovered
in a raid on a private home in Caracas
during the investigation of the Cuban
plane crash. The reported terrorist
acts were planned to take place in the
United States.. Venezuela, Trinidad.
and Tobago. Barbados, Guyana, Pan-
ama and Colombia, the newspaper_
said. Past acts related to these plans
included the bombing of Guyana's
consulate in Trinidad and Tobago, ac-
cording to the newspaper account.
The wide-ranging terrorist plans re-
ported by El Nacional today were the
latest development in a broad investi-
gation in several nations of the Lete-
Hier killing. the Cuban plane crash
and other incidents.
Letelier, a former ambassador to
Washington. foreign minister and min-
ister of defense in the government of
the late Chilean President Salvador
Allende, died Sept. 21 when a bomb
exploded beneath his car as he drove
along Washington's Embassy Row.
In Washington, sources close to the
Letelier investigation said Tuesday
that they expect Bosch to be returned
to the United States and to be ques;
teaned about Letelier's death. A State
Department source said the United
States is urging Venezuela to return
him informally as an undesirable al
len rather than to go through formal
extradition procedures.

The Caracas newspaper El Nacional
has previously reported that Cuban
exiles arrested in Caracas have impli-
ented two brothers-identified only as

EXAMPLE OF THIS CONNECTION, MARTINEZ SAID, IS A 2 OCTOBER ARTICLE
WHICH APPEARED IN THE CAPRILES PAPER "EL "MUNDO" WHICH DESCRIBES AN
EARLIER UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A CUBANA FLIGHT OUT OF BARBADOS AND,
WHILE DEPLORING SUCH ACTS, SAYS THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT STARTED
THEN. THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE, AND ABOUT
WHICH THE CUBANS KNOW NOTHING, IS BELIEVED TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT
MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE CASE OF THE 6 OCTOBER DISASTER. THE CUBANS,
THEREFORE, BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR MAY WELL HAVE HAD PRIOR KNOW-
LEDGE OF THE ATTACK ON THE CUBANA AIRLINER. (FIELD COMMENT: FOR
AN EARLIER REPORT ON CUBAN CONCERN ABOUT ARTICLES APPEARING IN "EL
