Guillermo ARASTAGUIA, pseudonym "Rene," is the chief of the
Department of Technical Operational Support (MI) in the
Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence DGI). He was formerly the secretary of
Ramiro VALDES in the Departamento de Seguridad del Estado
(Department of State Security DSE), but ARASTAGUIA was a
follower of Anibai ESCALANTE and because of a problem
concerning ESCALANTE and because ARASTAGUIA was believed to
be a homosexual, VALDES transferred him to the DGI. ARASTAGUIA

of the DGI and has traveled to Moscow three times.
