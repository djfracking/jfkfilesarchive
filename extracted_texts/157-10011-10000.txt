OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover. The memo
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board. The problem seemed to
be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency) is assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself at pages_00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence-agents
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and #gotiating for British help inga
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. The British want to
know how serious are you? before risking their assets to help the U.S.

OCCURRENCE: Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense.'
# 1 The pressure led to several
"very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pigr
and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. After-
wards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries
including an attempt to stop the sale by theLeyland Birs
Cubar. SOURCE

(stopage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing
"lubzol," a corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil through commercial

Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least
create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve
CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate-which-will-permit provocative
actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate

In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development
of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables
produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of
actions." (00107)
The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside_Cuba

resistence. It was also noted that in support of State's efforts, CIA has conducted pro-
paganda operations including a number of mass demonstrations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chiley Columbia, Costa Rica Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

meeting of foreign ministers which opened January 22, 1962. The object was to get wide
Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the
rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations in
Latin America generated by CIA and a psychological campaign assisted by USIA." The major
task_of_the_diplomatic capability was to encourage Latin American leaders to develop
independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the
Cuban people against the Communist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on
Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake
the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which
Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane
fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted.→

the President wishes to have a large number." Mr. HARVEY "gave a rundown on
progress to date with agent teams and in the general field of intelligence.'
He said, "that three agent teams have been infiltrated." "A significant develop-

dispatched on purely intelligence-gathering missions." HARVEY also reported
on two attempts made to intrude into Havana TV programs.

Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the

OCCURRENCE:
It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the
interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico, where
she can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin
American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the
original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food.
This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against
the_unarmed_people_of_Cardenas. "The-Cuban-source-to-story need not await your determina-
tion of the true cause of the Cardenas demonstration."

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply
proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire
situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the
Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-
tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired
about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt
against him." Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities
by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of
July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-
ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed. Looking into proposal to subsidize
Japanese purchases of Dominican sugars so that the Japanese could divert these purchases
from Cuba. McCone said that his experts had informed him that from a legal point of view,
CIA could use unvouchered funds to support an operation of this kind. He cautioned,

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty
thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father
Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that
-the-current-thinking-contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order of 3,000." Mr. Barnes.
replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.
