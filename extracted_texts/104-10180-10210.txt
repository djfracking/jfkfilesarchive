NONOFFICIAL COVER REQUEST
FOR INDIVIDUAL
To insure the most effective application of nonofficial cover, it is
essential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Central
Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning. As soon as it has been
determined that an agent is to be placed under nonofficial cover, either
in the United States or abroad, a meeting with a representative of
Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of
an agent for a nonofficial cover assignment is contemplated, Central
Cover Staff facilities are available to facilitate "clean" recruitments and
protect the agent against identification with CIA during the integration
period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should
result in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover
´Staff, Nonofficial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122.
Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require-
ment memorandum signed by or for the operating division chief should
be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It is specifically requested that a
headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated
to deal with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-
official cover, including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-
orandum, in order that this development may proceed on a completely
objective basis. This memorandum may be keyed to the paragraphs
numbered below to obviate repetition.
No commitments will be made with any cover organization until
Central Cover Staff has been advised by memorandum that the proposed
cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred
in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD/P. Such memoranda
are to be signed by or for the division chief. Each agent proposed for
a nonofficial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a
designee of Chief, Central Cover Staff, for assessment as to his suit-
ability for the proposed cover. This interview, when required, will be
requested by Central Cover Staff.
At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and
discussions between representatives of Central Cover Staff and the cover
organization, two formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:
a. The first, a "Letter of Cover Instructions" addressed to the agent
will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly
the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected
of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover fa-
cility. Each item in the instructions will be discussed with the
agent and/or his case officer by the Central Cover Staff case officer,
after which the agent will be required to acknowledge the receipt
of these instructions. The branch chief concerned will also be

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/3
FROM
:
Chief, WH/3/Venezuela
SUBJECT
18 August 1967
Assignment of Emilio Rodrigues
1. I wish to make it clear that I do not oppose
the assignment of Rodrigues per se to Venezuela, but I
do have some reservations on what he is going to be
doing. Cos, Caracas intends to use him as the case
COS,
officer for the CIHAVOC and CITILT Projects. Since both
are basically CE/CI projects I think this is a great
mistake. The amount of research in these projects
necessarily requires a great amount of files research
which Rodrigues in his cover situation will not be
able to do. This will entail a greater amount of work
for the inside case officer, defeating the purpose for
which Rodrigues was originally considered; freeing the
inside case officer for developmental work.
2. The intoduction of Rodrigues into the CIHAVOC
Case will also intoduce one more step through which most
of the vital information that CIHAVOC-2 produces must
pass. For example, his info now goes through CIHAVOC-1
to the case officer. With the addition of Rodrigues
one more time consuming step will be added.
3. I am also of the firm opinion that different
case officers should be used for these operations
since both are penetrations of the same party and at
times produce similar info. In addition, both are
extremely sensitive and the compromise of one could
possibly lead to the compromise of the other.
4.
If Rodrigues was assigned to Caracas for the
handling of a sensitive case which exposure would be
embarrassing to the United States, such as a high level
political penetration or a sensitive Soviet/Satellite
Case then it would be well justified. However, I feel
that his assignment as an outside case officer for
these two activities is not since they could be better
handled and serviced from the inside.

5. Has agent any past connection with or has his intelligence status
been identified to OSS, SSU, CIG, G-2, A-2, CIC, ONI or any for-
eign intelligence, police or security service? Is any such con-
nection known outside CIA and the service involved?
6. Any other factors, such as family problems, which might have
bearing upon the personal security of the agent or his ability to
live his cover.
7. Has agent ever given CIA, Miss Violet Pitts, or "2430 E Street"
or other potentially compromising reference for credit or other
purposes? If so, where and approximately when? Cite any other
instances of employment of cover for credit or other purposes
not already cited above. Include specifically use of Agency-
provided cover units or facilities.
8. After the currently proposed tour, do present plans for this agent
contemplate (a) continuation in a nonofficial cover status; (b)
transfer to an official cover status; (c) assignment to headquar-
ters or (d) termination? It must be recognized that protection
of certain nonofficial cover facilities precludes early assignment
to a more compromising cover status after completion of the non-
official cover tour.
9. If this request is for interim cover, what are foreseeable plans
for eventual, more permanent cover?
10. Identity, relationship, degree of knowledgeability, and address of
person designated to Chief, Benefits and Counseling Branch,
Office of Personnel for contact in the event of an emergency situ-
ation involving agent, as prescribed by HR 20–46.
11
Government or Agency-affiliated beneficial plans in which agent
participates (WAEPA, GEHA, Federal Employees Group Life In-
surance, Association Benefit Plan, etc.) and other personal in-
surance held, together with identity and location of beneficiaries
and whether or not each beneficiary is witting of agent's CIA
affiliation.
12. Agent's Selective Service, military or naval reserve status, includ-
ing current unit attachment.
13. Clearance status o: agent, spouse, and other adult dependents
who will accompany agent overseas. Are spouse and adult de-
pendents knowledgeable of agent's CIA connection? His Govern-
ment connection? Has agent been polygraphed?
3. OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
1. Type of Operation
The general type of operation involved, le., CA, FI, COMMO,
Logistics, etc., and the expected duration of assignment. The
sensitivity of the operation should be indicated-e.g., observation,
spotting and reporting only; case officer for established agents;
!
:
-
recruitment of new agents; penetration operation-and a state-
ment should be included as to the identities of any individuals
and organizations, in the U.S. or abroad (other than CIA staff
personnel, cover facility officials, and those listed under 2(C)
(4) above), who are or will be made witting of agent's CIA or
U.S. Government affiliation while he is under this nonofficial cover.
2. Location
The city in which the agent is to reside should be specifically
stated and alternates in order of preference should be given
3. Indicate localities outside of agent's permanent location which
agent should be free to visit and state the frequency and duration
of such visits. Also it is important to know whether or not the
time and intervals of such meetings will be determined by the
agent or dictated by influences or circumstances beyond his con.
trol.
4. Special groups agent should be able to contact
It is sometimes possible to relate a cover to a particular group
in the operational area, i.e., social, cultural, political, commercial.
If this is considered an important factor in the cover, this aspect
of the requirement should be explained in detail.
5. Approximate annual income which agent must be able to at.
tribute to the cover organization. Sound cover, of course, re-
quires overt (cover) explanation for a reasonable approximation
of the sum actually to be available to the agent through Agency
salary and allowances. However, a professional intelligence
agent's qualifications frequently cannot plausibly command an
ostensible income from commercial or other lay sources nearly
approaching his Agency income. Firm understanding should be
had relative to the agent's living within his cover income. Reser-
vation of a portion of his Agency remuneration may be required.
A less desirable alternative is the provision of additional cover
for income.
6. Estimate of the minimum number of hours per week which the
agent must devote to operational duties.
7. Communications channels desired
In rare instances it may be possible to set up SW means of com-
munication through the cover facility. If this is desired, the
justification and frequency of such communication facilities
should be indicated.
8. Cover Suggestions
Any specific cover suggestion or preferences expressed either
by the agent or the operating division emphasizing the agent's
special suitability to the cover suggested and or the special ad-
vantages of the cover vis-a-vis the target.

Summary of branch and/or field recommendations; specific operational
task performed by individual; views re long and/ or ringe utilicy
of individual for Branch area and overall Division needs
1. It is recommended that Peter J. Digervous, a Type A Contruct
Agent with Career Agent status, be promoted from his present trade
GS-13 step 2 level to the grade (equivalche) of CS-14 step 1.
2. During the period 1 December 1965 through 25 February 1967
Digorvenɔ is served as an operations offices in the Fi Branch at the
Michi Station. His performance during this period has been obscend-
ing. This primary duty, and the one in which his performance has beca
exceptionally competent, was as the principal number of the so-called
"operational flying squad" of the Station, i.c., he traveled, alona
ou with another officer, to various creas of the world yo approach
Cuban target personalities for recruitment purposes; to debrief newly
recruited agents or resident agents traveling abroad; to train newly
recruited agents or more senior agents; to serve as a consulcune and
advisor on Cuban affairs for stations or buses which did not possess
an officed imowledgeable regarding Cuban operations; to aid such
Stations in conducting operations, to confer with and, where desired
by the local Station, to advise or assist local liaison solvices in
the conduct of Cuban operations.
3. Only an officer with the highest qualifications makes a fully
effective "flying squad" member. Ilo must be that in Cuban Spanish;
he must have crea knowledge in depth concerning Cuba, including the
lutout internal developments. He must have a personality which enables
hila to induce officials--on occasion very senior officials to colla-
borete with the U.S. Government while serving dusido Cuba despico the
serious personal risks involved. He must be able to train agents in

ability to handle this very complex and difficult job in a consistently

Station cauagement and commendations from several other field stations.
He has turned in an exceptionally competent performance in every opera-

must be regarded as one of the two or three top officers, regardless of

During the period June 1960-May 1965 DIGERVEKO acquired considerable
FI operational experience, beginning with approximately 18 months in a
hostile, Lenici Area atmosphere. He is a most conscientious officer,
absorbed by and dedicated to his work. He is resourceful, constructive,
• capable and requires a minimum of supervision. He has growth potential
as an operations officer and can handle FI, CI and CA cases with equal
competence. His appearance is more typically Latin American than native
United States which enhances his usefulness in Latin American and some
Europetal posts. Ile would be most effective in docp cover commercial
assignments where his business experience and fluent Spanish can be
used with maximum effectiveness.
During the period May 1965 through December 1966, DIGERVELO has
turned in an unusually strong performance. For detailed information
concerning his performance see attached current Fitness Report.
In case of "New Hire" include a personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of Division
personnel who have interview him; give account of his performance in

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
1.
The cover for Peter J. Di Gerveno was discussed by Robert S.
Hunkeler, Chester B. Dagnillo and the undersigned on 7 and 9 November
1967. The purpose of the conversations was to determine the most
suitable cover to be used under the broad umbrella offered by
Hunkeler's various enterprises.
2.
The following conclusions were reached:
3. That Di Gerveno will come to Caracas as the
representative for some of Hunkeler's sales lines.
Specifically he will be the representative for IDENTITY-1,
which is Hunkeler's marketing firm.

Subject's linguistic ability (bi-lingual Spanish-English) and
his logical, orderly approach to his work are particularly effective
alems with respect to clandestine communications. Not only is he fully
qualified to instruer agents an SW and OWVL (including the use of numerical
and literal ciphers), but the clandestine messages he prepares himself
are notable for meaty content, unambiguous style and concise format; other
officers less fluent in Spanish frequently consult him concerning their
own OWVL or SW messages.
Although Subject is a career agent, he has functioned in a staff
capacity during most of his tour at this Station. Lacking experience
with internal procedures at the beginning, he is today fully familiar with
operational administration and support matters, and his files (operational,
administrative and production) are among the best and most complete in the
Branch. He is by nature a gregarious person but is also self-sufficient
to an advanced degree and likes to work on his own; left to his own
devices, he may spend undue time on routine detail which could be handled
by his secretary or one of the Branch IAS but this characteristic has been

Subject's performance merits an exceptionally strong evaluation when
rated against the standards expected of staff officers in his grade,

terms of personal character and professional talent, he is a fine officer,
dedicated to the work of this organization, and it has been a distinct
pleasure to have served with him.

COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL
The Chief of Station has chosen to review this report
in order to underline the very high opinion held by the
Station concerning the performance of this officer. The
excellent educational background, intense devotion to duty,
courage, imaginative approach to operations, agent-handling
ability, and his tradecraft skills have been noted in other
reports and need not be repeated here. However, the reviewer
wishes to note that during the reporting period, faced with
a number of new operational challanges and a sizeable amount
of independent work in areas far removed from the Station
location, Subject has turned in an unusually strong performance,
In his handling of several important and sensitive agents
being mounted into a denied area Subject demonstrated
exceptional attention to detail, a line knowledge of tradecraft,
and unusual good judgment in a number of difficult operational
situations. Thus, the reviewer fully concurs with the narrative
comments and the performance evaluations of the rating officer.

He was
recontacted in the spring of 1965 and employed as an independent con-
tracter by the then COS, JMWAVE, who expressed the hope that this

areas during the two year period of HUNKELER's contract status with us.

initiative, branch offices in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic and
again volunteered them for possible use as cover.
Station Caracas has shown some interest in taking advantage of the offer
According to HUNKELER
There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during
the past two years. Such use in the future is an open question depend-
ing in part on whether WOFACT has a requirement for cover facilities
such as this, and in part on the nature of our relationship with HUNKELER.
b. HUNKELER has met frequently with members of the Central
and Latin American consular community in the Miami area.
iations were enhanced by HUNKELER's activity and participation in
These assoc-
several international organizations concerned with business and social
relations among Latin and North American countries. Some operational
information was gathered about these persons, but none of them ever
shaped up as a valid intelligence target worthy of further development
and recruitment. It is not expected that this target area will be of
any more interest in the future than it is now.
1
C. HUNKELER has a large number of business associates through-
out Latin America and in his travels has contacted a number of government
officials up to the presidential level. Most of these contacts have
been of a business nature. One of them, a Panamanian legislator, is of
some interest to the Panama Station. Interest in the others has been
minimal. Future prospects remain open, but must be considered as long
range.
d. There has been no use made of HUNKELER as a third party
recruiter and agent handler during his two year tenure. He has de-
clared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks,
but the Station has found it more advantageous and efficient to use
inside personnel for this. It is highly unlikely that station policy
will change in this regard.
4. HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this period.
On these occasions he was given an intelligence brief and his operation-
al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT. The results, in terms of dissemine
ated reports, have generally been negative.
5. Recently, HUNKELER provided an introduction to some individuals
who have a potential for use in the JMUNION program, There was some
discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but it
was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise in his contri-
bution to merit retaining him for this purpose alone. It can be ex-
pected, however, that he might, in the future, assist in entree to
other persons of JMUNION interest.
6. Station JMWAVE is of the opinion that employment of Robert S.
HUNKELER has not had the results that were hoped for when the contract-
ual relationship was first established. Recognition of this was implici
in the renegotiation of his salary scale from $4800 to $3600 per annum
in March 1966 at the end of his first year's contract. It is also the
opinion of this Station that there is little likelihood of improvement
in the near future although it is recognized that a long range potential
exists. These statements are made without prejudice to Robert S.
HUNKELER, who has at all times taken a responsible, willing and coop-
erative attitude in his relationships with Station representatives, and
discussions of tasks and the prospects of future employment. It should
be noted that HUNKELER wants very much to retain some form of relation-
ship with the organization, as much for reasons of interest in the
intelligence profession as for income he might derive.

of these tasks;

Background:
1.
'
Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he
met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions
concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.
It was between the period following his resignation, and
before his first contract with the Station, that the COS
told Hunkeler that he was in a "cooling off period" during
which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the
settlement of his personal affairsand the development of
his own business interests.
Hunkeler was also told that
his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased
if he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOKE in
order that Hunkeler may be available at a later date for
KUBARK assignments. The COS did not, however, make any
commitments to Hunkeler.
Developments:
2.
During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation
he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,
Florida, and established his company, Identity A, in the
WAVE area.

Review of Accomplishments:
5.
Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to
travel anywhere at anytime for any KUBARK assignment, he
was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized
if he were to take operational assignments involving any
degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept in a
vacuum" as regards his being able to serve field Stations
which have not to this date been made aware of his availability
to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes
to a country and the field Station is advised of his presence
in the area.
6.
From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop-
ments in the WAVE area and he began to work in organizations
which would permit him to penetrate the diplomatic community

and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of
being able to spot and assess Latin American political
leaders. Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy
making position in the Identity B, he was elected to
the position of President of Identity C, appointed to
the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to
the position of President of Identity E, and became a
delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and
in PBPRIME) of the Identity F.
7.
It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin
American oriented commercial activities and his organizational
activities that he was able to provide timely and valuable
reports on the Dominican crisis, establish a personal
relationship with Identity G and persons close to him,
spot and access several Panamanian targets, and report
on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an
organization which provides commercial policy to the President
of Panama. (See
) Hunkeler kept the Station
up to date on the personalities and activities of the Consular
Corp in the WAVE area, and has furnished assessments and
biographic information on 12 members of this group.

Future Potentials:
110
When Hunkelers contract was about to expire in
February, 1966, he met with a Station Officer and advised
that he was fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00
to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which
were evident at that time. Moreover, Hunkeler volunterily
ceased requesting reimbursement for operational expenses
choosing to use his KUBARK income for entertainment expenses
which oftimes have operational value to KUBARK. Although he
has expressed his strong desire to continue his KUBARK
relationship under a renewal of his present contract for
$300.00 a month, he has advised that he does not care to
renew his contract for a figure of less than $300.00 a month.

(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office
in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not
yet been time to query Station Santo Domingo as to whether or
not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilities.
(Hunkeler is presently phasing out of much organizational
work in the WAVE area in order to devote more time to the
chore of setting up his operations in Santo Domingo and
Venezuela where both of his companies are currently doing
business.)
10.
There are several aspects of Hunkelers present business
activities which have not yet been finalized: He will soon
terminate his lease at his present address and has not yet
decided where to re-locate his offices; he is still in
negotiations with an investment group in Haiti and may
undertake a consultant type survey there which would provide
access to Haiti of possible interest to that Station.

Other accomplishments include the following;
During the last two
(a) Operational Reporting:
years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted
operational and/or intel reports about Mexico,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,
Panama and Costa Rica, in addition to reports
originating in the WAVE area.
(b)
Establishment of Cover Facilities: In 1966
Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities
for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers
companies and subsequently assigned to a European
post where he remained until a personal reduction
cut caused his termination. The cover aspects of
this cover operation, however, were tight and
professionally mmaged by Hunkeler. Other cover
facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period
included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela
and the Dominican Republic.
(c) Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer
ässigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of
reviewing the operational potentials of the 'aribbean.
Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the
names and introductions to persons well known to
Hunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing
in Miami and available to participate in gent, p.a.,
or informant capacities.

*Ref A requested a reading on the status of
the plans and timing of DIGERVENO'S proposed

**Ref B suggested Has and JAVE set a date for
the release of DIGERVERS From his PBRUMEN duties
so he can thereafter spend full time preparing
for his Caracas assignment. Ref 3 also says
DIGIRVENO'S ETA in Curacas is not critical, and
the Caracas Station prefers every effort be
made to insure a viable long term cover to
