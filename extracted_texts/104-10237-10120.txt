exchange with Mrs. Donald WEBSTER, TOMIU's supervisor at the
Defense Language Institute, Anacostia Naval Annex, 4 June 64,
Mrs. VERSTER volunteered the information that "all of the other
Brigade students here' have told me they think very highly
of TOMEU, and that he is a very brave man, because he and his
family vere very wealthy in Cuba and he gave it all up to go
into exile and fight the Castro Regins."

"exchanged small talk" for a while until TOMEU finally stated
that he still wished there was something more he could do to
help free Cuba, and asked "What do you think I should do?"
Stroud replied that no person could really make that type of
decision for another individual, and countered by asking TOMEU.

63 Army as a career military officer.
8. TOMEU replied that, of course, he was once an
agriculturalist, but that there were few job opportunities in
which he could apply his past experience. His sister had also
saked him if he felt he and his family would want to live with
her in Spain or Mexico, but he didn't think too much of this
idea. He then stated that he had been asked by Manuel ARTIME.

TOMEU stated that he would no longer follow any man as “A

by saying he would "no longer follow a man, One could only
trust his ideals or an organization which followed those
