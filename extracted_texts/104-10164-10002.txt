8. My relations with Mr. Bartes have been very good, and I
Inclined to bellave what he says. However, this whois estier, of course,
would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services,
9. There is one other matter I would like to mention in connec-
tion with MP, Barter and that is that he served for two and a half months
with a group of Cuban filers in the Congo, as he holds a pilot's license.
He did not tell me and I did not ask who the sponsors of this group were of
what their duties ware. He did, however, mantion a Colonel Waber and
Kr. Saunders. I strongly suspect, of course, that this was an agercy
operation and, if so, the Clandestine Services will aiready have a good
leal of information about Mr. Sartes.

10. I pass this on for whatever it is worth and, if there is on
further Information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

and he and his family have been in contact with her.
4. Miss Bustillo, who is about 29 years of age, was one of the
up of Cuben ballet dancers which recently made a tour of Europe. A group
of these Cubens defected while the troupe was Paris, and this received wide
publicity in our newspapers, Miss Bustillo, however, did not defect and
continued on the tour and returned to Cube with the group. According to
r. Bartes, Alicia Bustillo has recently injured her foot and is not now
lancing, but is working as secretary to Alicia Alonzo,
Mr. Bartes told me that he had planned to meet Alicia Bustlilo

not have the money to make the trip nor did he think that he would be able

well-known Communist. Bartes says that Alicia Bustillo is not a Communist.
and he and his family have been in contact with her.
Miss Bustillo, who is about 29 years of age, was one of the
group of Cuben ballet dancers which recently made a tour of Europe. A group
of these Cubans defected while the troupe was Paris, and this received wide
publicity in our newspapers, Miss Bustillo, however, did not defect and
continued on the tour and returned to Cube with the group. According to
P. Bartes, Alicia Bustillo has recently injured her foot and is not now
dancing, but is working es secretary to Alicia Alonzo,
S. Mr. Bartes told me that he had planned to meet Alicia Bustillo
Paris and that she had agreed to meet his in Paris, but Mr. Bartes did
not have the money to make the trip nor did he think that he would be able
to obtain the necessary vise for the trip to Paris because of his status
Cuban refuges.

Bartes says that Miss Bustliis has traveled all over the
world with the Cuben bellas group and hos visited most of the Canalit
countries including Chine. He feels quite certain that the Cuban group will

Inclined to belleve what he says. However, this whois matter, of course,
would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services.
There is one other matter I would like to mention in connec-
tion with Mr. Barter and that is that he served for two and a half months
with a group of Cuban fllers in the Congo, as he holds a p'lot's license.
He did not tall me and I did not ask who the sponsors of this group were or
cargo.
what their duties were. He did, however, mention a Colonel Weber and
Mr. Saunders. I strongly suspect, of course, that this was an agency
operation and, if so, the Clandestine Services will aiready have a good
deal of information about Mr. Bartes,

further Information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

This is to certify that I have known Mr. Francisco A. Bartos since
June, 1962. He contacted our company tp obtain a license permitting
him to continue flying in the United States after his departure from
Cuba.
Mr. Bartos held a Cuban pilot license issued by the Civil Aeronautics
Commission of Cuba, November 22, 1956, No. 1017, Multi-engine Aircraft
VFR.
The total aircraft flying time has been estimated due to the fact all
personal effects including his log books were left in Cuba. A certi-
fication from Sunny South Aircraft, Ft. Lauderdale, Flórida, sub-
stantiates his estimated time due to single and multi-engine aircraft
he purchased from themt
Cessna 172 130:00
Cessna 182 250:00
Cessna 310 750:00
Mr. Fausto A. Valdez, a Cuban citizen now residing at 10 SW 32nd Ave.,
Miami, Firida, holding an ATR certificate, 1515842, issued 11/28/61,
has also cortified via affadavit, Mr. Bartes, has close to 1,000:00 hours
of multi-engine time."
Mr. Bartes has completed the Private Pilo: course with us and has the
necessary papers pertinent to an FAA license. He is presentle continuing
his studies for a Commercial Pilot rating single and multi-engine.
