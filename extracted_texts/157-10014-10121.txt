through its budget devels and mannower levels, let's let the
agency decide how many people it takes to run a segment of its
own organization.
Mr. Inderfurth. A very special segment. though.
1.
Mr. Kirbow. Well, special önly because we have concerned
ourselves with the abuse artpects of it under the assassination
type thing. Of more concern to us should be the fact that the
analytical section out there probably needs strengthening
instead of worrying about requlating the size of the clandestine
service.
Mr. Inderfurth. Well, that comes up later as well.
Mr. Kirbow. Do you think that size in any way contributed
to the plot against Castro for some of these other people?
Mr. Inderfurth. I think it has in covert action throughout
Latin America.
Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, I would support Mr. Kirbow on
this one.
My own view is unless you're going to go to the full
extent of addressing the question of establishing mannower
ceilings throughout the Central Intelligence Agency, to single
out one directorate at this point doesn

saving he is responsible for arsharing the community's budget,
and he has this Committee for this purpose in trying to place
responsibility squarely on him to do that.
Now this would not mean, however, that the Secretary of
Defense be senior to him in the cabinet. I mean the National
Security Council could not make a reclama and could not go over
his head.
That situation will still exist and this Committee is
in fact a committee of the National Security Council. so there
is another laver at which inter-Agency disputes, if they continue
beyond the level of the Committee on Foreign Intelligence
where they could be resolved.

then authorize the following specific responsibilities.
First of all, the establishment of national intelligence

draw upon representatives of the members of the intelligence
community to help him in the task of establishing these requirement
Now this is an increase in his authority from his
current posture. He has now the authority to issue guidance
in the preparation of requirements, but he can't really say do

I think this wou not charest that that ceiling be a

for that, just as it has there other services that serve in the

Now I know Charley has some reservations about that.

referential treatment and advancement within the Agency.
Is that what we're trying to get to here?
Mr. Kirbow. They say it's within the clandestine services,
that the covert operator gets more advancement within the
clandestine services side of the house than the other people,
and I don't think our record supports that.
It may be that you have found more of the directors
being from the covert side of the house but that is not what the

So in an effort to try to suggest that they make a
real effort to compensate for what we have found in this area,
this particular thing is designed to urge them to do their
best to try to overcome that problem.
Now we wanted to put it in a way that was not pejorative
and that did not exclude the advancement of good covert operators.
If you want to keep covert onerations. I agree with Charley..
you have to have good ones and you've got to reward them..
I don't think that this particular recommendation which
is to the Agency and not to statute dues what perhaps Charley
foars it would do. It simply urges that they give the proper

atter. I think it's fair to say that
he goes pretty far in getting his way at the present time, but
on some of these requirements on a national basis, this would
give him the clear authority to ask them to do things.
Now his requirements. the level of detail and so forth,
would obviously be something that would have to be negotiated
out in the course of his work.
Now that is the recommendation of the first paragraph

I might just say it also gives the PCI in connection with
the requirements process. it refers here to the fact that he

Mr. Aaron. Okay. Number 24 goes to the question of
the relationship between th domostic contac' division and
the directorate of operations, or what is otherwise known as
the clandestine services.
In 1972. I believe it was, when Mr. Schlesinger went
to the CIA, this directorate whose primary responsibility is
for collecting overt intelligence but which has a support
function for the clandestine collection or the clandestine
recruitment of agents within the United States was then moved
into the directorate of operations.
The Committee's own hearings and testimony on the
subject indicated that a reasonably large portion of their
activity and their contacks are used for the initial stages
of trying to spot, assess, and get people close to foreign
intelligence agent recrutement targets.

My own sense of that is that the decision that was made
by Director Schlesinger in moving it from the DDI to the DDO
did raise the potential of compromising the overt character,
but it also made the liaison which we find important more
efficient and easier to manage and potentially easier to
control if both elements are under the same set of quidelines
and regulations which would govern the DDO as a whole as to
who may he apporoached, who may be used operationally.

Why was it taken out of intelligence?
Mr. Bader. It was a question of consolidation of
collection in one directorate.
You see, while the domestic contract service was under
the DDI, it was a collection service. It was in an analytical
branch and Schlesinger, as I understand it, felt that it was
the tidy thing to do to put all collectors under the same t

Senator Huddleston. No can't take something out of the

Mr. Aaron. No. we can't do that. But in his new
responsibilities as DCI for preparing the budget of the entire
national intelligence program. he will now be in a position to
reprogram the entire budget and therefore it's a much larger
kind of flexibility.
Now the thrust of this particular proposal is not really

For other departments?
Where; there is an authorizing and an
appropriations type action in the Congress, as Senator Hart
will know from his experience on that committee, if they wish
to reprogram missile money over to aircraft, for instance, it
has to be approved by all four of those committers, both
Arms Services and both appropriations committees with the
exact transfer of the amounts of money and the justifications
given therefore.
My concern is not that the Congress should not have a
control of this or that you could make it so rigid by making
recommendations that leave the oversight committee and the
appropriations committee ho flexibility to do this. And I would
think that unless we have a very good record on this, we should
recommend that this should be a matter that the oversight
committee in its new rule gives good consideration to.

committees would have flexibility. Every appropriations act is

So we're really
just recommending here that in this statute they provide the
framework under which these kinds of reprogramming can be
done in view of the fact that we are extending the DCI from his
own little bailiwick to the entire intelligence community.
Mr. Kirbow. If that's the intent of the committee, I
have no reservations about it.

would object to that kind of language. They'd like to have
some definite framework for a man to reach into his budget.
Mr. Kirbow. I think all the various agencies would like
to have that kind of protection.
Senator Huddleston Okay.
Mr. Davis. Number C the DCI should have responsibility
to review all intelligence activities and intelligence resource
allocations, including tactical military intelligence in order
to carry out his more general responsibilities.
We've used the word "review" very carefully here. This
is not a responsibility to direct those operations but simply
to be able to look at the whole in order to sort of balance it
out.
We're not saving that he's taking over responsibility
from the military commander

But then it uses the word guidance. That is that
the DCI will provide guidance on the relationship between the

that the DCI would be able to look at the whole but not have
responsibility for directing the tactical military intelligence
prograns.
Mr. diGenova. The original drafting of that Section C,
I think it's actually clearer than the way it's drafted now.
The original draft says, While the DCI shall not have responsibil

responsibility to review all intelligence activities, et cetera

and comment on them for the director.
Senator Hart. Do they perform any function? Have they
in the past?
Mr. Miller. Oh, yes.
Llewelyn Thompson, for example.
There are senior diplomats. senior military men from the outside,
people of distinction, people who have seen a lot and have
something to contribute.
Sevator Hart. Have they had something to contribute?
Mr. Miller. Yes.
Mr. Aaron. There are two functions they can perform.
More or less. they can bring their wisdom to hear on the product.
Senator Hart. I want to know what they have done in
the past.
Mr. Miller. Soviet matters. Llewelyn Thompson's roles,
for example.
Mr. Aaron. And the second thing they have done was to
provide some senior support for the DCI and the judgements he
is making.
Now the extent to which that support has been translated
into horsepower is unclear, except it was sufficiently strong that
it was of concern to the dious administration and was one of

think that's in relation to helping
to insulate the DCI from pressures to modify him,
past,
In the
the board of national estimates insulated the DCI
from pressures.
-Senator llart. Chile, Angola, all these cases where the
DCI comes in and says we don't really want to do that but the
President made us, does he bring in the senior advisor to the
President and say, Llewely Thompson doesn't want us to, either.
Mr. Lombard. I think part of the problem here. Senator,
is that the office of estimates was created under the Eisenhower
Administration and fitted very well into the formalistic way
in which foreign policy was evolved during that administration
Perhaps as a matter of fact it's been criticized as being overly
formalistic and the board of estimates was viewed as being
somewhat too long-range and somewhat other world and not
geared to what the President perceived as being his day to
day needs on estimates.
Now I don't know where the equities lie in this thing,
but it seems as though these insitutions have changed according
to individual Presidents.
So really. beginning with the Kennedy administration,
you had the decline of the office of national estimates because
it no longer seemed to fit the fabric.

So again, mv intent here is not to be a know-nothing. It
just to keep the structure as clean as possible to identify
responsibility. That's all. And if this is important to do,
let's do it.
The record, Senator, and I can only speak
Mr. Bader. The
from personal experience with the board of national estimates
I certainly know of at least four estimates with which I had
a part of which the board's sole was very important in shielding
both the pCl and indeed the analyst from the ravages in two
10
cases of the military
who felt very strongly that the
11
12
13
14
1
16
continuation of our bases in the Azores was much more important
than sav
some hard political realities about the future of
Portugese Africa.
And I could cite other cases where this kind of
insulating function was enormously important. It had a great
deal to do with the experience the background and the very
17
presence of some of these board members.
12
They also play a role as the chairman of the coordinating
19
sessions of these national estimates.
There's not just an
20
advisory board that sits culte far from the process. Each
21
national intelligence estimate one of these board members
22
becomes the chairman.

So they do play a
active role in the prenatation.

that Helms' disposition on this
was very clear. When he signed the estimate it was his estimate
and it really wasn't the board's estimate.
Mr. Maxwell. Perhans it might be useful because I think
it is clear that he is empowered to do it. Two, if the
committee desires to make clear that as a recommendation, on
the basis of the committee's examination of their record that
this is a desirable thing wither than saving that it would be
empowered by statute, because he does have that nower.
Mr. Kirbow. Is it the desire of the Committee though,
to change the current system which the present director has
not seen fit to change vet, which he has full authority to
change if he wishes to do go and which the previous DCI
established and developed into a working mechanism?
Mr. Miller. The records show that the function of
the board had been official results. Then it seems to me we
should so state that it is a desirable structure.
Mr. Kirbow. I had one difference with Bill. I don't
know that it is desirable to insulate the DCI from the opinions
of the respective military departments if they have a vested

thoroughly yesterday, as a matter of fact.
Mr. Aaron. On E, this is the clause which, in effect,
makes clear that there is a definite limit to the DCI's authority
and the limit being the conduct of warfare, at which time there
should be a clear system and process whereby these activities
of the intelligence community over which he has responsibility
in some general sense here for hadget and so forth, that these

It's

Mr. Kirbow. I want to talk about the testimony that
was given before the committee on this from two of the former
DCIS. Mr. Colby, at both the breakfast briefings he gave and
in testimonyv. favored the use of individual intelligence offices
around in these various agencies, originating estimates and
everything else: whereas Nr. Helms, when he testified here,
says I really don't know how that system is working right now.
I didn't favor it when Mr. Colby established it. and I had the
other system and it worked well for me.
'f
So I think here again you are talking about a man
staffing requirements as the suit the particular times and
the individual as to how he wants to run the intelligence
community and what apparently suited Mr. Helms fine didn't
suit Mr. Colby and he used a different system which he says
works great. And I say that that is, again, a step down thing.
Unless you want to encourage him to do it in a recommendation
and not mandate that he do it, it kind of makes him run his

Mr. Quanbeck.
Mr. Kirbow.
the former DCI's
There's no difference of opinion between.
I don't know Mr. Bush's position
or the
former Secretaries of Defense. Everyone concedes that the
control of intelligence should go for Defense's purposes in
time of war the principal control.
Mr. Davis. The point is, too, the argument in the past
has been the Secretary of Dense needs the control he has
had in order to prepare for war and now you're saving the
DCI's going to do more but you don't want to upset the
11 military commanders.
And this is a way of saying that we
12 understand that in wartime it is going to no back. It is more
symbolic.
Mr. Kirbow. One of the recommendations in the military

Mr. Davis. This also happens with the clandestine
service today. In war the clandestine service comes under the
military commander in the field.
Mr. Aaron. There are some arrangements of this character
because of the expanded authority of the DCI that is granted
both in the order and our proposed statute, particularly in the
area of requirements.
It's important to have this caveat, if you will.
Now recommendation 11 really suggests that the oversight

committee look at carrying the budget process
the budget process a step further
and instead of appropriating or authorizing the appropriation
funds to the different departments for intelligence purposes,
that in fact they are authorised to the DCI who would then
parcel them out, and it doesn't come down hard to say that this
ought to be done but that this is the next logical step in this
process and it is something for the oversight committee's
agenda.
Now number 19
Mr. Kirbow. I would like to excent on that until such
the
time as the whole subject of the budget and release of the
figures and everything else is considered. the whole budget
aspect at the same time.
:
Senator Hart. I don't understand this exception procedure:
How does that work?
Mr. Kirbow. Senator Tower has asked the Chairman that
if there was anything that had not been in agreement among the
staff, that it could be brought before that it would certainly
come to the subcommittee.

un to the Full Committes anyway.
Mr. Kirbow. I simply indicated to the Chairman earlier
that I didn't want to have a reservation like that and not
point it out to him because I didn't want the absent member
to appear to be sandbagging the subcommittee.
Senator Huddleston. He's putting us on notice.
Mr. Aaron. Option 13, this option steps up to the
question of whether the DCI in his new capacity as the overall
manager of the community, and by manager I don't mean down in
the nuts and bolts but having the general management responsibilit
of interpreting the budget in terms of requirements, in terms
of general quidance for the management of some of these
activities. whether that function should be separated from that
of running the CIA as an agency.
15
16
Now we have heard some testimony about the inconsistency
between those two responsibilities.
ities. I think the arguments, if
12
I can set them on the two sides, would be as follows. And
by the way, there's a difference of opinion in the staff as
to which of these is the right one to follow. The argument
12
20
23
in favor of going ahead pow to separate them is that these
are inconsistent, that one could have, you
have, you remove the DCI
:

development, programs and other people's SIGINT programs, and
other activities when he is the overall director of Central
Intelligence, and that therefore this separation, his removal
from that, would be a good idea.
i
The second argument is that you really want to place the
authority squarely on the director of this agency who's
going to be responsible for clandestine activities. If he
still has a boss above him who is kind of responsible but who
in fact because of his increased responsibilities won't be
able to give the day to day attention to clandestine activities
that he might. if he didn't have these greater responsibilities.
one should make the lines of authority clear and place the
responsibility for the head of this agence on that agency
and leave it there.
17
Now the argument against that is that
well, there are
18
two kinds of arguments against.
One is that the situation now
19
is justified and that this is a good thing and we don't need
20
to make any change and there are good reasons to believe that.

22

The second argument might follow in the middle and says,
well, there is some inconsistency potentially. There might

Mr. Bader. I would just underline that, Mr. Chairman,
the second point that David has made about recommending the
situation to stay the way it is today. That is, that the
two hats would stay together.
I think some of us feel that the period in front of us
will be a period of experimentation and tasting where there are
new responsibilities that will flow to the DCI. We'll see how
they work, we'll see where his authority takes us. We'll see
whether he really will in fact establish himself as the
'
responsible director of in a DCI sense; and we argued here that
the oversight committee should be attentive to this to see how
it works out and that if sometime in the future after we've had
a chance to see how these expanded responsibilities work in
practice. that will be a time to see whether the DCI and the
Director of CIA function should be separated.
Mr. Aaron. I think that to argue the first case a little
more strongly, if I could, there are two additional points to be
made about it.
24
One is that in f
haping the second half.

So it isn't reallush a question. I would argue,
system takes us. It's a matter of
of seeing where the current system takes us
looking at what we have learned as a result of our inquiry
and saying, in fact. this is going to be an impediment and it
is my personal opinion and I think supported at least by some
testimony that that would be the case.
The second argument. I think, is a somewhat broader one,
and I quess I'm not prepared to make it. Bu' we've had an
9 inquiry into the CIA. some of its problems. some of its

accountability problems. some of its management problems, and
as a result of this inquiry there is, at least it strikes me
as being some inconsistency to be argued between having this
broad inquiry and ending up with a much stronger, larger, and.
more powerful Central Intelligence Agency in every respect
with greater authority over other elements of the intelligence
community.
Now you can only carry that so far but it seems to me
that there is a serious question here as to, and it is seen in
19
20
part by other elements of the intelligence community who really
21
are concerned that by wearing the two bats, the DCI will still
really be representing the Avency vis a vis their particular
agencies like NSA and the others.

Committee. I believe the record reflects that Mr. Schlesinger
was the only former DCI who was in favor of separating the
Agency from the Director and all those who were still alive
to testify who were former directors favored it, most notably
Mr. McCone and also Mr. Helms, Mr. Helms characterizing the
director as ending up with a disembodied spirit if he were
deprived of this analytical vehicle.
So I think as far as the record goes. I think the record
is against divesting the director of the Agency, although there
is certainly evidence from those who felt that he should be.
Mr. Aaron. Let me see if I can clarify that record a
little more.
First of all, the proposal is not to divest him from the

Now my question is this. Assuming that we were to achieve
all of the measures in the recommendations that we have here
for the DCI budget and all the rest, it seems to me that that
is an awful lot of work without having to be concerned with the
day to day operations of the CIA.
I don't know. I Arst raise the question.
Senator Huddleston. I think that's a good point.
Mr. Lombard. He first of all has to present the budget
to the President.
He has to defend the budget up on the hill,
10
and that's in at least four committees.
And then he's got to
11
have an analytical base, and presumably the national estimate
12
function and on top of that, worrying about the day to day
17 onerations of the Agency.
I don't know if that is more than one may should be
14
15
asked to do..
16
Senator Huddleston.
Well, when we talk about major
reorganization and re-assignment of functions, almost, and.
we're probably confusing that by continuing to call the man

19
who is going to supervise all of the intelligence

gravity that that gave him, then he would be a disembodied

now where he has real authority over the budget.
Mr. KirboW. But also presupposes. Mr. Chairman, that you
have decided already that you're going to separate the analytical
side of the house up there from the clandestine side of the
house and put them into separate agencies.
I don't believe the committee has decided that. The
staff mav.have.
Mr. Treverton. It doesn't necessarily presuppose that.
Mr. Kirbow. If he's going to put the analytical side
of the house over there with the DCI
Mr. Treverton. Well, in any situation we would leave
the DCI with his responsibility for estimates and a staff to

it is not really relevans to the nestion of what the DCI will
be doing if, and I underling the word if. these new responsibili
ties that are being thrust on him by both the Executive and
by the Congress, are in fact implemented.
The argument I would make here is that the oversight

Mr. Davis. The Pracutive Order is an attempt to look
at the problem and to make one step which says there will be
two deputies, and therefore, the OCI will have someone who is
managing his operations and takes some of the burden off and
that's why they did it. And in a sense they recognized the
conflict of interest and thia was step in that direction

Mr. Kirbow. General allen at the meeting when this
war discussed, he indicated that this has not created any
problem for him, that he didn't see any favoritism being
displayed on the park of Mr. Cole and the prople be dealt with.
Mr. Maxwell I think that's part of the reason why a
number of us had favored oction number out. was that a great
deal of the trouble with the President's Executive Order and
our recommendations was to dive the DCT more authority. But
for the period of time in which that has not been sorted out
and we don't have a record for, to take away or recommend taking
away essentially the troops that the DCI had used, which in
the future honefully he would, not need if recommendations on
both sides come into being would be to weaken him at a crucial
time as people try to fill in the vacuum that is created.
Senator Huddleston,
I think the question then is whether
or not what we are recommanding actually comes to pass. If it
does come tol naes then this is an issue that needs to be

President's own proposals and own measures that he has taken but
in terms of the measures which we propose be taken in statute.
which of course the oversight committee or whatever responsible
legislative committee will have the power to dispose of these

But in that context it's very clear that we do nive

Could we solve it by just having a
narrative statement at the and of all of these recommendations
relating to the DCI to say that the foregoing, preceding
recommendations would, if carried out, substantially strengthen
the role of the DCI or they are intended to do that?
And this brings up the question as to whether or not
in this expanded role he should also at the same time be
essentially responsible for the operation of one of the agencies
and that this matter, as his duties are expanded, this matter
10 needs to be considered further and a determination made whether
13
14
or not it's appropriate that he continue to hold that
responsibility.
That's not a recommendation. It's just a commentary on

to exploitation for such purposes and whether in that shading
the Committee would want to take a position about recruitment
of that particular group.
Mr. diGenova. My position is this. Bill. The first
time I heard about this was when I read it in these findings
and corclusions. I never saw a hearing on it, I never saw a
document about it; I never had a chance to comment on it as
a designee, and I never had a chance to bring it up with my
Senator.
I'm not sure that we want to say this, ask the Senators
to say this, without having something in a report about w t
the practice is, how it's been conducted, who has objected to
it. what's the extent of it. before we start making a
recommendation.
We're saying we question the practice of recruiting.
I have no objection to the Committee ultimately making

would return to the United States. I mean the Soviet Union.
We did not take that testimony any further than receiving his
testimony. That is, we have not taken it to the point of
asking the agency whether in fact they have such a program
in the Southwest. So the testimony was limited to that one
charge which I personally gave some real credibility to.
Ms. Culbreth. Can you explain just what the charge is
here? What is the wrong that has been done?
Mr, Kirbow. What's wrong with that? That's the question
I had in the original suggestion at the staff level.
The only human collection we are getting from behip
the Iron Curtain in Russia today is principally either through
our cooperation with the Israeli intelligence community using
just this sort of individual and sending them back, or sending
this type of individual from the United States back inside.
We're not getting the other human intelligence.
Mr. Bader. I was only responding to the question of
what the testimony was.
To go on to the further issue which I think is going
to be addressed by the Committee. it's not the question of
whether we should, the Central Intelligence Agency should be
recruiting foreigners in this country for intelligence purposes
people who may return to their country of origin.
The question is whether the individual pic is in the

Senator Mathias. this is the kind of situation I'm
thinking of, perhaps not an illegal alien. but someone who is
in this country in some sort of legal status but which is of
temporary duration and he wants to change his status.
Senator Huddleston. I can see that. Of course you're
not going to get one unless there's something he wants. Most
of them, it's either money or some change in his status.
Mr. Aaron. We drafted this language to make clear that
they were really immigrants and they were not illegal aliens
or people here changing their status or people outside trying
12

Senator Hart. If
If it's happening, I don't think it should.
If we have to sacrifice some human intelligence, I don't think
we ought to have a CIA quy tugging on somebody's sleeve who's
filling out his immigration forms because it is a very subtle
and very powerful form of coercion.
I don't think it should go on if it is going on but
I think the oversight committee should find out.
Mr. Bader. It's my personal position on this that
we don't have the evidence. We have not taken it through to
come to a conclusion on this
I personally think that it's a problem that should be
pointed out, and I think perhans niv own view is that the
formulation of a recommenation to look into this as a possible,
as a problem would be my recommendation.
I don't believe that is David's recommendation.
Senator Mathias. I would think that you might as you
contemplate this thing there are all types of opportunities
for this and I don't have any idea whether it's been done or not,
but I would think an illegal alien, for example, would be a
tremendous target.

Mr. Aaron. In looking at what the foreign resources
division does in the way of penetration of businesses as
opposed to collecting agents on campuses or in some other
walk of life, we found that the FRD actually runs agents in
only a few cases.
The cases are Americans employed by local industries in
the United States or consulates.
In other words, in diplomat consulate establishments
in which there are few cases in which indeed the Americans
14 working for those diplomatic establishments are agents of the
CIA through the foreign resources division; and the Americans

Collecting intelligence on the activities of
that company because that company had foreign policy implications
for us.
The next question that was put to, I believe, the chief
of the FRD was do you have any requlations that prohibited
you from doing the same thing with an American company? And
the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or
we haven't done that or something to that effect.
That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Bader. I think one of the problems we have here. is
this question of whether in cur formal recommendations that we

Mr. Bader. We could certainly do it in an hour's time.
I would like to attend that session.

Mr. Bader. So we'll start at 9:00 promptly:
Senator Huddleston. Senator Mathias had the suggestion
that in view of the fact that there is specific legislation
relating to that subject and that's in the Immigration Act
Mr. Bader. I've asked them to be prepared to speak to
their interpretation of the provisions and restrictions in the
Immigration Act.
Senator Huddleston.
But our recommendation is that
we would review the act and the practices.

Mr. Bader. If we have this room as I hope we do, we
would take the testimony right here and if need be, move it
to another room.
Senator Mathias. In the event that I should not be
able to be here, and I hone I will, I think we ought to look
at this thing pretty closely.
As Senator Huddleston said earlier, you don't recruit
these people just out of the blue unless there's some reason
for them to sign up, and I don't think we want to be too
24 critical of recruiting procedures; to revert to the phrase that

Monday or Tuesday, even. his hope is that during the course
of the next week the Full Committee will finish that.
In the meantime, of course, we can still be working on
these reports looking toward hopefully, if we could have those
by the end of next week, too, then the Full Committee would
be in a position of at least having the material available to
them if we decided to release everything at one time or if
we needed a few more days to refine the reports themselves.
That's about as much as we can hope for.

Before we get into the substance here, I understand that

when I was there that there was no way that they could complete

Senator Mathias. I have been independently advised of
the same thing, that the end of the month is maybe a little
optimistic:
Mr. Miller. Senator Church just talked to Director Bush
and I talked to Mitch Regovin just prior and worked out an
arrangement on the question of clearances of sensitive material
and the Chairman told Mr. Bush that he will take whatever time

He said that he hoped that we could cooperate and work

of counter-intelligence which would look at other matters and
we will get to that in a moment, but among its tasks is that
it would be a forum in which differences of opinion as to the

In other words, the point is that certainly they do

counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon
the Attorney General to certify
to the President and to
the oversight committee that these actions are being taken in
a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of
American citizens or any other provision of law.
Trying to keep track of the domestic intelligence
recommendations is a little bit like painting a moving train,
but this tends to coincide with their recommendation, and the
purpose of this is obviously to place a little tighter
restriction and more authority in the hands of the Attorney
18
General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions
that are conducted on a covert or clandestine basis aré in
fact not infringing on Constitutional rights or attempting to

you were to establish a base in Florida for the purposes of
harassing Cuban shipping.
That would not come up here.

would be their job to compile it.
And that does not exclude other functions.
For example,
the analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply
to give it the collection function and that is because the
paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to

13
14

16
It could under the formulation now do that.
Mr. Aaron. That's why for example there's one thing that
they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad
do an overt collection job and that is biographic information
17
and that, while it was once in the State Department, was

they have a lot of clandestine

I think it's highly unlikely that they will let that stay
in there and we'll probably have to modify it.. I see your point
in a way that we might save ourselves time by scaling it down
to begin with to what we think will be acceptable, but on the

It's a chicken and egg situation.

was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I
asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is
never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going
to make these decisions without staff support of some description,

Mr. Aaron. I think that's a fair point. The question,

add to what already is in the sentence preceeding it which
is review. by the Committee which the Attorney General is
to chair, would be the case in which the Attorney General is

I have worked in a state law department and had to
sign some certifications much simpler than this, and I agonized
over them. And this is so far beyond the personal knowledge
of the Attorney General for him to make any kind of certification,

In this specific situation, for example, we've already
not the Attorney General being involved with the oversight
responsibilities.
When he takes office he already has the
obligation to see that all the laws and activities of agencies
are carried out as they're supposed to be.
And in addition to that, we are proposing in another.
part of our recommendations that the general counsel and the
inspector general of the CIA be subject to Senate confirmation
so that there are lots of other kinds of checks, and I would
just hope that as the Senators consider additional proposals
like this. that we don't get to the point that the Congres
is hamstringing them inside the agencies on how they carry
out the responsibilities:
Each one of these standing by itself may look like,
well, this is a good idea and we should have this additional
certification or this addition chain of reporting and making
sure you get it authorized.
But I have a fear after having looked through a good
bit of this, that we are getting too many layers in there, and
I would just urge a caution if there are situations where we
maybe have it pretty well covered until we get some opportunity
to see how this new set-up is going to work, whether we're
going to have the kind of abuses we had before: Maybe we don't

you're in the process of trying to recruit foreign assets

Mr. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph
and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-

which was to focus on resolving issues involving the bona

the body which would have the appropriate knowledge in the
positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned
to a counter-intelligence function.
It's simply a question of where the responsibility
should be allocated for reviewing those within the National
Security Council structure, and I wasn't clear whether the
counter-intelligence committee was the appropriate one.
Mr. Aaron. Well, on that point, the purpose of setting
up the counter-intelligence committee is essentially to look
at the domestic impact of our intelligence activities. the
primary ones being in the counter intelligence field but also

Mr. diGenova. Mr. Chairman, I would add in that regard
that with regard to the specific recommendation, this is
not going down into the Agency.
This is talking about the
Attorney General who is the head of an agency, first of all,
5
and the history has shown that other Attorneys General who

one of the reasons was that they didn't know about certain
things.
And the purpose of this provision is to make them aware.
of what is going on, to make legal judgements and to advise
the President about the legality of procedures attending
recruitment of agents and other activities within the confines
of the United States.
The provision for confirming the inspector general and

Mr. Aaron. I think by and large the FRD's quite clear.
In other words, when we went through the CHAOS and some of
these other programs that were questionable, there were some
cases in which some of the reporting that took place as a result
of the foreign resources division got into the CHAOS net.
But the foreign resources division managed to stay clear of
in general and resisted in Fact the effort on the part of the
CHAOS team to go out and actively recruit in this area on
a clandestine basis.

Senator Huddleston. Well, there are several places in
our report findings. several cases indicated in the testimony
we've taken that the Attorney General ought to review and
recommend.
And I'm wondering whether or not rather than bust spotting
it at these various places whether we couldn't make a general

Mr. Kirbow. I would feel much better about this since
it hasn't been an apparent abuse but to see that go in the
general recommendation that all of the activities of the
intelligence community ha, me viewed by him or her examinad in

But it would seem that it cuts then to

all along and not in violation of the law.
i
We don't appear to be accusing them of it here, although
the language may not be quite so specific.
Mr. Aaron. I might just say that there is a further
recommendation that involves the Attorney General on page 40,
which is number 27 dealing with the same committee, a different
aspect of it.
What this does is it elaborates with the recommendation
number 17. which establishes the counter intelligence committes

relating to what in effect is the re-establishment of the board
of national estimates to make clear that they weren't there just
for the purpose of endorsing estimates but from the standpoint
that they are there for the purpose of reviewing them.
So the next recommendation is recommendation 17, and it
is long and complicated.
Essentially what the recommendation
does is spell out more precisely what the DCI's responsibilities
will be for the overall allocation of resources and coordination
of the community's activities apart from the production of
finished intelligence, which is the purpose of recommendation
16.
Now what it does, the first paragraph summarizes the

Now it is slightly different from the Executive Order

Chairman of that Committes, and gives the DCI in his person,
if you will, the responsibility for presenting that budget to the

The bracketed portion says that the NSC would approve
all counter intelligence activities of the CIA in the United
States and it spells out a kind of procedure there.
Now the net effect of this kind of procedure really is
to establish that the "BI in without question. I mean the
practical effect is that the PR is without question the
counter-intelligence agency and you've not to get the President
to approve anything that the CIA is going to do in this
field. And that is really it inside the United States. That's
the net effect of this paragraph,
Now my own personal view of this paragraph is that it's
probably not necessary. We have the NSC dommittee. It is
supposed to resolve the question of where the FBI lets off
and the CIA begins and it is an NSC committe that can report
to the President if they have a disagreement.
I'm not sure I feel strongly about it.
Mr. diGenova. I would only add that I spoke to John

unnecessary to do this. No thinks that this consolidation

I really would like to see that kind of requirement
placed on the Attorney General as a general requirement instead
of trying to just pick out little specifics unless we have an
abuse connected with it.

with the recommendation on the top of 27 saving the domestic
counter-intelligence activities of the CIA would be subject to
this review and then follow that with a third recommendation
that the Attorney General would be required to advise the
President and the oversight committee if he found any irregular-

should be given by the President and be supported by the

That are conducted inside the

Now I think it's possible to consolidate those recommenda-

possible to take out any impliction that these programs were
not necessarily conducted pronerly in the past.
But I would hate to sort of just have, and my personal

that the Attorney General ought to do this because he ought

recommendations that are more specifically targeted on the
subject matter that we have reviewed and give him in effect,

Senator Huddleston. Well, we are giving him the
enecific charge of reviewing it, which apparently he didn't
have before. Now before when something came to his attention
he certainly had the responsibility to move on it if in his
opinion it was contrary to Constitutional rights.

That is. for operational approval.
As you know from our testimony these kinds of projects
do not go to the 40 Committee type organizations where they
deal with covert action projects.
So on the one hand we're hoping to deal with the question
of operational approval. In this particular subcommittee we
go to the question of overall management and direction of

And in this way we hope to bring the diversity that now

and management quidance.
It is not an important elaboration of the committee on

it's a management problem. This gives it focus, this gives
the Secretary of State the chairmanship of a committed and I

large proportion of that is
keved to their report and yet obviously a great deal of
clandestine collection is carried out by the CIA itself and
the military services account for a significant amount of
collection, some of which is extremely important in countries
with military governments.
The issue then becomes whether there shouldn't be a
particulay mechanism to deal with it and the proposal here is
to create a subcommittee of the CFI for that purpose, or a
special committee of the
CFF.
And the reason for that is to
