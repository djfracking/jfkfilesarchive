REFERENCES: a.
Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,

28 June 1967
hit ill
1. In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, I
confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal.
2. Justice was advised that our information disclosed that
POSADA-Carriles had passed silencers and grenades to Rosenthal
during July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencils
and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that POSADA -
Carriles was in contact with FBI/Miami and that it had been advised
of these dealings. Justice was told that the items involved were not
of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our
preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.
3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
POSADA-Carriles as its contact but apparently the details are some-
what vague. To make a federal case against Roserthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
that the items used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title 18 Section 837.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that

we supply answers to the following: (a) did POSADA-Carriles
volunteer himself to the FBI or did it approach him initially;
(b) who informed the FBI of the July 1965 deal the Agency or
POSADA-Carriles; (c) on what date was this information given;
(d) similarly as regards the October 1966 transaction, the date
the information farnished and by whom; (e) what were POSADA-
Carriles sources for the items or their components; (f) were
these sources within or without the State of Florida? And inci-
dentally were we aware that supposedly POSADA-Carriles realised
"profit" for furnishing the October 1966 items and that he tried
without success to turn it into the "company"? While I agreed to
undertake to obtain the information requested, I suggested that
much of it might be readily available from the FBI. Justice con-
ceded this and intends to have further discussions with it.
4. During the course of the meeting the interesting
hypothesis was suggested to the effect that POSADA-Carriles
might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he
began to feel the pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and
the FBI.
5. Under strictly controlled conditions with POSADA-
Carriles acting as a conduit, Justice is considering the possibility
of assisting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he
will be arrested immediately for possession. I told them while we
might be willing to have POSADA-Carriles so used we were under-
standably concerned over the adverse comment that our employeo's
involvement could generate.
6. On a matter that may be related: one Albert LARRAIN
Maestre is alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carriles that he has
been involved in the bombings with Rosenthal and to have said more
explosives were needed. LARRAIN Maestre is a fugitive under a
· narcotics endictment having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street,
New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Luis Clements POSADA-Carriles
}
1. The Department of Justice has been investigating
one Lefty Rosenthal whom they believe to be tied in with key
members of organised crime in the Miami area and who also
they believe has been involved in seven recent bombings in
the Miami ares. According to the information the Department
has gotten so far, Rosenthal went to a United States citison
named Norman Rothman in the Dominican Republic and through
him directly or indirectly through a person known as Diego,
Rosenthal was put in touch with Luis Clemente Posada-Carriles,
Allen Registration Number A-12419708, 263 S. W. 26th Street,
Miami. Rosenthal understands that Posada-Carriles is attached
te CIA and claims that Posada-Carriles supplied him with capo,
primers and C-4 explosives. Rosenthal is reported to have
offered to talk to Posada-Carriles about the background of the
bombings and who was involved and why, but Posada-Carriles
said he had no interest in the background.
2. Rosenthel is reported to be asking Posada-Carriles
to supply 240 pounds of C-4 explosives with cape and primers
by Saturday and has told Posada-Carriles that twenty more
bombings are scheduled. The local police are investigaging
the seven bombings which have taken place and do not know this
other background material.
3. Justice would very much like to have Rosenthal
prosecuted and accordingly would like to have the explosives
delivered to Rosenthal but to have 99% of it faulty and have the
state prosecute him on the possession of the 1% of valid
explosives. The Justice Department has a report from the

During JWHAYE debriefing on 11 April 1957, ALRIVER-L provided
the following information on the above subject:
: 1. As of March 1967, the role of MINCEX" in the Cuban
Government, including the Commercial Office in London, was
less important than it had been two years earlier.
those two years, MINCER lost & substantial portion of its
During
functions and operating elements. Beginning early in 1966,
Cubana de Aviacion made its own purchases abroad without
the assistance of the HINCEX Commercial Offices. CUENTABACO,
formerly an operating element of INCEX, was abolished late
in 1966 and its functions were taken over by an independent
enterprise called Empresa Cubana del Tabaco with headquarters
in Havana. In Apr 1537, COSTA, an operating element
of HINCHY, was scheduled to be abolished and replaced by
Instituto del Libro with headquarters in Havana In January
and February 1507, the GCC was studying the feasibility of
transferring CUBAZUCAR, an operating element of MINCES, to
the Sugar Hinistry.
:
SOURCE COMMENT: This tread of events appears to indicate
that in the future MINCEX, functions will,
be further reduced and possibly even
eliminated completely.

.A) AREA ESPECIAL (SPECIAL AHSA) OF THE TELEPHONE COMPANY
HERNANDEZ clains that in girly 1950, the GCC stablished a
surah
new department within the Telephone Company, this depart
ment was called "Ares Especial".
As site for "Area Fépecial" was chosen a building located at
19 Street corner of C-Street, Vedado, Havana, that is in the
Oppobite corner of the same block that "Area Horte" of the
Telephone Company is located (1) Street corner of 3 Street).
Prior to being taken by the 90%, the building was the local
of "Colegio Sepulveda" (Sepulveda private school).
HERNANDEZ claidis that since "Area Especial" was organized,
all of its nembord that had to deal with installations or ro-
pairments of telephone equipments had to be DSE agents (by that
time DIER, later on G-2).
Even though only the scredited members of "Area Especial" can.
• enter the premises, HERNANDE claims that it is common knowledge
Pamong telephone employees that the functions of the members of
"Area Especial" is to install, service and maintain telephone
equipments for: Offices of Misters, DS3 offices, Ministry of
the Armed Forces, MININT, 000 personalities' homes and offices
(including CASTRO'S), OSTI and any other GCC entity requiring
security measures. It is also a main function of "Area Especial"
personnel to establish telephone equipments and lines among tren-
ches of the Cuban Aray whenever needed (ex: October crisis of 1952):
Note: Debriefer had been previously informed by Eusebio Pio
RITER Weldes-Castro, on cobriefing carried out at Freedom House
on 7 April 1907, that a telephone cable had been installed (under-
ground) from 2 Street corner of 13 Street, Vedado, (place with
RIVERO referred to as "Unidad Militar-Military Unit") up to 19
Street corner of C Street, Vedado (place which RIVER referred to
* Telephone Company sub-plant of Vedado cres). RIVERO at that
pray for that this operation was cond in Iste
502 Dateber crisis, and that he thought that this was
hand offo,ging operation". Asked by Debriefer, HRNANDEZ
that during th 1962 after the October crisis, a tele-
at
to cable(unuerground) was installed a "Area scial" and
to was said he was insta" switchboard
