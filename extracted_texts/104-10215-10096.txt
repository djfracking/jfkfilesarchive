1. Harold R. NOEMAYR, & Carcer Agent, is incurring medical expenses
from the required hospitalization and medical/surgical treatment of one of his
minor dependents. He wishes to know if he is covered by insurance that includes
the above type of expenses for his dependents.
2. It is noted that reference regulation mentions in general terms that
Career Agents are usually entitled to the same benefits as Staff Employees.
6 However, since the Station does not have a copy of NOEMAYR's contract, it
is requested that Headquarters check his personnel file to determine if he and
his dependents are all covered by some manner of hospitalization plan azi, if
so, what the exact terms are that this plan covers.

SUBJECT
AMIASH-1 C-101080
6 August 1964
:
1. Reference is made to your "Request for Information" dated
31 July 1964 concerning Subject.
2. The PRQ Part II on AMTRUNK-10 (201-142291) contains certain
errors which are being struck: ANLASH-1 is not a Headquarters internal
asset, nor is he running any internal group. The relationship between
AMTFUNK-10 and AMLASH-1 is a personal one - they have been friends for
many years. AMIASH-1 is not doing anything whatsoever at the present time
inside Cuba which has anything to do with any KUBAEK operation, plan,
activity; in addition, he is not furnishing any Political or Foreign
Intelligence. A POA was requested on him in June of 1962 for recruitment
as a possible defector. He returned to Cuba and has resumed his career
as a surgeén. He is working with the cardiology department of the
Manuel Fajardo Hospital.
3. Station JMMAVE is being advised of the above.

ABSTRACT
MICRORN
1. It is requested that the attached application for Health Insurance be
given to Earold R. NORMAYR for completion. NOEMAYR may retain the covering
memorandna which outlines his coverage. The completed forms should be returned
to Headquarters for processing. The premiums will be deducted from HOFMAYR' 3
salary. Headquarters will notify NOEMAYR when his policy is in effect.
2. Please explain to NOEMAYR that this plan covers basically two types
of health insurance. 1: the normal hospitalisation explained in paragraph 3
of the attachment which includes in- and out-patient care, surgery and maternity.
The allowable expenses covered under this section are immediately reimbursable
within the limits of the plan. 2: the major medical benefit plan described in
paragraph 4 covers miscellaneous medical expenses not normally comected with
hospitalization such as doctors' office visits, doctors' home visits, prescrip-
tions, injections and medications given by doctors, X-rays and other laboratory
work done in connection with diagnosis or treatment, etc.
The insured pays up
to $100 of such allowable expenses under this category for each member of his
fasdly. If expenses exceed this $100 for any person during the calendar year,
then the policy will pay for 80% of their additional expenses. In connection
with this phase of the plan, it is suggested that NOEMAYR be advised to have
His family keep a detailed record of all medical expenses incurred by each
member of the family.
3. HOFMAYR should be advised that under the hospitalization section of
the plan, up to $75.00 can be reimbursed for surgical fees in commection with
a tonsilectomy, whether the tonsilectomy is performed in a hospital or in the
surgeon's offices.

1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 12 April 1960
wherein an amended covert security approval was requested to permit
the PCS of Subject, a career agent, from Mexico to Headquarters and
specifically, to permit his utilization in translating documents
pertaining to Cuban matters from Spanish to English and English to
Spanish. The Subject will also assist the Division by making suggestions
for PP and FI purposes. It is understood that Subject will work under
a cover established for him by CCD/HC and that he will have no access
to official Agency buildings or installations. It is further understood
that he will not engage in clandestine operational activities in the
USA..

2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Clandestine Services Instruction
Field No. 10-5, a covert security approval is granted for the use of
the Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph 1,
above.

Subject is being forwarded to CI/OA this date. CI/CA should be con-
tacted and this information reviewed prior to any utilization of Subject
4. Subjects of covert security approvals are not to represent
themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees of CIA.

approval does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for
approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this office.

United Press International. This was his
trip into the Sierra and he was very green
for camp life and had no knowledge of Spanish
or their history. It was a cimple matter to
give him a hand in everything and become¨.
his interpreter during the entire assignment.
This gave me a lot of access persons and
information that I would normally have to
struggle for but eventually, him being
-
a veteran newstan - he recognised my approach
as something more than journalism. He put it
in a few words, saying that I was ontiraly
too thorough too many field trips, too
many technical photographs, etc. He came out
and asked if I did belong to my true
organization. It became necessary to become
very convincing here) and I think that I
did eventually allay his susioions.
5. On December 29, 1958, I returned to Havana for a second assignment in the
Sierra Maestra which was interrupted by the fall of the BATISTA regime.
During a period of three weeks, the following persons were given the
business cards

KAPPES is now employed with Harry Wassel &

in the employ of Fidel CASTRO as an Under-
water demolition expert and was in the process
of sabotaging the Cuban destroyer "Jose Marti".
He had lost his contact with the movement and ·
did not speak Spanish - I helped him make
contact and remove the Explosives

he remained

Charles Schuman and Andrew St. George were also met again on this trip.
In Mexico City, from 7 June 1958 to 12 March 1960, the cover employment

On 11 March 1958 I went into the Sierra Maestra mountain range of
Santiago, Oriente Provinoo, on an assignment as observer with the
Fidel CASTRO Rus revolutionary movement. CASTÃO "cleared" me for this
assignment and was given my business card. It was also considered
operationally advantageous to "drop a hint" to CASTRO from another
direction as to my true mission. During the period 11 Harch 1 April
1958, the following percons were either given a business card or
informed of the cover firms

St. George made several trips of considerable
duration into the Sierra and in addition to
his journalism, was debriefed by our organi-
sation and the State Department. He was a
very shrewd photographer and an observing
person. We became very close during those
weeks and he eventually drew ne aside and.
told me that he wanted to bring me in
contact with some friends of his in Washing-
ton who would like to talk to me concerning
the military and intelligence' aspects of
CASIRO's movement. While I do not think that
he strongly doubted my cover firm, he seemed
to recognise my approach as more for military
intelligence than journalism or economies.

A RESUME OF THE USE OF A "HOTICHAL COVER" EMPLOYMENT
Harold K. Noemar
1.
2.
3.
10 April 1960
The following "notional cover firm" was established in April 1957
and backstopped mail-cable-telephone checks:
Public Surveys Instituta
General Polling Service
Riverside 1-3674
532 Fidelity Union Life Bldg
1511 Bryan Street
Dallas, Texas
A few hundred business cards were printed up both in Washington and
locally in Havana, Cuba for my use. It was agreed that stationary would
be printed up and some correspondence should be initiated from Havana.
The business cards were first used in May 1957 in Havana; renting an
apartment, purchasing furniture, automobile, and among friends and
acquaintances. It was later used as a developmental recruitment approach
with known communists in Havana details set forth with each case
reviewed here.
-
Generally, it is believed that this cover held up well with Latinamericar
in Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rios, Pename. It was received with some curiousity
by some Americans living abroad in these countries, and was often questic
"Well, what do you do?" Actually, university background in economics made
it possible for me to answer and converse professionally, and only diffi-
culties ever encountered with with two persons who were in a position to
appeal to my firm for services. This, of course, made it obvious that I
had to be prepared at all times to actually render some service or presen
a valid technical reason for not being able to do so. To my knowledge,
this cover firm has never been compromised as such, and it has only been
seriously challenged on one occasion. This was a newsman in the Sierra
Maestra in Cuba and will be set forth in detail.
It would be impossible, of course, to remember and record every"brushing"
acquantance that has been given this business card. But the well known
and more important ones are listed for Cuba as follows:
Bernardo ALARZ :

spotter in 1955, but not favorably received.
because "new blood" was sought.
Net in Guatemala in February 1954. Cuban exile.
BOAN was a news and radio announcer in Quatemala

now believed to have been re-activated in Havana

approached on the possibility of working for
a local survey on "economic" aspects of

10. February 1960
Suly File
NOEMAYR is a Career Agent in Mexico City on Project LIEDGE. According
to Charlotte Zehrung he is to depart Mexico City for Hqs upon the arrival
of HEGARTY. HEGARTY is scheduled for a medical release about 23 Feb 60
and should arrive in Mexico about 20 March. After a few weeks overlap,
NOEMAYR should depart for Hqs about 1 April 60, ready to go to work."
According to Charlotte he prefers to take no home leave.
Apparently Mr. Gomez has been working with the Covert Training people
in an attempt to place him in that type of activity in a cover status.
Per Col. King on 10 Feb Covert Training indicated that they had no interest
in subject and Col. King requested the above information for use in his
contact with Col. Baird in a further attempt to place NOEMAYR with OTR.

4. WH Division plans to bring NOEMAYR to the States the end of
March 1960 in his capacity of a Career Agent. At that time a cover
will be arranged for him which will be consistent with his Head-
quarters assignment. Appropriate cover will be decided upon only
after consultation with your office if you decide to use NOEMAYR.
5. As a Career Agent, NOEMAYR will continue to be funded under
LISTS, his present project. All funds required to support NOEMA YR
and his activity will be charged to this project against the WH Divi-
sion allotment. In addition, WH Division will handle all administra-
tive problems connected with HOEMAYR, such as renewal of the project,
covert income tax returns, cover, etc. after coordinating such action
with your office.
6. WH Division has confidence in NOEMAYR and believes he can ba
of velns to CTR in its training program. The Mexican desk will be
glad to work closely with you in the handling of NOEMAYR if you se
desire. NOEMAYR is enthusiastic about his impending Headquarters as-
signment and is anxious to start work immediately upon return to the
United States.
7. If you decire any additional information on NOEMAYR, I will
be happy to make it available on request.

III. CONTRACT
}
NOZMAYR was first placed under contract by KUBARX on 1 June 1949.
He is now under contract as a Career Agent. He is a 05-12.
".
IV. COVER
NOEMAYR is operating under a notional cover. He supposedly was
sent by the "Public Surveys Institute" of Dallas, Texas, into Mexico
to investigate the prospects of establishing a Mexican affiliate. is
supplements his income by free-lance writing. He actually has had
articles published in Bohemia and Boys Life. Subject can show these
articles to support his cover. On one operational trip he took photo-
graphs which appeared in the New York Times and the New York Daily
Hirver. To further cover his sources of income NOENAIR has let it be
known that he owns property in Costa Rica and in Cuba and that rentals
provide him with monthly income. When Subject returns to the U.S.,
WH Division will request Cover Division to assist NOEMAIR in establish-
ing a new, back-stopped cover which can be used during his tour here.
Af
V. TRAINING
NOEMAYR received covert training at Headquarters during October
and December 1953 in all phases of basic tradecraft. He was rated
above average by all three of his instructors.
NORMAYR was given additional covert training in May 1958.

SUBJECT
Harold R. NOEMAYR (ps)
3.63
Feb 1960
1. Reference is made to our telephone conversation on 10 February
1960 regarding the possible use by your office of Subject. Attached
for your information are some facts concerning his personal and opern-
tional background.
2. NOEMAYR has successfully worked for KUBARK under deep cover
for eleven consecutive years. All operations officers handling sub-
ject and his training officers at Headquarters have commended his
operational capability and achievements. He received an official
commendation from the agency for his work in Cuba.
3. WH Division has several motives for wishing to bring NORMAYR
to Headquarters for a tour of duty.
a) After having lived and worked for so long under deep cover
without being able to mingle freely with Americans he needs to return
to the United States for mental and physical readjustments for himself
end his family. The fact that his wife has not been able to becoms an
American citizen and that his children have not had an opportunity to
live in the States has been of understandable increasing concern to
NOEMAYR. This, combined with the stress of his double life required
by his deep cover position and his non-association with anyone except
his Case Officer with whom he can discuss his work and problems has
been making him increasingly more tense during the last year or two.
HOEMA YR is an extremely capable Operations Officer and wil Division
earnestly believes that it is KUBARK's responsibility to bring this
man and his family to the United States for two years. Your cooper-
ation in this effort is being sought.
b) MOEMAIR, even though he has received Headquarters covert
training, still needs to be closely associated with Headquarters for
a tour to acquire additional background on operational techniques and
approaches and to be exposed to Headquarters' activity and thinking.
This experience is requisite to making a well-rounded intelligence
operator out of NOEMAIR and will certainly affect his future useful-
ness to KUBARK.
c) A Headquarters tour will enable NOEMAIR's wife to become
a United Statos citizen and permit his children to receive, at least,
a part of their education in the States.

In May, 1958, he volunteered to go to the rebel mountain head-
quarters of Castro, in Cuba, to obtain information for KUBARK. He
received a commendation for his work during this special assignment.
NOEMA YH was transferred to Mexico on 7 June 1958 where he has
been handling Communist Party penatration agents and informants.
He spent January 1959 in Cuba on a TDY assignment similar to that
he undertook in March of 1958, and for which he received his commenda-
tion.
:
VII. CUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE AND COMMENDATIONS
On 1 May 1953, NOEMAYR was in charge of an attempt to physically
penetrate the homes of Manual :DRA Valverde, President of the Costa
Rican Communist Party for the purpose of obtaining documents which
could be used to prove the Communist Party's contral over the Partido.
Progresista Independiente, a front which had been organized to par-
ticipate in the 1953 elections. When the sub-agent who was to actually
perform the penatration failed to appear, NOEMAIR, realizing the ur-
gency of the operation, voluntarily and on his own initiative made a
successful surreptitious entry, removing approximately 85% of the PPI.
documentation plus Commmist Party documents. On 24 July 1953 the
President of Costa Rica signed a bill outlawing the PPI. The parti-
cipation of NOTAR in the campaign to prevent the PPI from becoming
a legal party is considered to have been instrumental in its success.

In May 1959 NOEMAYR was awarded a monetary bonus of $300.00 in
recognition of his outstanding services on behalf of KUBARK in the
Sierra Maestra area during the early part of 1956. For his outstand-
ing performance on this assignment and his great devotion to duty,
NORMAYR received a personal commendation from General Caball. In
early January 1958 HOEMAYR volunteered to undertake a mission to con-
tact Cuban rebal leader Pidal Castro in the Sierra Haestra mountains
in Southeastern Cuba. Ho spent approximately three weeks in the noun-
tain hideout of Castro's headquarters during which time he even joined
them in an actual attack on the town of Manem illo.

VI. OPERATIONAL BACKGROUND
HOZMAYR was first recruited in Panama in November 1948 and
transferred to Costa Rica under the HUMANOID PROJECT. He success-
fully directed and exploited a high-level penetration of the Costa
Rican Communist Party. Among other accomplishments he recruited two
mail intercept agents, processing the take himself, and recruited
three additional agents. He also set up safe houses and was in charge
of the monitoring post in a technical surveillance.
In early 1953 he was transferred to the PESUCCESS Project with
additional duties as cutout under Project ESCROW.
In 1954 he transferred to Cuba under Project AMPHODARCH. Ha
want under cover as a student since he had one more year of acadendo
work to finish in order to receive a B.A. in Economics. In Cuba he
worked on ponstration of the Communist targets at the University of
Habana. During the same period he was also in contact with subver❤
sive oppositionist elements.
In May, 1957, Chief CI/ICD recommended that HOEMAYR be considered
for spot assignments of making recruitment pitches throughout Latin
America to CP targets. This recommendation was made after Mr. Paul
Purke, Deputy Chief CI/ICD, had an informal discussion with NOEMAYR
on 9 May on this subject. Mr. Burke believed NORMAR would be m
effective recruiter and NOS MAYR expressed an interest in such assign-
mants.

5. For the remainder of his tour in Mexico (his first year will expire in Jums
1959), NORMAYR believes that his present cover will be entirely suitable. However, should
KURARK desire to continue the same cover arrangement for his successor – at the end of
his normal tour it is suggested that thought be given to the establishment of a registered
affiliate of an American concern, with the accompanying requirement of securing the costly
·working papers necessary for regular exployment in Mexico. This would be particularly of
valus if his successor should happen not to possess the type of back ground that would
permit independent activity in cupport of his cover, as is vriting in NOEHAYR's case.

Attached is a cover review of the notional cover under which Barold R. HOGAR,
the principal exponent for Project LINDGE, has been operating. This conlysis Es mainly
written by HOWAYB, himself, with additions made by the Station. It is requested that
this review be sent to Cover Division for their study.
2. The following constitute the basis for which the station is requarting that
Project LIEDOS be rensued for the period 1 Hay 1959 through 30 April 1960:
a. As this is a support project for the maintenance of Hawld P. HORMAVE,
an outside case officer whose responsibilities comprise the ruming of operations
currently in progress against the Commist movement in Mexico, there is no direct
product derived other than that obtained from projects LICHEART, LIMAD and LIK.
-
b. As of 1 Jamary 1959, Project LIGHOUSE use transferred to a case officer
under official cover at the station, and must, therefore, not be included as one
of the operations under the direction of CEMAIR.
KERR ES continued to manage operations under his control very
Entisfactorily and fully justifies the expenditure of KUBARK personnal, time,
funds and the security risk involved. (For produé
(For production specifics, consult review
for projects LIONERART, LITER and LIHAD.)
a. Operations under jurisdiction of this Project are the primary projects
possessed by the Station against the Communist movement and are based on Priority
A requiresants of the Station's Related Mission Directive.
8. This Project has contined to satisfy those requirements necessary to
maintain an outside case officer under the Commmmist penetration pros

f. There is no change anticipated in operational plaming for
`
this Project, nor are there any changes believed necessary in line with altered
political or operational conditions or any other changing altuations."
g. During the period under review (1 May 1958 -30 April 1959) fundo obligated
total U. s. $22,270. It is requented that the same obligation be made for the
8.
period 1. Hay 1959 - 30 April 1960.
h. All Comitments are contained in the contract for Harold E. HEMRend in
oral agreements with subagents LIJERRY-1 and LIJOIFT-L.
1. LIJERSEY-1 contimes to serves cutout for LIHOLD-1, a high-level
penetration of the Partido Popular (PP) and the Union General de Obreron-Campesims
Mexicanos (UGOCM), but changes are anticipated in this status. Since LEXED-1's
recruitment by LLJERSEY-1 on 15 Augurt 1957, LINOLD-1 has been handled by LIJERSKY-1
in a loosely-controlled namer. LINCED-1 still does not submit sensitive inft
on his organisations nor docs he know that he is receiving funds monthly from an
agency of ODTIKE. HOEMAYR is currently attempting to obtain & direct interview with
LDXID-1 – að arranged with LIJERTEY-1 - in order to either establish direct control
of the agent or, on the negative side, to determine if WHOLD-1 should be terminated
Thus far, LIKID-1 has not appeared, for apparently valid reasons, at sny of the
scheduled mostings with NORMAYR. When contact is finally established it maybe that

1. As recorded in Readgarters files,
Ris brother-in-law, Marie CORDERO
Calderon, Costa la residing in San Juan Sibas, San Jose, Costa Rica, was once &
member of the Costa Rican CP. Mario's first loyalty had been to the CALCOILSIA party,
but since the latter was allied with the CP, a great deal of recruitment had taken place
within the allegiane. Kario drifted from CP militancy shortly after the 1943 revolution
2. If the cryanization so desires, all the factors are present for the recruitment
of Mario and return to CP militancy with a low to medium leval penetration as the
objective. These factors are as follows:
Mario COMME has been caretaker and therefore living in NORWAYE's
house in Costa Rica for the past two 75383. On &ID occasions during visits
in 1956 sed1957, NORWAYR converted at some length with Mario concerning the
Costa Rica CP. Mario Indicated very emphatically that be was dispeated with
then (party leaders) because of the corruption.
1s
b. Lettern received from Mario during the past year have indicated
change in this attitudo. Nario is extremely grateful to KSA for this
period of residence without paying rent. (Mario is a beaker of mæble
1262012).
3. HOFMAYE is reasonably certain that Mario COMDENO would accept such an offer
and could return to CP militancy without security problems. It is believed that with
a little guidance and manipulation, Mario could become a medium level penetration with
a relatively abort time. While not baying are then an elementary school education,
Mario is a stolia type simcro and determined in his own way. Once satisfied that be
could improve his lot by this service, he would land a steady and reliable service.

SUBJECT: Cover Review for Harold R. NORMAYOR
.
1. The leading factor that has been responsible for the maintenance of a suitable
cover arrangement for 110PAYR has been the flexibility and adaptability of EAR himself.
Without this person's fundamental ability to mold his cover around his personal qualifice-
tions, the notional cover story would not have been adequate in Mexico. However, to aste,
this cover has provided the added backstopping needed to permit NOWY to give a convincing
appearance of being gainfully employed and with no apparent inference to Y connections.
2. When NOEMAYR originally was assigned to Mexico City, he stopped in Dallas, Texma
en route here in order to visit the cover address of his supposed cover concem so that
ho could be avare first hand of the details surrounding this company. In Ecvember-December
1950 he became acquainted with several Texans who were considering business opportunities
in Mexico and - although they were not from Dallas - was able to successfully convince
than of the legitimacy of his business. In this case, as is usual with his general cover
story, he also shovel them published articles in Bohemia and Boys Life, written under his
true name, to further illustrate his varied means of financial support.
3. As stated above, the notional cover firm alone would probably not satisfy NŒEMAYR's
cover requirements, but when combined with his actual writing activitios, it furnishes a
fairly vall-rounded background stary. Thus cerges the basic necessity for this type of
Cover: sone large grains of truth mixed tastefully with the nebulous aspects of a notional
story.
4.
The exact manner by which NOEMAYR achieves this impression is as follows:
2. He mentions that his cover firm has sent him into liexico to investigate the
prospects of establishing a Mexican affiliate. HOEMAYR's absences from Mexico (once
in July 1956 for consultation in Washington and again in January 1959 on TDY to Cuba)
are thus explained as added surveys of this nature outside of Mexico - thus providing
the pattern of flexibility in movement.
b. To implement his income, 1OEMAYR has taken up free-lance writing and can
prove his accomplishments by exhibiting his published articles. His home has
- office space that is surrounded by popular literature, manuscripts and other
aids that a writer would normally possess..
C. To further cover for his source of income, NOEMAYR has let it be known that
he owns property in Costa Rica and in Cuba (places where he was previously assigned
the Costa Rican property is actual) and that rentals provide him with monthly income.
d. MŒEMAYR does not attempt, however, to mix with the American commanisty in
Mexico, but prefers to lend the general impression thathe wishes to get "dom to
grass roots" in dealing with the native environment. His residence is situated in
a middle to upper class neighborhood largely settled by Hexican families. He thun
creates the impression of a slightly "bohemian American writer who has adapted his¨
life during long experience in Latin America, to local conditionis.

1. In answer to your queries of reference, we wish to direct jour
attention to FHB 20-620-1, dated 28 November 1958, which provides information
on overseas medical benefits available from KUHARK. This new handbook should
be of great help in the future on questions of this nature as it sets forth
in one place EUBARK provisions for employee and dependent medical benefits,
together with the procedures required.
2. Section 2 of the handbook specifically states that Career Agents,
if they are full-time employees and citizens of PEPRIME, may receive all
medical benefits available to Staff Employees. Section 3a also specifically
states that Career Agents, if they are full-time employees and citizens of
FRPRIME, are eligible to receive the benefits of the KUBARK dependent medical
program.
3. We suggest that Subject forward to Headquarters receipts for his
dependent medical expenses, together with a statement from his physician
attesting to the nature of the illness, his diagnosis and treatment. Subject
should also execute Form No. 1126 as requested in Section 5a of the handbook.
to will submit the claim to the Office of Personnel for their review and
determination of any allowable reimbursement.
