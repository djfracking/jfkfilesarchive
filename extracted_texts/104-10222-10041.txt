28 September 1973
Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators
with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo
verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has
appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached
memorandum is what Archenhold wants.
Conein's service was verified with ROB; his "honorable service"
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the case with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-
ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD.
Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.

SUBJECT: CONEIN, Lucien

Major
10 April 1956
On 27 June 1955, Major Conein returned to Washington, D. C., after serving
one year PCS at Saigon, Vietnam, where he was with the Saigon Military Mission
under MAAG cover as. Major, U.S.Army. Upon Major Conein's return it was decided
that since no replacement had been found for him it would be necessary for him
to return to Baigon under the same cover arrangements he used for his PCS, for
a period of TDY. Major Conein wan informed by CFE/4/Support end VN/Support
Officer that CLA travel orders were being prepared authorizing him only 90 days
TDY in Baigon. These orders were signed by C.V.Hullck, DDP/EXO, CFE, LCB, MPD,
FE/CFI, CFI, and FE/BF. At the conclusion of the 90 days TDY no replacement
had been found for Major Conein and he remained in Saigon. No amendment to
his travel order won submitted, however, no extension by cable from Hewlquarters
Lat Mater and etter OY op res.
WAS AR
☑
'
Soph checking with MPD it was found that Major Conein, if he remained in
the field for even one year's TDY, would receive the maximum per diem rate as
prescribed by FIR's ($20 per day Jenn 1/5 for quarters which were being furnished)
and that this per diem rate could not be reduced. ACFE/4, ACFE/4/VN, and VN/Support
Officer discussed the entire case and since Major Conein had been informed prior
to his departure that he would remain in Saigon on TDY for 90 days only, a Form-52
was submitted reassinging Major Conein to a PCS status in Sagon, Vietnam effective
27 October 1955 (90 days after his TOY started). An amendment to the original
travel order was submitted to show the change from TDY to PCS effective 21 Oct.
Major Conein has been informed of the fact that he was made PCS effective
27 Oct. 1955, per DIR

Headquarters appreciates SLADE's reply to Ref b, and will make it a
matter for the record. For SLAUR'a
For SLADE's (and VILLIER's) information
has, in the course of his duties in Europe, come to the
Attention of the French, probably including the UNION organization.
Naturally, his former KUTWIN record is well-known to UNION and ke
is personally acquainted, we have since learned, with TUTOR himself.
Min R1-

Headquarters appreciates, too, the probable reaction of TUTOR to the
advent in the Indochina scene of VILLIERS, and possibly other
with similar histories. This is unavoidable and unfortunate; however,
under the circumstances Headquarters considers their nasignment a
hecessary riak.

4. In the case of VILLIERS, whose orders have just been received transferring
him to Saigon, if indeed his previous KUBARK connection is known to
TUTOR, it can only be stated that he, too, has been released back to
ODUNIT, at their or ODEARL's request, in response to their urgent need
for an experienced senior officer with his qualifications for a special
mission in Indochina.

5. This movement of personnel from one agency to another is by no means
an unheard-of thing. As you are aware, as in the case of French service
officers assigned to the to the TUTOR ORG, 30 are selected military
personnel assigned to KUBARK. Very recently two senior ODIBEX officers
on the KUHOOK Senior Staff were released at ODIBEX request by KUBARK
and subsequently transferred to ODTOWN, Thailand, with no further KUBARK
connection.
6. In spite of sincere protestations and denials on your part, we realize
of course that at least some bit of suspicion will linger on in TUTOR's
mind and that these suspicions will not be allayed by even the most
circumspect of routine contacts between persons in VILLIER's group and
members of the SIM Staff. Such contacts are bound to occur, particularly
if the VILLIERS group does indeed succeed in getting an IFTARCADE program
of any sort in motion. However, as we have stated, this is an accepted
tisk, and we have to play the gume out, even though we cannot aus238
the possible damage to the SIM liaison.

Dear Dick,
You will recall that it was my intention in 1951 to
civilianise and assume a staff position upon my return
from Germany. Since my return last August, however, I
have decided to return to the Army and, accordingly, I
signed a statement of category to this effect on 1 Decem
ber 1953.
This decision is in no way a reflection on you or
members of your staff but rather recognition that I cannot
afford to civilianize due to my personal obligations. I
intend to inform John itichardson of my action at the same
time you receive this letter.
Since I am at present holding a slot, I think it in
only fair to all concerned to have it filled by a qualified
person before my departure.
+
I want to thank you and Gordon for the trust you have
given me in the past. You may rest assured that I will
always to glad to be of service to the Avercy in the
military in the need should ever arice.
Yours truly,
i

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
:
Compromise of Cover
1.
As a result of information obtained from reliable
sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that
the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should
be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employees to
the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975.
We presume also that the identifications of these individ-
uals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese
to the Soviets.
++
2.
Although the personnel listed in the attachment
are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest
that their official personnel records should be documented
concerning the possible past compromise of their cover.
3.
Please coordinate any action connected with this
memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMG; and Chief, CI
Staff.

writing. The specific objectives are (1) ability to produce and distinguish the sounds of the language; (2) ability
to use a stock of basic sentences and expressions; (3) ability to recombine the elements of basic sentences and ex-
pressions and to apply them to new situations; (4) ability to comprehend the language spoken at normal speed in vari-
ous situations; (5) ability to write and read the language commensurate with ability to speak.
Methods used in all courses stress oral drills and free conversation based at first on memorized material and,
at a later stage, on varied reading materials. written and oral tests are given at Intervals. Ustening to and re-
cording on tapes in the Language Lab is essential for class preparation.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths of weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in prosective thair relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given on Section 8 to provide best
basis for determining future personnal action. Manner of performance of menagerial or supervisory Suries must be described, if
applicable.
This officer is personally acquainted with almost every senior official
or officer in the Vietnamese Government and armed forces, and with a significant
number of these this acquaintenceship amounts to close personal friendships
extending back over a number of years. These associations have given this
officer truly unique access to senior echelons of Vietnamese Leadership,
he has exploited this access effectively and to great value to the Station.
He has had long experience in this area, and uses his understanding of it to
great effect. He works very well independently and has shown considerable
initiative. He balks at no assignment, and carries out all assignments without
regard for his personal convenience, safety, or well being. In the field of
written expression this officer's performance falls somewhat short, but he has
made strenuous efforts to improve in this sector with some success. All in all,
he is an imaginative and dedicated officer who can be counted on to discharge
his duties with high effectiveness and total personal commitment. It has been
a pleasure to have had him at the Station.

Subject is a virtual walking oncylopedia on the history, customs
and senior personalities of Vietnam. He has been associated with this
arca on and off over the period of the last 10 years. During this
time he has developed lasting friendships with many individuals who
are now in high positions of power within the government. These
contacts are of considerable importance to the Station in its intelli-
gence appreciation of the situation and in the coordination of opera-
tional activities on a discreet basis with those high personalities.
At the personal request of the Prime Minister he has become senior
advisor to the Prime Minister's personal protection force and' has,
in fact, formed and trained this force from scratch. He is a highly
motivated and dedicated officer to whom considerations of personal
convenience and safety are always socond to his determination to
achievo whatever mission is given to him.
On the negative side, his written and oral presentation, while
showing some improvement over the previous report, still needs
additional improvement. Ho has no supervisory responsibilities at
the prosont time and therefore is not rated on that score. He
exhibits a good sense of cost consciousness in utilization of man
power, materiel and funds.

Subject is one of the outstanding Amorican exports on curront day
Vietnam. He has lived and traveled in the area for a number of years and
has continued a study of the area while absent from it. Many of the cur-
rent senior officers up to the general staff level were formerly Subject's
subordinates and regard him as a friend and colleague whom they trust and
in whom they will conride. This relationship of trust and friendship
fortunately also exists with the Minister of Interior who is the forth or
fifth leading personality in the government. Subject was formerly a son-
lor officer in the U.S. Special Forces and by virtue of his qualifications
and experience in this field has been of considerable value to this Sta-
tion in the extensive programs it has undertaken in concert with that -
command. He is additionally a skilled clandestine operator with a thor-
ough grounding in technique and a wide and colorful background of experi➡
ence, Bubject's ability to express himself in writing, while adequate,
can stand improvement. He is evidently sincerely attempting to remedy
this and some progress is noticeable. Overall, Subject is a distinct
asset to the Station and we are particularly pleased to have him. Subject
is a career agent and an amendment of his contract to reflect a promotion
to the next higher equivalent grade is recommended. It is likewise recom
mended that he be promoted from the USAR reserve rank of Lt. Col. to Col.
in order to increase his prestige in negotiations on behalf of the COB.

has proved himself invaluable to the Station and to the front office in
terms of his thorough knowledge of the Vietnamese scene, of Vietnamoso
personalities, and of the many issues involved here. I have personally
leaned heavily on his judgment and advice. Our high
Our high appraisal of Subject

it is a good Indicator of how much of the General's reporting-

applied field of philology, particularly in Vietnamese oral
linguistics and the working of official documents...
this paragraph was shown to SCHWICKRATH, he gave vent to some
very soldierly language, pointing out that he doesn't speak

Deletion of Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH from
Project IUJEWEL roster.
MEMORANDUM FOR:
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
1. Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH has been employed as
employed as a Career
Agent in Project IUJEWEL since 16 October 1961. During that
period he was assigned to the Saigon Station as a Staff
Advisor on Paramilitary matters to the Chief of Station.
2. When at the termination of that assignment,
SCHWICKRATH returned to Headquarters, it was assumed by SOD
that he would return to SOD and be again covered by Project
IUJEWEL. However, I now understand that SCHWICKRATH is being
processed for an assignment in WH Division and is, in fact,
engaged in language training for that assignment.
3.
In view of the foregoing, it is requested that the
name of Arthur R. SCHWICKRATH be removed from the Project
IUJEWEL personnel assets.

1. FE/Fers will not honor promotion recommendation to GC-U. equiv.
until field sends in a specific recommendation. This is the
way FE Operates. TE Division feels is their employes
until his tour in Saigon is completed. If SOD wants to take
action re the fitness report recommendation, Mr. Jorgerson
should discuss this with 'Faul Breitwiser.
2. FF/Per advised the field by KM "Personal note" from Mary Boulger.
that promotion from Lt. Col. to Col. is not possible. SUD/Pers
advised by FE/Pers that Department of Defense turned down active
duty status, for cover purposes because in addition to being -
a retired reservist, Ben departed for the field under Department
of Army Civilian cover and was arrigned to Saigon in that
cppacity. After his arrival it was determined
in
the field that he would represent himself as military. This was
Lever sanctioned by headquarters.

In view of present and past Fitness Reports, and
by comparison with other ZRJEWEL personnel, I believe that

the promotion of

FE/Personnel. Technically, however, the administration of

2. I would strongly recommend against any move to

he is at Saigon it might be possible to give him notional
or "assimilated" rank.

A FORMAL FITNESS REPORT ON ARTHUR R. SCHWICKRATH WILL
BE DISPATCHED SHORTLY. AD INTERIM, THOSE QUESTIONS RAISED IN
REFERENCE ARE ANSWERED BELOW.
2. ARTHUR R. SCHWICKRATH, ZR.JEWEL CAREER AGENT, IS ASSIGNED
AS CHIEF OF THE PARAMILITARY STAFF REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE CHIEF'
OF STATION. AS SUCH, HIS DUTIES ENCOMPASS PLANNING, OPERATIONAL
COORDINATION, FIELD INSPECTION, AND LIAISON WITH VERY SENIOR
GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM OFFICIALS IN THE INITIATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
OF PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, SCHWICKRATH IS THEXPRIMARY
STATION CONTACT WITH THEMMINISTER OF INTERIOR, WHO IS A PROLIFIC
SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCEMAND A MAJOR ELEMENT IN THE STATION'S POLITICAL
ACTION PROGRAM. SCHWICKRATH ALSO REPRESENTS THE STATION ON THE
ODYOKE COMMITTEE FOR PROVINCE REHABILITATION /THE SO-CALLED TRUE-
HEART COMMITTEE/.
3.
-
SCHWICKRATH IS NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED IN AGENT OPERATIONS,
BUT AS THE STATION SENIOR PARAMILITARY STAFF OFFICER, HE INDIRECTLY
SUPERVISES A NUMBER OF SUCH OPERATIONS /E.G., STGALLY/ AND HIS
ADVICE IS OFTEN SOUGHT ON MANY OTHER STATE AGENT OPTRATIONS
GECAUSE OF HIS LONG SERVICE IN VIETNAM AND HIS INTIMATE FAMILIARITY
WITH MANY KEY MILITARY AND POLITICAL FIGURES IN VIETNAM.
4. SCHWICKRATH'S DUTIES MAY BE CONSIDERED AS HAZARDOUS
WITHIN THE NORMAL MEANING OF THE TERM AS UTILIZED BY KUBARK.
SC PICKRATH IS FREQUENTLY INVOLVED IN OVERFLIGHTS UN FIXED AND
ROTARY WINGED AIRCRAFT OF AGEAS KNOWN TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE
VIET CONG. HE HAS,
HE HAS, IN ADDITION, PARTICIPATED IN INITIAL PHASES OF
CONVENTIONAL AND UNCONVENTIONAL MILITARY OPERATIONS AND IS A FRE-
QUENT VISITOR TO STATION FIELD INSTALLATIONS IN AREAS WHICH ARE
OFTEN UNDER ARMED ATTACK OF VARYING INTENSITY BY VIET CONG FORCES.

5. IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN STRICT PERSONAL
SECURITY FOR SCHWICKRATH. HE IS KNOWN TO MANY VIETNAMESE DOTH IN
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS HAVING BEEN ENGAGED IN VARIOUS INTELLI-
IN ADDITION, THE STATION
GENCE ACTIVITIES IN VIETNAM SINCE 1945.
HAS JUDGED. THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS BEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE CHIEF OF STATION IN VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND LIAISONS
WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY HE DE IDENTIFIED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
COS. IT WOULD BE BOTH IMPOSSIBLE AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE IN
SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HICE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION
WITH KUBARK.
6. DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR, SCHWICKRATH HAS ACQUIRED IN-
CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF KUBARK STAFF
WORK, BOTH AT THE INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGA-MISSION LEVEL.
THIS IS A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN
SCHWICKRATH HAS PER-
KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER.
FORMED THESE NEW DUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY
RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY
FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY
ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH
WAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESENTATIVE IN A RECENT CONFERENCE CONVOKED
BY CINCPAC IN HAWAII TO RECOMMEND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF
A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF
CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV.
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON-
FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS
FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV..
7.
I HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE
MEMBER OF OUR STAFF WITH AN INDISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND
BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO
GUERRILLA WARFARE. IT IS A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING
HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATION.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FE Division
SUBJECT:
Employment of Lou Conein.
1. At my request, General Lansdale has quietly checked
on the status of Lou Conein's retirement from the Army. He is
presently in Iran and is slated for return home and retirement in
August. He has made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian-
Government protested that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently,
he is doing a good job with them).
2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Lansdale
feels that any move on our part to accelerate his return would be
misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,
by ACSI. I am getting his address and will establish contact with
him by personal letter. Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious
to come back to work for the Agency.
