O'BRIEN:
Well, I suppose you had some conversations
with Dulles and with Bissell and some of
these people about it.
LANSDALE: Yes.
O'BRIEN: What's their feeling? You already discussed.
Di
sking you to sort of
hold your criticism...0
LANSDALE: Well, Bissell definitely felt the same way。
O'BRIEN:
Bissell was a very hard-working, intense person,
an
almost high-strung type of individual. He

became rather impatient with my questioning
i
of the changed concept when it took place. I thought
that

Initially, if they had the correct personnel &
and ✓ they had a correct reading of dissent
inside of Cuba, that was a fair chance to do
something. My only concern at the time was
did the CIA have the Americans who could work

with such a situation? I just didn't know.
∙yes,
of any, but I was assured that there were such
'A
Americans but I'm not certain that there were.
Did you question the kind of intelligence that
was coming out about Cuba and the expected
reaction of Cubans to an invasion, a

at all and certainly a thing with Dephon

and also the Pope thing are only taken by the
Agency after approval up at topside so as far

However, the objectives and
again,
the intent are approved, and not, the means of

doing it--the nuts and bolts--which are
supposedly overseen by an ambassador.

when we get down to the level of a country .

think much depends on the individuals?:
ambassador, and the station chief, and how
they get along, and again, mostly on the. .
Well, no, it isn't either; it's a fifty-fifty
proposition. We have ambassadors who don't

want to know or who are opposed all such things
and if an order comes down to do it, they very
unwillingly tell the guy to go ahead, but
watch it now, not too far. A station chief,

between the embassies 2 between the U.S. embassy

in, particularly, Pnohm Penh and Saigon?

LANSDALE: I didn't notice that. It might have existed,
and I wouldn't have even known that.
O'BRIEN: Well, there's some feeling among people
during
involved with Cambodian relations that time,
^
as I understand it, that somehow there's an
involvement on the part of the South Vietnamese
in some of the groups like the

he was telling the guy. Then how useful
this was, mind you; I don't know.
Well, do you find again, in passing on to
the task force and the formation of that.
Vietnam task force in the early part of
the Kennedy administration--do you find the
sensitivity on the part of the people, the
political appointees, to what's going on
in South Vietnam? Are you able to explain
what you're telling me right now about
South Vietnam to these people?

LANSDALE: Un only partially. They were as bemused by
the mechanics of getting decisions in Washing-
ton as they were with the problem that they were:
employing the mechanics to solve. It was all
sort of new to

LANSDALE: I don't know. I heard about it this first

it. It was very early in the administration.

was to brief him on something.
And I was
working on a number of intelligence matters
in Defense at the time and I showed up, and

after a bit, they asked me to come on and
they had me sit opposite the president.

that.' Well, he hadn't at all and there was

Just in very general terms. I didn't have

I think it's a shame that the guy's kept on

right back to him that I had sacked him and

just get belabored over that.
LANSDATE: Well, did Nolting ever try to get you back to
Vietnam, in an advisory position?
LANSDALE: I think so. There were a number of attempts
by the Vietnamese themselves, and unfortunately,
some of them were couched in terms of wanting
n.
me to come out as ambassador, by the Vietnamese: :D:D:D:D:D:_:_l
but Nolting and I had very friendly relations,

and I think he had proposed that I come on
out several times. But these things would
usually only come to me sort of second or

Kennedy had said something to the JCS because
suddenly my relations with the Chiefs went

finally asked General (Curtis E.] Lemay of
the Air Force, because I'm an Air Force officer,
what the trouble was. And he said, "You and
your ambitions to have four stars." I said,
"What's this again?" Apparently Kennedy had
said something to the Chiefs of, what would
they think of my being given four stars and
being put in charge of operations in Vietnam?

again, that isn't I'd want to do. So this
was about the time that--no, maybe [William

it was around that time.
Well, the task force really forms up the instructions
for Nolting, doesn't it& ...
LANSDALE: Yes.
O'BRIEN:
.. for the next few years. Just what kind
of recommendations come out of that task
force?
LANSDALE: Well, I was only in on the very original one,
which was to undertake some things such as
changing the specific types of things to
meet a situation in there. One of them was?:
we would get a political section that would
work out better relations with the Vietnamese
government, a political section in our embassy,
and that the foreign service would go and
search through their own personnel for people
with some real political savvy to get in to
guide, rather than control or belabor or have
confrontations with the Vietnamese government
n

--- Image 176-10030-10168_page_117.jpeg ---

to get the Vietnamese coping with their own
problems more effectively than they were
doing.

of the Taylor- Rostow mission, are you involved
in Vietnam on a kind of regular basis or
•
no. Off and on I was, but again with
second- and third-echelon type of problems.
^
n
I was seeing Gilpatric everyday and working
very closely with him, so that a lot of times,
as things would come up, he would discuss them
with me. But again, I was trying to explain
who certain people were that were named, their
backgrounds, and their qualities, and certain
events and places, and going to maps with

the situation really meant that was making
the problem. So I was fairly well out of it.

to carry out essentially political reforms,
and getting some of the just criticism of
the opposition considered in the governing
4
body. Another thing was on the police, of
getting police training done so that they
could cope with meeting enemy units, rather
than doing urban police work. In this, I
was begging them to at least get to a state
level
constabulary as far as American advisors were
concerned, and I wasn't certain that the U.S.
Army's military police could cope with it, but
maybe they could get a team of them in and
then I was pointing out that there were
constabulary officers and officers from other
countries, including South America and the
old Philippine constabulary, who knew the
law-and-order conditions--quite similar to
Vietnam--and bring them in if they wanted to
go international. I was trying to get them

on a premise that many people in Cuba were very

which surprised many of the supporters of
Castro as a guerilla and as

saw any attack or military trouble in Vietnam
