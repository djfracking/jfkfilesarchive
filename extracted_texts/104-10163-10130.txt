1. Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a
copy of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1969.
This memorandum sets forth information received that day by the
COS from AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture
in Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President
He is believed by many to be
Somoza. ZELAYA has cabinet rank.
pro-Communist although, as in the case of similar reports about
Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these allegations seems to
be produced.
2. When shown this memorandum, the LNPURE Chief said he
thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American
as reported by AMBIDDY.
3. AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard
Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States and
AMBIDDY "wondered" to the COS if ZELAYA could be exerting some
evil influence on Somoza.
4. The Station will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length on
this matter at an opportune time.

The Ambassador
11?
12 May 1969
Political Attaché
Statements of Jose Maria "Chema" ZELAYA
1. On 12 May I was contacted by a close friend of mine
who is engaged in negotiations with "Chema" ZELAYA which
may lead to the two forming a business partnership. While
my source is not normally a source of intelligence informa-
tion, I have found him to be a good observer and to be
reliable. He told me that ZELAYA told him the following
at a meeting on 9 May.
2. The ROCKEFELLER visit is merely a political maneuver
on the part of President NIKON to furnish an excuse if
anything goes wrong in Latin America. It is preposterous
to expect Governor ROCKEFELLER to learn anything about a
country in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to
the United States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about
his normal duties. NIXON will adopt those recommendations
regarding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable
to him, paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes
wrong, NIXON can pin the blame on ROCKEFELLER.
In this way
he has a scapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the
prestige of a potential political rival. No possible good can
come from this mission.
3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing
(bendición) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on
the blessing of the American Ambassador. In this respect he
has proposed setting up youth centers around the country--
places where youngsters can go to read good books, play
ping pong, etc. and the American Ambassador is interested.
--
4. My friend is of the opinion that ZELAYA is strongly
anti-American.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa
1. On 18 April I saw Subject again briefly and
told him that I would appreciate an opportunity to talk
to him alone. As he was about to leave town, he
promised to contact me again on his next trip to Managua.
He phoned me on 28 April. I picked him up that night
and drove him up to my house where we had a long conversa-:
tion over a couple of steaks and a good bottle of wine.
.
2. I told Subject that I had heard his name mentioned
in connection with such unsavory activity as fomenting
revolution in Panama and narcotics trafficking--from people
who don't know him. My reply to any such dirty-mouthing
is that Subject is a hyperactive type who keeps in contact
with all sorts of people, some of whom may be involved in
unsavory activity. This does not mean Subject is involved.
Indeed, I was sure he was not.
3. The provocation yielded desired results and in
the ensuing conversation Subject gave me a detailed
explanation of his present activities and financial situation..

7. As for possible sales of cattle to INFONAC,
Subject is working on a deal with SOMOZA which may
involve as much as a million and a half dollars.
8. Subject lives on commissions. He is now in
debt to the tune of $9,500 of which he owes $1,600 to
American Express and $3,900 to SOMOZA. When he has been
down and out three persons have helped him with handouts
of money to tide him over. These are Sixto MESA, in
the construction business in Miami; Jose Luis GONZALEZ,
in the lumber business; and "Tacho" SOMOZA. Subject plans
to pay back all three every cent they have given him. He
considers these handouts as loans. He is now trying
to consolidate his debts through a loan from Diners Club.
He is paying on his home mortgage at a rate of 5 3/4 percent,
quite low by present-day standards. Two Cuban Negro friends
of many-years standing live with him at his home. They
are taxi drivers and each pays $25 a week to help defray
household costs. One of these loyal retainers fired the
first shot during the Pilon sugar mill raid pulled off by
Subject's followers several years ago.
9. Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own
a piece of the Vizcaya restaurant in Miami although he
could have been a partner had he made a $500 investment
when the enterprise began. The owners are Oscar VILA,
Aramis PIÑON, and the cook, named Tomás (Inu). VILA
and PIÑON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion
and both are old friends. VILA has been rumored involved
in narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is. Some time
ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet reporter to do a
story on the Vizcaya. She found it to her liking and wrote
a favorable story but some unidentified character at the
Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya
and that Subject was one of the owners. Publisher KNIGHT
of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the
gourmet reporter's story to be printed. The restaurant
was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.
10. One of the persons most prominently involved in
blackening Subject's name is Rolando MASFERRER. Subject
classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba. One gets the
impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who
Subject says has been involved in narcotics trafficking,
were to say anything good about him.

11. Subject's only other possible connection with
narcotics involves a report he gave to Mr. DREW of the
FBI. This was as follows: Subject has a friend named
Carlos ARMAS who is skipper of a shrimp boat the "Sea
Cat". ARMAS lives at 1800 NW 34th Street, Miami.
At sea
in British waters (around some British island or cay in the
Caribbean). ARMAS has "fraternized" with a Cuban shrimper
"El Costero" captained by Antonio LOPEZ. LOPEZ has told
ARMAS that his boat, "El Costero", often carries aboard a
small, very fast speedboat. While anchored in British waters
this speedboat, with a crew of 3, is put overboard with a
"package" on board. It disappears only to return sometime
later minus the package but with large quantities of monay.
It then refuels from "El Costero" and heads for Cuba on its
own power. Subject and ARMAS think it probable that the
package contains narcotics and that Fidel CASTRO is raising
money this way. Mr. DREW of the FBI told Subject to tell
his story to the Coast Guard. Subject did but the CG said
they were not interested because the smuggling was taking
place in British waters. As far as Subject knows nothing has
ever been done about this matter.
12. Subject says that "politically" his program breaks
down to:
Keeping about 200 men ("my action men") ready
for action in case of a sudden change in Cuba
or a "gö ahead" on raids against Cuba.
Keeping on good terms with Edgardo BUTTARI and ·
Frank CONDOM who are both on good terms with
"Bebe" REBOZO who is in turn, an intimate
friend of President NIXON. (Subject asked me
not to discuss or report this owing to its
political sensitivity. It would seem prudent
not to accentuate this matter).
Keeping good relations with Nicaragua and
Haiti for possible future operations against
Cuba.
☐
13. I asked Subject if he had any dealings with Colonel
Angel ARAUZ of Panama in connection with efforts to everthrow
the government of Panama. He said that ARAUZ had teled to
get him, Subject, to furnish arms, support, and influential

Subject obtaine
the livestock from the
Montura Ranch of Florida.
C. Sales of Florida real estate.
Subject is not licensed to make such sales
in the U.S. but can sell to persons abroad.
(About two years ago he was selling lots
west of Miami near where a new airport is
to be built.)
5. Subject is now involved--on this trip--in a deal
with President SOMOZA to furnish well drilling and pumping
equipment for an agricultural irrigation system. SOMOZA
was approached by a British firm which somehow wangled a U.S.-
guaranteed 5 1/2 percent loan to underwrite the same scheme.
This low interest was better than Subject's contacts could
obtain initially and it appeared that the contract would
go to the British outfit. However, Subject's stateside
partner, a South Carolina legislator (state level), who
operates a business known as INTERGROW, managed to swing
the same deal and was due in town on 29 April to talk with
SOMOZA. SOMOZA told Subject he would give the business to
Subject if he and his INTERGROW friend could equal the British.
offer. As of 28 April prospects for consumation of a deal
looked good.
.
In
6. Subject is also trying to work out a deal with
SOMOZA regarding export of Nicaraguan meat. Previous
dealings with a man from S&W fell through when this chap
tried to "go around" Subject by dealing direct with Nicaraguan
meat exporters. At present Subject is dealing with SOMOZA
to buy meat from CARNIC and IFAGAN to sell in Miami to
the Northwestern Meat Company, owned by Elpidio NUÑEZ.
return for his cooperation in the meat business, SOMOZA is
to be given a 38% slice of the profita, The remainder would
be split up as follows: 16% to Edgarde BUTTARI, 13% to
Frank CONDOM, and 33% to Subject. SOMOZA is trying to
figure out some way to get his bite without paying U.S.
income taxes so the matter of spreading the profits is still
up in the air. Central South International inc. has an
account at the Capital National Bank of Miami; Subject showed
me an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $48,000
issued by this bank to be used for the meat export deal.

The Station has seen a copy of an FBI report of 30 January
1969, concerning AMBIDDY-1, which indicates, among other
things, that AMBIDDY reportedly claimed to have arranged an
interview With Mr. Richard NIXON at the time the latter was a
presidential candidate. Since the content and tone of this
FBI report differ somewhat from what the COS, Managua, has
learned in direct talks with AMBIDDY-1, there is attached

resulting from meetings with AMBIDDY in Managua.

He is usually accompanied by Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre,
Manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana, S. A. "Pepe"
is a Cuban and a close friend of mine. He is ARTIME's
closest friend in Nicaragua. ARTIME often stays at his
home. On a couple of occasions ARTIME has been by to
see me with another mutual Cuban friend, Primitivo
ABLANEDO, who used to live at El Bluff on the East Coast.
"El Gallego" ABLANEDO now lives in Managua and makes his
living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling
equipment. On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I
believe was named VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual
Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)
tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that
ARTIME has no connection with this enterprise. A couple
of times ARTIME has come by with Frank CONDOM, & short,
quiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry stores in
Miami. CONDOM is now pretty well-off financially and is
a good friend and business associate of "Bebe" REBOZO,
who, in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. I
believe CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the
meat deal.
t
4. ARTIME always comes with someone when he visits
me--not because he feels need for a bodyguard as some
suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to
drive a car and I live some distance out of town. Our
visits are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.
The last two times ARTIME has not had anything to drink.
We talk no operations or other such business. My personal
views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should
have dealt with him in the past, are rather hawkish and I
think ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although
he is well aware that they are not "policy."
5. ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections--
of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO. The meeting was arranged
through CONDOM. ARTIME has not claimed to me to have met with
Mr. NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency.
He has made it known, as is already well known, that REBOZO
is close to the President. He has also speculated that
REBOZO might have considerable say in formulation of the new

administration's Cuban policy. He expects this policy
to be more hard-line but has not specifically said that
REBOZO has said this would be so. He recently told me
that some of my ideas on enforcing the economic blockade
had been passed on to REBOZO.
6. In response to my queries as to what direction
ARTIME said in March 1969
the new Cuba policy might take,
that he did not expect the NIXON administration to address
itself to the Cuban problem before May of this year.
Then he expects a concerted effort to make the economic
blockade work. If that does not yield results, he expects
that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban
exile raids against Cuba from non-U.S. bases.
He hopes to.
be the man chosen to lead in this endeavor. Again, in
response to my questions, he said that exiles could be
trained in Nicaragua. He favors using Haiti as the actual
base of operations, i.e., the raiding parties would leave.
from there. He mentioned having talked with President
DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for
such operations.
7. ARTIME said that operations against Cuba would be
designed to knock out shipping and port facilities. He
has not recently referred to his earlier invasion plan
as outlined in MANAGUA 6752 of 23 October 1968.

termed elsewhere "the old exile hacks" who have not given
up. He really does seem determined to play a leading role
in unseating CASTRO. he is beginning to go to fat a bit.

he would do well to get into trim if he hopes to lead in
any military operation.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa
1. ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using
LANICA Airlines and frequently flying over Cuba. He is
aware of the possibility of a highjacking and says that he
would never make it out of the Havana airport alive if
the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.
2. He explains his trips as legitimate business.
One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms,
canteens, web gear, and similar equipment and supplies
for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise,
in which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber
and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua
to the States. He dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman
named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through.
At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying
to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in
Germany here. I have heard no more about this. A more
recent line is Nicaraguan beef for export to the States.
He says that he has made contact with the top man of the
S & W restaurants in the States. This man, after checking
samples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy all he can get.
The supplier at this end would be CARNIC, a meat packing
enterprise owned by President SOMOZA. (There is no doubt
ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may
be stymied by the import quotas, especially since Nicaragua
over-exported to the States in 1968 and had troubles as a
exported to
result.)
i
3. ARTIME drops by to see me at my home often although
not on every trip. His visits to me have been less frequent
of late. We have easy rapport. He knows who I represent.

Current Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Community
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
MICKE
FFB 24 1009
2400
BOX MCRO. SE
1. As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors
making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community. While we normally tend
to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they
relate to GPVALIANT.
2. The first of these rumors deals with a new group which has pre-
sumably been formed for the purpose of trying to deal through GPVALIANT,
Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,
Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly meets every Thurs-
day at different houses. The last meeting in January was held at the home
of Lincoln Rodon. At this meeting Prio presumably stated that Butari was
a better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando. The general
consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business
partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.
The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it favors
political and democratic solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they
really seek armed intervention. In this same connection Father O'Farril
has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-1 is once more connected with WOFIRM
and that AMCORE-2 has joined him. The rumor mill says further that AMBIDDY-1
and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit
encouragement of the above group. According to AMPALM-4 O'Farril himself
does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-1 and AMCORE-2 wanting to estab-
lish training camps. O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking
for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.
**
3. WIBALDA has picked up information quite similar to that learned
through AMPALM-4. He also has reported the existence of this group and
said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms
and equipment to overthrow AMTHUG-1. According to WIBALDA important mem-
bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticon, and Ortodoxos are in-
volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating
as groups in the movement.

4. Another rumor has it that AMOTEX-59 is also conspiring in
plans for future arned action against PBRUMEN.
5. The above information is being forwarded strictly as unfounded
and unconfirmed rumors. We are passing it along only because it represents
another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GPVALIANT. Ke
find the rumor concerning AMBIDDY-1 particularly interesting and suspect
that it may be an outgrowth of the recent report we have received from
AMCHALK-1 that AMBIDDY-1 has been contacted by ACSI.

he was reported to be trying to organize
a commercial strike in Leon and Managus.
He was arrested in November 1960 as a known
conspirator in an attempted revolution and
for having been involved in the clandestine
movement of revolutionaries across the
Costa Rican border.
Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre
On 2 March 1962 a report said he was a Cuban
refugee who talks anti-Communist but was
actually sent to Nicaragua to make Communist
propaganda. On 8 May 1965 he vouched for the
entry into Nicaragua of Jesus FERNANDEZ Suarez,
a Cuban (no OSN or Station traces). (Note:
FERNANDEZ is known personally to ZABOTH and to
the Chief of Station, whose opinions about him
are that he is a Cuban businessman who is
both anti-Communist and anti-Castro because of
the loss of his business interests in Cuba.
His principal business in Cuba involved dis-
tribution of the products of Procter and Gamble,
the soap and chemical company. He is now
manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana S.A.,.
an import/export and distribution firm in
Managua.) On 18 January 1967 the Guatemalan
Security Service requested traces on the subject,
along with a list of other Cubans. No reason
for the request was given to OSN.
Orlando CASTRILLO S., Bachiller
On 20 November 1965 he wrote a letter to La
Prensa, the opposition newspaper in Managua,
asking them for 30,000 copies of an anti-SOMOZA
caricature in order to sell them and raise funds
for university student grants.
German ARELLANO
On 17 January 1967 a report said he had bought
$5,000 worth of arms in Miami for illegal ship-
ment to Nicaragua, and they had been con-
fiscated by authorities at Miami. (Station card
shows subject's name as German ARELLANO Morales.
See JMWAVE-5188, 20 January 1967 and JMWAVE-5247,
24 January 1967 for further details of this re-
port.)
There are no OSN, SAC or Station traces on the other
persons mentioned in letter number 2 of the reference.
3. Both ZABOTH and the Chief of Station have discussed
with AMBIDDY-1 the "intelligence net" mentioned by the reference.
The stated Station position was "we are happy to maintain con-
tact with you and to discuss this matter from time to time on an
informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization
is that we do not engage in intelligence activities in a friendly
country except in coordination with the local government.
Therefore, even though you assure us that General SOMOZA knows
and approves this activity, we would have to have a direct re-
quest from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind
of an official capacity." This appears to have sufficied to keep⠀
our lines open to those involved without committing us to do
anything more than listen.

2. Incidentally, my secretary Eugenio Claude spoke with
a friend named Pedro Pino who lives at 1132 W 71 St., Hialeah,
Florida, 33012. PINO told him that his friend, Lourdes BELLO,
who lives at 1124 West 71 Pl.. Hialeah, Florida and who has lived
there for only a short while, has received correspondence which
must have been for the previous tenant at that address. This
correspondence came from Cuba and consisted of subversive propa-
ganda. All the correspondence is addressed to;

La Habana, CUBA of pepaganels to Co-tos Gonzale
Being that I was out and that my secretary knows Rafael LLANEZ
who works for Sangenis who works for you, gave him this corres-
pondence so that he might sent it to you. I have sent you the
propaganda which so far has arrived,
3. I have received from my father, in Cuba, a note with
stage in which he tells me that he intends to leave Cuba
under a false name. His message is very clear:
I am trying to arrange that the "nucleus" of Gonzalito
Penaranda leaves soon. NUMBER IS 117838,
Of course, he is referring to the Airlift from Habana to Miami.
I ask you to inform me if you can do anything in this regard as
think it is the last chance my parents have of leaving.
4. Please tell me if it is certain that Fidel intends to go
to EXPO 67 in Canada for the 26 of July as it has been rumored.
EXPO
If he is going, I would like to know if Commander Vallejo will go
with him as his chief doctor. When I was imprisoned, I received
many messages from Vallejo telling me that he was not a Communist
and never would change.

Dear Jim:
Miami, 23 May 1967
ARTILI - BIESA, MANUEL FRANCIS
I have delayed the trip to Nicaragua until Wednesday
the 24th or Thursday the 25th, because the Nat Harrison
Company, which is financing my trip, wants me to take
some documents to Managua.
I am sending you the signed reciept herewith.
It looks like Roberto (our friend over there) wants
Ablanedo to stay on for a complete month in Nicaragua.
If it is going to be that way then I will need the money
for this month also. If he stays it is because Roberto
orders him, and if Roberto orders him to stay, then
Roberto should pay.'

I inform you of the following:

1. The manner used to focus the case of Felipe Rivero
is absurd. They are converting him into a hero and a
martyr. In order "Not to be a slave of Yankee Imperialim”
even I had to make declarations protesting the imprisonment
of Felipe Rivero, although I clearly stated my discrepancy
against his ideology and principals.
Boch, the one from MIRR, is taking the anti-North American
campaign and turning his hate toward the United States on
this problem.
They could have taken Felipe Rivero out of the United States
without informing anyone, and then they could have informed
the people that he was already in another country. Or they could

with Venezuela in order to see if anything concrete comes

MIAMI, 24 April 1967
Dear Jin,
Pardon my lateness in writing to you but I have had to face
many problems and I wanted to be calm when I wrote to you.
I vas at Luis Somosa's funeral and I think that I made a good
impression. I am at prement more worried than I was before, but not
for my future, because Tacho is a very good friend of mine and Luis
was not. I am worried about Nicaragua's destiny. Let us not
forget that Nicaragua is the most solid pillar of Central America.
1-Lainos grew closer to Tacho during the funeral. Laines took
practically all the load of the funeral arrangements upon himself.
S-Many of the good men who gave the Somoza's advice were intimate
friends of Luis and they are afraid of coming to Tacho in order to
give him advice.
3-The Communists are aware of this and they are also aware of the
fact that Tacho is even more violent than Luis, therefore, they take
advantage of the situation to provoke Tacho, thereby hoping that
without Luis's advisors and possibly with the "bad advice" of "an
infiltrator" in Tacho's circle of friends/to rule his government
with an iron hand, which is just what the Communists want from him.
4-I think that Tacho has grown mụch closer to me and I will try to do
everything possible to see that he keeps calm.
L
5-There is no doubt about the fact that the Communists have brought
in a great quantity (of weapons into Nicaragua. The weapons have
not been found, in spite of the investigations by the Security Corps;
even General Montiel recognizes this.
6-Ithink that there is discontent in the young officer's ranks
because of the low salaries which the officials, sub-officials and
SHPIXERA
♫ enlisted men receive. This is not a problem at the present

--- Image 104-10163-10130_page_195.jpeg ---
L
14-00000
-2
but it could develop into a problem, if the Communists exploit
it skillfully.
7-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function
under the orders of Montiel, who is also chief of Staff and also
a merchant, loses all its efficiency because of the fact that Montiel
cannot dedicate sufficient time to the Corps and as a result leaves
its direction to Captain Willop, who I think is entirely incompetent
for the job.
8-I think that the only good thing that panorama has is the loyalty
of General Somoza's military troops, for I honestly do not trust
some of the high officials.
S-Jose Fernandes made the contact with the Nicaraguan girl who
received the proposition to study on a scholarship in Russia, at
the Patricio Lumumba University, and she is willing to collaborate
with us. I gave the contact to Carlos.
10-According to reports from Pepe Fernandez the "comrades" are
going to try to intensify their "infiltrative job" in the Nicaraguan
departmentsEx of Education and Agrarian reform.
The following is expected after 2 May, the day on which Tacho is
sworn in: sabotage, terrorism, and kidnappings. Provocations!
11-I sincerely think, and excuse me, that the United States should
now, due to the psychological state in which Tacho is in, demonstrate
that they have confidence in him XXX and in the success of his
He is grateful to the United States for the help
which the United States sent to him so that he could save his
brother, therefore take advantage of this.
Government.
12-According to the comments which I heard in Tacho's close circles
(Col. Sanchez from Lanica, Gen. Camilo Gonzalez, etc), Sevilla Sacasa
is not in very good standing with Tacho. I think that Washington
should become friendly with Tacho in a direct manner.

Querido Jim:
Perdona la demora en la carta, pero he tenido muchos proble-
mas a los cuales hacerles frente,y quería tener tranquilidad para escri-
birte..
Estuve on los funerales de Luis Somoza,y creo que causé bue-
pesar de que
na impresión. Pero ahora est más preocupado que antes
mi gran amigo es Tacho y no Luis,pero mi preocupación no es por mi fu-
turo, sino por el destino de Nicaragua.No olvidemos que Nicaragua es el
puntal más sólido de Centro-América.
1-Lainez logró macercarse más a Tacho durante este proceso .Practicamen-
to fué el hombre que llevó todo el peso de los funerales.
.
2-Muchos de los buenos consejeros que tenían los Somoza, estaban intimamente
ligados a Luis,y le temen acercarse al Tacho Para darle consejos.
3-Los Comunistas son conscientes de ésto y de que Tacho es un hombre más
violento que Luis,por lo tanto se aprestan a provocar al Tacho para que
éste,sin los consejeros de Luis y posiblemente con los "malos consejos"
de "algún infiltrado" en el circulo de Tacho, unido al caracter violento
del Tacho,lleve su gobierno a una mano dura que los comunistas desean
en Nicaragua.
4-Creo que Tacho se ha acercado mucho más a mí después de éste proceso y
yo trataré de hacer todo lo humanamente posible para que vaya por camines
de tranquilidad,
5-No hay dudas de que los comunistas han logrado meter on Nicaragua una
gran cantidad de armas, que no han aparecido a pesar de las pesquisa
de los Cuerpos de Seguridad;ésto lo reconoce el mismo General Montiel.

MIAMI, 3 April 1967
Dear Jim,
Pardon my lateness in writing, but I have had to run around
a lot.
are
The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss
1.
I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed
the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield
with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with
him (Genral Somoza); above all without even consulting
with me before he went ahead and did it, this put me in
a difficult position with the Government. This is what I
discussed with Carlos:
them
(a) The company will help me get him out (b) I will
tell Somoza that he
felong to
me
afe of us (c) I move them to
another place which is less accessible.
We agreed with
me on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave
to (b) was that T he planted the "other friend" in with
Somoza, and nothing else was said. Thank God that I did
well on that job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.
2.During Somozas' stay in the USA I have seen him frequently
and I have taken American investors, who wish to put their
capital to work in Nicaragua, to see him, We have conversed
copiously about his projects. He wants to do the following:
Turn over his power when his mandate is terminated. Raise '
the standard of living for the Nicaraguans. Give the

farmers the chance to take their products to big markets,
through the construction of highways, silos to store grains
and favorable legislation for the small farmers. The
only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence
that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are
diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he is
a member of the Communist Party or not; but the truth is
(I know him personally) that he is a social outcast, bitter,
A very intelligent and very ambitious. Furthermore, when
he tries to please someone he acts like their servant. If
he is not a Communist then he is easy material for the
Communists.
3. Somoza has promised me to continue to move the subject
of Cuba in the international spheres, and in his appearance
in "Weet the Press" he has already done it.
There is a "GARCIA" who is a syndicate leader of the
?wharfs? of New York, who through Adolfo Jimenez told me
about a new invasion that was planned for Haiti, directed
by me and leaving from Nicaragua. I responded negatively.
It seems that they spoke with others about the project and
rumor started which said that I was preparing an invasion
of Haiti from Nicaragua; I then went to see the Haitian consul
in Miami to make it clear to him and his Government that I
was not an adventurer, and that neither I nor the Nicaraguan
Government had the slightest intention of interfering with
Duvalier.

I do not think that Almeida has the control nor the
influence over the Army thak Raul had, and therefore a
conspiracy and revolt of the Armed Forces is easier.
There is no doubt that Fidel is assigning key posts to
men and women who are his personal friends, without
regard to whether they are good or bad Communists.
This
is going to bring about problems with the old guard of the
Communist Party and with the people in the new guard who have
been hastily taught Fidel's doctrine but have received
✓ Communist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).
It seems that Russia is very displeased with Fidel and
it would not surprise me if Russia would try to cause an
attack on him; we should insinuate this in the propaganda
against Castro for we know that his paranoic mentality and
his disgust for Russia would most emphatically make him
start to purify and take reprisals against Moscow's unconditional
demands; an atmosphere of tension would then be created
between Russia and Fidel,
The divorce of the Latin American Communist Parties from
their obedience to Moscow, seems to be a feeling of disgust
for Russia.
I have 200 men randy, who upon receiving weapons, can be
taken to Cuba in only 49 hours, in case of a revolt. Their
mission would be to overtake a town with a radio station
in order to take advantage of the chaos of the revolt and
establish a military Government that would be immediately
recognized by a number of Latin American Governments and

The consul has now told me that Duvalier wishes to speak
with me. I told him that I would be glad to speak with him
when he wished and when the interview would be kept secret.
I think that this interview could be useful, for I have
found that the Haitian Government has a grudge against the
U.S. I do not know what we will speak about but I think
that can get some good information for you (plural).
5. I think that we can expect violent revolts in Nicaragua,
in Panama, in Guatemala, and in Honduras (the opposition is.
in possession of many arms that have not been found yet).
This breakout of guerrilla warfare in Bolivia and Brasil
demonstrates Fidel's desperate strategy in trying to
start other Vietnams in America whether or not Russia is
in agreement.
i
I think that the dismissal of Raul Castro and Vilma Espin
from the key posts in Cuban Communism can cause an internal
revolt in disagreement between Cuban Communist elements and
we have to be on alert in order to take advantage of the
event so that it will not surprise as the "bloody rebellion
and cultural revolation of China" surprised us.
I believe that propaganda for CUBA should be centered on
planting distrust in the Armed Forces and on making Fidel
Castro appear unstable as a person. If he has not even
been faithful to his own "brother," then what can the rest
I think
of them expect if they are not even his relatives?
that we should emphasize the fundamental part that Raul and
Vilma had in consolidation of Castroim and its rise to power.

Querido Jin:
Miami 3 de Abril 1967
L
Perdona la demora en escribir,pero he tenido que correr mucho.
Los temas fundamentales que queria tratarles son:
1-Me disgustó cuando vuestro amico de Nicaragua le trató el tema 01 Gene-
ral Somoza antes que yo,de los"implementos" que teníamos en Blueffield;
sobre todo,sin haberlo consultado antes conmigo;ya que eso me colocaba
on una posición dificil con el Gobierno. Lo que yo traté con Carlos fué:
a) La compañía me ayuda a sacarlo b)Yo se lo planteo a Somoza como cosa
mía c) Los mudo de lugar a otro más inaccesible.
El quedó conmigo en consultar con la Comapañía y la respuesta fué que
el otro "amigo" se planteó a Somoza sin hablar” nada más.
Gracias a Dios pude salir bien del asunto, pero pasé mi momento desagra-
dable.
2-Durante la estancia de Somoza on USA le he visto frecuentemente y le
he llevado inversionistas americanos que desean poner a trabajar su
capital en Nicaragua.Hemos conversado largamente de sus proyectos.
Piensa: Entregar el poder cuando termine su mandato,Elevar el nivel
de vida del pueblo nicaragüense.Hacer asequible al campesino el sa-
car sus productos a los grandes mercados, mediante la construcción de
carreteras,silos para almacenar grams y una legislación favorable
los pequeñios productores.
Lo único que me preocupa, es la extraordinaria influencia que en mate-
ria económica,tiene sobre él el "Che Lainez".Sobre este individuo hay
comentarios muy diversos sobre si pertenece al partido comunista o no;
pero lo cierto es (lo conozco personalmente) que se trata de un recen-
tido social,amargado,muy inteligente y muy ambicioso.Además,ouando
trata de agradar a alguien,llema hasta al"servilismo".Si no es comunis-
es materia rhoil para el comunismo.
Somoza ma ha prometido continuar moviendo el asunto Ouba en las esferas
internacionales,y en la comparescencia on "meet the press" ya lo hizo.
4- Hay un tal"GARCIA" que es lider sindical de los muelles de New York,que
través de Adolfo Jiménez,me planted el asunto de una nueva invasión

6. Ablanedo tells me in a letter that ROBERTO, the 'friend"
from Nicaragua, has told him that he cannot go to Blueffield
until everything is taken out. That will take part of this
month which means that apart from the subsidy that I have
given him for last month I will have to give him this month's
also. Could the company help me with that? The subsidy comes
to $275.00 monthly. That is what I give to his family in
Miami. This does not include what he is spending in Blueffield.
7. Tell me if at last you know anything about the request
that I made for Mr. Manuel Guillot, for the Fundora widow
and for the poor, deaf lady whose husband is in prison.
That's all for now, if there is anything new to tell you I
will inform you of it.

Dear Jim:
Just a few lines to report the following:
1. I believe that Communism will concentrate on Nicaragua as
a point of attack.
2.
The men who have returned to Nicaragua after receiving
training in Cuba only acted indirectly in the bloody events
of the 22nd, because according to information gathered in
Nicaragua through "Pepe Fernandez," the "Sandinistas" communists
(who follow the Castro line) were awaiting the assassination
of the Somoza in Leon and this was never realized (carried
out).
These men were expecting an outbreak before Tacho
Somoza took over the Presidency of the Republic.
9. I am structuring. (building) an anticommunist intelligence
net in Nicaragua, which I have begun to instruct (train).
This net is composed of: Jose Fernández ("Pepe" Fernández)
Manager of Casa Hook. Rodolfo Jerez, Owner of casa "Venus."
Capitalist of various enterprises.

No hay duda de que Fidel está poniendo en los puestos claves a hombres
mujeres,que bueños o malos comunistas, son amigos personales de él,y és-
to le va a traer problemas con la vieja guardia del Partido Comunista y
con la nueva guardia que por encima de Fidelista,ha recibido un indoc-
trinamiento COMUNISTA (muchos de ellos simpatizan con Raul).
Parece ser que Rusia está muy descontenta con Fidel y no me extrañaría
que intentara un golpe de mano contra él;de todas formas, hay que insi-

THE STORY OF HIS DOUBLE AGENT ROLE CAME TO LIGHT AFTER HIS DEATH
WAT HANDS OF BKHERALD.” PRESUME THIS STORY KNOWN TO ADDRESSEES.
3. SLOTH-21 TOLD K-1 THAT "HAVANA" WANTED HIM AVAILABLE FOR

TAKE HIS WIFE TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT HE IS ON HOLIDAY. K-1 TOLD
BLOTH-21 THAT HE COULD MAKE THE TRIP IF HE HAD SUFFICIENT ADVANCE
NOTICE AND KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IS EXPECTED OF HIM. K-1 HAS INVITA
TION FROM CLAT OFFICIALS EMILIO MASPERO AND EDUARDO

AMBIDDY-1 CONTACTED JAMES D. ZABOTH 4 MARCH, SAID
HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID
HOT WANT TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR
TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS
LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP
ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS
AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-1 ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO
RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN
OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON
OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK
SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE
METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD
LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM
OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,
AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DUMP
WEAPONS AT SEA.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: 0 Termination of Manuel Artine Buesa
@ of Ecrit
LX-3212
willwormson
1. On the night of 13 January 1967 the writer using
the operational alias James E. Wilson met with Artime in a
room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose
of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association
with the Agency. This involved the obtaining of termination
Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover
the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and
obtaining outstanding receipts.
2. The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved
in the proceedings was accomplished without incident. There
was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had
done (or tried to do) for the Agency in the past and an un-
doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready
and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in
the future.
3. Artime made only one request--a rather passionate
one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members
of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)
members who were executed the result of operational missions
to Cuba and the wife of another who is serving a 30-year
sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing
receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in recent months
claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members
who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR
missions.) We are examining these three cases and if worthy
will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and
martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.
4. Artime has a sterile Headquarters telephone number
and a P.O. box address in Washington, D.C. He was not scouraged
in maintaining a loose contact by telephone or correspondence
if he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured
that if he ever had any "new" ideas, if he put them in writing,
they would be studied. It was, however, made very clear to
him that his formal association with the Agency was terminated
and that there was no prospect of any financial assistance in
the foreseeable future.

2. I acknowledge that should I again be affiliated with another

dgard BUTTARKT
:
1. Dr. Manuel Artine Buesa has been a close friend of
mine since we first met in Nicaragua in Inte 1966 or carly
1967. It was as a result of Artime's revelations at that
time that we recovered several tons of AORLD arms and
munitions which had been secretly buried at El Bluff. I
last saw Artine in Tegucigalpa in July or the first days of
August 1972.
2. Artine's business activity has narrowed down pretty
much to exporting meat from Central America and arranging its
importation into the United States at Miani. His principal
partner abroad is General Anastasio Sonoza Debayle of Nicaragua.
I am not sure with whom he deals in the U.S. although he has
mentioned on a couple of occasions a business connection with
Edgard Buttarri (not sure of this snelling) who, in turn, is
I have also heard

OF THE MEETING WAS AS FOLLOWS;
A. SOMOZA SAID THAT ARTIME COULD TALK WITH SCHICK, BUT SCHOZA MISHED TO
EXPLAIN HE CONSIDERS SCHICK AN INDEPENDENT AGENT AND NOT AN EXTENSION OF HIS
(SOMOZA'S) RULE. HE SAID SCHICK BY HIS OWN RIGHT HAS PRESTIGE, AND WOULD NEVER
CONSENT TO BE A "PUPPET RULER". AS FAR AS SCHICK'S FUTURE PROGRAMS WERE CONCERNED,
SOMOZA BAID SCHICK HIMSELF WOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH ART IME;
B. SOMOZA SAID NICARAGUA HAS GREAT INTEREST IN BETTERING ITS RELATIONS WITH
ERAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, AND AS AN EXAMPLE “SINGLER: OUT VENEZUELAS
G;. SCHOZA COMMENTED ON THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND MADE IT CLEAR HE HAS LITTLE

PART WITH THE COMMUNISTS.
ON 23 MARCH ARTIME MET WITH PRESIDENT RENE SCHICK FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT
TWO HOURS. SCHICK MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
A. THE IMPORTANT TASK FOR NICARAGUA IS TO RID ITSELF OF THE "DICTATOR"
TAG. SCHICK SAID THAT BY BRINGING THE OPPOSITION INTO THE GOVERNMENT, AND LETTING
”R
THE OPPOSITION SM " IN THE GOVERNMENT, HE IS CONVINCED THAT NICARAGUA CAN PROGRESS

C. SCHICK WISHES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN NICARAGUA AND COSTA RICA
AS WELL AS WITH VENEZUELA. HE SAID HE WANTS TO CONCENTRATE HIS EFFORTS ON INTER-
NATIONAL RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND THUS HELP
ESTABLISH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COMMON MARKET.
D. SCHICK IS CERTAIN IN HIS OWN MIND THAT LUIS SOMOZA HAS NO INTENT
OF RETURNING TO POLITICS, AND ADCED THAT HE, SCHICK, ASKED GENERAL "TACHO" SOMOZA
TO STAY ON AS CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES. HE EXPLAINED THIS AS GOOD POLITICS, SAYING
SOMOZA'S PRESENCE WOULD KEEP THE MILITARY IN CHECK AND ALLOW TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING
REFORMS. HE HOPED THAT ON THE EXPIRATION OF HIS, SCHICK'S, TERM OF OFFICE, NICARAGUA
WILL HAVE PROGRESSED TO THE POINT WHERE SOMOZA'S PRESENCE WOULD NO LONGER BE
NECESSARY IN THE ARMED FORCES;
.
NICARAGUA, LIKE ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA IS DISPOSED TO HELP
THE ANTI-CASTRO CAUSE CLANDESTINELY, BUT SCHICK ADDED THAT SUCH HELP IS CONDITIONED
UPON THE IMPLIED APPROVAL OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY. IF SUCH APPROVAL IS GIVEN.
ARTIME CAN COUNT ON NICARAGUA'S SUPPORT.
SUBSEQUENTLY, AS AN ADDITIONAL CONDITION, SCHICK SAID THAT IF PRESIDENT
KENNEDY APPROVES, AN AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE MUST BE SENT TO CENTRAL AMERICA TO
COORDINATE THIS EFFORT.
