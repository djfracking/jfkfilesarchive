Executive Order 11652 Appeals
Richard boyle Mahoney (176-150)

1. Summary of Recommendations:
Sustain the initial
determination to deny in tofo TDCSDB-5/655,740, an
intelligence report originated by Paris Station dated
19 September 1955 under exemption 5(B) (2) of Executive
Order (E.0.) 11652, and add the claim of 5 (B)(3) of
E.O. 11652.

Background:
a. Richard Doyle Mahoney, a member of the public
who is identified as a researcher, initiated on
8 January 1976 through the John F. Kennedy Library
a mandatory review of THCSDB-5/656,740 \ accordance
with the provisions of B.O. 11652, Section 5(C).
The request for review was forwarded to IPS via the
National Archives and Records Service (WARS) on
10 May 1976. -
b.
IPS responded to NARS on 24 Jung 1976.
Among other things, CIA denied in toto TDCSDB-
3/656,740, which was Item 9a on the NARS request, ou
the ground of Section 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652.

reply stated that the document had to remain
Classified indefinitely in order to protect
intelligence sources and methods, and stated
that release of segregable portions was not
feasible. This was based upon a classification
review by a knowledgeable officer with experience
in French-African affairs, dated 24 May 1976.
c. Mr. Richard Doyle Mahoney appealed this
determination directly to IPS in a letter dated
22 September 1976. He specifically asked if
it would not be possible to release a sanitized
version of the document without jeopardizing.
national security.
3.
Recommendations:
a. See the Appeals Review Forms for specific
detailed recommendations.
b. A second classification review was requested
by DDO/ISS/PICG. The second review was conducted
on TDCSDB-3/656,740 on 22 December 1976 by Europe
Division, which decided to retain the classification
at Secret in accordance with E.0. 11652. Europe
Division determined after review that there were
foreign policy and liaison sensitivities which
precluded downgrading TDCSDB-3/656,740, or
sterilizing the document and releasing portions
thereof, at this time. Specifically the report
describes in a critical and subjective way various
French governmental entities and French personalities
living and dead. The knowledge by the current
French government that this particular information,
or general information of this same type, had been
circulated at high levels of the U.S. government
would be detrimental to current U.S./French foreign
relations. Further, one of the individuals
mentioned is a former French intelligence operative
and cabinet officer. Relations with the French
liaison services are presently reasonably good,
and disclosure of information of this sort would.
undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on future U.S.
relations with French liaison services, as well as a
probable spill-over effect on U.S./French foreign
relations.

Dear Robert Young
IRS 75-4057
I am writing pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, % U.S. C. Sec. 552, et seq.,
to request that you provide me with any and all records, documents, memoranda,
letters and any information of any type or kind and in any form concerning me that is
on file, in the possession of, accessible to, or maintained by your agercy. If for
any reason you decide not to forward to me any of the information that I have hereby
requested, I further request that you identify the nature of the information withheld
and the reasons for your action.
I presently reside at 4401 Pine St., Philadelphia, Pa. 19104. I was born on 6 July,
1942. My social security number is 416-60-7822.
I ask you to waive any fees according to the Act which permits it when the request
"is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as
primarily benefiting the public." I think this is the case.
As provided in the amended Act, I expect to receive a reply within 10 working days.
Sincerely,
Elaine Fuller

2. Background:
a. On 22 July 1975, Ms. Elaine Fuller wrote
to CIA and requested all and any information con-
cerning her maintained by CIA under the EQIA.
She provided some biographic information and asked
that any fees be waived.
b. On 15 December 1975, IPS/DDA advised DDO
that two documents concerning Ms. Fuller had been
referred to CIA by the FBI.
c. On 19 March 1976, IPS wrote to Ms. Fuller
and enclosed sanitized versions of four documents,
three of which were DDO documents. Deletions had
Been made under (b) (1), (b) (3), and (b) (6) of the
FOTA. Two additional DDO documents (those referred
by the FBI) were denied in toto under the same
exemptions. The exemptions were explained, the
denying officials were identified by name, and
Ms. Fuller was advised of her right to appeal.
Ms. Fuller was also advised that FBI and INS ori-
ginated material was being referred to the FBI and
INS for their direct response to her request.
[N.B. When IPS listed the four documents they
erroneously listed the Deputy Director of Security
as denying document 1 and Chief, Services Staff
as responsible for documents 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
In fact, the Deputy Director of Security was the
denying official of document 4 and Chief, Services
Staff for documents 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. OGC should
point out and correct this error in their letter
to requester].
d. In an undated letter received by CIA on
26 April 1976, Ms. Fuller appealed the decisions
pursuant to subsection (a) (6) of the FOIA.

b. As stated in Paragraph Ic above, I
recommend that OGC, in their letter to requester,
correct the previous error in identifying the
deciding officials.
c. Document B-6 is a CSC that transmits an
accumulative machine listing to the FBI. This
document is updated periodically and previous
listings should be destroyed. Document B-5 is.
the updated and final machine listing for 1970
and superceded document B-6 which should have
been destroyed. I recommend that OGC advise
requester that document B-5 supercedes document
B-6 and contained the exact same information. I
further recommend that IPS draw this matter to
the attention of the FBI so future duplicate
referrals may be avoided.

listed in Tab B has been conducted. The documents
are properly marked and properly classified in

Dear Sir
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as amended (SU.S.c.
Section 552).
Briefly, my request is for information that may be in your files pertaining
no a U.S. paramilitary organization known variously as the American Volunteer
Broup, American Voluntary Guerrillas or Alternate Voluntary Government (all AVG).
As you know, the amended Freedom of Information Act provides that if some
parts of a file are exempt from release, "reasonably segregable" portions shall
be provided. I therefore request that, if you determine that some of the
requested information is exempt, you provide me immediately with the information
that can be made available. Of course, I reserve my right to appeal any such
decisions pertaining to "exempt" material.
I am prepared to pay reasonable costs for locating this information.

Dear Sir:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information
hot, 5 U.S.C. 552, et. seq., on behalf of a Quaker Action
Group (AAG). We, the undersigned, were the authorized
officers at the time of the dissolution of the organization.
We request that you provide us with any and all records,
documents, memoranda, letters, or any other type of kind
of information concerning our group that is currently on
file, in possession of, or maintained by your agency.
The full name of the organization is a Quaker Action
you. It was also known by its initials, AAG. The
organization was established in 1965 and existed until
.971. The main office was maintained at 20 South 12th
bureet in Philadelphia, PA.
If for any reason you determine not to forward to
as any of the information that we have hereby requested,
further request that you identify the nature of the
information withheld and the reasons for your actions.
As you know, the amended act permits you to reduce
on Weive the fees if that "is in the public interest
nus furnishing the information can be considered as
primarily benefiting the public." We believe that
this request plainly fits that catagory and ask you to
vaive any fees,
As provided for in the amended hot, we will expect
to receive a reply within 10 days,
Susan D. Levering
Sincerely,
George Willoughby

2. (U) Background:
a. Subject submitted a request under FOIA, on
22 March 1976, for any and all information the Agency
held on "A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AQAG."
In the 20 July 1976 initial response, 24 newspaper
clippings and one leaflet were released to him;
o him; two
documents were denied.
"
b. On 23 August 1976 Subject appealed, requesting
that further information be released to him on the group.
c. During the appeals review 11 additional documents
were located and are included in the recommendations
below. These documents were not considered during the initial
review since they were not considered to meet the criteria
for "records" extant at that time and they contained only
incidental references to the subject of the request.
d. During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject
of this request. The requester should be told that this
was apparently an error.
ei During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Department of State documents concerning
A Quaker Action Group. Two State documents located, and
possibly referred to in the initial response, do not
concern A Quaker Action Group, The requestor should be
informed that this was also apparently an error.
3. (C) Recommendations:
a. My specific recommendations are shown on the
Appeals Review Form attached to each document. A
classification review has been conducted and all documents
are considered properly classified and marked in accordance
with E.0. 11652, as amended.
b. I recommend that the two documents denied in toto
under the initial review continue to be denied. One of
them (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive
source. The other (Tab 4) was obtained through a sensitive
operation conducted jointly by American and German
authorities.

as applicable, to the denied portions.
recommendations on each of these documents is reflected
Specific
in the attached Appeals Review Forms. (Tabs 5-14).
One additional document located during the
peals review should be denied in toto, since it was
received from a foreign liaison service. (Tab 15).
88 FBI documents located during the initial
review, but not referred to the FBI, should be referred
to the FBI in writing for review and direct response.
These documents are listed under Tab 16.
f. One Department of the Army document should be
referred in writing to them for review and direct response.
The title page and a description of the document are
attached as Tab 17.
Five items from NSA have been referred to them by
APS for review. (Tab 18).
h. Several other documents turned up during both the
initial review and the appeals review should be considered
not responsive to the request since they refer to the
genèric term "Quakers" but not to "A Quaker Action Group"-
as specified in the request. (Tab 19).
4. (U) Mrs. Devine of OGC has concurred in the above
recommendations.

Despite the detailed explanation provided Kr. Singerman, we note fä liis letter
of appeal that he continues to souk a basis for the decision. With regard to
these documents, we believe and agree that releasing them to Mr. Singerman
would violata protection of sensitive sources and sathods. The original
denial is correct and should be upheld by the Information Review Committee.
4. Our review of the remaining three documents (items f., g. and n.)
has resulted in the following recommendations.
171-559663. A passenger list sich the Agency apparently
obtained through foreign liaison (Canadian). The nature of the
information, the passenger manifest of a Cubsa controlled ship, does
not pornit segregating and releasing parts of the list to Mr. Singaruan.
We believe the document is exempt under (b)(1), (b)(3) of the FOIA and
SB(1) of B.O. 11652.
b. MEXICO CITY 330. Provides the same information as RYA-37509
and is, therefore, exempt under the same exemptions cited in the original
doufal, 1.e., (b)(1), (b)(3) and 58(1).
.c. BX-3663. We believe certain parts of this 25-page document
can be sagregated and released to Mr. Singerman. We agree with ITC on
the selected portions that should be extracted for reloane (see attached
marked copy). The balance of the documoct, however, must be considerad
exempt under (b) (3) (a) and (b)(6) of the FOLA.
5. In summary, it is recommended that the appeal be denied and tha
exemptions upheld on all the related documents as listed above except in the
case of EX-3663. The selected portions should be sanitized and provided to
Mr. Singeriman. This recommandation has been discussed with Mr. Makowka of the
OCC and he concurs with our decision.

If they remained classified, the Agency was
requested to cite the applicable exemption
category from Section 5(B) of the EC
date when
E.C. and
automatic declassification may be
accomplished. They requested that the copies
of the documents be returned with the Agency's
response...
On 26 July 1976, IPS wrote to the
NARS and returned copies of the documents
Both documents were found to require continued classi
fication under E.0. 11652 Section 5(B) llowever,
I
sanitized version of Item #1 was found possiblé
and was enclosed. NARS could advise requester
of his right to appeal directly to CIA.
d. On 15 August 1976, Mr. Mahoney wrote
to the CIA and appealed the decision to with-
hold from declassification Item #2 of his
request.
3.
Recommendations:
Tab B-2 contains TDCSDB 3/657,851 dated
12 November 1963. During the initial review, the
document was denied in toto to requester under
provision 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended. The
document is based on ACL-1832 dated 10 November
1963. I recommend that the initial determination.
to deny the document to the requester in toto
under provision 5(B) (2) of E.O. 11652, as amended,
be sustained and that provision S(B) (3) of E.O.
11652 now be applied. The information is from
a sensitive source with unique access to a poli-
tical leader. If released, the information could
cause embarrassment to the United States Govern-
ment and exacerbate relations, with a friendly
foreign government.
a
b. During the DDO appeals review, a classifi-
cation-review was conducted.
properly classified and properly marked in accordance
The document is
with the provisions of E.O. 11652, as amended.
Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter,
meaningful sanitization cannot be made.

Freedom of Information Officer, DDO

Phillip A. Singerman
IRS 75-801 (Appeal)
Request for Agency documents
1. Attached are the three Agency documents listed in
our memorandum of 14 May 1975:
1969
a. Agency dispatch HMMA-37416, dated 23 June 1
This covering dispatch does not mention Subject by nane;
Subject's photograph was forwarded as an attachment to
this dispatch. Two other attachments listing Subject's
name on two flight manifests are not available here, but
the reference to his travel from Mexico city to Cuba had
been incorporated into a Special Channel memorandum to
the FBI, 5-561, dated 11 August 1969 (paragraph id of
our 14 May memorandum).
b. Agency dispatch HMMA-37509, dated 10. July 1969
listed requestor as a traveler to Cuba and listed his
passport number.
It also forwarded a copy of his passport:
in an attachment which is not available here.
C.
Special Channel Memorandum B-561, dated 11
August 1969 (see paragraph la above).
2. We believe that the above mentioned documents have
been properly exempted in our 14 May memorandua under (b) (1)
5(B)(1) (foreign liaison, in this case, two sections of Mexican
liaison) and (b)(3). The material is not segregable for re-
lease, as the nature of the information and its format are
such that the requester could determine that the information
'concerning him was obtained by the Agency through surreptitious
access to airline manifests and clandestine photography of
passports of U.S. citizens. Release would thus violate
protection of sensitive sources and methods (Mexican
liaison and a unilateral agent).

One more document (not indexed into the 201 file or
any other records of this office) has become available:
Transmittal Manifest 599888, dated 28 August 1969, forwarded
by COS, Ottawa. This manifest lists Subject among passengers
arriving in Canada from Cuba. No covering dispatch was used
and no source is given, but the information may be presumed
to have been provided by foreign liaison (Canadian). The
material is thus probably exempt under (b)(1), 5(B)(1)
(foreign liaison), and is certainly exempt under (b) (3)
(intelligence methods). The format and the nature of the
information do not make it feasible to segregate and release
it to Subject without making it possible for him to adduce the
Agency had access to the passenger manifest of a Cuban controlled
ship.
4. Attached is a segregable portion of internal Agency
memorandum EX-3663, dated 24 October 1969. This document is
a 25 page paper on the Committee of Returned Volunteers, and
refers briefly to requestor, repeating in part the reference
to requestor's travel as reported in HIMMA-37509 (paragraph
1b above), but also includes the fact that he served in the
Peace Corps. The excised portion of the document is considered
exempt under (b) (3) (a) and (b) (6).
:
5.
Also attached are copies of three additional Agency
cables. Mexico City 330, dated 24 June 1969, is referred to
in HMMA-37509" (paragraph 1b above), and provides the same
information (except for copies of passports). The reference
cited in this cable, in turn, is Headquarters 876, dated
24 June 1969, which requested that names and passports of
groups traveling to Cuba be cabled, as the information was.
urgently needed for a paper being prepared for the White
House. This cable in turn refers to Mexico City 329, dated
23 June 1969, which explains the reason for the investigation
of requestor's foreign travels. Although Headquarters 876
and Mexico City 329 do not mention requestor by name they
are attached for background information.

releasing six of the DDO documents in segregated versions
and denying the remaining 21. IPS advised Mr. Oglesby
that the non-DDO documents were being referred to the
originating agencies for direct response to him.
b. Mr. Oglesby appealed on 24 February 1976
:
requesting full release of all withheld data, and this
triggered an additional search with the following results:
(1) Nine press items, not considered under
carlier guidelines were located.
(2) As a result of an exchange of referrals
between the DDO and the O/S, DDO accented responsibility
for five documents not located during the initial
review--i.ė. those covered by Tabs 28, 30, 32, 33
and 34.
(3) As a result of a Privacy Act request levied
by Mr. Oglesby on the FBI, the latter referred three
DDO memoranda, per P 76-180. Two of these--CSCI
316/02677-67 and CSCI 316/05757-67--had not previously
surfaced, but the third had been handled initially
under Tab 19(H). We informed the FBI we would
handle the former two in the appeal.
(4) In addition to the documents discovered per
(2) and (3), 17 DDO documents were located through
re-checking files and running down references. These
additions have resulted in a total of 51 DDO documents
being treated in this appeal, an increase of 24 since
the IPS response, and nine pŕece items.

Four EX memoranda--895, 1070, 2187 and 3363-

Dear Mr. Wilson,
LOS/APPEAL
IRS 75. 4681
May 5th
On August 7, 1975, I made a request to the CIA under the
Freedom on Information Act for information, and documents pertaining to
the Africam Research Group and Nancy (Sam) Barnes. By letter dated
April 6, 1976, the agency agreed to release a newspaper clipping
and three censored documents. The remainder of the requested documents
were witheld.
I hereby appeal the agency's denial of my request for
documents on the grounds that the exemptions relied upon do not
apply to the requested documents.
In reviewing whether classified information pertaining the
to the Africa Research Group is till properly classified and therefore
exempted from disclosure under subsection (b) (1), you should be
aware that the ARG formally disbanded three years ago.
In addtion, I have reason to believe that the agency's initial
reply is incomplete. In particular, the documents released by the agency c
contain only one publication of the NRG. The documents already released
indicate that the agency was at least aware of other ARG publications.
I hereby request a copy of any catalogue list or index of these publications.
As to any documents or portion of documents which are witheld
after this appeal, I hereby request:
(a) specification as to whether the material pertains to Nancy (Sam)
Barnes or to the Africa Research Group
(b) as to material withled on the basis of exemption (b) (5),
names of any other agency which initiated or received copies of
inter-agency memoranda; and
(c) as to the material witheld on the basis of exemption (b) (7)
the authority for the law enforcernet activities of the
Central Intelligence Agency and the function of the investigation.
