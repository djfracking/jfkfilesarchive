MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:
SECRET
EYES ONLY
13
Deputy Director for Operations
Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-15
Thomas J. Keenan
WH Division recommends that Nr. Thomas J. Keenan
be promoted to GS-15
Mr
Keenan has been serving as COS, Kingston since
October 1973 He was selected for this important position
as a result of the high level of performance turned in by
him in his previous field tour as Deputy Chief of Station,
Lima In Kingston he has inherited a Station in which,
because of circumstances beyond control of Agency personnel,
the incumbent faces enormous operational and circumstantial
difficulties.
The Ambassador was declared persona-non-grata
"
last summer and concomitantly both the attitude of the
local security services with which we conduct liaison and
the attitude of Jamaican personalities of import has become.
increasingly hostile. Mr. Keenan thus faces a great
challenge in rebuilding operational activities practically
from scratch. In spite of the short time in which he has
been in place he is off to a promising start and has already
demonstrated the qualities of leadership and imagination
which we expected of him. He has shown soundness In
directing his two subordinate officers and in counseling
them on how to achieve desired: objectives in specific,
operational situations He has likewise maintained-ex-
cellent relations with the acting principal officer who
turn has shown himself to be a strong supporter of the
Station's effort
3% It is noteworthy that Mr. Keenan has been able to
maintain the Station's morale at an acceptable level in
the face of the extremely difficult law and order situation
in Kingston where personnel must live in constant daily
fear for the well-being of their dependents

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Thomas J. Keenan
:
1. During the first six weeks of the reviewing period,
Mr. Keenan continued as Chief of the Mexico and Central
America Branch, the Division's most demanding geographic
unit. His performance during this period continued at the
same Strong level detailed in the last Fitness Report.
=
During February, as part of a determined effort
to strengthen the Division's Operations Staff Mr Keenan
was moved up to fill one of the two Deputy Chief slots in
that unit As of 1 July, he was the sole Deputy of the
Staff. As set up in Latin America Division
America Division, the Operations
Staff had both staff and line functions
had broad
coordinating responsibilities with all elements outside
the Division, served as the focal point for all senior
staff requests for studies and reports, stimulated and
coordinated Division operational activities and reviewed
the effectiveness of Division programs. All Division
operational traffic flowed through the Ops Staff where.
better than 80 per cent of the traffic was released.
3. Mr. Keenan was assigned primary responsibility
for close review and staff action relating to the northern
area (Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean plus Guyana
and Surinam in South America). In addition, he served as
the staff referent for narcotics operations throughout the
Division and for Cuba operations worldwide.
4. I consider myself singularly fortunate to have
had Mr. Keenan as my Deputy. I assumed the Chief/Ops
responsibility in April 1977 and immediately discovered
that ground rules were different, legal strictures impinged
on many operational decisions, and the almost constant
senior staff requests affected one's ability to concentrate
on operations. Mr. Keenan was extremely helpful in pro-
viding substantive briefings, guiding me through the legal
and policy complications and pointing out the shoals. He
made many valuable suggestions on how to handle the work
load without drowning in paper.

is quick at distinguishing the wheat from the chaff.
does his homework and I have never known him to go off
half cocked. In making operational judgments, his initiative
is tempered by a healthy dose of prudence. Mr. Keenan's
writing is first rate; his prose is lean, often elegant,
and always precise. I have admired his talents as a
briefer. His presentations are balanced and detailed,
often spiced with his engaging humor.
6. Mr. Keenan's tenure with the Ops Staff was a very
intensive period. He normally worked an eleven-hour day.
and Saturdays as well. I take some pride in the fact that
there never developed an antagonist relationship between
the operating branches and the Ops Staff. Mr. Keenan
deserves much of the credit for this. While often taking
issue with branch positions and written work, he was
unfailingly courteous, good humored, and helpful. His
counsel was often sought on difficult problems.
7. A significant and time-consuming aspect of the
Ops Staff's work concerned screening operational traffic
for compliance with E.0. 11905 and ensuring that U.S.
person strictures were scrupulously observed. I found
Mr. Keenan's general knowledge in these areas unmatched
among the non-lawyers of the Agency.
8% Mr. Keenan shared with me the responsibility for
supervising the work of two operations officers and one
secretary. He is an excellent supervisor who manages
(despite the belief of some that it is not possible) to be
both exigent and pleasant. He cares about people, and as
noted in the previous Fitness Report, takes special
interest in developing younger officers.
9. In addition to his Operations Staff responsibil-
ities, Mr. Keenan served as the Division EEO Officer. He
also served for nine months on a time-consuming DDO task
force concerned with a threat against President Carter's
life. He performed these responsibilities with the same
thoughtfulness and effectiveness he applies to everything
else.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL continued
While I personally handled the first week or so of
the myriad problems associated with a wide-spread investi-
gation of an alleged plot against President Carter, I
subsequently turned the responsibility for it over to
Mr. Keenan and he represented the Division with the DDO, CI
Staff and Secret Service on this important and seemingly
-never ending problem area. This involved a lot of extra
hours work and had to be handled meticulously. He performed.
these responsibilities impeccably.
During the past year he made many contributions to the
smooth functioning of the division. Not least among them
was the fact that having fully familiarized himself with
US laws, Executive Orders, regulations, notices etc which
have increasingly affected our operations programs, he
ensured that our operational business was always in meticulous
compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of these
seemingly myriad "don'ts." Similarly, we had to produce
staff papers in a hurry, often synthesizing a great deal of
detail or alternatively presenting a great deal of detail.
Mr. Keenan saw that the job was accomplished on time and with
good style.
'
Although he was the junior member of the three-man
Operations Staff, on occasion he served as the Acting Chief.
He handled the COPS function with his usual dedication and
good judgment.
As the rating officer has mentioned, when the division
was reorganized in November, we decided to combine the Opera-
tions Staff's staff, but not command, functions with t those
of the Plans Staff. Mr. Keenan was the obvious choice for
this important and challenging assignment which will tax his
abilities and broaden his experience. He is one of our best
GS-15 officers and has additional growth potential in the
Clandestine Service. He is a good operations officer as well
as a good staff officer and is qualified to manage one of
our medium-size Latin America Division Stations.

10. The Operations Staff was disbanded in early November
as part of the Latin America Division reorganization. In
recognition of his splendid performance on the Ops Staff,
Mr. Keenan was made Chief of a combined Coordination/Plans
Staff with a T/O of six. This staff will retain most of
the coordination functions of the Ops Staff but not the
line functions.

most promising GS-15's in the Division. H

Mr. Keenan took over as COS Kingston in September 1974. This is h his
first COS assignment. The Kingston Station is composed of 6 staff employees
(including 2 communicators) and 1 contract employee for a total complement
of 7.

In reviewing the past fitness reports none has yet been written
specifically commenting on his performance as COS in Kingston. I will
attempt to fill that gap with this one.
The Station has been changed from basically a liaison Station to a
unilateral Station. Liaison has never been overly cooperative, but the
present COS has continued to develop the liaison, and at the same time has
moved out unilaterally. During the past year two access agents to the
Chinese target have been recruited (one being among the best in the Division)
and two access agents to the Cuban target. It has also acquired a penetration
of the local service who is especially useful against the Chinese target.
In addition, a surveillance team which was recruited in 1973 was developed
and used to the extent possible. The Station has become more active than
perhaps ever before in its history, with emphasis on the PRC and Cuban
targets.
From the past we know that Mr. Keenan an

as COS we now also see
that he can perform as a manager. Upon his return from Kingston this year
Mr. Keenan will attend the Army Hár College to continue his career development,

From January to July of this reporting period Mr. Keenan finished
his tour as Chief of Station, Kingston. In addition to himself there
were two other case officers at the Station. Its total complement was
7 persons. Mr. Keenan entered the Army War College in July 1975.
During the last six months of his tour, the Station had three things
going for it; a good access agent operation against the PRC target, a one-
on-one-relationship between à Station officer and a Cuban Embassy officer
and further development and exploitation of a member of the ruling politi-
cal party. Of these the latter turned out to be the most worthwhile.
This agent provided useful information on, key political developments in
the Jamaican government and the government party relating to its growing
relationship with the Cuban government. The

rather than vice versa. During this period the PRC access agent' was
most promising and was the best operation of its kind against the PRC
that the Division had.
Mr. Keenan's relations with the Embassy during this period were good.
No problems of any kind were noted. The operational environment continued
bad due to the high incidence of crime.
Ir. Keenan is an able, experienced officer with good personal presence
He is measured in his operational approach and in his management style. He
is a man of good judgment, has an agreeable personality and inspires confi-
dence; he can be counted on to do a creditable job without a lot of fanfare.

later found out that it was a most difficult situation--especially for
someone like Mr. Keenan with a large family of small girls. Given this
personal problem, it is understandable that Mr. Keenan did not perform

aggressiveness but at the same time enlightens them on the virtue of looking over
their shoulder at who may be after them as well as on the advantages of doing their
homework first. Usually the upshot has proved him right.
In running his own cases, Subject is meticulous and very thorough, preparing
himself for eventualities as well as maximum disseminable information. He has
personally handled two difficult cases while here and has gotten what there was tô
be had out of both. Each also had serious flap potential but there has been not
whiff of suspicion or of leakage.
Subject, as noted, before, has a cherry exterior that covers a deeply serious
person within. His easy and forthright manner has earned him friends in the
official Embassy, community and in the larger society as well All respect his
E
Judgment, his seriousness about his work and the issues of our time and his
eminently decent family life. All of these qualities should go far to make his
upcoming tour as a COS a success. We wish him well and expect in future to hear
only good about him and his work.

This report is occasioned by Subject's early departure from Lima, before end of tour
to assume the duties of COS in Kingston, Jamaica. That fact alone attests the esteem in
which he has been held by Hgs and, when the proposal for that assignment was made, also
expressed once again by the rater.
=
Subject had not yet completed his first two years as a DCOS and this was his first
crack at that level of responsibility. So his rise of late has been rapid, although of
course it is based on abilities and experience developed and polished in the course of
a number of tours overseas prior to his coming to Lima. These have all be

is going.
be
As DCOS in Lima, Subject has shown a high order of operational soundness, administra-
tive good sense, and conscientiousness about his work that permitted COS to delegate
vithout hesitation both specific problems in any area or even whole sections of Station
activity (e.g. narcotics) for him to carry out or to supervise. Subject is a prudent man
who thinks things through before acting. He weighs the pros and cons carefully, is quite
CI-minded (an indispensible attribute in this semi-hostile climate), and then acta
promptly. His judgment, while it tends to come down on the conservative side, is
invariably sðundly based, His periods of serving as Acting COS have been competently
handled as well, always within his understanding of what the COS would want done if he
were here.

However, all that he has achieved he has worked very hard for and certainly earned; and
despite the fact he has a youthful face and a somewhat boyish manner, he is not all that

for determining
This fine officer has been DCOS in Lima for nearly a year now, his
first crack at this level of responsibility. And for nearly two months
of that he was Acting COS during an interregnum which was made easier
for Hqs to accept at the time because of Subject's already acknowledged
ability and operational judgment
T
This officer has many laudable qualities He was an established,
painstaking professional with solid operational background. He has now
demonstrated that he is also good at management, at keeping things mov-
ing, and at finding time for the little details that so often make the
difference. He has a healthy respect for the opposition services
(international and local) and weighs his operational decisions carefully
in the light of their capabilities. In his present DOOS (and ACOS)
responsibilities, he also shows excellent political judgment
knowing
what will wash and what probably won't , what is acceptable risk (all
things considered) and what is probably asking for trouble. A prudent
officer, he looks before he leaps-or asks officers to.
71
This officer also has an amiable personality, warm and forthcoming
with all the people he deals with and deals with the more effectively
as a result This amiability (and the obvious decency and quiet
integrity of the man) does not for a minute, however, get in the way of
a good mind getting quickly to the bottom of whatever subject or
problem may be before him. He is especially effective working with
junior officers and subordinates explaining the background /CONTINUED/

ways proven himself as a koon, mature operations officer, supervisor

I have evory reason to believe that during this period his actions

The above represents the COS' end-of-tour rating of Mr. Keenan,
and following fairly close on the heels of the previous fitness report,
it adds little to the previous narrative.
Since the COS in Lima is physically located outside the Station
area, Mr. Keenan's normal function is to serve as de facto chief of
operations and office manager With the COS' departure in May, Mr.
Keenan was serving as Acting Chief of Station. Ho maintained the
tempo of Station operations and activity under what have been for
some time a rather hostile operational climate in Poru..

In the brief three months Subjuct has been at the Station, he has
moved rapidly not only to thoroughly acquaint himself with his specific
responsibilities but also with all aspects of the Station's activities
His oquable nature, ability to deal successfully with people of all
descriptions and dispositions and solid operational background make him
a most welcome member of the Station staff. As COS, I am particularly
grateful for bis services
Among his duties is that of supervising closely the activities of two
Junior officers which he does extremely well. Being one who readily
commands: respect they readily seek him out for advise and consultation
and are learning much under his masterly tutelage.
Subject is also coordinating Station efforts to penetrate the military
and is already achieving some positive results. A recent military
rocruitment was made by another officer closely assisted and encouraged
by Subject. The latter is now handling this new source, which could well
become one of the Station's most productive
Subject has clearly demonstrated his managerial talent and acuity in
the handling of funds and other resources. I would predict a most
successful tour of duty for this fine officer in Lima and foresee marked
progress toward Station operational objectives as a result of his
presence

characteristics is his decisiveness and ability to organize his time

misses a deadline. His work is thorough but cuts through verbiage

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL
I concur with the narrative comments and numerical ratings given by the Rating
Officer. I have found this employee to be a particularly mature case officer
who possesses an excellent knowledge of tradecraft and requires little or no
supervision to carry out his assignments. His work is of an excellent quality
and he has proved to be a definite asset to this station. His only area of
weakness is that he must be more assertive and aggressive in deväloping operational
contacts of use to the Station. This has been discussed with him and he is
planning to devote more effort in the future to correct this weakness.

ROOM
Mr. Keenan is an exceptionally strong officer. Following a
successful tour in Mexico, he was assigned to the WH Division Staff in
a capacity which required not only intelligence and a knowledge of
operational procedures, but also a good measure of tact and perception
in dealing with Branch personnel senior to him in rank and experience.
Mr. Keenan adapted himself to the requirements of this assignment to our
complete satisfaction.
Subject is industrious fast in his work, and enthusiastic.

be
The nature of a Headquarters staff assignment precludes specta-
Roular achievements. The excitement and glamor which make field assign
ments challenging and rewarding are absent here. Instead, there is a
routine and sometimes almost overwhelming flow of paper which has to
be massaged and managed, dull as it may be. Many a young officer
motivation did not measure up to this test Those officers who work
on a desk or a staff as effectively and cheerfully as they do in the
field are the ones who are likely to possess and develop the qualities
needed for senior positions Mr Keenan is in this category. He has con
siderable growth potential. "IFICATION AND COMMENTS:

He has a good manner, is energetic, responsive, and bright, and
his attitude is thoughtful and perceptive. I would assume that he

Subject's duties and responsibilities as an Operations Officer are
characterized by managerial and supervisory responsibility for several
Important operations. Although subject's grade (GS-10) is considerably
below that of all other Station Operations Officers, it is noted that his
dutles, responsibilities and authority are comparable to those possessed
by officers with two to four grades higher rank.
Subject is a mature, competent, conscientious and thoroughly de-
pendable officer who always performs his assignments in an excellent
manner and willingly assumes responsiblities which are usually associated
with officers of higher rank.
Subject does not have any significant weaknesses. His command of
the Spanish language is entirely adequate for most operational needs and is
continually improving.
Based on subject's personal qualifications, hla past performance and
his very weighty and Important operational responsibilities, it is strongly
and urgently recommended that subject be promoted to at least GS-11 and that
serious consideration be glu

Oct 25 2 32 PH '61
Subject, a Case Officer at this Station since 3 February 1960, continues his
outstanding performance in assignments normally handled by a Case M89 a
considerably higher grade.
Subject carries out his assignments with a minimum of supervision and is very
willing to accept responsibilities of any type assignment to him.
Subject is rated very highly in Section B of this Fitness Report and this has
been donɑ because Subject has earned these ratings in his own right and in comparison
with the work done by other Case Officers at this Station.
It is strongly recommended that Subject bo given special consideration for
promotion. It would be unfortunate for KUBARK to lose a man of this calibre through
neglect of his career promotions. In addition to this superior work, Subject is the
head of a family of six (6). As a result of his low salary, he is relegated to an
inferior standing in the local society, based upon what a man can acquire through his
earnings. Subject's contacts and currently high standard operations require that he
spend and appear to be making considerably more than he fo currently paid by KUBARK,
It would seem unreasonable for KUBARK to expect a man of this calibre to make high
level contacts and yet not be able to represent himself as a man in the economic level
which his responsibilities represent

Dear Mr Bush's
I am pleased to report that Mr. Keenan, Central Intelligence Agency
Civilian, was among those who successfully completed the course of
instruction at the US Army War College during Academic Year 1976 and
was awarded a diploma
This report is my evaluation of Mr. Thomas J. Keenan during his attend
ance at the US Army War College from 4 August 1975 to 7 June 1976.
Attendance at the US Army War College is based on a highly selective
process, and only a very small percentage of all those eligible is chosen..
The evaluations herein are made in relation to this outstanding group of
individuals. No attempt is made to distinguish between graduates on a
rank order basis.
Mr. Keenan was one of eight civilians (three from the foreign affairs
community) in a class of 227. This total includes 187 Army, 16 Air
Force, ten Navy, and six Marine officers of colonel or lieutenant colonel
or equivalent Navy rank.
In a class structure such as that outlined above, the task of the civilian
student at the USAWC 16 an especially challenging one. Working in an
area outside his normal milieu, his was a dual responsibility On the one
hand, he had to acquaint himself in considerable detail with the military
aspects of national security with which, in most instances he has had
relatively little, if any, previous experience To accomplish this require-
ment; he did extensive background research in the areas of military policy
military strategy, and defense management to keep abreast of his profes-
sional military colleagues. On the other hand, his foreign policy expertise
was in heavy demand by his military colleagues. In consequence, his
contribution to various international relations aspects of seminar group
efforts tended to be disproportionately large Moreover, as the sole
civilian voice in a seminar group of fourteen highly experienced
military officers, he also ensured that adequate weight was given EVOLUTION

to civilian viewpoints in the group's discussions. Much, therefore,
depended on his ability to develop rapport with his military colleagues
and on his intelligence, knowledge, skill and persuasiveness. In a very
real sense he was a teacher as well as a student.
Among the objectives of the curriculum is enhancing the competence of
selected officers to assume command and leadership responsibilities and
to function in key staff assignments in major Army, joint, and combined
headquarters and in planning and policymaking positions at the seat of
government. To achieve this and related objectives, the curriculum con-
sists of three major segments: The Common Overview, the Electives. Phase,
and the Military Studies Program. The Common Overview segment includes
four courses: The United States and the World Environment, Command and
Management,
In the Electrategic Military Studies, and the Military Strategy Seminar.
In the Elective Phase, students take at least four elective courses out
of an offering of 54 courses.
of 54 courses. The large number of selections provides
an for students to tailor the curriculum to meet professional
needs. Participation in the Military Studies Program is optional and can
be substituted for one or more electives, depending on the scope of the
research subject selected. In addition, the ten-month curriculum includes
voluntary programs and field trips.
Mr. Keenan acted as assistant seminar group chairman in the core curriculum
course entitled, "The United States and the World Environment. He and
one other student edited the final seminar report, and he wrote that part
of the report dealing with US policies in the Western Hemisphere, including
an excellent treatment of the Panama Canal negotiations Mr. Keenan was
also assistant seminar group chairman during the "Strategic Military
Studies” course, and again his facile pen was put to good use on the
editorial subgroup. His
His calm, steadying approach to issues won the respect
of his military colleagues, and his extensive knowledge of Latin America
was particularly valuable to the group's deliberations. In the "Military
Strategy Seminar," Mr. Keenan proved himself an excellent student of
strategy and an articulate, well-prepared debater in the seminar discussions.
In the electives phase Mr. Keenan took four courses (the required number);
'The Power Potential of Developing Nations Contemporary Issues in US
Foreign Policy, "Strategic Issues of World War II,
World War II," and "Third World:
Dynamics of Social Change"; he audited "Latin America: Power Structures
and the Current Scéne, Mr. Keenan prepared carefully for his elective
courses and contributed his views in a concise, orderly manner.
Since the vast majority of the Army War College student body live together
on the post, a very important part of the overall War College experience
is the social and extracurricular interaction which takes place outside
the lecture hall and the seminar rooms. Some civilian students at the Arøy
War College need considerable time to adjust to the military subculture
but Mr. Keenan enjoyed a relaxed camaraderie with his military colleagues

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for restesing officer's comments.)
The incumbent is a quiet, low-key, but highly energetic and competent
professional officer in his chosen field. He has discharged the
responsibilities of his first more or less independent command in an
outstanding way. His manner is always crisp and efficient, and as
nearly as I can determine, he runs a tight ship while at the same
time commanding both the affection and respect of his staff. His
manner towards me has invariably been responsive and supportive.
Given the inherent difficulties of the relationship, I have deliberate
ly put pressure on him from time to time to determine
time to determine his reactions.
As a result, I am confident he has been fully candid with me and has
shared any information which might be relative to my concerns and
activities. We have been passing through a particularly difficult
phase in Jamaican-US relations, in which the slightest misstep by
any US Government agency, but particularly by the incumbent and his
people, could have been seized upon to possibly embarrass this mission
and the US Government. The incumbent has been sensitive to these
dangers, has consulted with me at every turn and has taken whatever
steps are possible to reduce the risk while still meeting basic
requirements.
2247
Beyond his professional specialty, the incumbent has been an important
part of our Embassy family. As a member of the Country. Team
he has
always offered his views when asked if he felt he had a contribution
to make, and I have often found them to bo most helpful. He has also
served as the mission'a représentative on the board of the Priory

Continuation of FRQ Jeremy L. NIARCOS (Section 12):
demonstrated considerable planning and leadership ability
which the station has tried to develop by placing him in
charge of Soviet and Bloc operations and using him as our
informal Chief of Ops. His excellent judgement and pro-
fessionalism has already earned him the respect and con-
fidence of his colleagues as well as that of COS who
values subject's advice greatly.

The purpose of this memorandum is to call your attention to existing
policies which are particularly material to you while you are integrated

status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:
1.
As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and
salary of 08-9-80135
per annum, you will accept cover employ-
ent with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred
to as your cover facility") effective as of
January 1960
You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this
organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies
of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional member of
that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being.
effected at
and salary of $5540
F8S-10
per annum.
You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retain-
ing emoluments paid by your cover facility.
2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your
overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed
tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour
consists of a period of two (2) years
from the date of your arrival
at your overseas post of duty.
for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of
duty, an currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organi
zation in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour
of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas
assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circum-
stances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control
or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organiza-
tion before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed
above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will
not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your
dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request
termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience,
unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization
to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the
regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year
of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty,
you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses
for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from
the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

A portion of your annual and all of your sick leave which
has accrued to your credit at the time of your integration shall
transferred to your cover facility. The remainder of your annual
leave will be held by this organization in escrow pending the com-
pletion of your integration. If the sum of your accumulated annual
leave with your cover facility and this organization exceeds the
maximum accumulation entitlement afforded you under the regulations
of this organization, the excess will be forfeited. If possible,
such forfeiture will be accomplished by reducing the leave credit
in your escrow account with this organisation. While integrated,
you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home leave, and
leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover
facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization Upon
completion of your integration, your accrued annual and sick leave
will be transferred to your credit with this organization. If
security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-
sum payment for accrued annual leave, you will be required to pay
the gross amount thereof to this organization including income
taxes withheld by your cover facility.

the Espionage Laws, dated 25 June 1948, as amended, and other applicable
laws and regulations The termination of your employment with this
organization will not release you from the obligation of any security
oath you may be required to take.

Mexico where he began as a junior case officer and developed
rapidly to the point where he was handling an extremely heavy
load of important and complex cases. He operated against Soviet
Bloc and related targets, ran support projects, surveillance
teams, and technical operations. The experience he gained was
broad in nature. Also involved was the supervision of up to 30

supervision and is quick to profit from the guidance of his super-

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the
Agency the responsibility:
"to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security,
b.
make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the ordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national
security;
c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government
d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies such additional services of common concern as the National
Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished
centrally;
"to perform such other functions and duties related to
intelligence affecting the national
Council may from time to time Security as the National Security
direct.

The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency
to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the
investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time
consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks
includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and
availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered
This is called "clearance" of an applicant.
..
2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware
perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-
clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of
specific reasons is made to the applicant.
3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk
taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants
are not cleared.
Statement of Understanding
and Agreement
I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-
erations.
I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No.
