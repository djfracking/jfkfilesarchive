is quite vague and is not conclusive in any way, but it is
hoped that, by using it as a trois for our investigations,
more concrete details regarding the Party's present activi-
ties in Cuba, as well as identification of individuals named
in reference, can be obtained. Copies of this report are
being furnished to our field stations in Nexico and Buenos

of "Giovane Italia" that it was inadvisable to demonstrate against the sentences
imposed on students who participated in the November riots. Instead, he
invited then to concentrate their efforts and attention on preparations for
20 March, promising that he would authorize student demonstrations on that date.
3. It is rumored that a new clandestine organization, composed of approximately
260 youths who are members of the MSI and other parties, is being formed
under Bruno HARSETTI ("SO Comment: Bruno MARSETTI is possibly identical with
Salvatore ASETTI.) This organization consists of action squais of twenty
to twenty-five men, each squad being under one leader. 12-SETTI was expected
to return from Rone during the weekend of 23-14 January with arms and funds
for this organization. In the opinion of source, these arms and funds are
supplied by prominent Masons in Rome and Milan. Source stated that the or-
ganization is being formed with the knowledge of GEFTER-NONDRICH, although
the latter attempts to evade any responsibility therefor.
4. The action squad leaders most daily in different locations to discuss progress.
At the present time they have no headquarters. Their principal tack appears
to be the formation of plans for demonstrations on 20 Marca. They state that
20 March will be their day of revenge against police. The following persons
are leaders of action squads:
Constantino DE MARCO
Aurelio ALESSIO
Pasquale BUONAIUTO

REPORT No.350
1 Results of our first conversation with a roung man from TORREL VEGA,
SANTANDER, about 28 years old. At the beginning of the war he was in the
army in MOROCCO and spent the whole war in Franco's army. He comes from a family
of small garage-owners. Neither he nor any of his family have belonged to any
political party or syndicate although his sympat:ies have always been on the left.
SPANISH ATTITUDE TO THE REGIME AND THE WAR. He says that the immense
majority of the Spanish people is against Franco and the Falange, workers, peasants,
exployees, bourgeois, big and small and a large proportion of the soldiers
and the Roquetes. He says that everyone hopes for the victory of the Allies.
In it there is a blind trust, especially when the U.S.. entered the war as the
U.S. and England are the most powerful countries in the world, especially with
the assistance of Russia. Only the Falangists desire
Only the Falangists desire and plan for the victory
of Hitler, even though there are many Falangists too who take a very black deur
of "kin","He says the majority of people sympathise with England. They have
complete faith in the Hctory of the Democracies. There are sup orters of the
USSB, but the immense majority, according to our informant, do not like "commurd sa®
and prefer Democracy. He is obviously rather muddled by the Falangist pro:aganda
against the U.S.S.R. Be says that the entrame of the U.S.S.R. into the war gave
rise to happiness all over the world, although there had been a great deal of
confusion before, through the "Treaty of Ald between Russia and Germany. But this
confusion disappeared with German aggression against the U.S.S.R. He says that
the German defeats on the Russian front raised morals and renewed' everyone's
confidence in victory. Hitler's admission in his speech of how much they had
suffered in Russia in winter, and that they were on the edge of catastrophe,
produced great joy mong the people. He says that the entry of the U.S. inte
the far caused a very gobà ingression; and increased palplats confidence in
victory although Pearl Harbour caused some demoralisation. He says that no
vishes Spain to enter the war, except the Falangists. Franco does not wish

himself; and desires neutrality out dince those who command are Serrano Sunar
and the Palangists, Franco had no choice but to do what Hitler orders him, and
there is serious danger of war for Spain. He says that the Anglo-Soviet and the
Soviet American pact are known through the Palangist press which has spoken of
them. They made a very good impression on the people. Asked if he knew that
the said pact stipulated that after the victory nations would have freedom to
decide their destinies without foreign interference. No says yes, the press
published it. About the Second Front he says that everyone thinks of it, and
is hoping for it to o en if possible through Spain. That the day they disembark,
all the people will rise. Asked what the people would do in case of a landing
in France, he said that his o indon was that if that happened the Spanish
people would rise, even though the invasion was not on their coasts. The agreement
about the Second Front is also known. He says the people who are most fervent
supporters of the Nazis are Serrano Suner, Primero de Rivera, and a certain
Count whose name he does not know. He often says that he knows nothing of politics,
because he only read the sports news in the rapers and did ot want to know any-
thing about the Falanga. He says that there are many preparations for war; they
are maiding fortifications on the coasts of Calicia and placing a considerable
amount of artillery there. He says that the political force of the Falange and
the syndicates is Partificial": ev ryone hates them. The peo, le belong to the
syndicate because they can't help it, but they do not pay their dues or take
them seriously. Discontent has even reached the ranks of the Falange. Many
clorks, students, and people was joined it thinking they "were going to steal the
music" are now vay discontented, and do not pay their dues, and when they are
threatened with being expelled they say that is what they are waiting for, for
the Falange to play at "fisticuffs". There are many officers in the army wo
are not in agreement with the Falange or the idea that Spain is to go to war.
The most molent op osition comes from meipo de Llano and Yague. No one knows
where queipo is going and Yaque is thought to be in exile in the Prov. of Pontevedra.
Both were cashiered, Quaipo for protesting against food leaving for Germany and
Yague because in a speech at Zaragoza, he said *we do desire a great and
-
free Spain, but without any Elue Shirts, Red Shirts, or prisoners."
All the sergeants say that they are very discontented, because they earn
5 pts. w ich keeps them very short and of the soldiers he says-"in a word they are
hungry, many years in barracks, and then the danger that they might be sent to
war". He says that they are well-uniformed, just as well as before the war.
They have dismissed the 1941 Draft. He thinks that there was very little sympathy
for the Division Azul and the people laughed at those who volunteered. 40%
were forced to go, others went because they were hungry, and there were/volunteers.
He says that survivors came back in a state of panic, there was a lack of food
and equipment, several of them mutilated themselves in order to escape from
this inferno. All say that the Russians are very well-armed and fight with
great courage.
-
HELP TO THE NAZIS. He says that his opinion is that a great deal of food is
taken to Germany, although he can give no details, but if there is no food and olive
oil in Spain where is it? He says that in Torrelavega the "Fabrica Continental"
is working at high pressure, making tyre covers, while in Spain transport is hald
up for want of them.
-
"
THE CHURCH. He says that it is not true that in the Church there are anti-
German and Anti-Falangist groups. The supporters of the Regime are the Falange,
the Germans and the Clergy, in that order. The Church, wishes for the triumph
of Germany, in spite of her anti-Catholic policy because they believe that in
that case they will be able to preserve their position of influence.
He says
that English and Russian news can be heard although it is very difficult and is
forbidden although there is no watch or inspection. He says that everybody is
against the Falange and submissions to Germany, including the monarchists and the
rich on whom to Falangists impose large fines for racketeering. Many of the
monarchists, bourgeois etc. are on the side of England. Democracy is considered as
a possible substitute for the Regime. A democratic Republic like there was
before the war. ▲ Regime of peace and work. Speaking of the solution of the
present situation, he says that they want a regime of peace and not a revolution.
That he contradicts himself by saying tit will not be achieved by peaceful
means. He says that this would be the best but that the deaths, the betrayals, the
crimes must be avenged.

The people are very united and there are not the old differences between the
parties of the Frente Popular. The policy of National Union is unknown, he has
heard no one s; eak of it.
DETAILS F THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGER
-
He says that he thinks that secret
organisations function, especially in. Bilbao and he says particularly "It is
a city of brave men". He says that notices rainted on the walls are aften seen
there. He only remembers one "Less Franco, more wite bread". Asked if
the nitices were signed by any party he says no, because would ive away
the people who had done it. He says that he knows, because he was told, that
in Bilbao there were illegal pamphlets and even a newspaper in circlation,
but he does not know their content. He thinks that there ust have been a
clandestine press, but as he was never an idealist the people who did these
things would not trust him, and as he is out of everything he does not know
any details". He says he thinks that the people working in "ilbao are
nationalists and communists, especially the latter. That age- enths ago
two Italian submarines, badly damaged by English planes, came into Santander.
Two hundred persons were arrested for discussing this, and many people
thought that the second front has already begun. He gives no more details.
He says that Serrano Suner was the object of an attack in Madril when he met
Arress, and when the latter tried to protect Suner he was seriously wounded
and had to undergo a critical eration. Asked if he thought there was
sabotage etc., he says no – the disorganisation of the train services is due
to all the employees being new and not knowing their business.

It was
GUERILLEROS - He says that "El Carinoso" was working in Santander and
"The Railwaymen" too; that "El Carinoso" came from Herrmes and had his
headquarters in Santander. That he was recently killed through quarrels and
imbroglios caused by his girlfriend who was from the J.C. and had another
lover, and it was he who was arrested at the same time as El Carinoso.
he who informed against them all. Many people love the Juerilleros, al though
there are many people help them through fear, as for example a relation of
his from whom they tolk is only pig, but in general the Guerilleros behave excellent
ly. "El Carinoso" was once in Barcelona, where he went in a cab to get his
teeth fixed. ☑ Carinoso was not a politician but took to the mountains in
order to avenge the death of his cousin who was assassinated by the Falange.
That they often, like the guerilleros of Asturias, disguised themselves as Civil
Quard, went down to the villages, and arrested the Falanists. But where there
are most Querilleros, and the most active, is in Asturias.
Six months ago,
about three hundred guerilleros were ready to embark on the coast in order to
leave Spain. But there was a quarrel and a terrific fight between these quer-
illeros and the forces of authority, with many dead, and after that they
retreated to the mountains. He says that the politicians xde who are
most po ular are Prieto and Asana. Some speeches of Prieto's have been cir-
culated through Bilbao, but he does not know what they say. 'here is also in
circulation an article, reproduced from an English paper, reprinted by an
employes in the Real Comp. Asturiana, de muz. Republicana. The article refers to the
powers ani resources of the Allies and their chances of victory. He says
he does not know of any activity of the communists, that this is obviously the
activity of other people who are not communists; that for example the man who
reprinted the article and those who read it were all on the Republican Left; and
if there is any communist activity it is so camoufla-ed that no one knows who is
the author. He says that during the crossing they were detained by the English
in Bermuda and in Baltimore by the Americans. That the English made a short
examination, they did not interrogate them in front of everybody and left
them the letters they carried. In Baltimore they were interrogated one by ne
and were asked about fortifications, food, if they sent it to Germany, etc.
When our informant said he had been in Franco's army up to the war they asked hims
why he did not desert to the Republican army.
SOLIDARITY.
He says
there is no organisation for solidarity, that this only
exists between groups of friends who have a relation or acquaintance in prison.
They are not allowed to visit the prisoners more than once a week. He says that
the killfar goes on, and that in Vog, a few days before he left, a lieutenant
of the Civil Quard was shot for having gone for a walk alone at his own risk*.

inhabitants, sc that her district which is wine country, gets less sulphate

REPORT No.352
-
Information volunteered by three Galiciar easants, not members of politica
parties. They remained throughout the war in Franquist territory, although only
one of them fought in the army. Vary backward politically, anti-Franquist,
and more anti-Falangist. Bith the exception of one who was in Asturias as a
soldier, the others never left their village which is a hamlet in Galicia.
The majority of the Spanish people
SPANISH ATTITUDE TO THE WAR AGAINST HITLER.
with the exception of the very rich and the Falangista are against Franco and the
Falange. They explain that Falangists see what is coming to them through the crimes
they have committed, and they are the people who really wish for a German
victory, with the object of saving their skins, and the money they have stolen
from the peoṛle. In Spain, in general, no one wants the war, since they are
exhausted, according to our informants, except for the Falangists. It is said
that Franco is a partisan of neutrality, and daily visits the British Ambassador
at his private residence and has interviews with him. In spite of this they
say there is a danger of Spain being pushed into the war against her will, because
in Spain the Germans are the masters. All the world believes that the Allies
will be the victors except the Falange. Before the attack on Rusd a many people
were demoralised by the German alvances and began to #think them invincible".
When Russia entred the war, enthusiasm and confidence in Hitler's defeat
increased enormously, but that was especially when the Russian victories began.
They say: - I do not know what would have happened to us but for Russia;
the Naxis would be masters of the world. They also say that the Hasi army
will not stand another winter of war, that they have suffered such losses that
the next Russen winter offensive will defeat them although there is no talk of
a Second Front. They are sure that the Democracies will win the war. They
admire the resistance of the U.S.S.R. They say that Germany has already lost the
war as a consequence of the losses suffered in Russia. The entrance of the U.S.
into the war contributed to increase the already existing confidence in victory.
They do not know of the Anglo-Soviet and Soviet-American agreements, nor the
agreement about the second front. One of our informants asked us what "O Hitler
1942ª"meant and when we told him he said that they also said it in Spain, because
in order to achieve it it was necessary to open a second front. They think that
if there was a landing in France the people would rise. They also say that
there are rumours that they land in Galicia and in this case the whole of Galicia
would revolt to help the Allies. The same thing would happen in any part of Spain.
The "DIVISION AZUL" is hated by the majority of the people. They say that the
majority have been forced to volunteer, and explain how the recruiting is done.
Anyone who does-not-want-to-go_and_fight Communism, take a step forward. Some
enlisted because of the desperate situation they were in. Some enlisted, too, bec
because they were stalwart Falangists. Then the recruits left the province
a great many people went to see them off, calling them "sons of bitches" and
insulting their mothers. Then one contingent of "Volunteers" came back from the
Russian front at Irun they had to leave the train because the people were stoning.
them. Many people box came back maimed and with frostbite. They tall
terrible istories about the Germana and the horrors of the war. They say the
Russians are very brave and fight with great courage. That they have large supplies
of an unition, and that things on the Russian front are not like the papers said
they were. They said that the food on the Russian front was very scarce and bad.
It was sent to them from Spain and they suffered many hardships. They all
wished to return to Spain as soon as possible; they repented of having enlisted.

prestige are Prieto and Asana and Negrin, although Negrin is the most, hated

FUTURE PROSPECTS.
He thinks of the Republic as the Regime to substitute for
Pascism, but without a revolution, and he immediately adds that the Republic will
come because when the Germans are at their weakest the whole people will revolt
and avenge the crimes of the Falangists. The people's blood rises when they

hate the Requetes less than the Falangists. They say that the schools teach
only militarism and religion. There are many little boys who can hardly
read, but who can speak of military operations with maps, artillery and aviati an.
A teacher who was dismissed and came back to his post, told our informants that
the Ministry constantly sent them books of military tactics, so that they could
teach them to the children. The summer camps for children consist of sanding
boys to camp and teaching them drill.
-
GENERAL SITUATION OF THE PEOPLE, They spoke of the terrible poverty endured by t
the people, and the high-price of food; wages have hardly been raised in compario
son with those paid under the Republic. The Committees of Supply get hold of
agricultural products and only leave a small quantity per person for the whole
year's supply. Already in their village the Falange had listed the crop although
they had not yet requisitioned it, which they had already done in other parts
of Galicia. Falangists speculate in foodstuffs, selling them at high prices
and so get rich. He says that in Vigo a large quantity of rice went bad and had
to be thrown into the sea because they would not sell it to the people at lower
prices. The rationing is quite inadequate. They were a whole year without seeing
olive oil. Maturally on the Black Market it could be bought at 50 pts and mare,
In a year they only had bread twice. A very mall meal in a restaurant costs
16 pts. Two courses and dessert 25 pta. One of them was charged 75 pts. for
eating and sleeping in a pension in Vigo one day. A pair of shoes costs
25 pts., a poor suit 500, a dosen eggs 18 or more pts. The people hate the
Committess of Supply used by the Falangists to make themselves rich. They
say that there is the greatest immorality in all official organisations and
everyone steals.
In the prisons there are still many people. They treat the prisoners very
badly. In the prison of Oviedo, which has a capacity for 600 there are more than
5.500 prisoners. There are batallions of forced labour (workers they call them);
they grant some people conditional liberty but they send them to districts where
they know no one and where they die of hunger.
Generally these three young men have great confidence in the victory over
Hitler, and say Germany may break up this very year.
REPORT No. 353
Information volunteered by an ex-Consular official of the Cuban Governmen
in Spain, who arrived on the "arques de Comillas" on the 25 th of July 1942.
The subject is a person of quite good economic position. He is the sons of
Spaniards and owns some properties in Asturias. He went as Consul to
after Fran.co's troops had taken possession of it. A man of moderate views,
politically of the persuasion that was regnant there at the moment, he honestly.
believed, doubtless as a result of Falangist propaganda in America, that
"Franquist Spain was a paradise". Later he had the opportunity of experiencing
what Franquism represented, and still represents for Spain, and owing to his
·honourable behaviour as Consul he was often insulted and was even threatened with
expulsion. He was closely connected with of icials of the Fascist Regime and
with Falangists in high positions. Ha tern of office, to use his own
expression, was more suffessful through his friends than owing to his position.

in Russia are recruited by force, by the process already mentioned. All airmen
have to serve some months on the Eastern Front as "training". They say that
lately they were training about 150 pilots to send them to Russia.
The war
factories are workingat high pressure. The Germans are directing the erection-
of an aerodrome in the province of Lugo. In Gal cia very few Germans are to
be seen. Military instruction is obligatory for boys and youths in the
"Frente de la diventud". They also train youths from 15 onwards to serve in
aviation. A friend of the informants told them that there passed daly through
a city in the North fifty card loaded wit war material in the direction of the
French frontier. German submarines refuel at Redondela and Vigo. H。 says that
English seroplanes often make reconnaissance flights over the harbours of Galicia.
They describe Serrano Suner as the rost subservient to the Nazis and in general
to the Falangists who have crimes behind them or who have become rich through
Troubing the people.
Those who go to work in Germany are those workers who have nowork, or even
if they have any live in the greatest poverty. They believe that by going to
Germany they will be able to solve their economic situation and that of their
families. The groups sent are not very large, according to our informants, at least
in Galicia. This is understandable because the Germans prefer specialists.'
According to our informants, three workmen came back from Germany who say that
in Germany the situation is terrible. They hardly eat, there is great poverty.
They have the impression that Germany will not resist long in consequence of the
situation there is in the country. They also say that a group of Spanish workmen
were thrown out of the country because "they caused trouble".

FRICTION BETWEEN THE RULING CLASSES He does not know of any dissension in the
army except the case of Yague and Queipo, and gives data which is already kn.wm.
The soldiers in general are against the entry of Spain into the war....They live in
very bad conditions. badly fed, badly clothed and ill-.reated by the officers,
especially by the recently recruited Falanists. They all wish to be demobi ised
as soon as possible. They have demobilised the 139 draft. By their conversation
we observe that the soldiers from the "national" and the "Red" zones receive
different treatment. In Galicia there are rany soldiers from Cataluna who have
already spent several years in the army. They do not cake it difficult for
youths of military age to leave Stain; they cited their own cases.

THE PEOPLE'S RESISTANCE TO THE WAR AND THE FRANQUIST_REGIME They say that
there is no resistance there at all, because no one can act, and passivity is
the opinion and state of and of the people. Then we insist they say there
have been various trån smashes and some derailments which they think were due
to sabotage as well as to the defective material. Everybody knows the British
and Soviet war communiques and they are discussed in private conversation. Some
people take them down in shorthand and later circulate them. He says that in Wigo
there is a secret transmitting station, but it was discovered by the police and all
those connected with it shot. They were said to belong to the republican Left
("Izquierda Republican) and among those shot there was one doctor and other
intellectuals. He does not know any more details. Women complain loudly in queues
of the shortage of foodstuffs. He knows because the rumour went round there that
Prieto made a speech in the White House before Roosevelt, and that Roosevelt
embraced him saying that the Americas were behind the Spaniards. This speech too
is circulating in clandestine coples, but he never could see one. He says that
there is no organised political activity because this is impossible. He tells
several jokes which are going the rounds, and quotes this one: - "Recently
they made a film called "We Thieves are Honest Men". Beneath the announcement of
this film in Vigo, someone wrote "The Caudillo's Own Words"." He says the press
give most space to the English Far comuniques and the U.S. war news bulletins..

REPORT No.351
MARIA RODRIGUEZ, about 29 years old. Comes from a confortably-off peasant
family in the Province of Orense. She is very sluggish and at every question
repeats that she does not know and that women do not understand many thin s.
She had only a little more than an hour to spare as she was busy in the evening
and had to leave for the interior in the morning.
-
WAR
She says that she was surprised when she arrived in Havana as she thinks
there is more enthusiasm in S ain than here and more confidence in an American
victory. The peasants "like everyone else" would like the "American" to win,
even those on the Right are sure the Germans will lose. She cannot explain the
nature of Franco's assistance to Hitler, she says only that "as it was the
Germans who won, Spain owes them more than it has". She cannot be explicit,
either, about the dangers of war, but she says that Franco's soldiers, the young
men in general, and as a concrete instance a anther of hers served five jms
in Franco's my that they mil go up into the mountain and shoot before
going again to the war. About the Division Azul she knows only that when it
was first formed a volunteer left from her district. He was an outlaw who
had committed crimes and she says that he went through fear of the consequences,
The people do not like the Blue Division. They were not asked for anything for the
Pvolunteers".
FUTURE PROSPECTS
-
She insists that there is great confidence that it will soon
change. So much so that a Republican who was hidden for years and afterwards
discovered told her to tell her husband "Do not leave because things will soon change ®
The village has a hundred inhabitants, and she says that they all hope it will
change; but from what we can gather this confidence is based entirely on an
Allied victory. She says that if the English opened a second front in Spain the
people would revolt, but she says she has heard no c;inions on this point. The
people speak without fear. She relates that the Falangists tried to take a
pistol from her father and that he hid it. They threatened him, they took him in
a car telling Kirk him that they were going to knock his head off,
but the old man remained firm, telling them to do what they liked. They did not
do anything to him nor did they get the pisici. As an example of solidarity
against the Falange the old man said he had sold the pistol to a man who was
going to America. They told him to prove it, the old brought as witnesses two
peasants who lived more than a league away, without having agreed on a story
first, but being quite convinced that the peasants when they saw the Falangists,
if only for the sake of contradicting them, would say that what he said was true.
A little later they sent him a notice for a Falangist meeting and he refused to
80.
She does not know if the other peasants did.

ARMY She knows t. at a short time ago they dismissed the 36 (1956) Draft.
Her husband was on service in Orense and deserted and went to Cuba. Immediately
the Captain of the Company and a lieutenant went to his house to make inquiries.
His brother told them "In his circumstances I do not know what I would have
do ne", and the captain and the lieutenant went away saying "He is right".
PEASANTS. As we have already said, she belongs to a family which is con-
fortably off, they have several labourers in their employ. She says that the day
la bourers, and the farmer are equally against the Government and the Germans.
To illustrate the situation she says that the daily wage is 20 pts. without
food, and 6 with food. They-all-prefer the 5 and food, because otherwise they
have nothing to eat. The peasants are very discontented, and show it openly
to the Falangist officials when they come to inspect the harvest and when they
Mix the prices, saying "They have no right to do it, it is an abuse", but it
appears that it goes no further then this. They have not requisitioned anything
but they force them to sell to the official buyers who issue permits to authorised
buyers. These individuals take the produce to large shops and amass remal
fortunes. A quintal of potatoes, they have to sell at 30 pts. and they are sold-
afterwards by the dealers at the standard rate of four or tive ptas: the kilo, that
la to say at a 800% profit, to private people who require them. And if the
peasants take their produce to the market they have to sell it at the standard rate to
the dealers. No peasant takes any rye to the market, they prefer to run the
risk of selling it to private peo le. This is the only way in which they can

: and therefere men be talked with peale they always underlined the enormous:
difference there pas between that life and life under the present regime).
The Falangist unity beast of is a myth. Division in the Franquist Camp
grows daily. The Falasista mite lampeans in the streets and so do the
Requetes, but their elegens are contradictory. The Falangists accuse the rest
of being cure end traitere te tha meetrine of the Falange. For example, he talked
to a Falangist lieutenant – the sea cam free Cuba to fight at Franco's adde –
in the cafe Cate gre" in a few days before embarking. He seemed
to be ashamed of the present situation in Spain. No excused himself by
repeating the Palossist tag that the Falange not been betrayed. (This must refer
to the narchists, Asquetos, and other researics). The Falangists are
aware of the present situaties in Sale, Burhaps that is the reason why they are
seeking a solation which vill preserve their class privileges. In his own
phrase - the Prenquiet rezina tange from a very thin thread, which must snap very
8002. (Perbace this is not caly the men of our informant, but also of soms
ailitary and civil leaders with 19 89.20 mas closely connected). For this reason,
he says, they have tried to give the impression of a change, taking advantage
of the "Camara Corporativa", and, if it is true, with the restoration of a
Falangist-baarchy.
ON THE HORANCEL
There is, he says, no public activity with this goal. There
does not exist that we might¨oall paychological receptivity for this measure;
bat undoubtedly mgotiations in the direction are being carried on by high
officials of the Fromquist Regino. He was in Madrid on the 22 - 28 June 1942,
at the tims of the visit of Don Juan. His visit was not given any publicity,
but there were widespread palice precautions. The streets nearest to the palace
were closed to the public and a strict watch was kept. There were also arrests
of suspicions persons, those who had been in prison etc. But the press gave ip
sign. The presence of Don Juan was public property. The people seemed com-
pletely indifferent. The monarchists displayed no activity either. Parhaps,
he added, they took precitionary measures with some people characterised by
thair adhesion to the Monarchy. Ela impression is that if the monarchy were
restored in Spain it would be in alliance with the Falangists, but the peorle
would still have the impression that the situation had changed. He maintained
that there would be the semblance of a coup d'etat, apparently directed againat
the Palange, but Franco wuld remain head of the army. If so, things would, funda-
mentally, remmin box as they are; that is, the Spanish State would still be
entirely subordinated to Hitler, and without changing the policy of "partiality"
they now maintain, to one of "neutrality" in the war. They would take this step,
in his opinion, only in the last resort, if faced with a second front in
Europe, and on the approach of Hitler's defeat, which would, naturally have
an immediate repercussion on the countries subject to the Hasis in Europe. ·
In Spain
ON THE COMPLETE_SUBSERVIKECY OF THE FRANQUIST REGIME TO HITLER.
the Falangists do not speak of thair position of "Heutrality" in the war but of
"partiality". This is thair attempt to justify the help they give to the
Axis. There are_Geran_submarine refuelling stations in Vigo, Redondela, and
on the Galician coast. This is public property, but every now and then the
press publishes a complete demal that Axia submarines refuel in Spain. These
denials are very frequent but they do not give much proof. Those who can see
tanker-launches carrying on this work langh at these ridiculous dentals. Also
on more than ons occasion German submarines have been repaired in Spanish
dockyards. ·Da Galicia it is quite impossible to get a pot of jam. All the
production, which is onerous; goes to the Germans. There are places on the
frontier, through which trains pass with produce for Hitler. There are forti-
fications and artillery on the coasts of Galicia, where the Germans are in ·
command. There are also new agrodromes, some already finished and some under.
construction by German technicians. They fear in Allied invasion in Galicia.
Hitler is assisted not only with food and primary materials, but also with men.

privileged classes can eat, and they can only do it if they have a fortune.
They accuse the Falangist leaders and the Government of racketeering on the
Black Marketer. Damense fortunes have been made in a night. "They go tobed.

ons is allowed two packets of tobacco at 0.80 per person per week, and in
the Compania Arrenditaria de Tobacos, which is a state monopoly, one person
can buy from 100 to 10,000 packets of the 0.90 at 7.50 a packet. He also
relates the following instance. Petral is scarce in Spain. A litre costs
15. pts. Cara frequently stop in the streets for lack of it. He cites a case
which happened in the street of Gijon. A distinguished military personage had
no petrol He saw a tank-convoy of Campsa pass and asked the chauffeur for a
few litres, and then he refused, he ordered them to give it to him, as a
superior officer. The chauffeur refused again, and in a panic explained that he
could not do it because he was not carrying petrol but olive oil, without
being able to explain which military leader or leaders it was destined for,
although he knew it was to be sold/contraband.
SITUATION OF THE PRISONERS,

as
He cannot calculate the number of prisoners there
are actually at the moment although he asserts that it is at any rate enormous,
By reason of his position he has vis ted prisons and fortresses, and is terrified
at the terrible treatment in the "Comisarias" Civil Guard barracks etc. on
more than one occasion he says he has saved more than one Republican from oʻrtain
death. The prison that he knows is the Coto at Oljon. It is at the moment
completaly full. The treatment is inhuman.
They do not give the prisoners

do they give them a mess. Lately they agreed to give them a peseta dély for
maintenance. Es does not understand why there are not mère deaths, as with
one peseta a day in the prison canteen one can only buy bread. They book the
miners who were prisoners to camps so that they could work in the mines. They
gave them 50 was. day wages for bachelors and a peseta for a wife and 50 ets.
for each child, to the married ones. They keep then working ten and twelve hours
daily in the mine. The number of shootings has dimmished. It is imputed to the
fact that almost all must have been tried".
-
THE CLERGY He says that the clergy have never intervened in politics fron the
pulpit as much as they do now, sometimes inveighing against the Franquist
Government, and at other times, naturally, defending the policy of the Falange.
Numbers of the priests and monks continually expound their view on the political
regine and the points on which they differ from it. As a characteristic example
he relates that about two months ago in Gijon there was a house used provisionally
as the Church of San Jose, which was destroyed during the war. A priest,
“professor at Salamanca, gave five lectures. In these lectures he spoke almost
exclusively on political questions, and attacked the Franquist Government
for their method of supply and distributing the foodstuffs among the people,
saying that what was wanted was more rationing and less Franquist regulations.
He also advocated the necessity of a pardon for all condemned people and other
things that our informant does not remember. 500 people went to the first lecture,
but the second one, when they heard what the subject was, was attended by

RECONSTRUCTI:L Reconstruction is only done as a matter of private enterprise
by proprietors and churches. In Madrid, the Montana barracks, the prison, the
workers districts, damaged by the bombardments, remain as they are. Nothing
has been rebuilt. The Arguellos district has bean partly rebuilt. Every owner
has taken-in-hand-his-own-property. The Franquist reconstitution policy is a myth.
The people mock at it and make jokes, among them the following - In Of Jon they HIG
erected a building marked "Reconstruction Office";in the hallway there were
two doors, one marked "for partial destruction" and the other for total destruction'
So a well-known Asturian who was visiting the office about his house which had
been partially destroyed went into that department. Once inside, there ware twe
more doors - "for those who have some resources, and for those who have not".
He went through the first door, there was another room with two doors of or
those who are Falangists, and for those who are not". He went through the second
door and found himself in the street.

There is continuous propaganda for the sanding of volunteers as workers to
Germany. Unwilling contingents of soldiers have left for the Blue Division.
THE DIVISION AZUL was a Falangist manoeuvre to give political importance to some
Falangist leaders. The manoeuvre turned out very badly. This Division is the :
most unpopular innovation of the Falange. Our informant talked with 11 sur-
vivors of the division, who had returned from the Russian front on account of
their wounds. One of them was 18 when he left as a volunteer, without the
consent of his family. He asked if he would return to the front again and he
answered categorically "Ky eyes have been opened. I will never return".
They all speak of the bad food they are given - mainly vitamin pills and pots
of jam. They speak of the courage and fighting spirit of the Russian aray, but
above all of the contempt with which the Ogrmans treated them. They regarded
them as inferior beings and they also said that when they paid compliments to
the German women, a Spanish custom, they answered them disdainfully as if they
despised then. There were cases of self-mutilation in the ranks of the Blue
Division. At any rate their panic was obvious, and they refused to return.
Everybody speaks ill of the Division Asul.
Its commander Minos Grande, is the most despised of soldiers. Countless
jokes about this division circulate in Spain. Our informant knows several, but
cites the following as an example which came from the Club Benevente-Arniches
etc. # Gato Negros in Madrid. Eunos Grande sent a telegram to the political
address of the Blue Division at the front - this was the address; 1.E.T. URSS.
M.G. The telegram arrived and no one could decipher it, but finally a soldier

ON THE DANGER OF HAR FOR SPAIN AT HITLER'S SIDE. His impression is that Spain wil
will continue to assist Hitler as she is doing now but that she will not enter
the war.
Some of the Generals are in disagreement with the present policy
among them Varela, Aranda, Lague, Queipo etc. Among the soldiers the feeling
against the Fascist Regime is very marked. They complain of bad food,
treatment, clothes.... too much time spent on marches etc. Queipo, on his
return from Italy was rude to Serrano Suner and struck him for which he was sent
back to Italy. General Aranda spent a month at Gijon and talked to our informant.
They had an interview. Our informant has a real addration for Aranda, who, he
says, is a gentleman. He says that Aranda appeared to be Leftist. Among his
remarks he remembers the following wards. The Spaniards are robbers.
We are, and
we have been for some time. If you walk through the Castellana of Madrid you
will see the sumptuous palaces owned by Wexler (7) and Primo de Rivera, etc. built wi
with the blood of the Cuban people and the poor Spaniards who went to defend
the Spanish colomies. The colorire lost but the military leaders, whose duty
it was to defend them, enriched themselves. Now it is the same thing over again.
We made a revolution in order to bring progress to Spain but we have spilt
blood in torrents uselessly. The result was not worth the expense of so much
blood and so much repression".
In his conversation, although he said nothing against the Germans, he showed
contempt for the Falangists who are enriching themselves; he showed particular.
fear of the treatment meted out to the soldiers in barracks. Ha impression
is that it was a result of the seriousness of the situation through which the
Franquist regime was passing and fear of what the outcome might be. He said
nothing about the state of the war, and whether he was a partisan of England.
In the conversation he had with the General It is possible that there was another
aspect, which through discretion he did not repeat.
-
HUNGER SITUATION. The situation has become noticeably worse during the last
months. For several months already the rationing has been practically ml.
The rich buy everything on the Black Market. Our informant, with his wife
and five children spent from 9.600 to 10,000 a month on food alone. He says that
during the year his expenditure on food he does not drink nor smoke - TU
120,000 pesetas. Of course he had a special clothes budget
a suit and 180 to 200 for a pair of shoes. When asked how the workers live who
600 pesetas for
earn 10 to 15 pts. salary or perhaps less, he says very badly. They do not eat,
and adds that besides they camot earn more. L, the workers and the people in
general had a greater purchasing power, life wuld be impossible in Spain as they

In Spain acts of sabotage are carried out on the rail.
ways, factories, etc., although he cannot decide whether these are organised
actions decreed by illegal organisations of Spanish Republicans or are spon-
taneous acts of workers who are enemies of the Falangist regime. He does not
know any concrete instance of the activity of the workers organisations, C.P.S.
etc., but when he was in Madrid on the 22nd and 23rd of last June, there was
a film on called "We Thieves are Honest Man". There were thousands of lampoons
dond on that, some very clever and suggestive which were scattered throughout
Madrid. According to our informant, one day the lampoons appeared printed in
the same type lettering as the poater, with the following "words of the Caudillo,
from a recent speech". For this reason there were arrests and a number of
beatings in Madrid. He also saw how the people had lost their fear. In
the Oran Ha in Madrid a man cried out that he was not only red but communist,
and he would not endure this any more. Apparently the people told him to be
silent out he did not take any notice. The R.A.F. bombardment of Cologne,
which was known in Spain from the English breadcasts, was celebrated almost all
over Spain by the people who stayed up much later than the usual time in the
streets, drinking in barz, etc. Es says that even the police took part as
they are largely Anglophile.

-
GUERILLEROS
He says that there are many in Asturias; there is a state
of war.
There are bors and the 'Tercio'. The guerilleros appear occasionally
in the villages and avenge the deaths of anti-Fascists who have been murdered
by the Falange. They take food and clothes. Once his car was stopped by a
group of them in the street of Llanes. They were dressed as Falangists.
Then he showed his papers as Consul of Cuba and proved he was not the previous
consul Pena, a known Falangist, they saluted him and said - "Long live the
people of Cuba". He says that although they behaved correctly he was rather
afraid. He knows that a short time ago the guerilleres of Campocaso had Fight
with the Civil Guard and killed several people, among them some well known Han-
gists in the district. It appears that the Quarilleros are magnificently armod.
FUTURE PROSPECTS, He believes firmly that Hitler will be defeated this year.
No has great faith in the people of Spain and France, etc. Hasi-dominated
Europe will arise, since this life cannot continues "even one winter more.
He is confident that the U.S.S.R. will not be defeated; on the contrary the
Soviet battlefronts will be the end of Hitlerim. He believes that England
and the U.S., in opening a second front, will count on the help of peoples
oppressed by the Masis, in France or in Spain, and things will move rapidly.
The Spanish people ure waiting for the invation of the Allies in order to take
arms in the streets against their rulers. The Spaniards trust in the Allies
and hope that the Second Front will not be long delayed. Soviet and English
broadcaste archistened to; they follow the progress of the war. They hate the
Germans and the Italians. These who before supported Franco are not his
enemies and partisans of the defeat of Hitler. The Spanish people hope to
escape from this situation by the defeat of Hitler and trust in the Restoration
of the Republic.

Fascist or anti-Fascist either, as his opinions Tither confused.
SPANISH
TOWARDS THE FAR He says that no one speaks of the war
because they take the view that Spain will not enter it. All the world thinks
that Germany will lose the war because her enemies are very strong. He says
that nothing is said about the second front. About the Blue Division he says
that the people are against those who went to Russia, chiefly because they think
then mad. He talked to a friend of his who came back from Russia, who was
thoroughly glad to be back. He said that our entire war was child's play
compared with this one and the way the Russians fight. He says that some
Leftists werein the Division through hunger, and some were Falangist adventurers,
and in spite of its being said that all are volunteers it is obvious that many
ware forced into it. He says that in the Gibraltar demonstration, there were

In general he pretends to be slow and tries to get out of the questions
with trifling answees. We think it is because he feels constrained by a

speaking in favour both of Germany and the Allies, because Franco wishes to
stand wall with both sides. Es says that when the state of non-belligerence®
was established the people were content because before that they were afraid
of being involved in the war. This fear, he says, is not so strong now,
When asked what he would do if were in Spain and the Spanish people were
involved in the war he answered #I would go to the mountains or spend a

SUPPORT GIVEN BY THE FRANWEST REGIME TO HITLER. He does me know the proporations
of this assistance but he says that volunteers continue to leave for the front.
In the same way he thinks that if the Germans did not take provisions from
Spain all the needs of the country would be supplied. Hth this idea he com
plains against the Germans and against Serrano Suner above all. Falangists in
uniform are now only seen in parades.
-
WORKERS FOR GERMANT He says that a few months ago they sent a great quantity
of workers to Germany. They were almost all Galicians, and very few from Bilbao.
A little later they were returned because "they were being deceived", "getting
into difficultiss". When he was asked to be more precise he said that when they
got to Germany they asked to be returned to Spain, and so they did with almost
all of them,
TERROR
He says there are no persecutions or executions. Then the execution
of Larranage was mentioned he said that the people had no knowledge of those
crimes. About the refugees he says that the people talk of their beturning to
Spain when the war is over.
-
FRICTION On this point, without being questioned, he says that the Paquetes
and Falangista cannot meet, because when the two parties were analgamated the
Asquates were pushed into the background, and that is the reason they prefer the
monarchy. On this point he says that he has heard nothing about the restoration
nor about the differences between certain leading factions in the armys
RESISTANCE. At first he said that no one speaks about the war or any other
problems because the people are afraid. But afterwards he said that people
remember the Republic and how well they lived then. Na does not report any
example of resistance to the war. He says that the Nationalists have a lot of in-
fluence, but not so other parties, among them ours. Prieto has no influence d ther.

He says that if the Germans invaded Spain the people would rise. As we said, he

of books, about 500 pts; before it used to cost 200. He says that studying has
become very difficult. He says that all students along to the S.E.U. although it
is not obligatory, but they are coerced, and they join in order to be in a good
position,
ON CONDITIONS OF LIFE He explains that in the rationing they allow a K. of

He refers above all the discontent of the families because their sons
have to spend four years in the army. He says that they demonstrate their

REPORT No.358.
LUIS FERIA & Maxican student, who has always lived in Oijon, Spain. Es
Pablly is comfortably off and he is going to Maxico to join his father as he
lived on what his father sent him in dollars and when this was forbidden he
decided to leave Spain. He is an ardent Falangist. He is ignorant of all problems
of the working and middle class. He only associated with people who were very
well off, and especially with Falangist students. He is very cultured.
e says that he was in Gjon at the beginning of the war and remained there
till now; as he was a Mexica he was molested by neither party.
-
HUNGER He roundly asserts that there is no hunger, only a scarcity of certain
articles. That with rationing "there is not enough for one mouthful" but that
he never felt the want of food. That the olive oil ration is 1/8 of a litre
overy 15 days, and so on for all other commodities. That the rationing of
bread (black bread, since white can only be got on the Black Market) is arranged
in three categories, and for that there are three classes of fards · poor,
middle class, and rich. That the ration of the poor is larger, as they have less
money for buying on the Black Market. That at Belmonte, Asturias, the rations
are double what they are in Gijon. That rationing is different in each province,
and even in different places in the same province. He says that no one is
interested in politics, that everyone's daily preoccupation is food.
He says
that it used to make him laugh to see well-to-do old people who in all their
conversations spoke of nothing but the price of beans and bread etc. When he
was asked for facts he says that it is obvious that the poor (by which he means
the workers) who earn 10 or 12 pts. cannot buy anything contraband and live on
their rations, which causes them to suffer somewhat from hunger and be very
discontented. He says that the f hunger is caused by the war and the blockade,
because as soon as the Spanish war was over there was abundance of everything and
free exchange, and as soon as the European war began there was scarcity and
rationing. He also says at the same time that the cause of the scarcity is that
the Government has bought thousands and thousands of tons of food in case the
situation gets any worse. That this is good policy of the "Generalissimo's® and
that the Falange is doing a lot of propaganda, saying that it is much better to
keep the food now, whan a lot is coming from Argentine and the U.S., than to
ot
eat it now and then if the situation gets worse, have nothing. That the people
who are "good stuff" accept it, but most people protest and complain. He says
that mother cause of hunger are the Provisions Committees, which, like those
of Oijon, are composed of bandits who sell as contraband the articles they are
supposed to: divide among the population.

ABSTRACT
FILM
1.
A source who has given highly reliable information in the past, and
whom we have no reason to question, has stated that during 1943 one Luis
TEDESCHI was either being considered for recruitment by/or was actually work-
ing for the RIS. According to the source, be was known to have been active
as a member of the Spanish Communist Party. The address used by TEDESCHI
during early 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
2. The Buenos Aires Station has determined that a Luis TEDESCHI, born
2 February 1918, is listed in local police files as living at El Domador 3150,
telephone 58-3717. Further investigation is being conducted there. Unfortu-
nately, Headquarters does not have the date and place of birth of Subject of
paragraph 1. The source has indicated that Subject was probably born in Italy
and may have been active in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39. This, of course,
could explain his involvement in the Spanish Communist Party.
3. It is requested that Rome, Barcelona, and Madrid check Station and
Base files for any traces of Subject. Liaison and police contacts may be
approached for any information available in their files.

which is wry intelligent, as it knows how to maintain a balance in the
situation and remain neutral. He says that the Spaniards are very favorable
to Germany because they could have penetrated into Spain and taken Gibraltar,
thus closing the Mediterranean to the English, but that it is "a German idea
that one must be pleasant". After arguing a little with him I said that Germany
might not have invaded Spain because she was not interested in dispersing
har troops, considering that she needs them all for fighting against Russia.
Later he confessed that all the Spaniards would fight against the Germans in
case twy invade Spain because the Spaniards are very fond of their indo-
pendence, and would fight anyone who wished to enter Spain. The Spanish Govern-
ment is a partisan of neutrality and the immense majority of the Falange
think that Spath should send volunteers to Russia but "not enter the war"
because they do not know that many thousands of Spaniards would be killed.

This is not obligatory but it is sounted as time spent in the service and for that
reason every one does it.

INVASION He says that there are no Germans in Spain. Eg has seen none and so
on. If there are any they are disguised as peasants. He is not certain that they
re making fortifications in the north of Spain. Ijon is in fact defended by two
ships, one of them a "gulta-taces" and if there was an English invasion there
"they wuld be the masters"
HELP TO THE NAZIS. He says that it is not a fact there are more factories
in the north of Spain which were not there before, and they do not work for
the Germans. That the Germans say in their propaganda that they mean to suspend
armament manufacture, beßause they have enough. That Germany is selling a
quantity of war material to Turkey, which is a proof that they have no need of
it, therefore armaments are not manufactured in Spain nor exported. But he
takes the opposite view, that pain receives material from Germany; there are
frequent consignments, mostly tanks. What Spain does sead, not, "as some say because
the Germans take it", but because the Government gives it very willingly, is
food. Every day many loaded open cars leave Spain and the people talk of it and
are din contented, but those are only those who think with their stomachs".
DESPATCH OF WORKERS He cannot be accurate about the quantity but many thou-
sands have gone, all volunteers. He says it is quite natural for a man with
no food or job to go there wherethey eat well and can send money home and because
all the "poor" are like that. That is the reason they "go as volunteers and are
glad to better their position",

REPORT No.357
JOSE PAGOS, a peasant, resident in Cuba for 11 years, returned to Spain
in 1940. At that time he was a Franquist. He is very backward and extremely
-suspicious. At first he refused to speak, especially when he was told that
he must talk to a journalist. He knots very little, since he lived in a small
village in the district of Estrado and only left it to embark. He often mys
that he knows nothing, and can only give information about his village that is
not political. Is a moderate anti-Falangist, and continues to defend Franco, of
whom he has a high opinion, in many instances. The first thing he asserts is that
in Spain there is not so much hunger as they say here. There is a scarcity
caused by the war but it is just the same as it is everywhere, these with money
eat and those without go hungry. It is not true that they requisition the
peasants' crops, at least in the part of Spain he knows. He says that
.
everyone says in Spain that they control the crops, and even if they force them to
sall at the standard rate they leave the peasants enough to eat. It is obvious
that everyone makes fun of the order and hides the produce "but it is not that
they requisition them, but that the Government controls produce and they
have to sell it at fixed rates." He says that he has a brother in the army and
the soldiers are very well fed. The food is well prepared but rather scarce.
In Estrada they get the two regulation loaves just as before the war,
but in Coruna bread is scarcer in the barracks. What everybody wants is for
the war to end, anyhow, what is wanted is peace and tranquillity. When asked
about the second front he says everyone is hoping for the English to come and
give orders in his house but when the people are so anxious they want some-
thing to happen to change the situation and see if it improves". On further
questioning he confesses that 90% of the population are against Franco
not on
his own account but on account of the hunger and misery there is..
There is no repression. People are only executed legally, through the
tribunals.

He says that no one wishes Spain to enter the war, and France, "if he could, wot

exaggerating, since in the Russian Campaign they said that the Russians
were defeated already and nevertheless months passed and the war went on.
Our informant did not know the existence of the Anglo-Soviet and Soviet-
American pacts, although he heard some agreement spoken of, but he never
knew exactly what it bas. There was a lot of talk about the second front,
and it is thought it will be in France. When asked what, in the event of
the English landing in Spain, the attitude of the people would be, he says he
thinks the Requetes would unite with them. When I told him I thought they
had sent a brother of mine to the Div. Asul. he made a face as if they had
sent him to the devil. "I am sorry, because those who go to Russia in generà
do not return, and those who do come back are crippled for life" He says
that in the Div. Axul was joined by the unfortunates who are, with their
families, dying of hunger, and adventurers and robbers; some too because
they were soldiers already and did not dare say no because they would have
cut their throats if they had. He says that in the beginning a group
of 40 left Santander and a few months ago ten came home, armless, legless
or tubercular, the reft died of it. One of them, a captain, and tubercular,
told some of his family and friends that all the Ogrman propaganda
on the
Russian war was an absolute lis. That the Russians never retreated until they
were killed or received an order to retreat. That it is a lie to say that
they have no leaders, and similarly that they have no material. He knew
better than mybody what the war in Russia had already cost the Germans.
During the winter they had lost millions of men and a great deal of
material. It was terifying what went in there. He says that those who come
back from Russia are forbidden to speak of what they see there and therefore
it is impossible to get more details. However they tell their friends in
confidence.
ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE FRANCO-FALANGIST REGIME TO HITLER. — The reinforcements
they send to the Div. Asul grow less each time. No one wants to go because
the stories of the survivors are gradually passed round. He adds that the
Germans pay them very highly. They give them 3.000 pts. just for crossing the
frontier. A few months ago a few left Santander to concentrate in San
Sebastian. It is there that they train. While before, they made propaganda
out of those who were going to Russia, and saw them off at the Station, now
it is done secretly.
All foodstuffs are sent to Germany, that is why there is famine in Spain.
#I wish you could see all the things they send. Imagine that one can', get
olive oil, which used to be so abundant in Spain". They say that in Bilbao
and in Reinosa (?) and other places the factories work for the Germans.
According to him there are no German soldiers in Spain, only technicians.
Germans in civilian clothes are particularly common. He added that the
Ograns spend millions on propaganda and there are many newspapers, reviews,
pamphlets etc. which are distributed gratis. The people, as a result of so
much propaganda, do not know what to think on some points. They say - "If
what the Germans say of Russia is true that country is doomed to disappear;
there is nothing but savagery there". He says that some German propaganda
postcards show Roosevelt and Churchill dressed as prostitutes, and` Stalin
in the middle embracing them. The people do not like this kind of propaganda.
As for the German infiltration into the country, he limits Amself to saying
that they are the masters in Spain. He gives no data. He says that the
Falange is very much weakened, that only timeservers and those who do
business, thanks to the positions they occupy in it, are its supporters.
Whereas, when it began, eyybody-wished to be Falangists, now no one takes
any notice, and some people are careful to conceal the fact that they
are Falangists. They say that the Requetes appear very upset. They were
the ones who fought hardest in the war and now the Falangists are taking
advantage of the victory. He says they do not give positions to the
Requates, and when the Falangists control the syndicates they do not give
then work either. There is a great deal of discontent among the Requetes, and
they have already begun to speak openly against the Falangists and those whom
they blame for the present situation in Spain. They accuse them of being
rabbers. No say that they have printed broadsheets about the Falange, which
they scatter on the streets and stick on walls at night. He adds that the
syndicates have many members, because membership is obligatory, but if it
were not so no one would belong. They oblige the young men to enter the
frente de la Juntud", although many already losing their fear, and

He says that in Spain there is a lot of talk about the war, al though
no one bothers about politics at all now, and only out food. There are all
sorts of parties, partisans of the Allies and the Germans, and asong his friends
the people are mostly partisans of the Germans; he also thinks the majority of
Spaniards are on the side of the Germans and among the 150 in his university
hall only two were partisans of Democracy and they had fierce guments in
loud voices until the director come. The partisans of the Masis maintained
that anyone who wanted England to win was not a Spaniard because of the
Democracisa win Prieto will come back and all the Reds of the Republic, and
there will be a government of Leftists and in this fashion they attack the
defenders of England. The students say we are very fond of Ogrmany, because
she helps us to be free of communism and is now defending us against it." H
says that this appeals to many people who also hate communism.

SECOND FRONT, He says that no one believes it will be established. The
Gormans cannot invade England, nor can the English invade Europe.
Spaniards would unite to defend themselves from the English. They would do the
same if the Carmans invaded Spain.
ON THE WAR. He said that the Spanish idea was that it would last five or
six years and that when they were all exhausted there would be an armistice
or negotiated peace. This is the opinion of the people on the Right and the
Falangista; he does not know the views of the rest. Franco said in a speech
*If the Bussigna make a breach and arrive at Berlin, he will send two million
men to fight communism". They do not attack the Republicans much, but blame the
Russian agents and the Communists for all that is happening in Spain. He says
that in Hendaye there are hundreds of aeroplanes and many fields full of
tanks. The Germans have war material on the frontier in fantastic quantities.
He thinks that is in order to be in a position to assist aither France or
Spain if it were necessary.
-
FRICTION He says that there are no disagreements between the Requstes,
Falangists or Catholics; they are all united, and if there were any friction
there are no scenes or qua rrels betase the "Generalissimo" would shoot them.
-
FRENTE DE LA JUVENTUD, He says that it was a failure, that at the
beginning many people were excited by the propaganda, then they got tired and
practically the Youth Front does not exist.
STUDENTS.
_These-are-all-the-very happy to be members of the S.E.U. because
they avoid military service. The S.B.U. is obligatory. They only corps they
have to belong to is the University Militia. In summer they go to camps where
they have military instruction and are commanded by students who are officers
with some officers from the Army.
RESISTANCE OF THE PEOPLE There is none at all. In Spain there is a
totalitarian Government favourable to the Germans. In totalitarian countries
there are no protests or any resistance because anyone who resisted would be
shot. There are discontented people but they are silent, they do not speak
because they cannot. I have seen no inscription on the walls of Gion, the
only thing there are a few robbers, the so-called Quarilleros, who rob, kill

REPORT 371
30.7.42.
Up to
A young Basque 24 or 25 years old. By profession a metal-worker.
the beginning of the war he was working with an uncle in Zaragoza. He remained
in the battle sone throughout the whole war and was mobilised in Franco's army,
Is a Basque nationalist, like almost all his family. Although a workman by
profession he always worked with his relations, almost always as foreman, or
at least as manager. He has no political point of view nor are his class
feelings very developed. He has never belonged to any syndicate. After the
war was over he worked in Bilbao in a wire factory where there were about
a thousand workmen. He finally left work in order to devote himself to the
Black Market because, acording to him, it was impossible to live on what he
was paid at the factory. He lived in Nationalist circles, they were the
only ones with which he was connected. For this reason his report is rather
incomplete, and in some cases lacks objectivity. He is rather reserved.
-
ATTITUDE OF THE SPANIARDS TOWARDS THE ANTI-HITLER WAR. In the graphic
words of the informant, 80% of Spaniards are partisans of England. The
workers, peasants, petit-bourgeois, capitalists, and some of the clergy,
(later he told us the majority of the Basque cures) are on the side of England,
although in a passive way, and against Germany and the Falange.
The general opinion which is expressed in conversations between groups of
friends, and lately also in the street, is that the defeat of Germany is in-
evitable, due, according to our informant, to the fact that the Allies have
more economic resources and more primary materials. It is thought that the
United States will be a very important factor in the ralisation of victory.
Also the defeats suffered by Germany on the Eastern front contribute to
stressing this opinion.
In Spain everyone is tired of the war, and no one wishes Spain to take part
in it. Thare people are in a real panic on this score. Our informant thinks
that if France should decide to fight, in view ɗf the terrorist nature of the
Regime, the people would have to obey. Later in another conversation he said that
there were people who, in that case, would hide in the mountains.
The defeats suffered by Germany on the Rastern front were well known
there and contributed to increase the people's confidence. He says that they
said there that, in spite of their resistance, it was obvious that the Russians
were not sufficiently prepared to face a power like Germany.
The entry of the United States into the war was received with joy by the
people who interpreted it as an event destined to shorten the war, of which they
are all very tired over there.
The Ratification of the Anglo-Russian Pact and the American-Russian agreemant
is known there, although the range and content of the pact and the agrement
were not known. He says that the Falangist press; only said that these nations
had promised not to make a separate peace.
He does not know the agreement about the second front, although this
subject is very often spoken of, with the idea that it would be the final blow to
Germany. Over there they think that the opening of the Second Front will result
in the rising of the French people, perhaps the Spanish people too. With the idea
in mind the people often discuss possible landing places. It is thought that
this will-take-place-in-France, although some say it might also happen in Spaina
The opening of the second front would be received with joy by all.
The attitude of the people to the Division Asul" is frankly hostile.
It has no sympathy from the people, even from the very moment the recruiting was
begun. He says that in the beginning a few volunteers gave their names, mainly
Falangists who wished to earn merit in order to improve their position in Spaine
Others went because their position in Spain was desperate and they thought it
might improve if they left it. Some, who want in the army, found themselves
in the position of not being able to refuse, because if they had the would have

In Spain they believe that Hitler may be defeated in 1942, especially
if the Second Front is started. They also say that Russia is bearing the
brunt of the fight.
Speculation about a monarchist restoration has neither delighted cr
depressed the people. The possibility does not arouse much interest.
The people, who, according to our informant, have most prestige in
Buskadi (Basque national territory) are Aguirre and Prieto, especially the
former.
As regards conditions of material life he assures us that they are terrible
and that is the fundamental reason why all the people have turned against

All business is controlled by the lack Marketeers" of the falange who,

peasants at the standard rate, and instead of selling them to the people at
the standard rate they reduce rationing to almost nothing in order to compal
the people to buy articles on the Black Market, at a price which will give them
the profits. He says the these who haver Roney to buy things contraband (and
they are the majority since salaries have hardly been increased at all in
comparison with pre-war standards) die of hunger. He gives prices which
correspond with those for other regions of Spain".

says that when the names of the first casualties arrived, the people were glad
and said that will teach them to interfore in what does not concern them"..
The survivors came back disillusioned. They repent of having gone. The
majority of them come back ill or crippled. He adds that the war in Russi
is worse than the Press reports.it; the Spanish war was child's play compared with
it. The Falangists are more reserved and make no public criticisms like the
others but among their friends they also say that it was terrible. They went
into action in fact just before the Russian counter-offensive beɛan, and
received the full brunt. They had many losses through bullets and the cold.
Some of those who came back crippled have German iron crosses for which they
get a pension, our informant does not know the am unt, from the German government.
SUPPORT OIVEN BY THE FRANQUIST REGIME AND THE PALANGE TO HITLER.
informant does not know in whatquantity they send reinforcements to the Blue
Division. He thinks that there is some exalteration on this point on the pat
of the Falangist Press which tries in this way to encourage enthusiasm among the
young men. He knows that the place they report to and trath is San Sebastian,
and that from there they leave for the front. He thinks that they are still
sending people, but they are only reliefs" for those who come hime. He adds
that those who go to the Division Asul today, with very few exceptions, do it
against their will. They get the majority of those who go from the barracks.
He says
that many workmen went to Germany on account of the lack of food and
work. He does not know how many but he thinks a fair quantity. He says that the
people take these things calmly generally, because they cannot do anything
against them. He only heard that in Ifun there had been some scene with the
Blue Division or with the workers who were going to Germany but he gives not
actual details, saying that it is dangerous to try and know too much.

cites as an example the fact that employers are obliged to pay something as

says that the Falangists do not pay it to anybody, but spend it themselves.
For these and other shilar reasons there is a lot of discontent among the
employers.

FRICTION AMONG THE RULING CLASSES.

-
He knows that in the army there is a surge
of feeling against the Falange, but he says that it has no outside repesussions.
The only incident-known there was the case of Yague and Queipo de Llano. In
general there is a great feeling against the Falange among the soldiers. The
consequence is that they make life impossible for Falangists in army.
He says that the majority of the Basque Priests are enemies of Germany,
of the Falange and of Franco. They are very indignant about the executions
of nationalist priests carried out by France. Even today there are many of
them in prisons. He says that the priests devote voluntary masses to praying
that Spain may not enter the war.
He says that other members of the clergy, although they are opposed to the
Catholic persecutions in Germany and Poland, support Franco because they believe
that only with his help can they preserve their positions.
Be adds that the richest and most influential people there do not wish to
hold official posts because they feel that there will be a change in Spain.

Germana and Italians controlling Spain. He says that in conjunction with the
Requetes and other individuals in the army, they were preparing a coup
who is the worst hated of all,
against Franco, and principally against S. Suner,
but it was found out and no one knows what happ/to Yague and Queipo..
General Espinosa de los Monteros also had something to do with it, but he does
not know exactly what his part is. Referring to Yague, he says that he was
dismissed from the Air Ministry when he made a speech in favour of releasing
the prisoners. Queipo refused to allow the Italians to have any olive oil.
The situation of the soldiers is very bad. They hardly eat at all, and are
very badly clothed. It is pitiful to see thes. They all wish to be de-
mobilised as soon as possible. The 159 draft has been demobilised and he
thinks the first reserve of the 140 draft as well. He thinks it is because
they cannot keep them in barracks for want of food.

are in hiding. He says that the only people who are openly fighting against
the Falange and the Regime in power are the Requetes. That besides the
pamphlets we have referred to above, there often appear on the walls, lampoons
and posters against the Palange. He remembers one which said more or lese
#Faxine and Theft, that is the Falange". There appeared another very like it, but
he does not know what it said because they rubbed it out at once.
He says
the Requetes also accused the Falangists of being cowardly assassins who are
only useful for doing mass assassinations ("dar Passos").
The people take a sympathetic view of these actions of the Requotes.

There are many prisoners. When the "nationalists" first entered Santander they

anything are the Requetes. In general our informant does not know any of our
organisations because he was very young when the war began. The only thing he says
is "the Falangists are like those they used to call the F.A.I. They go to a
house, steal, take a man, take him and shoot him, and then it is finished".
He could not get my information about the Union Nacional, although he gives the
impression that he does not know anything about it.
He has no ideas in the future prospects. He thinks that this depends on
England; there is talk that the Requetes wish to set up a King who is not a
Bourbon. He does not show anything the restoration of Don Juan. The Falangists
are enemies of the Monarchy and the people do not worry much about this
problem. Referring to the attack on S. Suner, Espinosa de los Monteros,
Ambassador in Berlin, had on one of his visits to Madrid, a violent quarrel
with Suner and in consequence resigned. He reports that then he was appointed
Captain General of the Sixth Region, Burgos, and on taking over the post he made
a speech in which he attacked the Falange. He reports that as a consequence be
was violently dismissed. A few days later a son of the general who is a
lieutenant in the army, shot at S. Suner several times, he thinks in Madrid.
Arrese was wounded in consequence. The press said nothing about it. They
published a notice that the Secretary of the Party was undergoing an abdominal

Hatred for the Falange is general in the majority of social classes.
He says that even those who belonged to the Falange before, young students,
employees or just rich peole, do not wish to have anything to do with it
now, and say that the Palange is going to the dogs.
He adds that in general everybody hopes that the triumph of England will
cause a change of government in Spain and so they confine themselves to waiting
although there is talk of a possible coup d'etat by the soldiers,
-
RESISTANCE OF THE PRO LE AGAINST ENTERING THE HAR AND AGAINST THE FRANQUIS
REGIMS The people wish to see the situation change as soon as possible, but
they believe that the solution must come from outside. According to our infor-
mant, there is no thought of fighting against the regine. He says that the
workers in the factory in which he worked spoke openly against the regide but
he does not know that there was any activity. (Given the character of the
informant we may sup ose that even if there was he would take pains to ignore
it). From time to time the women ricted in the queues; at first they simy
them up, now they say nothing. Es asserts that every day the people speak more
openly against the regime. The contribution to "Auxilio Social" was obligatory
before but now no one pays. When the young ladies of "Auxilio Social" beg for
subscriptions in the streets and ask the reason for refusal, some people answer
E because I do not man to".
<
He says that when Franco was at Bilbao the people remained in their houses
and he was received only by four "chats bottes in the offices of the Falange,
At the end of Franco's @sech not a soul applauded. Then some Falangist
young ladies said, half in tears, "what we must do is buy a machine gun and
shoot them allª.
Assistance to the prisoners, according to our informant is given by relations
and friends. There is no organised assistance, but he proceeds to tell us that
certainly there have been collections sometimes in the factory in favour of the
prisoners, but "by groups of friends". He does not know of the activity of ary
organisation, as such. The nationalists, according to him (he is a nationalist)
are the ones who have some organisation.
They distributed there a speech made by Aguirre in America. One of the
Pristo's was also in circulation. He has no news of the other organisations
although he admits that if they have any organisation they would not go and
tall him about it.
When he is asked about the activity of the different organisations of which
the Frente Popular is composed, and the attitude of the militant party members
of these organisations, he asserts categorically that there the people are
completely united, and there is now no talk of socialists, anarchists, communists,
republicans etc. All treat each other as comrades, and help each other as far
as they can. In Spain, according to our informant, there are only now enemies
of Franco and the Palange, who maintain a strict unity among themselves; they
discuss the progress of the war together, comment on the situation etc. Eg says
that the people wish for unity, regret the disunion there was before in Spain.
and the quarrels between different parties and anti-fascist organisations.
He did not know of the shooting of Larra or Diagues. The execution of Larra
impressed him very much and he said that in order to do what Larra had done one
would need plenty of guts.
-
PUTURE PROSPECTS He repeats again that they believe in Spain that the triumph
of England will cause a change in the situation. (We must point out that for some
time there have been currents in the Basque nationalism which have been seeking
for a "solution" of their national problem with the assistance of England,
transforming the "Pais Basque" into an English protectorate or Dominion or
something like that, and even during the Spard sh war there were individuals who
thought that at the critical moment the Basques would receive help from the English)
Our informant told us at the beginning that there people spoke only in
favour of England, but after considerable circumlocution he confessed that the
workers also sympathised very much with the Soviet Union, although conversations
in this direction ware much more restrained. He added that the people were quite
well informed about the course of events as they listen daily to the bulletins
of Radio London, and some also listen to those of Radio Moscow,
The people in general are in favour of a solution on the basis of the

worse than the other and for this reason they are sore hesitant. Those
individuals are specially the rich. If they believed that the Republic would

MABA-9016 of 4 November 1960
,
1. Headquarters regrets that it has been unable to learn the date and place
of birth of the Luis TEDESCHI who, according to a usually reliable source, was being
considered for recruitment in 1943 by the FIS, or was actually working for the FIS.
As stated in HAIR-6515, our source reported that the address used by TEDESCHI during
the early part of 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires.
2. Collateral information on Luis TED SCHI of Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires,
has been found in a 1942 document which appears to have been based on censorship
reports. This document indicates that TEDESCHI's address, as given above, was a
cover address for a UDE (Union Democratica Espanola) manifesto sent from Cubs.
Also one THSESCHI, Estados Unido 366, Buenos Aires, was given as a cover address
in a secret writing message. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document
is attached.
3. It is hoped that a unilateral surveillance on the Luis TEDEDCHI living at
El Domador 3150, Buenos Aires, if instituted as the station planned, will be
fruitful. Headquarters will be extremely interested in any further information on
this individual you may be able to develop, as it is possible that he may be linked
with Communist and/or RIS activities in Cuba as well as being used locally by the RIS.
4. As. KUDESK is currently handling this case, it is requested that the slug
REDWOOD not be used.

living at El Dorador 3150, with telephone number
58-3717, and has no record of police offences.
This individual was born on 2 February 1918.

1. A source who has given extremely reliable information in the past,
has stated that, during 1943, one Luis TEDESCHI was either being considered
for recruitment by the RIS or was actually working for the RIS. TEDESCHI
was known to have been an active member of the Spanish Communist Party.
The address used by TEDESCHI during the early part of 1943 was Fichincha 969,
Buenos Aires, Argentina.
2. Our source was unable to provide further information on TEDESCHI
and Headquarters' files contain no pertinent identifiable information on
him. It is requested that you check all available records including any
appropriate local services for any information on TEDESCHI that may be
available.
