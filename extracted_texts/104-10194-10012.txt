I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the
Central Intelligence Agency as defined below:

carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to
devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make
a career with the Agency."
In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faith-
ful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the
obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essen-
tial to the furtherance of its mission.
I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue.
of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will
be my obligation to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty
as determined by the needs of the Agency, and I have been assured that in
order to carry out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this applica-
tion for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured
that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part,
just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my
tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory com-
pletion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compati-
ble insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall

SUBJECT: Yansportation of Car to China
DATE: 22 January 1947
1. In view of my recent appointment in Shanghai, China to head
up SI operations in that area, it is respectively requested that I
be allowed to take my car to this port.
2. It is anticipated that a considerable part of my work will of
necessity be done at night when office transportation would not be
available. The poor transportation system in Shanghai will also
make going to and from work very difficult without an automobile.
3. Am willing to reimburse the government funds for all charges
in the delivery of my car from the United States to my station.
To
ADSO
1st Ind.
23 January 1947'
Through: Asst. Executive for Personnel
Basic communication requesting the transportation of privately
owned auto is forwarded with a recommendation for approval.
1.
2. It is felt that since Mr. Noore will reimburse this Agency
for all expences connected with the transportation of his private auto,
there is no objection to such an arrangement. It will indeed
materially aid Mr. Moore in his work to have a car at his disposal.
It is understood by Mr. Moore that he will not rent or lease this
vehicle to the Government for official use. Should it become neces-
sary for the personnel of the station to use this car for official
travel, Mr. Foors will be reimbursed at only the rates allowed by
regulations which govern the use of privately owned autos in Government
Travel.

I concur in Mr. Watts' evaluation. Mr. Moore is a very
good administrator and his office has performed its collection
mission very well and provided excellent operational services and
support. They have not been tested in our emigre program because
of a lack of potential but I am confident they will do the job
well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to
represent CIA and the Intelligence Community on the outside and
he does a very good job in representing DCD within CIA and the
Community. In a pinch I feel that I could depend on Mr. Moore
more than almost any other DCD field chief of his grade.

SUBJECT: Mr. J. Waltón Moore
10 February 1977
+
1. During the period under review, Mr. Moore con-
tinued in his assignment as Chief of the DCD Field Office
in Dallas, with responsibility for the supervision of a
Resident Office in Tulsa and a Residency in Austin. The
Houston Resident Office was raised to Field Office status
on 1 September 1976, and the New Orleans Resident Office
was placed under the newly formed Houston Field Office:
Both of these offices were formerly subordinate to the
Dallas Field Office.
+
2: Under Mr. Moore's able direction, the Dallas
Field Office has continued to perform the full range of
ection and support. tasks exceptionally well. The
office produces well prepared reports on subjects of
priority intelligence interest. Mr. Moore is a quiet
and efficient manager with high personal and professional
standards. He is well liked and respected.
3. During this rating period, Mr. Moore and the
Dallas Field Office were formally commended by the Office
of Strategic Research for timely reporting of information
which resulted in substantial improvement of an estimate
on Soviet military medical staffing. The information
supplied by Mr. Moore"...resulted in a reduction of over
500,000 in the Community's estimate of the total number
of Soviet military personnel."
4. Extraordinarily fine work has been done under
Mr. Moore's direction during this rating period supporting
the activities of the FR Base. The FR Base is relatively
new and has depended heavily on Mr. Moore's readiness to
support it in the early stages of development. In
November 1976, Mr. Moore was formally commended by the
FR Base Chief "...for his outstanding support to the new
Dallas Base during the period October 1975 to October 1976.
...The level of overall support from DCD Dallas was consis-
tently outstanding. Under Mr. Moore's management, the
Dallas Office support of FR objectives is among the most
effective and comprehensive in DCD.

Mr. Moore's long and unique experience in the FBI, OSS, and CIA coupled with
his background in China and his admirable personal qualities make him a very valuable
asset to DCD. When he recommends something to me, I know he will be correct; when
he is asked to represent the Agency in some highly important contact, I know he
will do it well and rake an excellent, professional impression, and I can count
on him to run a very good office with a high level of productive activity.
I feel very comfortable and very confident with Jim Moore in Dallas.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. James Walton Moore
20 April 1976
1
1. Mr. Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the DCD Field
Office in Dallas, during the period under review, with responsibility
for the supervision of the Resident Offices in Houston, New Orleans and
Tulsa and a Residency in Austin. His Letter of Instruction remains
current.
2. The Dallas Field Office, under Mr. Moore's perceptive and compe-
tent direction, produces a good volume of quality foreign intelligence
reporting. DCD headquarters officers consider the Dallas Field Office
performance to be of high caliber. The office is highly responsive to
headquarters direction, and there is a strong commitment to quality
performance. Mr. Moore has the Dallas Field Office fitting smoothly into
the DCD organizational framework. Morale is high and Dallas field personnel,
both professional and clerical, feel a sense of importance in their
mission. This spirit and pride in their work stems directly from the
positive tone set by Mr. Moore.
3. Mr. Moore has extended the hand of cooperation unstintingly
to the FR Base which is in an embryonic phase of development. Base
officers are enthusiastic about the cooperation received from the Dallas
office and the willingness of Mr. Moore to be of assistance. Cooperation
between the Dallas office and FR is among the very best in DCD. In
addition to the fine support supplied to FR, Dallas had made an important
contribution, during the period under review, to the cost-analysis program
of Format. Support to operations, through the Operations Services Group,
is excellent and a good variety of operational leads and operational
reporting is received from the Dallas office.
4. Mr. Moore is a capable and efficient manager. The Dallas office
structure presents a complex and difficult management challenge. Through
his experience and mature judgment, Mr. Mocre has directed the activities
of the office smoothly and effectively.

5. Mr. Moore is a calm, mature, respected and popular
officer who handles his complicated job with the easy assurance
that comes only from experience and past success. I believe that
it is largely due to Mr. Moore's personal reputation that so many
of our junior officers want to work in Dallas.
6. During 1974 Mr. Moore recommended the establishment of a
one-man residency in Austin as a more efficient way to handle our
responsibilities in that part of Texas. We agreed, and the Residency
was established in mid-1974. Although it has been in operation only
a few months, the wisdom of Mr. Moore's recommendation is already
apparent, and I am confident that the success of the Residency will
continue.
7. Rating: Strong.
8. A copy of this memorandum, with reviewer's comments, will
be forwarded to Mr. Moore.

1. Mr. Moore became Chief of the DCD Field Office in Dallas
in June 1973 and was promoted to grade GS-15 in the same month.
He had been selected for this position approximately one year
earlier, and spent the interim in DCD headquarters as Acting Deputy
Chief of the then Soviet Bloc Division. He now supervises one of our
most complicated Field Office organizations, with people located in
four cities (Dallas, Tulsa, Houston and New Orleans). More than half
of the people under his supervision are located outside of Dallas.
Perhaps because of his long service as one of our most successful
Resident Officers, Mr. Moore excels in supervising this type of
operation as a Field Chief. His three-Resident Offices are among
the most responsive and productive in DCD. He delegates duties well
and permits his staff the freedom to exercise individual judgment and
responsibility. He is both liked and respected by his staff, which
shows excellent morale and esprit de corps.
2. Mr. Moore maintains excellent relationships with other
Government agencies in his territory, as appropriate, and also with
other components of CIA. He manages his many responsibilities
efficiently and effectively, and with proper attention to security.
He is quick to identify members of his staff who have potential for
greater professional advancement, and to give them the necessary
encouragement and guidance.

I concur in this evaluation. My principal interaction with Jim Moore during the
year has been the result of our mutual concern for the well-being of a capable officer
who performs well and has growth potential but who is difficult to work with and has,
on occasions, apparently been on the brink of a physical breakdown brought on by
tension, overwork and other factors. In his approach to this problem, Jim has been
concerned, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional.
Under Jim's direction, the Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD
offices and is holding it.
While Jim Moore is a long-time DCD officer, he seems to have lost none of his
enthusiasm and drive. He is a valued and respected colleague.

MEMORANDUM 'IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.
SUBJECT: MOORE, J. Walton
1. Jim Moore continued in his assignment as Chief of the
DCD Field Office in Dallas during the period under review, with
responsibility for the supervision of Resident Offices in Houston,
New Orleans and Tulsa, and a new Residency in Austin. His Letter
of Instruction dated 7 November 1973 remains current.
2. The Dallas Field Office with its four satellite offices
represents the most complicated field office structure in DCD.
While Mr. Moore's staff consists of only nine officers and seven
secretaries, more than half are located outside the field office.
The Dallas Office requires a chief who is experienced in resident
office operations, is able to motivate and manage people from a
distance, and who can keep personally familiar with a wide variety
of activities. Mr. Moore is admirably qualified. He has been able
to, coordinate these essentially independent activities most
efficiently. His entire organization performs in a responsive
and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced
reporting.
°
3. Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during
1974, two of his key officers were incapacitated for extended periods,
both at times when the work load was especially heavy. The operating
procedures which he has established enabled the office involved to
continue to handle priority matters effectively in each instance.
4. On at least two occasions in 1974 Mr. Moore had to intercede
in complicated and difficult situations, and in each instance his
judgment and highly professional approach resulted in successful
solutions.

Mr. Moore is the prospective Chief of the Dallas Field Office. He was
assigned to DCS headquarters in July 1972 for a familiarization and training
tour prior to assuming that post. For approximately six months he served as
Acting Deputy Chief of the Soviet Bloc Division, during which he was required
to fulfill that role as though it were a permanent assignment. Although he
had never been active in headquarters before, he quietly and efficiently
familiarized himself with the operations of the division. Through his friendly
personality, experience and interested approach he quickly and effectively
made what was basically a training role into one of real contribution on a
daily basis.

This certifies that the above-named officer has satisfactorily
completed the three-week interdepartmental course at the Foreign
Affairs Executive Seminar in the Foreign Service Institute of the
Department of State.
Objective, -Content and Method of Training
The objective of the interdepartmental Foreign Affairs Executive.
Seminar is to provide an advanced, short-term course on the current
formulation, coordination, and execution of U.S. foreign policy to
senior foreign affairs executives of U.S. government agencies serving
-either in the U.S. or abroad. While the focus of the Seminar is on
policy problems in foreign affairs in general, special emphasis is
given in the course's regional seminars to a coordinated interagency
approach to policy formulation and implementation in Washington and
in the field. In the process, of the three-week course, the Seminar
gives special attention to the Nixon Doctrine, foreign economic and
trade policies; domestic factors affecting U.S. foreign policy, and
problems of modernization and internal defense.
The course is conducted through lectures, readings and Interagency
Regional Seminar discussions. These seminars, organized by geographic
regions with representatives from the participating agencies, analyze
specific problems in their areas, consider appropriate courses of action
for the United States, and emphasize inter-agency coordination in
Washington and at the overseas Mission.

Number of Students: 28

COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS
The basic objectives of the Advanced Intelligence Seminar (AIS) are
to increase the awareness of experienced Agency personnel to: major
international and domestic trends affecting US foreign policy and intelligence;
key problems and possible organizational changes, facing the intelligence
community; recent and projected developments within CIA to meet current
and future Agency responsibilities; and major problems of collection,
production, coordination and support of intelligence.
Methods of instruction include formal presentations by academic
experts, government officials, senior Agency and intelligence community
officers, and substantive experts from the Agency. Students are encouraged
to participate actively in follow-up discussions both with the speakers and
within the class itself. Emphasis is also placed on in-class discussions,
using the talents and experiences of the students as a primary resource.
For purposes of encouraging open, meaningful exchange, sections of the
course are held at Warrenton and ISOLATION, where a more relaxed
seminar atmosphere can be developed. Finally, attempts are made to
provide provocative-type readings to the students both prior to, and during,
the course itself.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance only; no attempt was made to
evaluate student achievement in this course.

Mr. Moore has demonstrated his outstanding capabilities in handling
operational support matters during the forced phase out of certain funding
activities which required exceptionally good judgment and much tact.
During this period he has also become responsible for the activities
of an Air Force officer from the 1127th Field Activities Group. Through
his guidance and effective direction he has been able to integrate this
new officer into the production of the Dallas RA in an efficient manner.

Although Jim Moore is an above average employee I would not rate him Outstanding
in specific duties 1, 2 and 0. Duties 1 and 2 because it is difficult to
compare his performance with anyone else as he has always held this position.
Duty because supervision o: 2 other people should not be much of a chore. We
are studying the possibility of moving Jim to another assignment to determine
how he can perform in a more demanding job.

2. Mr. Moore's performance as Chief of Station, Calcutta, has been
excellent. He has been given an "Excellent" officiency rating by the Consul

reporting. Mr. Moore was well liked by Consulate personnel, the British,
and the natives with whom he came in contact. He is a man of good judgment and
commonsense and has carried on OSO operations in a secure and efficient saler.

CONFIDENTIAL
Jim's work in Dallas has been consistently excellent.
Under his leadership the Dallas complex has provided timely
foreign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities
and requirements. As an example, in April 1975 the Acting
Director, Stratetic Research commended Jim for "outstanding
performance" for urgent special efforts to obtain information
which resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 in the
Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of
Soviet military personnel.
.
Similarly, the Dallas Office has provided excellent
support to the Clandestine Service. In November, 1976 the
Chief, FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding
support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which
were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in
Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifying and
assessing prospective targets for recruitment.
There are very few persons of potential consequence to
the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jim Moore does not
know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf
of Community and Agency requesters.
The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in
November 1963, the subsequent allegations against CIA and
Jim Moore's long association with Agency interests and
programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media
attention and scurrilous innuendo. Although under various
forms of severe, external pressure as a result, Jim Moore
never lost his calm, cool demeanor and has been absolutely
dependable in adversity.
An experienced professional, a true gentleman, a delight-
ful person, and an example to be emulated, Jim Moore has
been a real credit to the intelligence profession. As he
approaches retirement, he richly deserves recognition in the
form of the Career Intelligence Medal.

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby nominated for a
Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his substantial
contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the
Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency
for more than 37 years.
J. Walton (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,
1930-36) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary
parents.
Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University
in 1940, Jim joined the FBI and served as a Special Agent in
both Chicago and San Francisco. During the latter assign-
ment he reported on pro-Communist elements in Chinatown and
directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US
citizens returning home to ensure that enemy agents were not
slipping into the US as refugees or foreign businessmen.
jim joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned
as an Ensign, USNR. His first assignment was in Kunming
where he recruited and trained Chinese agents to infiltrate
Japanese lines. While in Kunming he took parachute training
and on August 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese internment
camp at Weihsein. Following evacuation of refugees he
became Chief of Mission in Tsingtao. Returning to the US
in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and
Chief of Station in Dairen. Soviet intransigence prevented
his reaching Dairen so he remained in Tsingtao for an
additional year until transferred as Chief of Station in
Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948.
Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and
joined the Contact Division, Office of Operations, CIA.
CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.
Fron 1949 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office and
from 1954-1977 as the Resident Officer in Dallas. The
Contact Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service
and a reallocation of resources raised the Dallas Resident
Office to Field Office status. Jim was the obvious choice
for the job. After nine months training and preparation in
Washington (where he performed admirably) he was assigned
as Chief of the new office with responsibility also for
Resident Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-
tually, Austin.

Mr. James Walton Moore is hereby awarded the Career Intelligence
Medal in recognition of his exceptional achievement with the Central
Intelligence Agency for more than 30 years. A charter member of
the Agency, Mr. Moore held a series of increasingly responsible
positions in which he consistently used his many talents in
advancing foreign intelligence objectives. His strong leadership,
professionalism and dedication to duty not only enabled his office
to provide timely and effective support to worldwide priorities and
requirements but also earned for him the admiration and respect of
all with whom he worked. Mr. Moore's overall career contributions
to the mission of the Agency were substantial and reflect credit on
him and the Federal service.

4. The data submitted by the Dallas field office
as a result of a specially arranged debriefing pro-
vided us with the basis for a much improved estimate
of Soviet military medical staffing. Furthermore, Mr.
Moore's questions elicited some new information of value
to future work. Most important, the results of DCD's
efforts contributed significantly to convincing the
working group that the original Army estimate was far
Stoo high. Eventually the estimate we submitted based
upon the information supplied by DS-2172 was accepted
by the manpower Steering Group and resulted in a
reduction of over 500,000 men in the intelligence
community's estimate of the total number of Soviet
military personnel.

The efforts of your people struck a mighty

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Chief, Domestic Collection Division,¨
DDO
Appreciation for Outstanding DCD
Performance
1. I want to express the appreciation of the
Office of Strategic Research for the special effort
recently made for us by J. Walton Moore of your Dallas
field office. Mr. Moore responded quickly to our
urgent request to obtain information on Soviet military
'medical services from DS-2172 and provided it to us on
very short notice.
2. Let me give you some background. The subject
of Soviet medical personnel emerged as an important
issue in a recent community-wide effort to reassess
total Soviet military manpower. The community reassess-
ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months
ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military
manpower were low by almost one million men. If correct,
the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications
for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host of
intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the
Soviet military threat.
3. During the ensuing interagency review of the
individual estimates contributed by various agencies
in the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that
the number of Soviet medical manpower estimated by an
Army intelligence group was much too high. A rapid
search of headquarters' files turned up barely enough
intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion of the
medical services, but no direct evidence on total
medical manpower. At this point it became clear to us
that an improved estimate might be made with information
from DS-2172. As we had to present our case to the
manpower study Steering Group early in the week of
March 24, speed in contacting the Soviet source was
essential.

To: Chief, SFB. FPD
Subjecti Mr. J. Welton Moore, Agent, Contact Office, Dallas, Texas
I should like to call attention to the outstanding
cooperation given our activities in Dallas by J. Walton Moore,
resident representative in Dallas, Texas.
Mr. Moore has not only extended the normal hospitality of
his offices, but has gone out of his way to nominate and talk
with exceptional people who come to his attention as potential
employes for the Agency. Mr. Moore has contacted me from time
to time with names and comments on individuals, and in every way
attempted to serve as an active personnel scout in his area. I.
feel his efforts and time consured in interviewing people have
gone a good deal beyond the normal expectations of cur agency,
and that this attitude best represents the unified type of
teamwork which our organization subscribes to in this work.
While my experiences with the resident offices in my area
have been uniformly a pleasant experience, it is a matter of
real satisfaction to find a man who is thinking in terms of the
Agency as a whole and not of one sharply defined activity. I
believe the spirit that Ar. Moore shows should be brought to the
attention of his superiors as a prime example of teamwork in the
field. It is not only a personal satisfaction to do business
with Mr. Moore, but it greatly contributes to the morale of our,
efforts by knowing that other offices are as concerned as we
are in producing results.
Sincerely,
Byron Crosman

SUBJECT
:
Retirement Planning
1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even-
tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each
employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retire-
ment. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you
that you are scheduled to retire on
5 Octoher
.
1979.
2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves
serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the
transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence.
To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor
for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling
session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement
planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation
and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on
such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits,
life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation
and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining
other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a
Retirement Information Seminar that will be offered in the
autumn of 1974.
3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the
scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early
as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well
before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe
you would benefit from such an earlier start on your personal
planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division,
212 Magazine Building, on telephone extension 3328.

Head of IT Career Service
Notification of Non-eligible for Designation as a
: Párticipant in the CTA Retirement, and Disability System
{
As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current, career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In the process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of nis
Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board sales recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Sertice advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50. for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal termination required by the
is
regulation that you are not eligible for designation.
eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My.
Ny
determination that you are not eligible at his time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Ciril Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
for
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraf the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965; entitled "Public Law -- The Central Intelligence
S
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Engloyees".
40 It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System. please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. Inition you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff rate in boom 05-131; Fean-
quarters (extension 5001). Ir suen disca not revolve my question.
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the Seard. However, this request must be made within 30 days of
the date of this memorandum.
