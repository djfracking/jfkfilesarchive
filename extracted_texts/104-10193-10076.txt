1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Cryanisa,
tion Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective
21 November 1965,
2. Although such designatien under present statutes is viewad favorably
by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the
individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designa-
tion adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement
may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal, An appeal
with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of
the date of this dispatch or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any
questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot
be answered by referring to book Dispatch 5096 should be forwarded to liead.

3. We believe that the benefits of the virganization ketirement System
aro superior to the benefits of the Civil Service Retirement system, how.
ever, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retire.
ment may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a
higher annuity under the Civil Service system, because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the ɩrganisation system whɔ,
“would receive a higher annuity under the Livil servico system may, not later
than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from cur system
and transferred to the Civil service system. Thus, you should not anticipate
this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation
as a participant adverse to your best interests,

William K. Harvey
Fitness Report for Period 1 April 1964 - 31 March 1965
Section C (cont'd)
i
Some administrative details, such as the reports on the performance of..
officers whose evaluation he was reluctant to make, Mr. Harvey has had
a tendency to postpone despite repeated efforts to provoke him into
timely response.
I have rated Mr. Harvey's overall performance outstanding in
recognition of his superior supervisory ability, his unusual skill in
expressing his views and his determination to accomplish his basic
objectives regardless of the obstacles which he encounters. The Rome
Station is complex, is engaged in some highly sensitive operations which
must be guided with a strong hand and by an officer with a degree of
professionalism which Mr. Harvey is well able to supply as a result of
his extensive operational experience.

Mr. Harvey has continued to minage the Agency's activities in with the same
enthusiasm and drive which charcterized the description of his approach to the
Station Chief role in his past Fitness Report.
In his efforts to reorient the home Station's FI program toward vict-Satellite
targets Mr. Harvey has devoted considerable energy to acquiring the basic information
needed for this task. This his been well reported and the responsibilities for carry-
ing out this shift in operational approach have been precisely delegated. It is still
early to assess the results operationally but the reorientation has been well organe
ized. As an early indication of the trend this is taking, several successful technical
operations have been established which are well on target..
'
.
To accomplish the objectives of the CA responsibilities of the Rome Station
Mr. Harvey has acquired the most competent officers with this highly specialized skill
and has staunchly supported their efforts to prosecute this program which remains ex-
tensive. He has considerably improved the Station relationship with Embassy officers,
including the Ambassador, by devoting greater effort to this necessary phase of the
Station Chief's role and the Ambassador, during a recent trip to Washington, made
special mention of the degree of confidence he had in the Station's reporting and in
the extent to which it has kept him properly informed.
-
During the period under review, Mr. Harvey nequired a Deputy Station Chief' for ·
whose arrival he had waited more than 6 months. He has delegated general management
of the Station's activities to this officer, who has applied himself diligently to
this task and the results have been promising. Mr. Harvey has been receptive to head-
quarters guidance; is extremely prompt and thorough in replying to his correspondence.

I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4.
I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong, '
with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall
administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient, or perhaps "strong."

Mr. William King Harvey
28 West Irving Street
Chevy Chase, Maryland 20015
Dear Bill:
I am sorry that due to a busy schedule and my
absence for several days during the Christmas holi-
days I didn't have an opportunity to see you prior to
your retirement at the end of the year.
Red White has told me of his visit with you,
and I am particularly appreciative of your expres-
sion of continued loyalty to the Agency and your
offer to be of assistance should an appropriate
occasion arise.
I extend to you, personally and officially, my
sincere appreciation for the important work you
have done and my warment hopes that you will find
full enjoyment in the years ahead.
Sincerely.
/s to ma

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4.
I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong,
with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall
administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient, or perhaps "strong."

William K. Harvey
Fitness Report for Period 1 April 1964 - 31 March 1965
Section C (cont'd)"
Some administrative details, such as the reports on the performance of
officers whose evaluation he was reluctant to make, Mr. Harvey has had
a tendency to postpone despite repeated efforts to provoke him into
timely response.
-
I have rated Mr. Harvey's overall performance outstanding in
recognition of his superior supervisory ability, his unusual skill in
expressing his views and his determination to accomplish his basic
objectives regardless of the obstacles which he encounters. The Rome
Station is complex, is engaged in some highly sensitive operations which
must be guided with a strong hand and by an officer with a degree of
professionalism which Mr. Harvey is well able to supply as a result of
his extensive operational experience'.

"
In his efforts to reorient the Rome: Station's FI program toward Soviet-Satellite
targets Mr. Harvey has devoted considerable energy to acquiring the basic information
needed for this task. This has been well reported and the responsibilities for carry-
ing out this shift in operational approach have been precisely delegated. It is still
early to assess the results operationally but the reorientation has been well organ-
ited. As an early indication of the trend this is taking, several successful technical
operations have been established which are well on target.
To accomplish the objectives of the CA responsibilities of the Rome Station
Mr. Harvey has acquired the most competent officers with this highly specialized skill
and has staunchly supported their efforts to prosecute this program which remains ex-
tensive. He has considerably improved the Station relationship with Embassy officers,
Including the Ambassador, by devoting greater effort to this necessary phase of the
Station-Chief's role and the Ambassador, during a recent trip to Washington, made
special mention of the degree of confidence he had in the Station's reporting and in.
the extent to which it has kept him properly informed.
F

for
During the period under review Mr. Harvey acquired a Deputy Station Chief
whose arrival he had waited more than 6 months. He has delegated general management
of the Station's activities to this officer, who has applied himself diligently to
this task and the results have been promising. Mr. Harvey has been receptive to head-
quarters. guidance, is extremely prompt and thorough in replying to his correspondence.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT:
Fitness Report - Mr. William K. Harvey
1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1962 to
15 January 1963 during which Mr. Harvey was Chief, Task Force W.
**
2. As a senior officer in the Clandestine Services, Mr. Harvey
has behind him a long record of professional accomplishment achieved
during tours in Washington as well as seven years in Berlin.
He is
thoroughly grounded in the tradecraft of clandestine activities, and
has brought to each and every assignment an intelligent, thorough,
and uncommonly conscientious approach. His qualities of leadership
are attested to by the loyalty and devotion of those colleagues who
have worked under his direction. If anything, there has tended to
grow up within the Clandestine Services a coterie of officers who
have come to regard themselves as "Harvey men" a development which
Mr. Harvey himself has not encouraged but which demonstrates the
strong emphasis on first-class tradecraft which he has insisted upon
in each assignment.
1
3. As Chief, Task Force W, Mr. Harvey had the task of organizing
and developing a large operational team devoted to the acquisition of
intelligence and the handling of special operations directed at Cuba.
He was obliged to work within a complicated bureaucratic framework, a
fact which made the clearing of actions a laborious' and time-consuming
exercise. Under his direction, the Task Force grew substantially in
sire and in professional competence with the result that when the
Cuban crisis arrived in October intelligence assets were in place to
make a significant contribution to the overall intelligence picture.
Mr. Harvey devoted considerable ingenuity, long hours of personal
tire, and great energy to this enterprise, and, although certain
aspects of the intra-governmental coordination of the operations had
rough sledding, his net achievement was the establishment of an ef-
fective, going concern with momentum which carries on to the present.
4. Mr. Harvey, after a strong performance as Chief, TFW, has
'been assigned as Chief of Station, Rome, and is now preparing himself
to take over at that post in the coming months.

William K. Harvey - Memorandum in lieu of
fitness report for period 30 March 1960
10 May 1962
->>
1. It is difficult to prepare a fitness report on this
outstanding officer, largely because forms do not lend them-
selves to measuring his many unique characteristics. His
strengths are in professional knowledge and competence in
the operational field, in a toughness of mind and firmness
of attitude, while the latter in past years have moved him
into positions that were sometimes stronger than superior
officers, with a responsibility for adjustments necessary
in matters of policy in relation to Agency position in the
community, were able to handle easily, his own closeness to
policy positions of the Agency within the U.S. community in
the last two years has found him with a real ability to
handle policy matters and to adjust to necessities, without
losing his firmness and his independence of thought.
2.
He is sometimes accounted to be less than outgiving
of information about operational matters in which he is engaged,
yet it should be remembered that this characteristic has been
part and parcel of a sound operational attitude in his career.
He has a wide knowledge of personalities within the officer
corps of the DD/P and is for the most part a good selector of
officers to accomplish necessary tasks. He handles people
well. He has a tremendous energy and is a loyal officer both
to his superiors and to the purposes of the Clandestine Services
of CIA.
+
3. He is one of the few distinctly outstanding officers
in the DD/P.

to provide best
inbe described, if
Harvey's management of the Agency's program in Italy has to date been charac
terized by the forcefulness and drive which have gained for h
vious assign-
ments & reputation for dynamiam. He has undertaken to reorich the Rome Station's
FI program toward Soviet-satellite targets and any delay in this reorientation has
been due fully to our inability for administrative reasons to supply the personnel
he desires on the time schedule which he would prefer.
7
14
Although not by inclination oriented toward the objectives of CA, he has pre-
served and guided the most complex CA program in Western Europe with understanding
and skill. To accomplish this it has been necessary for Mr. Harvey to learn the intri-
casies of an extremely complex local political situation. This he has set about to do
with confidence. His accumulated experience in earlier assignments has equipped
Mr. Harvey with a self-assurance and confidence which I have rarely seen equalled in
any other officer. The continuance of ideal relationships with the key Embassy of-
ficials in Rome has been somewhat handicapped by the sudden death of the principal
officer in the Embassy who was knowledgeable of our program and the impossibility of
bringing into knowledge of our activity the next lower level echelon of Embassy of-
ficials for reasons beyond Mr. Harvey's control. This handicap has been overcome
over the past year and Mr. Harvey is currently supervising extremely sensitive poli-
tical operations and contacts to the satisfaction of the Ambassador and his headquarters
He delegates responsibilities skillfully to those officers under his command who
are best qualified and by his own outstanding performance, which is always at its
best under heavy stress, he earns an intense loyalty from these personnel. He demon-
strates cost-consciousness and outstanding supervisory ability.

MEMORANDUM IN LIÊU OF FITNESS REPORT
The following statement relates to the performance of
William K. Harvey, GS 18, Chief of FI, Division D.
"
This officer has held a series of responsible positions
in DD/P and its predecessor clandestine intelligence organiza-
tion for well over ten years. He excels in the field of
clandestine operations in general and especially so in that
phase of clandestine staff and operational activities concerned
with the procurement, handling and exploitation of highly
sensitive and critical intelligence and operational materials.
His performance generally over the recent years has
proved him to be one of the outstanding officers of the DD/P
organization. He has demonstrated clearly superior performance
both in staff responsibility at Headquarters and as Chief of
"Base in a very important field station where he was directly
engaged in supervising and carrying on operations successfully
against targets of the highest priority.
>
In the period under review, June 1959 to March 1960, he
took over and directed functioning of one of DD/Ps most
sensitive components charged with achievement by special
means against targets of the highest importance. This included
carrying on negotiations and liaison with other components
of CIA and other Agencies and Departments of the U. S. Government
concerned with his special field. His performance of this
responsibility in many respects has been outstanding. He has
continued to demonstrate his fitness to handle a wide range of
positions of major responsibility within the clandestine service.
Among his outstanding characteristics are: thorough
understanding of his profession and ability to make this clear
to persons of high level whose knowledge of the Clandestine
Services is general. He is fiim, tenacious, and on occasions
strongly aggressive in pursuit of his point of view. While this
may sometimes make for difficulty on the part of those in
higher echelons who wish to dispose of a complicated problem
easily and quickly, this officer's persistence in carefully

:
1. Subject's abilities and performance are too generally known
to require detailed comment. One of the very senior officers in
KUDOVE he has been chief of what is probably the largest and most.
productive overseas Base of KUBARK for approximately seven years.
During this period Subject has been personally responsible for a
number of operational successes, some of which have been of national
importance. Possessed of driving energy, determination and initia-
tive, he has few equals in professional experience and competence.
Throughout his administration of the Ease he has established and.
maintained exceedingly high standards of accomplishment, discipline
and endeavor. Subject's Judgement, on occasion, is impulsive and
proposals of the Base have been, from time to time, advanced and
defended with greater vehemence and more exhaustively than the
; occasion, objectively speaking, required. Subject's basic self-
discipline, good sense and loyalty, however, have prevented any such
incidents, which are in large measure manifestations of the highly
charged atmosphere and insistent operational pressures of Berlin,
from developing into serious friction with the German Station or
Washington headquarters.
2. It has been a pleasure to serve with this officer and,
‘during his assignment, he has consistently rendered dedicated and
effective service of the very highest order.
