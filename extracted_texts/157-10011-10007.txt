SGA discussed various possibilities of accomplishing reconnissance of Cuba, ranging from
very low level coverage by tactical aircraft to high performance aircraft and drones. Over-
flights and peripheral flights were discussed.
It was agreed that the first priority is one high performance mission in the western part of
the island, to be accompanied by all out 11int support. Depending on the results of this,
a number of similar scarches may be mounted. First mission was later approved by higher
authority, but the decision on the second proposition left open.
The entire package was to be discussed at the USIB, and by Chiefs on Wednesday, October 10th.

of an alleged plot with Mafia overtones to assassinate Castro and which the AG agreed
to handle as a matter of law enforcement." (116)" The reference is clearly to a 6/10/64
memorandum information report from the DDP to the Director," (116) which was dissemin-
ated to the Spec. Asst. to the Pres. for Natl. Security Affrs.; ASst. Sect. for_Inter-

eared to be involved in the scheme." The asking price was $150,000.- JOSE MARIO PEPING
