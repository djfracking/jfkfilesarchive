2. In terms of our operational utilization of QRPHONE/1 at this time,
while they reserve finite comment until all the returns (per above) are in, the
Medical Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-
taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular,
warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,
and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapse. So long as these
caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some
more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he
also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona
offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the
time being.
3. The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per
para, 1 above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run,

1. This mounrunâm requests your Agency's comments, on a priority basis,
relative to improving the operational espabilities of SUGAR, & scures of this
Agency known to you, whose reporting on expatriato American luftist personalities
we are forwarding on a continuing basis.
2. Dempite our hopes end his efforts, SUGAR was unable to obtain un
invitation to the Tri-Continental Conference recently hald in Havana, which was
a target for collection by this Agency. It is our belief that SUGAR's
reputation of being pro-Chinese was responsible for his exclusion. E
discussing this problem with important pro-Chinese cœrmnist personalities in
Europe recently, the latter suggested this his ability to secure sœcess to
such meetings would be considerably enhanced if he could obtain a "grass-route”
base or counsction in the United States which he could represent. In reporting
this suggestion--which strikes us as valid–SKAR speculated on the possibility
that he might attest to become the European "roproscutative” of the
Revolutionary Action Movement (RAN), un American organization cơ which he knows
little but which seems, from what he does know, to be consistent in its outlook
with his ostensible political orientation.

3. In this connection, we would very mach apprentiate receiving may

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/OA
ATTENTION:
Mr. John Brevar
SUBJECT:
SECRET
Field Investigation of GREBONY;
Grobony Clearance. (201-306052).
:
13 rubruary 1966
1. Purement to our conversation of 11 February in your office, this
memorandım requests that the usual field background investigation not be
undertaken in the clearence process instituted for QREBONY.
2. We make this request for limitation because of our strong belief
that such investigation would run an unacceptably high risk--approaching.
e
certainty--of causing serious damage to QREBONY's reputation and therefore
his effectiveness with the targets against which he is directed as on
informant. In the past, both here and abroad, QREBONY has made varm enemies,
as well as friends, anong dissident end leftist circles. He has particularly
aliomated both U.S. Communist and Trotskyist elements, apparently by his dealings
with time while serving as Executive Director of the Fair Play for Cuba Comittee
in the early 60's. His reputation for pro-Chicon syrpathies--which is the basis
of his present operational usefulness to us as a source--constitutes an
additional grievance against him by such parties as the CPUSA and the CPGB
which are pro-Noscow and anti-Peking. We know from independent sources as
vall as fro3 his own testimony, that such hostility has taken the form of
charges--oxalately false at the time--that he was an ODENVY or KUBAPK agent.
(Apparently a favored mear technique in such circles this charge has been
leveled in other cases with equal lack of justification.) These allegations
against QREBOXY' have not prevented him from winning the apparent confidence
of many leftist target olements who, if they are mare of them at all; no
doubt realise the prevalence of such backbiting and gossip and who have not
been prevented from developing personal and confidential relations with him.
Buch charges, however, do represent a dormant vulnerability: they have made
Bubject something of a controversial figure in a millien which rightly feals
itself a target for intelligence collection and is extremely sensitive to the
dangars of penstration.

4. Ebst of all, wo would welcome your comments on this general problɛs,
given your Agency's broad knowledge of such organizations as RAM in this
country. As a negro expatriate with pretended pro-Chicom sympathies, SUGAR
hmms also cultivated a reputation for sympathy toward the minittedly vague
mad diverse manifestations of "black nationalim”, and toward mach personalities.
as Robert Williams who embody it. He would be most interested in receiving
both your comments on this general movement of opinion in the United States,
and your descriptions of the organisations associated with it which could
enable us to provide information and guidance to XXAR for developing em
association which would increase his operational secess and effectiveness.

3. Against the background of this vulnerability, it must also be stressed
that the sources to be contacted by such a field investigation would include
many individuals whose suspicions of government interest--and hostility toward
it-ve could not reasonably expect to disarm. QREBOMY's career in the United
States in FPCC and similar groups put him in contact with a vide range of
individuals who are not merely sophisticated but highly sensitive concerning
such inquiry. It is not possible to conceive of my method of approach
which would not provoke their suspicions that a government connection with
QREBOMY vas involved. (It is, moreover, hardly likely that cooperation could
be expected of any of them, except in such cases where the individual sensed an
opportunity to record damaging information.) In view of what we know about the
rapid circulation of gossip among cuch individuals, and their great interest in,
and suspicions of government interest, such an inquiry could be calculated with
reasonable confidence to spell the end of any effectiveness CREBONY could offer
this Agency.
4. While we realise fully that the aim of such an inquiry is to resolve
unknowns in an individual's background and develop materials beyond those presently
available, va note that QRKBOHY has been a subject of continuing interest to
ODENVY for many years, and that, as a result, the basic politically derogatory
associations in his past are a matter of record. As you know, a successful
polygraph was performed on him indicating the absence of IS connection beyond
much associations, and confirming (to the extent that it can be said to do so)
his assertions of loyalty despite then.
5. In requsting clearance in this case, we are seeking to exploit QREBONY's
ability to report information to us which he receives in the course of his contacts
ability
with national liberation leaders, pro-Chinese commamists and similar personalities.
Such information represents general political and biographical material relative
to the interests, activities and plans of such individuals. Requirements passed
to him in this connection involve instructions for the refincusant and completeness
of the reporting he is capable of providing from his normal intercourse with
souros personalities. It is anticipated that his usefulness will be increased
by travel to those areas where his access to targets known to him permite firsthand
reporting. It is also anticipated that he may be able to serve selected CA
purposes by surfacing information available to him, then this does not prejudice
his cover status.
His use is understood to be, and has been, limited and precludes revelation
of classified information, either by operational assignments supporting or
servicing other KUBARK operations, witting participation in the recruitment of
other agents, or the passing of such requirements as would reveal a classified
status of KUBARK knowledge or interest in any collection target.

We have discussed the substance of the question raised
in Ref B through the regular Headquarters channel with the
ODENVY Rop here who has acted as a point of liaison for GREBOWY
material in the past. We passed on, also, the materials which
you prepared for the CDENVY representative with whom you are
in contact in Paris. We raised specifically the question of
passing CREBONY's identity to the Paris ODEVY representative,
which you mentioned in Rof B, stating that, so far as KUDARK
is concerned, we had no objections. The ODENVY representative
here, however, thought that this might serve to confuse sono-
what the lines of coordination for QREZONY's information, for
which ŒDENVY headquarters has sole responsibility. He there-
fore felt that we should continue the present arrangement by
which, in effect, GREBONY's identity is bold here at the point
where his material within ODENVY originates. He appreciated,
however, your initiative in filling in the Paris ODENVY
representative on the targets which QREBONY can service, thus
alerting him to possible leads he might look into. He suggests
also that we be kept aware of your liaison with ODENVY in the
field to guard against false confirmation or other possible
duplication which could lead to confusion here in those
quarters of ODENVY responsible for processing the QHETONY
material.
2. With respect to Freedomways, discussed in Ref A,
and Q's possible relationship with it, we will report separately.

del Fair Play Committee For Cuba. Aparentemente, perdió su puesto en
CES y se en-jenó el amor de su esposa (de esto se quejaba a menudo en
Cuba) por cause de 1- Revolución Cubone. Amigo personal de Radi Roa y
Gómez Wenguemert y también de Fidel Castro, según parecía en 1951. Con
rela ciones personales con Manuel Piñeiro (de quien se refa de sus infu-
les de policía) y Remiro Valdés y Raúl Castro, aunque nunca pareció
estimarlos mucho. Este sentimiento parecía reciproco. Gran enemisted
hacia los miabros del PSP y enemistad de ellos hacia Tober, sobre
todo de Aníbal Escalante y Jo-quín Ordoqui y Carlos Rafsel Rodrí-
guez. Una de las tragedias en la vida de Fob Tater fue el darse cuenta
de que se había malquistado con Fidel Castro por gecerle, personalmente
y cada vez que lo veía, críticas perilicas. Fue entonces (a fines de
1960 y principios de 1961) que comenzaron verdader-me te sus proble-
28 y que comprendió que no solamente había perdido el favor de sus
amigos, sino que estaba en desgracia con sus enemigos. Pue esto, sin
duda, lo que le hizo buscar la muerte en Playa Girón, mientras actuïts
como corresponsal del periódico Revolución. Fue gravemente herido en
un muslø y salvó la vida por pura suerte. Antes había renunciado a su
pasaporte o había sostenido una polémica pública con periodistas o se-
nadores norteamericanos, desde las páginas de "El Mundo", donde cola
borata. En Cuba por poco muere también, poco después, de una infección
>mebiásica contraída en Guatemala, en los días de la revolución contra
Arbenz. A fines de 1961 salió de Cuba con un documento (ni siquiera
pudieron darle un pasaporte cubano, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exte-
riores y en manos totalmente de los comunistas) personal de identidəd,
tratando de ir China cono corresponsal, pero en Praga le negaron el
permiso parɔ visitor este país y la URSS. F₁só - Francia y luego
Londres y de shí regresó > US4 via Comas..
Teber no es un comunista ni parece haberlo sido nunca. Es un román-
tico político y un hombre ingenuo, que crenó que la "evolución cubana,
de alguna manera, encarnata algo de los ideales de Jefferson y Lincoln,
asombrosamente. Hoy sabe que nada hay que esperar del comunismo en gene-
rel y de la Revolución Cubana en particular.

Es el menos conocido de los cuatro y quizás el más peligroso, pɔr-
que es el más estable emocionalmente, el más mediocre y más trabajador
del grupo. Fue Cuta en 1961, recomendado por Richard Gibson y el
Pair Play Committee, pero también por su cuente. Se hospedó en el
Haven Riviera, no sin dificultades, pues sus puntos de vista, nado
similables por los comunistes cubanos, fieles perritos de Moscú,
le strajeron el odio del PSP y una --ligera acusación--de posible
agente del FEI infiltrado en el Movimiento Negro y en Cuba. Hallf
poco con él y solamente recuerdo su extraño cento, tal vez de Chi-
cago o simplemente algún defecto anatómico, su specto de metodisto
○ negro y los shorts de cuero de elphista italiano que siempre usaba
en el hotel. Luego se hizo fomoso en Cuba y en Europa, cusado fue
proces-do por haber ido - Cuia ya China Comunista sin permiso v½-
lido. Worthy no es un fnatico no un comunista ni un oportunista,
pero perecía en comino de convertirse en un abanderado de că-lqui er
causa que le fuera affn. Entonces me pareció que esta couse sería el
Movimiento Por Avance de 12 Gente de Color. Hoy podría ser la Revo-
lución Negra o Lotinoamericana --o, simplemente, mundi-l.

Robert Hillions es considerado en Cuba como uns calanidad que

los círculos políticos y revolucionarios y oficiales. Converse.com 2,

puede hablar mucho, no solamente por su complicado eccnto del Deep
Sputh, sino también por cu incoherencia mentol y vertel. Sucle vér: e-
le scompañedo siempre de un traductor, por lo general un negro cileno.
Su renúltimo traductor fue Carlos Moore, que hoy reside en Fariz y
que provocó una aguda polítics en lo cfculos cutanos y eniges

el
un ertía lo que tomata las tesis del intelectual negro cut-no,
Carbonell, sobre in pritendid discriminación recial que existe on
los medios políticos y dirigentes cut-nos. Este asunto tuvo repercu-
dones en Cuba y no solo trajo problemas al verdadero -utor del artí-
culo (Walterio Garbonell, hoy expulsado de 1- Unión de Escritores de
Cub-), sino al propio Willions; quien m/s de una vez había expresado
tal opinión en público y en privado. Las desventures de Williams to
comenzaron aquí, sino cuando insistió en
su lines china revolucio-

intelectuales y dirigentes de Cuba se habían re-orientedo hoci Roscú.
Villions complicó su situación con un visje » Chin- Roja y fruit &

HEPATITIS BOUT
--
What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreme
fatigue I felt when I returned to London in July proved in
time to have been acute infectious hepatitis. The disease
which takes two to three weeks to develop was probably
contracted in Uganda. At least, I imagine so because my
principal contact in Kampala insisted on taking me to a number
of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda
delicacies.
Hepatitis was diagnosed by a doctor in Komiza, Vis, where
my family had been holidaying since the beginning of July,
and I was hospitalized in the isolation section of Split
Hospital (there is no hospital on Vis) on the 7th of August.
My liver was swollen by one finger and blood and urine
analysis indicated a fairly severe infection. Treatment
consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive
doses of vitamins.
I was put on a fat-free diet, which I have been told to
follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol.
On 20 August, I was released from the hospital, mainly be-
cause I was pestering the doctors to let me go. I was
told to have * "absolute rest* for four to six weeks and to
have another blood test within several weeks.
(Attached is the Yugoslav doctor's description of my case
and treatment, with results of all blood and urine analyses.
It is written mi in Serbo-Croatian.)

Security of QREBONY/1 S/W Communications System

1. In early June of this year KUWOLF developmental agent QREBONY/1
(formerly STEBONY/1) was trained by KUWOLF Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST in
the use of the S/W system prescribed by HKTOPAZ per Reference C. QREBONY/1
took one carbon sheet of the system with him on a brief trip to North Africa
and used it for four messages in the latter part of June. Concurrently,
Paris Station TECHS, on LCPIPIT's behalf, requested in OFPT 10348 that
METOPAZ prepare for QREBONY/1's use an S/W carbon pad which would alleviate the
carbon concealment problem for the agent, The pad was received subsequently
and passed to QREBONY/1 on 18 July 1965, at which time his original single
carbon sheet was withdraw.
2. QREBONY/1 first used his new S/W pad for a message dated 22-
July 1965, comments on which were transmitted to interested KUBARK Headquarters
and Field components in Reference B. QREBONY/1 underwent a corrective briefing
on the use of his pad on 4 August 1965, carbon No. 1 (rearmost of three in the
back of his pad) was withdrawn since it bore an imprint of the 22 July message,
and QREBONY/1 was authorized to use carbon No. 2 (middle of three) but only for
'essential" messages, (a 24 July S/W message was also critiqued at the 4 August
meeting—because the carbon impression was relatively weak.)
3.
On the basis of LCPIPIT's instruction to refrain from using his
S/W pad except for "essential" messages, QREBONY/1 did not employ it again
until 11 October 1965. The nature of the message indeed met the criteria for
use of the pad, but as in the 22 July letter the message was clearly legible
without development. To quote Paris Station TECHS:
"SW impressions were clearly visible under Ultraviolet Light
(short wave and long wave) and also under a plain desk light."
On the basis of this report, QREBONY/1's previous performance in use of the
pad, and the fact that the next point from which he was to use the pad would
be Algiers, LCPIPIT determined that the risk of compromise outweighed the
necessity of QREBONY/1 carrying this communications system with him and
withdrew the S/W pad on 20 October 1965. LCPIPIT retains possession of

the pad which contains the two remaining carbon sheets (No. 2 detached and
inserted in the back of the pad, No. 3 still bound in the pad.) The 11 October
message is clearly legible to the naked eye on carbon No. 2.
4. Of greater concern to LCPIPIT, however, were the following
additional comments of Paris Station TECHS regarding the 11 October messages
"The envelope you sent has evidence of tampering. There was glue
bleeding plus fiber tears.
Plus, additional glue had been added
to the upper flap (glue must have run and was sticking inside on
the letter.)"
5. In the 20 October meeting at which his S/W pad was withdrawn
QREBONY/1 stated that he had written the 11 October message on a sheet of glass,
perhaps with a pencil that was too soft. He conceded that there was some imprint
on the carbon, but nothing which could be read on the actual message sheet. He
said he wrote the message at 1100 hours when he was alone at his home and burned
the remainder of the message stack immediately. He said he then put the message
in an envelope immediately and sealed it gently under another sheet of paper to
avoid rubbing it. He added that he then placed the proper postage on the envelope,
placed it in his pocket, and mailed it two hours later at the closest mailbox
to him home. QREBONY/1 asserted that he did not reopen the letter after sealing
and was certain that his wife had not seen it.
6. Pursuant to LCPIPIT's exploration of this question with QREBONY/1
we sent an informal note to MKTCPAZ via a Paria Station Officer on 20 October
1965 requesting assistance in efforts to determine whether QREBONY/l'a
correspondence was indeed subject to tampering. MKTOPAZ prepared five "booby-
trapped" envelopes for our use. Two of these were mailed to the LCPIPIT letter
drop from two different cities on the continent, and the remaining three were
passed to QREBONY/1 on 5 November for him to mail from his home.
7. The five "boody-trapped" envelopes were picked up at the LCPIPIT
letter drop over a period of a week and were handcarried by a Paris Station Officer
to Frankfurt on 18 November for processing by MKTOPAZ. Paris/LCPIPIT asked the
opinion of MKTOPAZ on the following pointst
b)
Was there evidence of tampering with any of the five envelopes?
If so, which envelopes bore evidence of tampering?
c) Was it possible to determine from a study of the cachets whether
such tampering occurred before or after the cachets were applied?
d) Did such tampering appear to be of a professional or of
amateur nature?
e) Any other MKTOPAZ observations which would help LCPIPIT determina

I suggest that the Report always be mailed out from the same address,
London or whereever. Ay wife will be able to get sufficient copy from
Various people, such as Pomeroy and Jeanne Pyror [30-year old freelance
journalist who specializes in African affairs, now married to a Konya
parásitologist studying in London, formerly worked for Dennis Phomboan.
For my purposes, if can obtain press rates, I can wire copy to London
±1 from Havana or Dar es Salaam, thus giving tangible evidence of my
activities as a bonafide nexsman. It would be helpful if I could
get an American Cable & Radio System Credit (Transferred Account) Card,
such as I got from Revolucion in Havana for use at the U.A. in 1951.

QREBON
OFLA. 3146/1
56 Nov. 1965
In reply to the attached (Keno
on Home Situation) Redigast toli
QREBONY/1:
1. We can't do anything about his
housing problem in view of non-permanent
nature of our present arrangement.
2. Avoid formalizing periodical at this
point; it should require no authorizations
for publication as it is merely a news
correspåndent's report, mimeographed for
convenience--not a magazine.
3. In order to control content, Q
alone should have responsibility for
putting out issues- can't delegate to
wife and above all to other contacts.

Subject: QREBONY/1

Security at home
1. At his 17 November meeting with Rodigast QREECNY/1 (2) was
asked some questions concerning keep of files and correspondence. He keeps
copies of all correspondence (except routine letters transmitting articles
he hasw ritten, for example) in a file to which his wife has access.
He maintains a minimum of questionable notes, and keeps his personal
notebook (with addresses, expenses, etc.) in his coat pocket day and night.
2. His wife has two brothers. The one to whom Q owes money is
Gordon, a chartered accountant, who during World War II was in Spitish
Military Intelligence. He visits the Q home to bring gifts from the wife's
mother to the Q children, but has a cat-and-dog relationship with Q's
wife; indeed, he will not stay for a meal because he can't stand talking
to her, and the feeling is mutual. Q is certain she would never think of
confiding in Gordon, for example to say: "Lock at these awful letters
Q has written!" Gordon is more likely to confide in Q himself. Gordon's
politics are apparently solidly conservative. (His wife's other brother,
less involved with them, works for Rank.)
3. Q mailed the three test letters as follows: one in the morning,
the two following on successive afternoons, at the local box in the normal
way. One of the three envelopes actually contained a note: a simple
statement that "William" (Guillermo) had not defected but his brother had
(Cabrera Infante), information acquired from a Cuban official (see
separate contact reports).
4. Q wanted to get a lawyer's opinion on what regulations govern
publishing a periodical in his country of residence (he is not of course
officially a resident at all). Sensing additional costs and unnecessary
formality, Rodigast suggested that he keep it on the basis of being
a correspondent's reports, not a separate commercial press venture
requiring eventual licenses of payment of business taxes, at least for
the time being. Mailed first class, the material should require no permit
from the mail authorities. A contact had suggested he might have
difficulty with the locals (see report of Q's 15 November contact with WP).

HOME SITUATION
OFLA 3.146/1
My wife was rather hostile to my news about my contacts with the
Chinese comrades. Ste cuid she was sorry I couldn't work something
out with Metropolitan Features. I hadn't done enough work for thes
because i was lazy, she said. She said if I weren't careful I'd
be treated by the Chinese just What future was there in that?
she asked. Anyway, she added, "Ifidn't really give a damn about
the Chinese.-
t
*ber/1
She pointed out the situation was difficult for us. The landlord
in London was trying to evict us and we had no idea where we were
going. I had no substantial funds from the Chinese and was still
living on the gelerosity of the mericans (Metropolitan), she said,
Moreover, she was tired of being a grass widow. I was keeping secrets
from her, she had been certain for sometime, she said. She had had
enough trouble with my "secrets" in the past, she said.
However, she liked the idea of
sports, but was sorry about the
"objectivity" and the 50 copies only Dimić, There was no reason, if
I could get some help from the Chinese, that I couldn't make a success
of the newsletter and really be independent, she caid.
I emphasized to her that I had had contacted with the Chinese without
Ails' knowledge and that she should on no account ever mention the
matter with hin. She said that showed how the Chinese treated people.
nobody was more honest than hils, she added.
she added. What was happening to
him now wauld happen to me one day, she said.
However, she was genuinely pleased with the newsletter and spent some
time trying to collect material for the dummy I was preparing. She
wrote..x herself a piece on 2C.A.R.D. (I havex the feeling that a lot
of her resentment would be dissipated if she would allowed to handle
most of the business involved with the newslctter.)
The housing problem remains a serious one and we may have to move.
A temporary furnished flat in London would cost us at least £25 to
230 a week today at present, we pay 212-12-0 per week. We have
given the case to a lawyer, but, because it is a furnished flat, xc
will probably have to get out sometime soon.
The other important question to be settled is that of a mailing
aadress for the Report. Should I get a London mail drop and run the
risks of running into the Home Office or should I get a lawyer and
set the thing up legally, perhots under my wife's (British subject)
name? In that case, I could take a one-roon office iomewhere around
Fleet St. and my wife could take care of the mail with an occasional
office temporary during my absence.

1. The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBONY/1
and Marc SCHLEIFER. JAGUAR states that the information was
received from a "most secret and delicate source which has been
found reliable on previous occasions."
"STEBONY/1 was in contact with Marc SCHLEIFER while the
latter was staying in London with his family, en route for
Algeria. SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers
via Paris on the 2nd June, but he deferred his departure in
order to meet STEBONY/1. It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, if
possible, to visit Tanzania also. STEBONY/1 apparently was
prepared to help SCHLEIFER and his family to find accommodation
He is
while they were in London because they had little money.
also reported to have said that there was a possibility of his
co-operating with SCHLEIFER in Africa.
"According to our source, SCHLEIFER, while in London,
arranged to contact the Tanzanian Mission, in connection with
a job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIFER
or STEBONY/1."
2. Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/1 and
SCHLEIFER, of about the same period. While TIFFANY was in London
(which puts it at the right time) STEBONY/1 was in touch with
SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY should be able to compare JAGUAR's comments
with what STEBONY/1 said at the time. Ref B reflects a different
contact between the two, from a different source.

OFL-12 and CFL-13 were passed to the appropriate Headquarters desk for the
evaluation requested in reference.
The results of the evaluations were that the reports based on STEBONY/1's
elicitation contained "nothing more than chit-chat and opinion" with no new
information that could be disseminated. As indicated in the last sentence
+
of reference this result was not unanticipated by LCPIPIT.
In view of STABORY/1's reportorial capabilities however, we hope that his
continued efforts to elicit and report timely information will be vigorously
maintained.

1. JAGUAR, in acknowledging receipt of the processed STEBONY/1
material that we forwarded to them, have also asked for "further
information about Francois MASPERO and Professor Nguyen KIEN. We
should be most grateful for any further identifying particulars
for both MASPERO and KIEN and with regard to the latter, we should
particularly like to know his present position in connection with
'Africa, Agia, Latin America Revolution' and whether he still holds
a teaching appointment in Frpâce."
2. JAGUAR's note was shown to RODIGAST in London on 12 August,
just before RODIGAST met with STEBONY/1. LCPIPIT please provide
anything that can be had for passage to JAGUAR.
3. As should be fairly apparent, I think, from reading the .
material we passed to JAGUAR, plus the fact that there has been
no "Revolution" for lo! these many months, the status of anyone
connected with the magazine is about as uncertain as the status
of the magazine itself. Nonetheless, we will be happy to let
JAGUAR know as much as we can.

1. BAIRN, a sensitive SHOTH operation, provides the following
report relating to STEBONY/1 (date of info, 26 July 1965):
.
"STEBONY/1 (previously in touch with Pablo FERNANDEZ
while in Londan, en route with family to Algiers for the
international conference postponed when Den BELLA was over-
thrown) calls Pablo FERNANDEZ, tells him he (S/1) is just
back from North Africa if the confernece is held in November.
Says he has been unable to get any news of (Marc) SCHLEIFFER,
and asks whether Pablo has heard of him. Pablo says he had
a letter, brought by hand from SCHLEIFFER in Algeria, saying
he (SCHLEIFFER) was going the next week to Cairo, and would
write to Pablo from there. He has not yet written.
S/1 says
they had hunted for him high andlow in Algiers - he disappeared
completely from the conference scene, and they thought that per-
haps he had got mixed up in the (troubles between the new
regime and Ben BELLA's faction), Pablo assures 8/1 that
SCHLEIFFER is all right. He knows this from a negro journalist,
on "the Guardian" in the U.S.A. and coming from Pennsylvania,
who covered the Algiers conference preparations. The journalist's
name is, Larry HENRY or something similar. Pablo and S/1 agree
to meet to-morrow (27th July), S/1 will call Pablo then to fix
time and place. At 10.35 S/1 calls FERNANDEZ, arranges to call
for him at the Embassy at 13.30 hours for them to lunch together."

1. Career Agent Rufus F. RODIGAST has been briefed by Paris/
ICPIPIT on an ad hoc basis to date regarding information on the Afro-Acism
national liberation movement of operational interest to his handling and
guidance of SIMBONY/1. As the STEBONY operation progresses, however, it is
ICPIPIT's intention that those handling STEBONY/1 become more knowledgeable
on the subject of the national liberation movement than STEBONY/1, himself,
a msans to ensure the best possible operational guidance to the agent and
to provide another element of agent control--superior knowledge.

2. LCPIPIT's limited files include two basio documents:
Attachment to OFIM 630, and Book Dispatch No. 4463. We also have selected.
disseminations and reports on Chinese Communist activities in Africa. What
would be most useful, however, would be a collection of reports and analyses,
whether overt or covert, discussing the following topics: a) Jacques GRIPPA
and the pro-Chinese European Comamist factions; b) the Afro-Asian Journalists
Association (the Esadquarters TPRANSACK c/o has had a file on this organization
founding); c) the individual national liberation movements and their leaders;
d) operations of the national liberation movements, individually and
// collectively, out of such centers as Algiers (at least up to 19 June 1965),
||
Dar es Salaam, Acora, Cairo, Djakarta, Havana, etc/.; e) national liberation
movement relations with, and operations out of, the Bloc, both Moscow and Peking
oriented; f) support and guidance of the national liberation movement
by non-Bloc communist parties and selected fronts.
3. We recognize that much of the information on the above
mentioned topics may not yet be collated, if indeed it is available; however,
we should appreciate receiving from Headquarters such materials as you feel
would best meet LCPIPIT's operational needs in working with STEBONY/1. of
special valus would be a bibliography of overt writing on the subject, greatly
alleviating the security problem and mere logistics of bringing RODIGAST and
a large volume of classified reading together, in a secure environment, over
an extended period.

Dear Kettenbach,
TO:
Chief, KUDISK
FROMs Chief of Station, London
Attachment to OELA-43,589
13 July 1965
I'm pleased you have received at least one of my letters,
but I still wonder if you got a large envelope containing three
letters which had been held and return all at once. As one of
the letters was rather detailed and dealt with matters of some
importance, I'm rather disconcerted to say the least te
to think that it may not have found its way to you. The envelope
measured 8 by 5 inches and was light tan in color. A confirma-
tion of its receipt would be appreciated.
00
--
Of course, I understood about the service, the newsletter,
not being a definite thing. In any case, I am not looking for
a sinecure, but for a good, deep cover and that seemed to be one.
It also gave me something to offer contacts amb and would have
strengthened my position considerably. At present, my cover is
as light as the Emperor's new clothes.
-
Still no positive reply from any publication in the States,
and the general silence from my American "friends" is not very
encouraging. Here, the situation is much-better, and if I can
get to Algiers in good time, after visiting Grippa and Andersson
and seeing some contacts in Paris, my position will be better,
but I still see myself representing the West Indian Gazette or
Cinnamon and/or the Institute of Race Relations. Mrs. Sheila
Patterson, their editor, even suggested that I do a short paper-
back book for them, gathering together the conference documents
with an analysis. All of this is better than nothing, but it
definitely isn't much.
On the other hand, for the future, Noureddine Medjdoub,
who has been Tunisian cultural attaché here, is returning to
Tunis to take over the editorship of the Socialist Destour Party
paper, L'Action. He has suggested that I write some features
for him, after the Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers and that I
try to get to Tunis to discuss future projects with him while
I am in North Africa. You well know what many Africans and
Arabs think of Tunisia at present, so there may not be much
that we can do with this arrangement.
This afternoon, I saw Dennis Phombeah at the Tanganian
High Commission. Until three months ago, he was at the U.N.
He claims that Verges came to London last December and saw Babu
about me and other matters, but that Babu was not convinced.
He says he did not know that I was in London until recently
this was our first meeting since the spring of 1964. Now, he
proposes that he try to get the editorship of The Nationalist,
the TANU paper in Dar es Salaam, for me. We will discuss the
matter again at lunch next Monday. It would be a fixed post
in Dar and I can't yet fathom why he is willing to suggest
me for the job. He claims he has not been in touch with Vergès.

SOCROFILM
1. Subject to Brussels Station views, Headquarters believes that
STEBOHY's proposal in Reference is a good one and very consistent with
our interests that he develop his access and acceptability within the
circles of which Ref Iden A is a significant figure. We realize that
the picture is a complicated one, and that Iden A of Ref may or may not
yet prove to have the staying power of the successful political figure.
At the same time, it does seem that he is the most outstanding leader
of the anti-revisionists today, and as such merits our attention.
2. With regard to Reference para 4's concern about possible damage
to our national interest by publication of the book in English, we tend
to side with STEBONY in feeling that the support which such a publica-
tion might render to our enemies could not really be detected by the
naked eye. Similarly, while agreeing with the sentiment that would
critically scrutinize all proposals by new assets, we note that SIEBONY
is, indeed, supposed to be seeking to regain status among his former
associates, and that Ref proposal does not, to our view, contain any
hint which would suggest that in following out this line of action at
our direction, he is motivated by any ulterior or concealed aim different
from that which led us to impose the commission in the first place.
3. We are attempting to get a rough translation done on a priority
basis. STEBONY, of course, should understand that such a translation
vill be unfinished, und should be carefully reviewed for the proper
"feel," to rule out usage or interpretation which STEBONY, with his
background, would never have inferred from the French text. Bonethe-
less, as the document has come to hand only on 2 July, and given the
holiday weekend, the limitation on the number of translators available,
the existence of other translation assigments, and, finally, the pouch
transit time back to Rome, we regret that it will not be possible to
get this product to RODIGAST for his 15 July meeting.

The following further information has

1)
11)
iii)
iv)
GIBSON was to leave London on the 8th
June en route to Algiers via Brussels,
Lausanne and Paris, and he expects to
arrive in Algiers about the 20th June.
GIBSON has said that he will be in
Algiers in his capacity as a journalist
and that while there he may be contacted
through Georges ARROUD at the Directorate
of Information or through an American,
Marc SCHLEIFER, who is the representative
in Algiers of the 2nd of Kay Movement.
He has also said that he is anxious to
meet some responsible members of the
Afro-Asian Journalists' Association
Secretariat in order to clear his name
of the charges brought against him by
VERGES.
As a journalist GIBSON is hoping to be
allowed to attend the Second Afro-Asian
Journalists' Association Conference and
he has made enquiries as to when it will
be held.
In commenting on an invitation which has
been extended to Hodee EDWARDS to visit
North Korea, possibly via Indonesia,
GIBSON has said that he would very much
like to visit. Indonesia but that there
is little chance of his doing so as the
West Indian newspapers by which he might
be employed would be unlikely to pay the
cost of his fare.

QREBONY/Salary Raise for QREBONY/1
ACTION REQUIRED · REFERENCES
1. At the time of his recruitment in June 1965, QREBONY/1 was told that his
$600 monthly tax-free salary would be raised to $800 once he got a job in a target
organization, which of course was the goal of his planned summer activity in
Algiers.
2. Through no fault of his own, the Algiers assignment (and other possibil-
ities, such as Djakarta) evaporated shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, WOFACT changed
its signals and eventually decided to base QREBONY/1 in Europe targeted against
individuals and groups in various countries.
3. From the beginning, QREMONY/1 has proved more than satisfactory as an
agent. lie has carried out assignments given to him with knowledge and tact and
the proper spirit, has used his own initiative as much as our guidance, and has
not violated our instructions. No one will argue that he hasn't proved to be
better than we collectively thought he would be, and in terms of his own
abilities—apart from targets which may or may not be accessible to him he is
getting better all the time.
4. Last year, about a year later than QREBONY/1 might have expected his
salary to go up from $600 to $800, we raised it to $700. He was pleased, and he
has not complained as much as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably
QREBOWY/1 is responsive to the generally good treatment he has had, to the
respect for him as an individual and the appreciation of his services; probably
he is carried along as such by his own personal satisfaction in knowing he is
meeting requirements and continually breaking new ground.)
5. Nevertheless, LCPIPIT believes the time has come to raise QREEBOKY/1's
salary to the promised level. We can all agree that we are still getting his
services cheap; QREBONY/1 receives no quarters, living allowance, or educational
allowance for his children. His increased gratitude, the relief he will undoubt-
edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial worries, are more than
worth the extra $100.

MICROFILM
At their 15 March meeting, CREBONY/1 and RODIGAST discussed
QREBONY/1's running his own pro-Chicos group, at least as a
paper organization to allow him to get close to target conferences
and institutions as a bona fide delegate rather than bystander.
OREBONY/1 feels that if not done right this could cause trouble,
because of usual organizational rivalries. He is thinking of
beginning by writing and circulating a statement in support of
the statement on "Afro-American Liberation" which appeared in
the 6 December Ad Hoc Bulletin (Marxist-Leninist) in Chicago.
Ha would use a pseudonym to sign his statement, but would let
all his friends know that the pseudonym was really himself, and
he might use Manchanda's address. Perhaps Grippa would agree to
circulate or print it. If this statement goes over, CREBONY/1
could escalate into a small organization. He will show RODIGAST
a craft of his statement, but also will discuss it with Manchanda
for "ideological purity”.

Chers Madame et Monsieur,
Je m'empresse de vous faire savoir que j'ai fait
citer la Société des NOUVELLES EDITIONS INTERNATIONALES
pour l'audience du 13 avril prochain.
Or, je viens d'appendre que celle-ci est mise en
faillite et que Monsieur PINTA, Syndic de faillite, a été
nommé par jugement du Tribunal de Commerce.
Je ne vois pas, dans ces conditions, l'intérêt que
vous avez à poursuivre le paiement de sommes qui vous sont
dues par cette Société dont le passif dépasse de loin tout
actif.
Voudriez-vous, je vous prie, me donner vos instruc-
tions définitives compte tenu de cette situation.
Je vous indique d'ailleurs que vous pouvez produire
à la faillite entre les mains du syndic, mais que bien
entendu celui-ci vous demandera un jugement pour pouvoir
inscrire votre créance toute théorique contre la Société
qui, comme je vous l'indique plus haut n'a que des dettes
· et aucun actif.
j'attends donc de vos nouvelles et vous prie de
croire, chers Madame et Monsieur, à 1 expression de mes
sentiments dévoués.

At a meeting held on August 14, 1966, STANFORD mentioned that
Rbbert Williams allegedly has $1,000,000 available for the use of RAM.
NY T-10 advised on September 26, 1966, that STANFORD prior to moving
to Philadelphia on September 18, 1966, discussed RAM and ROBERT F. WILLIAMS
with him. According to the source, STANFORD has alleged WILLIAMS has money
available for RAM.
During the course of the conversation, STANFORD stated that the contact man
between RAM in the US and R. Williams' is one Richard GIBSON in Paris, France.
STANFORD stated that GIBSON passes on messages from WILLIAMS and will be, the
man contacted by whoever is designated as a courier to go to China to get the money.
Source also stated that he was told Richard GIBSON was living in the C
Crystal Hotel (phonetéc), Paris, France, and was working out of the La Royale Cafe
(phonetic), Paris, France.

Subject: RICHARD GIBSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING
A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable
information in the past recently advised that during the
Fall of 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist-
Leninist organization stated that one Richard Gibson was
suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency.
According to this individual, Gibson recently had been in
Milan, Italy, in the company of a female secretary from Paris,
whose home is in New Rochelle, New York. At that time
Gibson remarked his travel and activities were possible
because he had married a wealthy English woman. Other things
were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.
According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese
Marxist-Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning
Gibson to Rene Raindorf, a member of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist).
Raindorf reportedly thereafter met in Brussels, Belgium, with
Gibson although he had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese
communists would look into the charges of the Italian Marxist-
Leninist.

II The arrangement between the cover firm and QREECHY/1 should be on the basis
of a regular subvention to CREBORT/1 to act as a foreign stringer contributing
feature-type material to the press service. An agressant having been
ostensibly entered into by QREBONY/1 and the cover firm during the former
trip to the U.B. (expected around 20 July), a regular monthly check should
be forvarded to QRZSONY/1 by the cover firm, along with any correspondense
it may see fit (suggestions for pieces to write, comments on pieces received
etc.)
III The following steps are proposed to set this cover in motion:
A. At a meeting on 6 July, QREHOWY/1 will be instructed to write a number
of U.8. news media organizations stating that he expects to travel to
the U.8. shortly, describing his news background and indicating he would
be interested in developing sose cutlets for his writing. The cover
organization is one of those addresses.
ensvor
B. CIA's contact in the cover organization receives this letter end,
pureumnt to our direction, writes e emmer stating 1) what his firm
does, 2) that it would be very interested in handling CREDOWY/1's
prednot if it seems to fit the needs and 3) that it would be ready to
reimburse some of QRESORY/1's expenses if he could come to Chicago
discmes the matter further.
C. QUIROWY/1 does not meet the contact in the cover orgmimation. He is
2011/1
briefed to offer the story, on his return, that bind entered into a
ad
regular arrangement with the cover firm to preduse feature material
mable by the cover firm (not specifying the frequency) in return for
which he is to receive a monthly retainer.
Any letter QREBOSI/1, may later vish to send to the cover firm should
be given to us in copy preferably before it is sent.
E. Copies of my correspondence initiated by the cover firm should be made
available to CIA end, particularly, to the Project Case Officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Deputy Director for Plans
VIA:
Chief, CCS/NC
SUBJECT:
Request for Approval for Operational Use of
U.S. Free-Lance Writer
-
QREBONY/1
1. This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval pursuant
to CSI 240-6, 10 January 1963, paragraph 6, governing operational involvement
of personalities in the field of journalism. This request concerns cover
support for QREBONY/1, an asset currently handled by CA Staff, and involves
the cooperation of Russell R. DeBow, a Chicago city official and proprietor
of the Negro Press International Inc. GREBONY/1 was granted a POA on 23 May 1966,
and a full operational approval is pending. The project under which he is
handled was approved by Acting ADDP on 14 June 1966. Mr. DeBow was granted
a Covert Security Approval on 19 April 1966.
2. QREBONY/1 is an American Negro e.patriate journalist and author
presently residing in London. He is the author of one novel and numerous
contributions to a wide variety of publication, such as the Kenyon Review,
Monthly Review, The Nation, The Liberator and others. He worked as a reporter
for the Philadelphia Arro American in 1950, for Agence France Presse in 1959,
for CBS in 1960 and, in Europe, for the now defunct, pro-Chinese magazine
Revolution. As a result of broad contacts and acceptance among radical,
pro-Chinese and Negro militant circles, he has offered valuable access to
important targets spanning four continents, and has demonstrated considerable
skill in elicitation and exploitation of contacts for intelligence purposes
in the process. The immediate and paramount operational objective for this
agent is to gain direct access to hostile political targets in North Viet Nam
and China. The outstanding requirement to be met in support of this objective,
and of his continued effective exploitation generally, is the development of
a backstopped and viable explanation for at least a portion of his income,
which presently derives almost exclusively from clandestine CIA support.
The proposal outlined below represents the conclusion of considerable research,
including an interview with Mr. DeBow, to identify suitable cover arrangements
which would make possible this explanation.

QREBONY/1 Amendment of Memorandum of
Oral Commitment
1. The Memorandum of Oral Commitment with QREBONY is
amended effective 15 June 1966 to provide indemnification in
the amount of $10,000 in case of death, and payment of $600
per month up to $10,000 to his wife in case of total incapaci-
tation or disappearance.
2. It is anticipated that a trip planned for late
summer or early fall will take QREBONY into VC controlled
areas of South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and China. Indem-
nification is intended to apply to death or disability
resulting from air accident, act of war, or for disappearance.
3. Without being able to specify the possible circum-
stances, it is intended that such indemnification as outlined
above be deemed to apply to loss of life or functions suffered
by QREBONY as a direct result of his KUMARK relationship dur-
ing the trip. Such indemnification, if made, must be presented
to his widow by a cover mechanism which would hide KUBARK in-
volvement.

3. Mr. DeBow, a lawyer, is an Administrative Assistant to the Mayor of
Chicago as well as a long time, if casual, contact of Domestic Contacts Service.
His background includes assignment to the Intelligence Division of the Chicago
police and cooperation with CIA in the course of a trip to Africa in 1961.
Mr. DeBow also is part owner and in effective control of a very small feature
syndicate in Chicago, the Negro Press International, Inc., which distributes
rewritten news to Negro newspapers in the United States on a subscription basis.
4. On 20 June 1966, Mr. DeBow was approached by representatives of CA Staff
and Central Cover Staff, acknowledging CIA connection, and interviewed with a
view to determining the feasibility of using his service to backstop modest
payments to QREBONY/1 for real or ostensible contributions of feature stories
and reporting. (Since the contact was made to develop information pertinent
to the present request for DDP approval, the interview was conducted on a
hypothetical basis: QREBONY/1's identity was not revealed nor were any
commitments entered into.) This conversation, despite its limitation, demonstrated
clearly that such an arrangement involving Mr. DeBow and his firm would be
practical from Mr. DeBow's point of view and well suited to the needs of the
QREBONY Project. Mr. DeBow grasped the problem involved and suggested various
means by which he could plausibly implement a cover arrangement should this
be our decision. He was made aware of and understood the incongruity between
his and QRESONY/1's ostensible political positions, and stated that this need
offer no impediment to creation of the type of relationship which would be
involved. The nature of Mr. DeBow's feature service and its modest size
clearly enhance its usefulness and appropriateness for our objectives.
Mr. DeBow, in conclusion, expressed his agreement in principle to participate
in this cover support activity should CIA, on further review of its needs,
decide to proceed with a request for his cooperation.
5. In the light of the very favorable response from Mr. DeBow and the
determination, from reviewing the outlines of his operation, that it would
be a uniquely appropriate backstopping for QREBONY/1, your approval is
requested to recontact Mr. DeBow and establish with him suitable cover

SUBJECT
QREBONY/1
REFERENCE: Your Femorandum, Dated
10 February 1966
Jab
A Provisional Operational Approval is granted for the use of this Subject
as set forth below.
A Provisional Operational Approval issued by CI Staff grants the same
authority, on a temporary basis, for the use of an individual as the authority
granted in an Operational Approval unless other ise specified by CI/OA. It is
based, however, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
ject to a further final review when all investigation is completed.
(1) POA is granted to utilize Subject in an international context to exploit his
contacts and/or associations with a wide variety of personalities and organizations
(particularly Cuban and Chinese) engaged in "anti-imperialist" propaganda operations.
Subject will be expected to renew his old relationships and expand his circle of
contacts with Afro-Asian national liberation leaders, pro Chinese Communist, and
similar personalities and to report general political and biographic material rela-
tive to the interests, activities and plans of such individuals and their organizations.
(2) Requirements passed to Subject will be confined, insofar as it is opera-
tionally feasible, to instructions for the refinement and completeness of the reporting
he is capable of providing from his normal intercourse with source personalities.
Disclosure of classified information will be held to a minimum, he will not be given
operational assignments supporting or servicing other UZARK Sperations, nor will he
participate directly and/or vistingly in the spotting and/or recruitment of other ageats.
(3) In addition to this background, certain of Subject's past statements and
behavior are inconsistent with, and give rise to an uncertainty about, the nature and
degree of his presently professed motivations and loyalties. It is impossible to
resolve this uncertainty with the knowledge now available. At the present time,
therefore, it is believed that his bona fides have not been established to an extent
which would warrant handling him in any way than "at arms length".
✗To process the Operational Approval, full information (completed PRQ
Parts I and II) must be submitted as soon as possible and not later than six
(6) months from this date. An Operational Approval will follow when all
investigation is completed and upon the receipt of satisfactory PPQ Parts I
and II. Cancellation must be requested if use of Subject by interested Di-
visions ceases.

1. We are manifesting reports and correspondence concerning QREBONY/1's new
contact, Carole Piña, an American, age 31, born in New York City (possibly Bronx
County), whose father's last name was Appel or Appell. Hier husband's name is
Carlos Piña (Mexican), but she is separated from him and he is seeking a divorce.
She holds US passport, No. D633873, issued 5 August 1963 in New York; it comes up
for renewal in August (at which time she expects to be in Rome). She is afraid
that her having traveled to Cuba in 1964 with a Progressive Labor delegation will
hurt her chances of getting a renewal of her passport.
2. Subject had been having a series of political and amorous affairs during
her stay in Dar, and was in serious trouble when Q met her. After rejecting Dennis
Thombeah's advances, she was in serious danger of being declared a prohibited
immigrant; Q befriended her, and he and Colman Ferrer of the Cuban Embassy (who
had been having an affair with her) saw that she got out of Dar safely. Q was
to meet her in Cairo (but in fact had no intention of doing so) and later caught
up with her in Rome. She indicated a desire to work with Q (without quite knowing
for whom she would be working--he hinted rather broadly to her that he was in
cahoots with "our friends in the East," but it will be noted that in one of her
letters there is this disarming phrase: she warns him about how to deal with
certain persons and adds: "Be cool with them-do not show your true colors (what-
ever they are)").
3. Q seized on the opportunity of using subject as an unwitting informant
and eventually agent on the same basis. She submitted to an interview on tape
in a Rome hotel room which lasts about 2-1/4 hours, in which Q debriefs her on
her knowledge of every Tanzanian, liberation movement, or Bloc personality with
whom she had contact, and in view of her attractiveness and willingness she kne
quite a few. (She had some amusing run-ins with ODYOKE personnel in Dar, which
we shall edit out of the tape only for a fee.)

1. At his 6 April meeting with RODIGAST, QREBONY/1 pointed out that his
brother-in-law (the accountant) still thinks that (REBONY receives regular income
from an American radio or news feature service, paid through Switzerland, and
undeclared for tax reasons ((REBONY's and the American company's taxes).
2.
RODIGAST thought that if the brother-in-law finds this story hard to
believe he may guess that GREBONY is really working for KUBARK and may have passed
this information on to the British. Thus he would be the source of the story
relayed in reference.
3. At the same meeting, on another subject, RODIGAST Baked CREBONY whether
He said
he had ever told anyone pointblank that he (GREBONY) is a Chicom agent.
that he never had. RODIGAST broke in: "or the agent of any other country,
including CDYOKE?" QREBONY said he had not.

4. Q feels that she is emotionally unstable--his firmness in dealing with
her, his making it clear he was not out for her body, have made him a guardian
and true friend. She seems to be a good political reporter, understanding her
own (confused) political yearnings and where her various contacts stand; she
also seems to have a good memory for details. Q says that her "anti-revisionism"
is incipient anti-Communism. He could eventually recruit her as an ODYOKE witting
agent, but that would take a lot of time and trouble; with much less effort he
could effect a false-flag recruitment, and indeed, he has already done this on an
informal basis by making it clear that he was collecting material for his Chicom
friends. She would undertake further assignments for him. He actually asked her,
"Suppose I asked you to go somewhere, would you go?" To which she replied. "If
it's not cold." It is unlikely, however, that she would be able to return to Dar
because of Phombeah's hostility. Wherever she goes, her main asset will be her
physical attraction,
5. She could be debriefed further on any point raised in the tape interview.
The ideal would be to have the questions by the time Q goes to Rome in the second
half of April, but this does not seem to be a likely possibility.

posed in reference. If any further clarification is required by leadquarters,
please advise.
2. With regard to QREBONY/1's overt tax return, it has been determined that
declarations Lust be filed by all citizens with over $600 income. If it turns
out that QREBONY/1 cannot justify a $600 incere from overt sources, and we think
he cannot, he simply has no declaration to file and will be advised to so state
to the Embassy.

Ref: LOND 2425, 2 March 1966
1. A number of lengthly and fruitful discussions have
been held with JAGUAR officers regarding our continued
running of QREEONY in the U.K. Their comments on the
quality of CRIBONY's reporting hat been reported from time
to time. Similarly, we will not dwell here on the mechanical
arrangements we have evolved (with SWOTH's agreement) to
expedite the passage of information to JAGUAR, on the one
hand, and avoid duplicate reporting (prinicpally by passing
the same materials as CS dissems to SMOTH) on the other
hand. Suffice it here to say that achieving both of these
goals, without compromising CREECNY as a source throughout
both JAGUAR and SMOTH (due largely to the wide range of
areas he reports on), is a complex problem. We think we
have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement for
achieving both aims.
2. What we are concerned with here, then, is JAGUAR's
permission for us to run CREBONY from here, for the time
being at least. The exact phrasing from JAGUAR's letter,
agreeing to our request is: "ith regard to the continued
use of QREBONY by your service on a temporary basis while
he remains in this country we have no objection to this
provided we are kept fully informed of as much detail as
possible."
3. JAGUAR pointed out that CREBONY operates in the
same areas as some of JAGUAR's own agents, and this necessitates
a fair amount of frankness regarding his activities in the
U.K. We have made every effort to date to display to them
that frankness. In return, JAGUAR has been cooperative, if
not downright helpful. In one of our discussions, SMILL
confidentially stated that one of their sources had quoted
a sub-source as saying that CREBONY had admitted tohim that
he is a KUBARK agent. We assured JAGUAR that QREBONY is
under instructions not to reveal his KUBARK relationship,
of course; that QREBONY is not supposed to be recruiting any
sub-agents and has not done so; that the remark could well
have been made in jest, in reference to the charges levelled
against CREEONY three years ago (or longer). We told JAGUAR
that it would obviously be advantageous for us to know to
whom QREBONY is alleged to have made the statement, and we
would be grateful if JAGUAR could tell us. We have repeated
this request in writing, but with no reply to date. SHILL
stated at the time that he had doubts about whether they
could identify to us the person who had made the statement; he
was sure that they could not go back to their agent for
elaboration without showing an undue interest in CREBONY.
may yet hear who the person vas. All this is repeated here
merely to indicate how far JAGUAR will go to be helpful, and
how far, to date, they will not go.

resolved before being taken up with Q, and thus he has a somewhat rosy
view of the operation. The satisfaction of accomplishment (i.e., being
able to produce useful answers to our questions) is surely a factor
in his present attitude.
Though light-skinned, with a voice and accent which would be
considered acceptable in any PPRIL, society, Q is extremely sensitive
to the fact that he is a Megro. He has not said or suggested any such
thing to Rodigast, but this is so obvious a factor in his correspondence
(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of
his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigast that it must be a factor
in his life. On the other hand, Hodigast has known another legro who
was a close friend of Q (and now one of his major enemies, as a result
of the Paris forged letter incident and contributing events) who was
so sensitive about race that he makes Q in retrospect seem like an
Uncle Tom.
Still, Rodigast does not believe Q could be handled by someone
who is not genuinely a "ni-ger lover", i.e., who could not convey
a convincing image of a person for whom a color difference was not a
barrier (Q would surely detect the false "pal"). Q has mentioned anti-
Negro prejudice as a reason for his refusal to cooperate with ODITY
officers who talked to him while he was in New York. In fact, Q deals,
with his present case officer as a possible if not a true friend;
they share an interest and involvement in writing, English literature,
living happily abroad, etc.; Rodigast has tried to read Dante in the
original and Q has done so%; Rodigast would like to write a novel and
Q has published one; Rodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical
positivists who interest Q but probably gives a convincing impression
that he would like to know about them, and just might be capable of
understanding them. What all the foregoing means is that in Q we have
an accomplished person, and it is a useful tactic to treat him if
not as a superior than at the very least as an equal.
There remains the possibility that opportunistic reasons are
primary: Q joined the organization and stayed with us because he could
not do as well in any other job, could in fact get no job (because of
his background, his alien status abroad, etc). Rodigast does not exclude
this, although he feels that whatever the original motivation, it has
been strengthened and perhaps converted into something more worthy.
But even if his primary notivation remains material, the history of the
project over its first nine months suggest it is a viable one.
C. Q has lived in the underground for so many years without
breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. He thinks
fast, handles himself well in matters presenting security problems.
He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. Rodigast's long
meetings with him always include advice on one or more specific aspects
of clandestine work, which when added yp may be taken to represent a
short, course, but that is all. The lack of training has led Q to do or
say things which Rodigast would not have wished him to do or say, and
whenever possible this has been brought to Q's attention, and he seems
responsive to such instruction.
Rodigast would not recommend that Q be given a training course,
but this would not preclude more formal sessions with Rodigast during
which Rodigast could give more complete instruction on various phases
of clandestine work.

A. QR_BONY/1 (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at home
in his new work. He responds well to sugestions and instructions, adds
suggestions of his own for improving the plan-- an indication that he
wishes to please. In the beginning he showed a tendency to raise minor
objections involving personal material problems (e.c., inconvenience to
family life of a long tdy) but less of this was remarked as he came to
realize that requirements were to be reasonable and he was to be treated
as a human being with his own problems.
He has stated that he would not continue his present involvement
with target personalities and institutions if it were not that we wish
him to, i.e., his own inclination would be to withdraw from the political
fringe. Podigast feels that this is consistent with his background,
which was not a party career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical
and hostile to the "rovement"; later he was involved in opposing party
people in his New York work; in Paris he didn't get along with his party
friends (the affair of the forged letter) and of course broke with the
magazine crowd there.
He seems to be genuinely committed to working against enemies
of CDYKE, ready to accept even deeper commitment; he has expressed
no reservations as to what he will do. He doesn't object to reporting
on old friends, fellow FBPRIMES, et al. He raised no objection to
FLUTTER, or using s/w techniques (which he took with him on a trip to what
was then a very hostile area, where he had known enemies, and where
there was a recent history of dealing roughly with outsiders). When
orders conflict with personal desires (for example, when he planned to
spend a weekend in a city he enjoys but was told he should proceed
immediately to his next stopping place), he obeys without hesitation.
The foregoing is a collection of miscellaneous facts, but taken
together they paint the portrait of a promising agent, both in terms
of motivations and abilities.
27
B. Rodigast's knowledge of Q's attitude in the months prior to
recruitment (June 1965) is limited. Rodigast has the impression had
simply reached the end of his rope-- he had nowhere to go, he had
earlier decided that he would like to work for or at least cooperate with
ODYOKS (although earlier attempts to make contact met with no success)'.
The humane treatment received at the hands of his recruiter, the
subsequent sympathetic handling by his case officer, undoubtedly
convinced him that he had not made a mistake.
The material factor is not to be underestimated.
The demoralizing position of living on his wife and worse, on her family,
must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast
simply doesn't know how Q might have responded to a reasonable offer
from enemies of ODYOKS at that point. The prospect of immediate engagement
at a decent wage may have been decisive.
Since that time, Rodigast feels Q's motivation has been reinforced
and perhaps considerably altered: he has been asked to do obviously
necessary tasks, and so he can feel he is needed by someone; he has been
given reasonable instructions on how to accomplish them; he sees that
others are concerned for his personal safety and material wellbeing.
Rodigast has taken pains to avoid giving the impression that there was
any confusion or error or difference of viewpoint in running the project
(even at a time when there were plenty of all three); such problems were

rarely been a minute or two late, and in recent meetings--presumably
because he feels that kodigast's never-failing appearance on the
precise second of the meeting must mean that this is required KUBARK
practice- he has been even more precise. Rodigest is always ready
with a suggested solution to a security or other problem which will be
faced by Q in carrying out a new assignment.
On the other hand, part of Q's satisfaction with KUBARK might
derive from a feeling that KUBARK is a "soft touch". Rodigast does
not recommend that anything be done to change Q's opinion (if he really
does hold it); Rodigast feels that we are going to pay Q as much whether
he likes us or doesn't, and for the same money we might as well make
sure he likes us and will do his utmost for the organization rather
than simply be a timeserver keeping up appearances. If given cause
for resentment, his behavior is unpredictable, for he hasn't much to
lose-- reputation for lyalty, good name, etc. One solution would be
Ito give him enough so that he would indeed stand to lose much.
Q appears to possess a realitsic, sane view of ODYKE, what
its people are like, what can and can't be done by it. As already
indicated, he seems to be as loyal a FBPRIER as other people who don't
give much thought to the matter, certainly a lot more loyal than his
background would lead one to expect. In any case, we have no
recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himself
to be a loyal PBPRIER; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't
make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodigast.
Q is unlikely to hold sympathetic feelings for CDSINY, having
had what he described as an unfortunate experience or two with them.
On the other hand, he is sophisticated enough to assume that his
reporting on PBPRILRS is of concern to ODINY, and he must know
that his own suggestion for tdy in PBPRIMS to contact target
instititions and old friends there would put him into ODENVY territory.
He would probably accept any necessary collaboration without showing
that he didn't like it.
_

E. Rodigast does not believe Q is at present working for another
service, but it is difficult to know what would happen if another
service approached him. Rodigast assumes he would report this to us,
just as he reported in detail the overtures by two persons apparently
working with the services of the country in which he resides. As part
of the present operation involves the possibility that Q will in fact
be approached by the opposition, and Q is aware of this, one assumes
he is prepared to remain loyal to KUBARK; one would also assume he would
recognize the heightened value of his services to us should he be
approached by the other side and continue to remain loyal to us.
Q certainly would not agree to work for an opposition service
for peanuts, but if offered a considerable sum of money (given that
he just breaks even in his present arrangement with us, in the
thinking of Q's wife), there is no telling what he would do. When
recruited, Q was told he would get a raise once he got settled "in place"
(to $800), and when this promise is kept he will have enough extra
money to begin to pay debts and buy clothing, and thus have more
concrete evidence of the material advantages of his present arrangement.
Rodigast would be very surprised i: Q agreed to work for an
opposition service not for financial reasons but through ideology.
Q likes to live well. He believes in wearing good clothes,
staying in good hotels, being able to invite others out for food and

It would prove very useful to us--both as a contribution to the
preparation of the Project Outline now in progress and as a backgrounder for
possible discussions of QREBONY's operational utilization--if RODIGAST
could provide us with an interpretive assessment of him based on the
impressions and judgements he has been able to develop over the past months.
We have some such initial assessments, of course, and can infer more from
current reporting. However, we would like to get the benefit of RODIGAST's
unique and direct contact, now that QREBONY has passed through a breaking-in
phase and settled down in a regular relationship which, at its inception, is
certainly a difficult one for most people to adjust to. We would suggest
the following outline of topics for RODIGAST to follow:
A. Estimate of loyalty to ODYOKE and QREBONY's psychological
adjustment--his comfortableness--in working for ODYOKE clandestinely:
his attitude, as RODICAST can infer it, toward targets hostile to
ODYOKE: in short, his ideological motivation.
B. Estimate of his motivation generally: his personal reasons for
association with KUBARK.
C.
Psychological suitability and staying power in leading a "double
life". Possible or actual strains on him by virtue of his wife's attitude.
Qualms about the "morality" of his position or fears about being found out.
D. His own views of his patriotism or loyalty. His attitude
toward RODĪGAST, KUBARK, ODYOKE and ODENVY.
E. His susceptability to approach or control by an opposition service.
F. Methods of control to which he is mort, and least, responsive.
What represents the effective lever of his control--internal ideological

Q gives the impresion of not being easily moved. He has
already survived violent attacks, questi ning by legislative committees
and police (including abroad), public denunciation; now that he has
KUBARK as a friend he should resist at least as well as before. One
negative trait is his need to take revenge for injury, and this
tendency must be controlled; his instinct to be spiteful to an enemy
could conflict with a longer-range plan.
It is to be hoped that the present situation regarding his wife
(who believes him to be working for the arch fea of B-RIME) will be
possible to maintain. She doesn't like the situation much, but accepts
it, and apparently hasn't betrayed his "confidence". If he is moved
to another city which both Q and his wife would consider agreeable
(Rome) she would probably be even happier and less likely to revolt,
especially if a quarters allowance helped them get out of their present
financial straits (they can pay rent and buy food but not save or
repay debts- so his wife says he is doing an unpleasant thing without
even being able to say they are better off than they were in Paris).
If he were sent to a less agreeable place for six months or a year
(say Dar) he would went to settle his wife in a desirable place (London
but preferably rome) for the children's schooling; here too her attitude
would depend on their material position and on the possibility of
his being able to visit on occasion (if he were in Dar, say, and she
in Rome, he would return for visits-- which would also be cover
for his meetings with his case officer). Rodigast recommends that once
in place, Q's basic wage be raised (as promised in June 1965) from
$600 to $800, but that he also receive quarters and if possible
an educational allowance.
D. Q says he is a local PBPRIMER. He now does act like one.
Rodigast feels the evidence for his loyalty is at least as good as
it is for most other PBPRIMERS he knows. Early in their relationship
(probably mid-June 1965 in Paris) 2 had said he had turned away from
the revolutionary movement and toward his own country; even though there
were opportunistic reasons for him to have done so, he is seemingly
not anti-PBPRIME. His views on Negro problems in PERFI probably have
not changed, but he never was a black nationalist, and has many friends,
besides his wife, who are white). He might not agree with ODYCKS policy
in Vietnam, Cuba, or elsewhere-- he obviously has not been questioned
; on his personal beliefs- but his dissent, if dissent there be, is
not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent him from executing
KUBARK policy to the letter. Undoubtedly he has a leftist economic
orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodox Marxist
one (or that it ever was).
,
He seems to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together.
He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast,
however, apparently feeling that this is not necessary, might not
be appreciated, and would conflict with the compartmentalization so
obviously kept in force by Rodigast (who hasn't told Q his true name
address, marital status, or any other personal fact which might lead
to identifying him). Seemingly does not believe the name which Rodigast
used at their introduction was a true name, for he didn't bother to
remember it (the last name), and all this would tend to discourage the
building up of a personal friendship.
.L,
It is probable that he respects rather than scorns KUBARK for
its decent treatment of him. KUBA through Rodigast has always kept
its promises, Rodigast has never been a minute late for a meeting (Q has

drink. He says that in the revolutionary movement poverty is no virtue,
but merely indicates lack of influence. He says that the most popular
persons are those who can dispense money, alcohol, and women. This may
well be true. It is certainly true that such a role would please Q
immensely (that is, having a plush apartment in which he could entertain
target personalities, satisfying KUBAPK's requirements and his personal
desires).
F. Q must be dealt with firmly, with continued serving of requirements
and planned itineraries for trips. At the same time, it is obvious that
he improvises well when left without instructions; he is versatile,
and can create situations which will result in an intelligence product.
Rodigast's method is to suggest reasonable plans and to be ready to
show that they can be implemented, and how they can, anticipating
objections.
While there is no evidence that if left alone Q would drift,
dragging out an assignment to fill time, it is possible that he would.
He has not written as many free-lance articles as Fodigast would have
liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering
material, selecting a point of view and thinking of the public to which
it would be addressed-- a lot of work for articles meant to serve mainly
as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaps merely to be
used to convince editors that he was active. On the other hand, he produced
the first issue of the newsletter in record time, following instructions
to the letter (indeed, accepting what must at times seem like petty
editorial changes made by Rodigast). Perhats he produced the latter
so efficiently because he saw in it added prestige, an opportunity to
get his name back before the public in a respectable context.
Ideological motivation would not seem to be a level of control
in his case. What is most important is his contentment with being (he
hopes) a permanent part of a large organization, with a steady salary
(he has never said this, of course); the power of CDY.KE is less
important than its known reputation for keeping its promise to pay,
something one doesn't find among the opposition groups known to Q,
and he finds new examples of this daily.
Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here-- Q
is now in a position where he can thumb his nose at some of his enemies.
Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with Q, letting
him know where he is going, what he can expect, not changing the rules
abruptly or pulling a rug from under his feet, letting him see the
possibility of small but certain increases in material benefits in the
course of his career, compose the ideal formula for handling him.
In the course of time, the ideological factor, which is perhaps marginal
at this time, would probably be reinforced, could one way be a major
factor. Q, meanwhile, must feel that the persons who deal with him
are concerned with his material wellbeing and also of his physical
safety, appre iating the risks in his work and understanding that not
all assignments will bear fruit. Our relationship with Q could be destroyed
very rapidly if we failed to pay him as promised, or wasted his time
with make-work, or came him confusing or contradictory instructions which
suggested that KUBARK was not the all-powerful institution he may now
think it is.

G. Very early in our relationship Q said that he would like
to make a career in KUBARK, outside now, perha > inside some day. He
would work in PBPRIL, or abroad. There was no indication then, and
has been nome since, that he regards the present dationship as a
distasteful one to be terminated as soon as conditions permit.
He would like to settle in en expatriate's paradise, such as
Paris or some, presumably involved in journalism and other writing.
If he could do these things in connection with his work for us, so
much the better.
H. Q is conscious of the need for security and handles himsel: well-
as well as an amateur could in this context. But he is far more naive
about techniques and especially the nuances of technique than Rodigast
would have expected in one who had been involved in the revolutionary
movement for so long. He often needs instruction on obvious points,
and responds quite well to it, the exception being his clumsy handling
of the s/w method-- he is an intellectual and not a technician, and
Rodigast assumes that he (Ridigast) would not do much better, if forced to
use same technical system.
Q is quite observant. He will recall a personal remark made to
him by Rodigast from one month to the next. His reports written some time
after the event are thorough and apparently accurate.
He read A Spy and His Master by Christopher Felix, and has
mentioned it a couple of times when a remark by Roiigast reminds him
of something sain in the book.
Roligast doesn't think that even after training Q would be very
good at throwing off surveillance (for example) as he seems too matter
of fact to be sly, and perhaps slightly lazy about what might be
gratuitous behavior (e.g., changing subway trains or taxis just on the
assumption that someone might be following him). Rodigast's solution
is not to depend on for such things, but to attempt to plan mesting
and stage other operations so as to minimize the need for dependence
on Q's skill in such areas. After patient briefing does understand
the need for tradecraft efficiency, and as already noted he follows
the advice.
I. At first Q qas quite concerned about money- he needed an
advance for clothes, for travel, etc. His requests were really plaints,
and he may have left the impression that he thinks of nothing but money.
It was the complex of a poor boy who never had anyone he could turn to-
despite a scholarship he had to leave a fine college aiter a brilliant
freshman year. Once he received his advance and began receiving his money
at the begiming rather than at the end of each month, and when he
realiz-a that he would, receive complete and prompty reimbursement of
expenses, he began to relax. Now he submits accountings without
himself totalling the figures or keeping his own record (Rodigast knows
this for he has seen Q's notes), so he must rely on us to tell him how much
he claimed for (even Rodigast would never do that). He is, in sum, relaxed.
The same ease is to be noted in his substantive work; he submits
his reports knowing he has done his best, and done well; he accepts
compliments with a very slight nod. When Rodigast first met Q in a hotel
room, Q had something of the hunted man. He still seens harried, slightly
nervous at the moment of contact, but on the whole he is more sure of
himself.
At the outset, Q would argue about assigments, suggesting
alternatives, worrying about not having time to buy tickets, or enough
money to pay for them. Now he accepts instructions without a murmur,

Increased Federal Income Tax Liability
!ty - QRPHONE-1, Employee No. 802799
In compliance with the recent Exactment of the Revenue ond
Expenditure Control Act of 1963, Subject's tax liability has increased
from $70.00 to $90.00 per month. This represents the additional
Burtax charge and begins with the July 1968 pay period. Effective
2 December 1963 (1969 tax year) the tax liability will be reduced to
$80.00 per month. The Station should effect the change and contime
to T/A tax withholdings to Headquarters.

LIVER FUNCTION TESTS
On 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Daly of the Bio-chemistry
Laboratory of West London Hospital for liver function
tests. My family doctor, Dr. Hodes, sent me to Daly as
a private patient, as British practice is not to take these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
My doctor thought I showed no signs of a recurrence of
hepatitis and the normal practice would have been, at most,
for me to have been examined by the specialist at the
hospital, who might then decide to ask for the tests.
Daly said that all required tests, except the B.S.P.,
would be done. He said he thought the B.S.P. unnecessary
unless the others indicated negative factors. In which
case, he said he would ask me to come in again for that.
test.
Daly will send me the results of the tests and his bill
c/o American Express, Rome, within a week.

BRITISH VISA GRANTED
On 10 April 68, I was finally granted a British visa,
without restrictions, valid until 15 Feb. 1969. No
questions were asked when I went to the Home Office
to get the visa.
My Home Office file number is: € 110880.
From the Metropolitan Police, I received Aliens Régistration
Certificate & 662567, which lists me as correspondent for
Negro Tress International.
I was told by the police that I could apply within a year
to have the registration requirement vaivered because I
married to a British subject. Moreover, I am free to
take any sort of employment or open a business without
restrictions or having to request permission from the
Ministry of Labour.

SECRET RYCAT
REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT
April 65.
1.
ORPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who
provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has
received a Provisional Operational Approval, dated 23 MAY 66.
Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project
QRPHONE.
2. QRPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965,
was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period
of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated
1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as
amended) since that date, ORPHONE/1's employment continues on a
month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a
30-day notice.
3.
QRPHONE/1 receives the following financial entitlements:
a.
Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a
"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure
effective 1 July 1967).
NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances
as carried on WOFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary
and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-¨
quarters to discharge QRPHONE/1's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the
Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised
to honor the original "tax free" commitment made
at the time of his recruitment and at the same
time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY
citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.
b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel
unless these are paid by other sources in which
case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement
against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1.
Since security considerations preclude processing
of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-
tional expenses, and as an added inducement to
QRPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain
confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a
small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,
LCPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/1 for each day
during which he is required to be absent from his
home on confidential business.
C.
NOTE: Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1
is to be effected on the basis of the procedure
approved by Chief, LCPIPIT and COS/London, a copy
of which is attached. This procedure is authorized
in view of the security considerations applicable
to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge
of this operation within WOMACE.
QRPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable
office allowance of $100 per month.

4. QRPHONE/1 will be compensated by WOFIRM in an amount
mutually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his
family to a new residence if such relocation is considered
desirable by him and WOFIRM. NOTE: This provision was included
in ORPHONE/1's original Letter of Agreement and was retained in
this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for QRPHONE/1
to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.
5. WOPIRM has arranged for a portion of QRPHONE/l's finan-
cial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also
agreed to repatriate ORPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done
for operational reasons to enable QRPHONE/1 to qualify for
foreign residence. Should QRPURE be obliged to honor this commit-
ment, WOFIRM will guarantee this QRPURE commitment and will
reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.
6. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QRPHONE/1
of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-
accountable and which shall be charged against the operational
expense category of approved Project QRPHONE.
7. QRPHONE/1 signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true
name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that
its provisions are still in effect.
8. QRPHONE/1 is aware that he may be required, from time
to time, to undertake an SGSWIRL.
9.
QRPHONE/1 is aware of all provisions of the Memorandum
of Oral Commitment with the exceptions of paragraph 6, which
describes an internal WOFIRM procedure; certain aspects of para-
graph 3a--specifically that WOFIRM is paying LNFORT taxes in
his behalf; and certain aspects of paragraph 3b--specifically
the procedure for write-off of funds since this is an internal
WOFIRM procedure.

INLAND REVENUE MONOLOGUE (required)
Until April of this year (1968), I lived mainly on assistance
from my wife's family and occasional freelance journalism
outside Britain. Also, I had some savings and investments
in America and Switzerland to draw upon. My brother-in-
law, Gordon Kaye, purchased a house at 32 Hartswood Road,
Stamford Brook, London, W.12 for us — the price of the
house being considered a loan to be repaid over the years
as is possible. My children's school fees were paid by
convenant by my brother-in-law, as well as a grant in
convenant to my youngest daughter.
I was not a legal resident of the U.K. until 8 April
1968, and on that date I began officially my duties
as Overseas Representative and Correspondent for Negro
Press International of Chicago, with a salary of $300
per month.

Forwarded under separate cover is a revised Memorandum of
Oral Commitment covering the WOFIEM relationship with QRPHOME/1.
This revision reflects most of the suggestions made in Reference A.
2. As said in Reference B. QRPHONE/1 does not fall into the
category of WOFIRM asset usually handled by LCPIPIT. This fact
plus the very stringent security considerations which must apply
to this operation dictate that certain procedure be followed in
QRPHONE/1's case. Handling of this case has been facilitated by
Headquarters' understanding and approval of the need for such care.
3. We request that this revised Memorandum of Oral Commitment
be approved, and that we be so notified.

1. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of
QRPHONE/1's report on his expulsion from Switzerland. In it
ORPHONE/1 concludes that the Swiss Border Police must have
learned of his planned arrival through a phone tap on a call
he made to Lausanne from Italy on the 18th of January.
2. Regarding QRPHONE/1's statement in paragraph two of
his report concerning his having visited Switzerland many times
since 1963, please see PALP-4738 of 1 October 1965.
3. QRPHONE/1 has been instructed not to pursue any further
protests with the authorities (either Swiss or American) over
this matter.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT

pet";

1.
QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOPIEN as a Pield Agent who
provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has
received a Provisional Operational Approval, dated 27 MAY66.
Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project
ORPHONE.
2.
QRPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965,
was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period
of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated
1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as
amended) since that date, QRPHONE/1's employment continues on a
month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a
30-day notice.
3. QRPHONE/1 receives the following financial entitlements:
a.
b.
C.
Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a
"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure
effective 1 July 1967).
NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances
as carried on WOFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary
and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-
quarters to discharge QRPHONE/1's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the
Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised
to honor the original "tax free" commitment made
at the time of his recruitment and at the same
time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY
citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.
Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel
unless these are paid by other sources in which
case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement
against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1.
Since security considerations preclude processing
of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-
tional expenses, and as an added inducement to
QRPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain
confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a
small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,
LCPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/1 for each day
during which he is required to be absent from his
home on confidential business.
NOTE: Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1
is to be effected on the basis of the procedure
approved by Chief, LCPIPIT and COS/London, a copy
of which is attached. This procedure is authorized
in view of the security considerations applicable
to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge
of this operation within WOMACE.
QRPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable
office allowance of $100 per month.

1. This memorandum outlines a new procedure which is to be
cllowed in the handling of the operational costs of field agent
•RPHONE/1. This new procedure is being instituted in order to
hance the security and compartmentation of the handling of the
administrative aspect of this project and parallels revisions in
Kẻ handling of operational traffic. The new procedure which is
als ‘ussed below is in accordance with accepted field procedures.
"
:. Currently QRPHONE/1 receives advances and accounts for

be given to QRPHONE/1 by his handler (Career Agent Rufus F.
<UDIGAST) and will be carried on RODIGAST's accountings as oper-
ational expenses supported by receipts from QRPHONE/1 acknowl-
edging receipt of the funds. This RODIGAST accounting and the
QRPHONE/1 receipt will be used for write-off of the funds againsz
approved project QRPHONE. No detailed accountings and no
receipts carrying QRPHONE/1's true name are to be maintained in
the LCPIPIT/Admin files.
3. It will be the responsibility of Chief, LCPIPIT and the
roject case officer to ensure that QRPHONE/1 is supplied with

1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/1's
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program.
He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.
We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm.
•
2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) From an administration standpoint
this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

swiss explusion 2 last
Milan on 18 Jan. (My train reservation was made in Milan, not
London.) I also spoke with Atkins of AP in Geneva, who told me
he had filed a story after wife's call about an American
Negro Journalist being refused entry into Switzerland. He asked
for more background on me, claiming that New York had expressed
interest in developments. Atkins believed that I could get the
ban lifted by protesting to the Swiss Press Attaché in London as
a professional newsman. He said he believed Swiss authorities
were rather jumpy about "suspicious" individuals entering the
country since the large Biafran shipments of Nigerian currency
to Zurich earlier in January. Whatever the real reason,
although I do resent not being able to talk with Etienne I
was counting on him to reestablish links with Nils Andersson
in Albania and to give me a picture of the altered situation
among pro-Chinese Communist parties in Western Europe since the
latest split from Jacques Grippa's party in Belgium --, I think
the expulsion is a most useful incident to prove that I am indeed
a good revolutionary and I intend to exploit it as fully as
possible, within reason. That is, no overt diatribes against
"how the Man operates in Switzerland, say in the Los Angeles
11
--
Herald Dispatch, but to inform as many people on the Left as
possible of the incident and let them draw their own conclusions.
Michael Bakafa/Petros Defta, who was expecting me in Geneva for
an interview on 22 Jan. was informed by a wire from Verona that
force majeure prevented me from keeping the appointment and that
I would be writing him when I returned to London.

ARREST AND EXPULSION FROM SWITZERLAND
Brigue, 20 Jan. 1968.
The Milan-Geneva TEE reached the Swiss border at Brigue at
about 1030. It was evident that the Border Police were ex-
pecting me the usual lone civilian inspector of passports
was accompanied by a uniformed policeman. I was taken, with
baggage, to the station immigration office. My wife went with
me, but was apparently not covered by the ban on me. When the
official in charge of the office phoned Lausanne and Berne, he
was informed that I was to be expelled immediately and that they
did not want to interrogate me.
Great effort was made by the official in charge of the office
to be polite, especially when I made a rather vigorous protest
at the expulsion, claiming that I had never been informed of
the ban on my entry in Switzerland, said to date from 16 Dec.¨
1963, and that, in any case, I had visited Switzerland on
numerous occasions since 1963 without interference. Moreover,
I was a professional journalist accredited to the United Nations
and was indeed on my way to Geneva to visit the U.N. Office
there, I said. The official seemed somewhat baffled by this,
because he had been informed I was en route to Lausanne, but I
showed my tickets valid to Geneva. Nevertheless, with the
greatest of apologics, I was escorted this time by a plain-
clothesman. to a train back to Italy at 1130. My wife could have
stayed in Switzerland but I asked new is return with me.
--
--
During my detention, my wife phoned Gilbert Etienne in Lausanne,
informing him of the situation, the Associated Press office in
Geneva (speaking to a Mr. Atkins) and the U.S. Press Attaché,
Frederick Pic: Steiner, in Berne. Actually, I had told her to phone
as many wire services as possible, but she assumed I also wanted.
to get the Press Attaché to protest on my behalf. In any case,
the shortness of time between trains prevented her from making
more calls.
When given the attached formal notice of the travel ban by the
Swiss official, I refused his request that I sign it and warned
that the expulsion was a violation of Swiss agreements concerning
the freedom of access to the U.N. Office in Geneva which I fully
intended to protest formally and bring to world attention.
--

Later, from Verona, I spoke myself frer with Gilbert Etienne, who
was convinced quitet correctly, I believe that his phone is
tapped and that my arrival was isZETEd communicated to the Swiss
Federal Police through a phone conversation I had with Etienne from

QRPURE's have been briefed carefully as to QREBONY/1's radical
aura, presumably they would have a good idea as to the kind of publi-
cations these might be.
4. For operational reasons, we would prefer that the arrange-
ments indicated in paras 2 and 3 above not be broached until after
QREBONY/1's departure from the United States, some time in mid-
October. We will advise you of his departure so that you can make the
necessary arrangements thereafter at your convenience.

QRPURE/QREBONY/1 Relationship
--
1. This will confirm our conversation of 18 September 1967, in
which we discussed QREBONY/1's plan to visit QRPURE some time
during the week of 25 September 1967, and you agreed to give CRPURE/2
prior warning of this visit. In accordance with the same conversation
QREBONY/1 was briefed that his visit should be mainly a question of
touching base with ORPURE, maybe a friendly luncheon with CRPURE/2
but that no substantive discussions affecting their ostensible rela -
tionship (i.e., amount of money, amount of QREBONY/1 production for
ORPURE, etc.) were to take place. You were to brief CRPURE/2
along the same lines, and also to indicate to him that, contrary to our
original thinking, we would now like to have QREBONY/1 given a by-
line, whenever ORPURE/2 feels he can do so.
2. In addition to the above, we would appreciate it if you would
take up with QRPURE/2 (and/or ORPURE/1, as appropriate) the pos-
sibility of increasing the amount of money funded to CREBONY/1 via
ORPURE. As indicated to you, we would like to increase the current
$100.00 monthly to $300.00 monthly, but would like your careful
examination with QRPURE principal(s) that this amount is not excen-
sive either in terms of their willingness to handle or in terms of
QRPURE's ostensible ability to cover.
3. Please also mention to QRPURE/2 our desire to have QREBONY/1
open a small office in London, and our thought of perhaps including
QRPURE (along with other publications) as a name on the door or on
his letterhead. Would QRPURE/2 (or CRPURE/1) have any objections?
Would he have any objections if any of the other names are of more
radical publications? It would not be operationally feasible or desir-
able to let him know in advance which these would be, but since both

niven in the draft NOC. Since the effective date of his relationship with
WOFIRM will one day be the basis for an equitable terminal settlement, or
might assume other administrative significance, we suggest that the para-
graph be amended to reflect this: "OPPHONE/1's employment with
WOFIRM which began 1 June 1965, was originally formalized by a Letter
of Agreement for a period of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of
Oral Commiticent dated 1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains

This
1. GREBONY/1 was recruited by WOFACT on 3 June 1965.
recruitment was performed by an officer from WOMUSE/ICG since
GREBONY/1 (then known as STEBONY/1) was viewed as a "double agent"
penetration of pro-Chinese communist groups. CREBONY/1 has per-
formed well in a difficult and dangerous environment. He is a
clandestine agent operating against targets violently anti-WOLADY
and of priority interest. The administration of CREBONY/1 requires
special care since, by the very nature of his role, he is not
typical of the average LCPIPIT asset.
2. CREBONY/1's initial employment was by Letter of Agreement
for a period of three months. This Letter of Agreement expired
1 September 1965 and was replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment
dated the same day. This oral employment agreement remains in.
effect at this date--some two years later--, but has been amended
to adjust compensation. Certain inaccuracies in the original
MOC have also been corrected subsequent to its preparation. Given
the sensitive nature of CREBONY/1's relationship with WOFACT it
is sometimes difficult to adapt the operational realities of his
situation to the administrative requirements of WOFACT. However,
with great understanding at home and in the field, we have reached
a very manageable situation.
3. In order to codify the entitlements and procedures applicable
to QREBONY/1's employment the undersigned has prepared the attached
revision of the HOC underwhich CREBONY/1 is employed. It is requested
that BOS approve this revised MOC and notify LCPIPIT of approval by
15 October.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT
(Revised to include all changes and amendments operative as of
14 September 1967)
1. QREBONY/1 is employed by WOFACT as an independent con-
tractor for certain services of a confidential nature. He has
received an Operational Approval, dated
aspects of his activity are charged to Project QREBONY.

2. GREBONY/1's employment under this agreement commenced

can be terminated by either party on 30-day notice.
It
˚ 3. QREBONY/1 receives the following financial entitlements:
a. Compensation so computed as to give QREBONY/1 a
"tax-free" figure of $800 per month (this figure effective
1 July 1967). NOTE: The actual breakdown of QREBONY/1's
finances as carried on WOFACT books is $700 monthly salary;
$100 non-accountable operational allowance; $70 tax supple-
ment withheld at HQS to discharge QREBONY/1's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the Covert
Tax Committes.
b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel,
unless these are reimbursed by other sources in which case
WOFACT will offset such outside reimbursement against WOPACT
financial obligations to QREBONY/1. Since security considera-
tions generally preclude the detailed accounting for mis-
cellaneous travel expenses, per diem will be paid at the
rate of $20 per day during periods of authorized travel.
This per diem authorization was qualified by a personal
ruling of Chief of Station, Paris/LCPIPIT dated 12 July 1965:
"If subject is absent from his home station on
authorized travel for part of one day and returns to
his home station the night of the dame day (i.e. if
no hotel expense is involved in the sense of overnight
accommodations), then he shall be entitled to draw
HOTE:
1/2 of his authorized per diem of $20 per day (i.e. $10).”
QREBONY/1 has a revolving fund (advance) to assist
in meeting operational and travel expenses.

QREBONY/1 will be compensated by WOFACT in an amount
mutually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his .
family to a new residence if such relocation is considered
desirable by him and WOFACT. NOTE: This provision was included
in QREBONY/l's original Letter of Agreement and was retained in
this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for QREBONY/1
to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.
5. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QREBONY/1
of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-
accountable and which shall be charged against the operational
expenses category of the budget attached to the FY 1968 project
renewal.
6. QREBONY/1 signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true
name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that'
its provisions are still in effect.
7. QREBONY/1 is aware of all provisions of this Memorandum
of Oral Commitment with the exception of paragraph 5, which
describes an internal WOFACT procedure, and certain aspects of
paragraph 3b, specifically that WOPACT is paying LMPORT taxes
in his behalf. NOTE: He was promised tax-free compensation
in his original recruitment and we have devised the current
procedure to honor this commitment while fulfilling the require-
ment that all WOLADY citizens pay taxes on funds received from
LEFORT.

1. LCPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which
have been rather haphazardly maintained over the past year or
so (much of this time the project was without a case officer).
In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been
unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational
Approval applicable to QREBONY/1. We do have a copy of the
Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW
1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed
during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move,
or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to LCPIPIT.
any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.
2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the
FY 68 Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents
which ought to be available to LCPIPIT.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1
by Jacques Verges' lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer
on behalf of his client. CREBONY/1 will probably accept this,
after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and`
effective ammunition for use in his continuing battle to counter
Verges' allegation that he was a WOFACT agent. It is our reading
at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this
effort and that this settlement from Verges will be the final
triumph in his campaign.

Chers adame et Monsieur,
Je m'empresse de vous faire savoir que aftre
VERGES propose de vous réglerg en dinars algeriens la moitié
des sommes demandées, ce qui me semble intéressant pour vous,
compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstance; de cette affaire,
soit :
total :
7.500 ir pour M. GIBSON d'une part, et
5,250 & pour me GIRSON d'autre part
12.7 0 &
Je dois vous indiquer que cette proposition est
un peu inespérée, car il est clair qu'en poursuivant la Société
des NCUVELLES EDITIONS INTERNATIONALES, vous gagnerez une cer-
taine somme dont je ne puis fixer le montant, mais ne toucherez
jamais rien.
En ce qui concerne la lettre digt. GIBSON
m'avait eatretenu, non Confrère ne me répond/šůr ceile-ci.
Je pense qu'il n'y a quand ême pas lieu d'en faire une question
de principe et que nous pourrious, dans le cadre d'a reçu, obi
tenir une phrase be sur ce qui a été dit à votre sujet.
L
En out état de cause et si nous parvenions à un
accord sur cette base, Me VERGES propose de tenir cette soure à
votre disposition dès votre premier voyage en Alérie.
Je crois qu'il serait préférable que, d'une manièr
ou d'une autre, cette somme soit remise à une personne ayant votri
confiance.
Si toutefois vous pensez que je dois tenter d'ob-
tenir un peu plus, vous voudrez bien je vous prie e le faire
savoir, mais j'insiste sur ce point qu'il est quelque fois préfé-
rable d'attraper que proposition à la balle! plutôt que de ris-
quer de tout perdre. CS CUPY

CONTINUING SHITISH IMMIGRATION PROBLEM
Returning to London from Stockholm on 10 July, I was again queried
by British Immigration about my failure to register as a permanent
resident. My excuse has always been that I did in fact co to
the Home Office, but no action was ever taken because I rarely
rezained in the country more than a month. However, this tale is
wearing thin and I fear that I may have much more serious trouble
in the near future.
It would sees to me that the best solution might be to become
the official London correspondent of MPI or any other outfit
that night have me. I would need a letter to that effect and
would require a notional salary of about $5,000 per year, I believe,
but even this might raise questions from the British Inland
Revenue.
Sone advice on this problem would be appreciated.

1. We now have JAGUAR's comments on the proposed "roup"
designed to allow (REBONY to expand his access by "represent-
ing" something - even if only a purely notional group. The
letter from JAGUAR is attached.
2. We would observe that JAGU: &'s comments are obviously
made in a constructive vein. Similarly, JAGUAR seems to take
a protective, almost proprietary interest in considerations
affecting the SONY project. We naturally welcome this ïcel-
ing on their part, since CREBONY continues to exist as a U.K.
based operation at their pleasure. and we think that JAGUAR's
comments are sound, in substance. Their final comment also
veils, to say the least, the understandable SHORANGE reluctance
to see yet another splinter group i-spawning, with the fright-
ful political implications if a KOLBY spy were exposed thale
running a phoney "pro-Chinese" group in the U.K.! (It would
probably be not too good in WCLADY, for that matter, Lut a
government could fall here as a result.)

E. ENSLIVER was particularly impressed by QREBONY/l's library
of radical books and pamphlets. RTSLIVER turned over to the under-
signed for copying and return a recent issue of Williams' The Crusader,
and a copy of QREBONY/l's own newsletter. These were received with
feigned interest, although of course we had earlier received the saze
items from RODIGAST (already forwarded to Headquarters).
F. INSLIVER did not recall meeting Mrs. QREBONY/1, and did not
know how many children QREBONY/1 had. He described QREBONY/1's house
as attractively middle class. He was aware of the fact that QREBONY/1
had gone to Kenyon College and praised QREBONY/1's writing skills.
QREBONY/1 showed him a number of articles he had written which
FNSLIVER said completely followed the Chinese Communist line. RESLIVER
was surprised that some of these articles had been printed in the United
States in spite of their political orientation.

CAR JUDGE INDEXING
MICROFILM
1. The relationship between OREBONY/1 and AMSQUAW/1 is a particularly
Important one from both the production and security points of view. AMSQUAW/1
has been a prolific and reliable reporter, expecially ou items dealing with the
International War Crimos Tribunal, and it will be highly desirable for her to
continue to serve in this capacity in the forseeable future. It is recognized
that AHSQUAW/1 is not a controlled agent and that her personal willingness to
serve as a clandestine informant of (REMONY/1 is based upon a complex and inter-
related series of reasons, both personal and ideological. OPEBONY/1 helped her
out of a tight situation in Africa and has befriended her since her arrival in
London. For the last several months she has been living at his house. QREBONY/1
has a very agreeable personality and is a genuinely likeable person. At the same
time, although she is not an ideological person, she shares his pro-Chinese
ideological position and she has never questioned his explanation that her
reporting is for the Chinese. Lastly, we cannot and have not, overlooked the
likelihood of a physical attraction between the two. In the last analysis it is
ispossible for us to state exactly what motivates her to act as a clandestine
informant for CREBONY/1.
->
2. It is quite possible for the relationship between QREPONY/1 and AMSQUAW/1
to change at any time. Should their relationship take a turn for the worst it
night possibly have adverse security implications for CREBONY/1. This subject
has been discussed at length with CFESONY/1 and he agrees that great care must
be taken. He is careful to use AMSQUAV/1 only in situations where it would be
plausible for the Chinese to have an interest. Thus far this has been relatively
masy, indeed at the Stockholm sessions of the Russell Tribunal the absence of any
Chinese representatives served to confirm in AMSQUAW/1's mind that QRESONY/1 was
the Chinese man on the scene. At this point no actual problem exists, but both
LCPIPIT and QFPEBONY/1 are alert to the possibility that one could arise.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: CILIBERTI Conversation with RNSLIVER 26 April Concerning His
Meeting with QREBONY/2
1. On 25 April BASTEAR told me that RNSLIVER was in London and was
planning to meet with QREBONY/1. BASTEAR accordingly suggested that
R#SLIVER be debriefed by the undersigned the following morning. Accordingly
I met with PNSLIVER for about one hour, from which meeting the following
highlights seen worth recording:
A. I told KNSLIVER that we (WOFACT) had been interested in
QREBONY/1 at the time that he was writing for China Quarterly concerning
his dispute with the editor of Revolution, Jacque Verges, but that we
had lost tract of him of late. "How that we are in QREBONY/1's home
town, RYSLIVER was told that we and Headquarters would be interested
in any information on QREBONY/1 which could be reported as a result
of such meetings as RNSLIVER had had with him.
B. KNSLIVER said that he had told Leo Labeds that he would like
to meet Ibrahim to gain some understanding of what was going on in
the African exiled community, particularly as it related to the Sino-
Soviet split. Labedz said that he thought that FNSLIVER would do much
better by talking to QREBONY/1 where he, Labedz, said was one of the
few people around from whoa Labadz could learn anything.
C. RNSLIVER met QREBONY/1 at QREBONY/l's house. RNSLIVER did
not have a complete roster of those who were there to participate
in what RNSLIVER described as a "political bull session". He
remembered only (in addition to himself and QREBONY/1) of Matthew
#koana and a girl from Mexico City named Sucesos, who he said knew✨
a great deal about guerrilla goings-on in Venezuela and whose
address he said was Calzada, Tacuboya 103, Mexico 18. RNSLIVER
said that Nkoana said practically nothing throughout the evening,
apparently because he found RNSLIVER's presence odd and unnerving.
D. RHSLIVER was as impressed with QREBONY/1 as Labeda had
predicted he would be. He described QREBONY/1 as remarkably knowl-
edgeable concerning Chinese factions of Communist movements in
Western Europe and Africa. He said that QREBONY/1 had described
his recent trip to Nicosia and Cairo, had mentioned that he had
visited Dar-es-Salaam, that he knew Jacques Grippa, and that he
intended to visit Stockholm in connection with the Pussell Tribunal
and a possible Stockholm visit by Robert Williams.

GRIFFITH VISIT
Conversation with Prof. William 3. Grißffith, London, 25/4/67.
Tadeusz Horko phoned my home to tell me that XXXXXX Griffith, who
is spending a sabbatical year in Murich from MIT, wanted to see me.
Later that evening, Leo Lapehdz and Griffith arrived. Stella Joyce
of Amnesty International and Matthew Akoana also arrived unexpectedly.
It turned out that Lebedz and Joyce had often talked over the
phone, but had never met.
Griffith told me that he had recently visited East africa. In Dar
es Salaam, he had met David Sibeko and Ahmed G. Ebrahin of the PAC
(Pan Africanist Congress). He said his distinct inpression was that
PAC was on a strong pro-Chinese course. Griffith said he had written
to Mana Manoso's old address in London in an effort to contact him,
but had learned later that Mahoro was now at Kirki Kirkland House,
Harvard University. He said he looked forward to talking with Mahono
when he went briefly to the USA in lay.

It would sees to me that the best solution might be to become

Cher Monsieur,
Mon confrère adverse, Conseil de la Société Nouvelle
des Editions Internationales, et de Monsieur VERGES, me fait
savoir qu'il a eu une conversation avec e VERGES qui lui a
indiqué qu'il vit actuellement en Algérie et serait disposé
à rechercher un règlement amiable des difficultés qui vous
opposent.
Il m'a fait part qu'actuellement sa situation ne
lui permet pas de payer en une autre monnaie que la monnaie
algérienne; savoir le dinar.
Il y a là une question de principe. Pourriez-vous,
je vous prie, me faire savoir si vous pourriez ênvisager une
transaction aux termes de laquelle vous seriez réglé en dinars.
J'ignore d'ailleurs dans quelles conditions l'exportation des
capitaux d'Algérie est encore possible à ce jour.
Quoi qu'il en soit, peut-être seriez-vous intéressé
par cette proposition.
Je n'ai pas encore discuté de chiffres avec mon
confrère adverse puisqu'il s'agit là d'une question préjudi-
cielle à toute discussion sur le fond de la somme due.
J'attends donc votre prochaine réponse et vous prie
de croire, cher Monsieur, à l'expression de mes sentiments
dévoués.

I phoned Schwartzenberg and informed him I would agree
to a settlement, but the amount to be paid in any currency
would necessarily depend on the extent to which Jacques
Vergès apologized for his accusations against me in 1964.
I said I d not mind if Verges attempted to lay the blame
for those accusations on a "hisunderstanding" or on erroneous
or malicious misinformation given him by others.

As HQS is aware, GREBONY/1 has been pursuing a legal action against Jacques
FL201-190164
Verges. He has now received a letter from his lawyer which seens to indicate
that Verges is willing to make some sort of settlement--although he can only pay
in Algerian dinars. QPEBONY/1, of course, is willing to accept a settlement
provided it includes sone sort of apology from Verges. Armed with this apology
QREBONY/1 could then dispose of any lingering doubts regarding his political
reliability caused by Verges' accusations and would also have the ego gratification
of forcing Verges to eat his own words.

1. QREBONY/1 told RODIGAST at their most recent meeting that he did not
have to file an overt tax form for 1966 because his gross overt income for 1966
was less than $600. This will not be true for the 1967 tax year and he will
have to file in the Spring of 1968. The operative sentence in the 1966 Tax
Guide For US Citizens Abroad, US Treasury Dept IPB Pub No 54 states--"Every
citizen of the United States, regardless of where he resides who is under 65
years of age and has a gross income of $600 or more during a tax year must
file an income tax return."
2. For the record the undersigned who is as yet unfamiliar with all

MICROFILM
1. On the basis of the documentation submitted under reference dispatch, the
Medical Staff feels that QRPHONE/I made a surprisingly fast recovery and seems
well on the way to complete health. However, the hospital report (a quick transla-
tion of which into English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still
reflects some inconclusive levels in the results of the various chemical tests shown.
Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since
ORPHONE/1 apparently felt well enough to travel to France, but the Medical Staff
believes it would be advisable for CRPHONE/1 to undergo another series of liver
function tests, to include the following:
+
a. SGOT
b. SGPT
c. Bilirubin (1) Direct
(2) Indirect
(3) Total
d. B.S.P. (Bromsulfophthalein)
e. Serum Proteins
Albumin
Globulin
Total
We assume ORPHONE/1 has consulted his own physician on his return to the UK,
but the Medical Staff has pointed out that clinical examination alone is not always
sufficient to determine complete recovery from hepatitis.

In fact, it is all fixed with the Home Office. They will

and they, of course, will check with us. Eb should not be
encouraged to be flippant or sassy with the Imigration people,
but he doesn't need to panic, either. He should behave in
a reasonably straightforward and natural way - so he should not
be encouraged to think we have "fixed" things for him.
I also discussed again with Jaû the question of having him

BUCEOFILM
1. Transmitted under separate cover is an excerpt from a recent
Senate debriefing of a PBRUMEN defector, in which QREBONY/1's
name was mentioned.
2. We do not believe that the testimony is particularly awkward for
QREBONY/1, and while we had an opportunity to have this portion of the
testimony stricken from the record, we elected not to do anything about
it since it would have involved revealing WOFACT interest in QREBONY/1.
3. FYI, In order to avoid any concern on the part of QRPURE should
this portion of the testimony ever hit the press, KAMMERMAYER
mentioned the reference to CREBONY/1 in low key to QRPURE at a recent
meeting. QRPURE exhibited no concern.
4. Please have RODIGAST brief QREBONY /1 concerning the testimony
at an early opportunity.

Returning to the U.I. on 15/3/67, I was warned by British Immigration at London Airport that
I was spending more time in Pritain than outside the country. The Immigration Officer inspected
my passport closely, counting the number of trips I had made since getting that passport, which
had been issued by the U.S. Embassy in London, on 1 December 1965. However, no explanation was
asked for concerning the travel. I explained that I had intended to resettle in Switzerland or
France and was spending so much time in Britain only because my wife, who was British, had been
helping to take care of her elderly parents in London. I was told nevertheless that I should
go to the Home Office and apply for temporary residence in Britain.
Before doing so, I would need to knows
1) whether I should in fact do so;
2) how should I describe my work, if ary, and source of income.
At present, upon investigation, the British would learn that I have no visible means of income,
except for perhaps for my Reports and some freelance journalism, but nevertheless receive money
regularly from a Swiss bank account.

If I told the Home Office R
I was a freelance journalist, I imagine they would iemand some sort

for possible taxation. Even if I say I have no exployment of may consergance and maintain myself.
on income from investments made in Switzerland and elsewhere, I might have to verify that statement
and pay some sort of British taxes. Considering the positions of my brothers-in-law, I doubt if
either could get away with claining to fully or partially support my family, ale my brother-in-
law Gordon Kaye, tho is a Chartered Accountant, has been deducting my children's school fees
from his taxes by means of an educational trust fund, although he no longer pays anything towards

In any case, I need advice on this matter urgently, as I suspect I may soon how – – Asit from the
Home Office if I do not go to them voluntarily.
