NERDGERSNTY IN SUGAR PRODUCERS UNION OPPOSED
Sante peninge Redio Clarin Nituerts in Spenian 2200
[Station commentary)
AFT TË PL
(Text) We have insistently said that to belong to the famous Union of Latin Amerie
can Sugar Producers--to which the mhilippines has been added-net (word indistines)
or beneficial to the Dominican Republie because there is a notable difference betwee
produsing and exporting countrics and in their respective interests,
We have also criticised the series of limitations imposed on the Dominican Republia
by virtue of meetings held and commitments soquired. Those limitations and commit-
ments are made in exchange for nothing because a country that produces sugar but does
not export it has nothing to lose in agreeing to limitations on its free right to
negotiate, to sell, and so forth.
Right now the Philippines has acquired a contract on sugar sales for a 5-year period
with a U.S. refinery amounting to 650,000 tons annually. Did the Dominican Republis
know anything about this? Or did it learn about it, as we did, from international
news dispatches? What prior consultations were made? How does this (tagree) with
famous meetings and agreements of Cozumel, Puerto Plata, Lima and calit
It is not that we believe the deal with the Philippines will have any effect on the
price of sugar or the market; however, we take the opportunity to stress this example
and make know the reasons we have had and have to criticize the Dominican Republic's
entry in an international group from which we will get no benefits.
AUTHORITIES DENY ARRIVAL OF ANTI-CASTRO LEADER
Santo Domingo Radio Clarin Network in Spanish 2200 GT 30 Mar 76 PL
[Excerpts] It is not true that anti-Castro exile Olandacht in the Dominican.
Republic, Demigration Director General Commodore (Ret) Enrique Rafael Valdez Vidaurre
declared today. He added that a report to the effect that Dr Bosch had been expelled
from Costa Rica to our country was journalistic speculation. The report had been
made in San Jose, Costa Rica, last night by a spokesman for the government of President
Daniel Oduber.
The Foreign Relations Secretaria; today also pointed out that it had no knowledge that
Bosch had been expelled to our country on orders of the Costa Rican Supreme Court
after many countries consulted by the government of that Central American country
refused to admit the anti-Castro exile.

(Text) San Jose, Costa Rica, 22 Mar--(ACAN-EFE)--Costa Rican Poreign Minister. Consalo
J. Pasio this afternoon rejected criticism by newsmen who have said he is propitiating
a rapprochement with the Cuban regime. Facio said that the Castroite adventure in
Angola and the proletarian internationalism doctrine it represents have thrown cold
water on the possibility of renewing relations with that island.
•
The minister thus responded to a newspaper editorial which noted the dangerous incline-
tion of the Foreign Ministry toward reconciliation with Cuba at a time when, according
to the commentary, the Havana regime has decided to embark on an expansive and aggressive
foreign policy..
Pacio rejected this critician and freed his ministry from all responsibility for what

The foreign minister commented that the adventure in Angola and the theory advanced by
Cuba--according to which it is prepared to back insurrections provoked by communist
movements--are very much taken into account by Costa Rica and are considered to be

Pacio also said that he did not share the opinion of the New York TIMES which commented

expelled from Costa Rica on the charge of meddling in the country's domestic politics
The accusation was made by the president of the PRD's Executive Committee, Rodrige

One of these charges is based on former President Jose Figueres' statements to a newsman
from Mexico City's newspaper. EXORESTOR to the effect that Vesco had financed several
political parties during the 1974 election campaign. Another one is based on statements

POR XIXISTER PACIO CLARIFIES COUT REPORT
San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GT 7 Jul 76 PA
(Text) Referring to the news conference he hold yesterday in connection with the alleged
plotting of a coup d'etat in Quatemala, Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Pacio said that
his statements were distorted by certain international news agencies.
BF
Facio said that the Quatemalan Government was not involved and had no part in the plot.
He added that the coup was under preparation and this was why he and the security minister
had gone to Quatemala to investigate the armed movement apparently headed by Cuban
Orlando Bosch.
Facio said the coup was not imminent but that it was suspected in view of Bosch's trips to
Guatemala.

Congressmen Concerned Over Rumors
San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 7 Jul 76 PA
[Text] A motion was submitted today at the Legislative Assembly to summon Public Security
Minister Mario Carpentier Gambos and Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Facio to explain
in full detail at a plenary session what is really happening in Guatemala. Furthermore,
we see some connections in the plot, which is now a chronic occurrence originating in
* Guatemala and El Salvador, against our country's institutional stability with the CIA's
collaboration. Precisely this week the Public Security Ministry ordered James Williamson
to leave the country. As we all know, Williamson is the CIA's chief in Costa Rica. During
Figueres administration he was declared persona non grata for publicly bragging about
the activities of the CIA, the Costa Rica Libre Movement and other groups trying to over-
throw the government in power at the time.
:
We expect Charpentier and Facio to explain to the deputies and the nation what is really
happening in Guatemala and what role the CIA is playing inthe plot to overthrow our democratic
institutions and to place Costa Rica under a fascist dictatorship similar to those which
exist in the continent's southern cons.
ODUBER STRESSES COUNTRY'S PREEDOM OF PRESS
Paris AFF in Spanish 0240 GT 7 Jul 76 PA
[Text] San Jose, Costa Rica, 6 Jul--President Daniel Oduber today reiterated that there is
unlimited freedom of press in Costa Rica. He was speaking on a nationwide. radio and television
network in connection with the forthcoming UNESCO conference on mass communications media,
which will open in San Jose on Monday.
He said that Costa Rica is willing to allow the holding there of a discussion reflecting
all the various trends of thought regarding freedom of information. "We want the delegaten
to make an on-the-spot evaluation of the system of freedoms--including freedom of speech--
existing in Costa Rica," Oduber emphasised,
Odubor contended that he is against state control of publicity agencies and the communications
Media, although, he said, a certain amount of coordination between the government and
those agencies in necessary.

PORE IMEISTER REPORTS EX ALLEGED COUP PLOT
San Jose to Reloj in spanish 1730 CHT 6 Jul 76 PA
(Excerpts) Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Gonzalo Pacio told nemmen during & Dow
conference just ended that he spent the weekend in Guatemala with Costa Rican Publie
Security Hinister Hario Charpentier Gamboa talking with Quatemalan Government officials
about a coup that was supposed to take place in the next few days in Guatemale to
overthrow President Kjell Laugerud Garcia,
Pacio said that orlando Bosch and other persons were presumably: involved in it but that the
names of the others would not be immediately revealed. The Quatemalan Government has the
situation under control and the plan has failed.
BE
Facio said: [recording] (And since we also know) that Orlando Bosch had entered and left
Guatemala several times using different passports he has (words indistinct). He came and
went from here. We felt that it would be advisable to make a fast trip to Quatemala to
take a close look at things and to talk (word indistinct] with Guatemalan officials.
Mario Charpentier and I went to Guatemala on Sunday afternoon and held the pertinent
conversations. Of course, I talked with the foreign minister; Mario talked with the
defense minister. The two (?reported to the president), and we reached the conclusion that
there was nothing serious--that there is always the same group, which is connected or [words
indistinct] with the same group which people say is a (?cell) of world communism and must
be smashed.
He
To me these people are completely half-witted and irrational, and I believe that part of the
whole thing was the usual gossiping by Orlando Bosch and the group that helps him.
boasted of (Thaving support) from other governments [words indistinct] and the important
thing was that the Quatemalan Government learned that there was at least talk about a
movement and offered, very sincerely in my opinion, all cooperation to avert continued
activity of this type.
'
Minister Charpentier and I came back pleased with the results of our efforts. I wanted to
[end
tell you this so there will be no other interpretations of our trip to Guatemala.
recording]
Facio said in connection with the coup brewing in Quatemala that, unquestionably, there are
groups who are interested in violently changing the government to establish a rightist
regime, such as the one sponsored by the Free Costa Rica Novement [MURL].
Asked if this coup plan was related in any way to one former President Jose Figueres was
allegedly hatching, Facio said there was no connection. Asked if U.S. citizen Willis;mson««
Riformer U.B. Embassy official--had anything to do with it, Facio said he has no concrete:
evidence involving him. He added that Williamson has 15 days to leave the country.
The Guatemalan Mano Blanes and the MORE have always been involved in these matters, Facio
id. He ended by saying that he has nothing concrete about the coup and that his and
Charpentier's purpose in going to quatemala was to gather information and to inform the
Quatemalan Government so it may thwart any further coup attempts against Costa Rica,

Now I will enumerate the activities of this organisation that re
directed by the CIA as an organ of the U.S. Goverment.
New York: Through Gustavo Marin I learned about a gemoral coordination of ABDALA with
persons of other counterrevolutionary groups to create a more concrete and stronger
program of terrorist actions. It is in this marrer that ABDALA directly participated
in the founding of the so-called Cuban Pront of ational Liberation (FL), whose
fundamental objective was to carry out terrorist acts, The talks on founding of
the FLNC were held by the ABDALA leadership and orlando Bosch, Dr Valley and
Dr Humberto Pontana.
Leyve
I was introduced to a counterrevolutionary by the name or
Gutierres, a militant of ABDALA who directly participated in the seven against
the Cuban Consulate in Madrid, Spain. A powerful explosive was played at the entrance
of the Cuban offices in Madrid, causing severe material damages. ☐ Tw wirions were
totally destroyed and the rest of the offices were seriously damaged well as other
floors of the building where the consulate was located." Present at the time of the
explosion were the Cuban consul, his wire and other officials.
Knowledge of plans of terrorist acts against veruelan tourist offices in Puerto Rico:
These acts were carried out by Juan de Dios who resided in Puerto Rides They were
developed in reprisal for the temporary detention of Orlando Bosch in vere suelan
territory and were of course made known to the CIA by mm. Nothing was done to stop
them. The CIA also know of and coordinated through ABDALA a public event in New York
City when a terrorist act was to be carried out against the building of the Cuban
mission to the United Nations using molotov cocktails. This was called off by the
CIA through officer Brackenhouse when some contradictions arose in esordinating with
the FBI on how it should be dom.
The CIA knew of attacks by persons residing in Miami against Cuban fishing vessels
17 international waters in which leader Gustavo Marin directly participated. Cesar
Sanches, a CIA informer, also took part..
Enowledge by the CIA and coordination of terrorist activity against the Cuban Embassy
Öuban.
in Montreal, Canada: In this second attempt, the ABDALA group, which was going to
use as liaison, was given a certain quantity of explosives. I mat explain that
this was not carried out because the required prior coordination with the ROMP, the
Canadian authorities, was not made, even though the coordination with the FBI had been
made. In personal conversations held with FBI agents, the NSA--this is the National
Security Agency--and representatives of the Justice Department at the federal level,
which took place in the Federal Building of the southern district in the city of
Manhattan, the possibility of controlling the activities of these terrorist groups
inside V.B. territory was discussed. Howe, despite the talks, that is, the
GIA--did not interrupt the activities in these terrorist programa donersationa
in
with the ABDALA leadership, I learned of possible attempts on the lives of certain
individuals in exile who had defrauded the counterrevolution. This foek place I months
before the death of the notorious counterrevolutionary leader Joriento.
I also learned about the attack on the Hispano Warehouse in New York City be

The Rativity was authorised by the CIA to determine how far the AHALA Cerrorist
apparatus would go. By then, Bob (Dynus), a CIA officer who supplied explosives,
was participating in the operational program with ABDALA, Bot. (Dynus) now works in
OIA programs related to Ohile.

[Press conference held by "Former CIA Agent" Manuel de Armas in Havana on 22 April 1976--
· videotape }
(bat) First of all, I would like to explain that I am going to read a written state-
ment which I have great interest in presenting in such a way that there is no doubt
about the quality of its contents. That is why, due to a problem I have in expressing
myself in Spanish, I would like to proceed in this manner.
I would like to take this opportunity to denounce what has been a phase of my life,
country
country. My objective is to openly.
also to briefly explain my presence in thisly or indirectly, against Cuba under the
dencuncs all immoral acts carried out,
spomorship of the North American goverment, of which I have, knowledge.

the United States until 1969 when I was recruited by the Central Intellige nos Age ney.
Ny relations with the CIA and a number of U.S. repressive organizations began then.
In doing this, great difficulties arise in cases such as mine. There are always marty
unanswered questions as to my possible motives or political affiliation. My motivation
has been created over a period of 5 years of personal, political and ideological degrad-
ation resulting in a high degree of personal frustration. Regarding my political
affiliation, I unfortunately have nons.
I know that many who listen to this press conference abroad will identify me as part
this system. Nevertheless, I would like to make a brief explanation. I want to
it very clear that it is not directed to those who accuse me of being allied to
system, because I do not owe them an explanation. Perhaps, the thing I would lik
best now is that those who accuse me would be right, but unfortunately their concept
of identification, just like mine during the past 5 years, has no meaning in this
evolutionary system;
past 17 years of revolution have not been based on identifications, but on principles,
rinciples that many are not capable of recognizing precisely because they lack them.

North American intelligence agent and, of course, functioning at the service of
North American political interests, I lived approximately 5 years in a world of
opportunism, in an inmoral manmr of ideological degradation and in an antiprogressive
position which have forced me to come to Cuba to denounce these facts from a totally
personal viewpoint and under my responsibility, and thus denounce the activities of
the CIA and other U.S...governmental organisations which work for that system's interests,
It is moessary to explain certain characteristics which are common to them as part of
such a system. In that system I lived, grew, studied and finally functioned an an
active part of the intelligence community, and that is why I consider it my right to
make the following comments,
In the environment that I lived in until very récently, like others, I was never able
to adjust. I do not believe there is any other system like that, capable of developing
a lack of personal and social identity due to its capitalist nature, which does not
grant values to any type of ideology or social progress but only to an apathestio
matorialism characteristic of the already degraded interests of that system,

The CIA knew about and approved acts against the Cutanea de scion offices in Mexico
City. Participating in this act was Les. Victa, an Ad leader who traveled to Restco

from Venezuela.

Knowledge by the CIA of personal contacts with representatives of the present Chilean
Government in New York City to take orlando Bosch to Chile after his arrest in Venesues:
Representing ABDALA was Enrique. Encinoss, who is a rabid atairer of Orlando Bosch, and
representing the Chilean intelligence services was Mr Julio Solose,
Enowledge by the CIA of the financing of ABDALA by the ultraright John Birch Bociety
and the Latin American Club of the University of Illinois Participating in the talks
on financing was Senator Buckley of the U.S. Congress, who maintains close relations
with ABDALA leader Encinoss as well as the notorious Carlos Prio Socarres and Nicaraguan
President Somosa.
DALA.
CIA coordinated a program for collecting funds for AEDALA, extorting cash from the
President of the Republic National Bank in Miami and assassinating Rolando Masferres
Por the killing of Rolando Masferrer, CIA officer Robert "Bob" Hills gave me four
packages (petacas) of C-4. I personally gave them to Lazar Alvarez, a leader of AEDALA
Later, as everybody knows. Masferrer was murdered.
I must explain that my relations with CIA officer Mills came about because of his
experience in Cuban problems. He acted as liaison officer between the CIA and the
Justice and Defense departments. These are all the activities that I personally
participated in as a CIA agent. I will now enumerate other activities which I learned
about during my stay in the United States and while traveling in other countries. I had
no direct participation in these programs. At this time I would like to explain that,
even though I say that I had no direct participation there should be no doubt as to the
veracity of the following events. I mainly learned about these things through official
sources, and that is work, comrades,
Attempt on the life of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro during his stay in Chile: It
was prepared and directed by the CIA, which introduced counterrevolutionary Antonio
(Beciana) to the Alfa-66 organization, requesting from its chief, Nazario Sargent, the
men needed. The (Tchambers) and diplomatic passports were prepared by the CIA, Parti-
cipating for Alfa in this activity were Jesus Dominguez Benitez and several others.
Kidnaping of Cuban fishermen in May 1970: It was directed by the noterious CIA agent
Ramon Orozco Crespo and Raul Carreras, former member of the 2506 Brigade who participated
in the Playa Giron landing. This activity was also carried out by members of Alfa-66.
In activitio against Cuban fishing boats, counterrevolutionary Roberto Pur acted as
permanent informar, establishing the positions of the boats. He lives at 12th Avenue
between 8th and 9th Streets in southwest Miami.
"
Other activities carried out by Alfa-66 were: Atton on the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City in the early hours of 20 January 1974, when two explosive devices were used. One
exploded and the other, which did not explode, was hurled at the children's playground
at the Cuban Mission. In the early hours of 5 August 1974, a bomb exploded in the
garden of the Cuban Embassy in Jamaios. In October 1974,
In October 1974, the Bahamian authorities
saptured seven Cuban counterrevolutionaries who, on orders of the Alfa-66 organization,
were going to infiltrate Cuba through the northern coast of Oriente Province. They
were to land Luis Lobaina and Aristides Marques armed with M-1 carbines and pistols with
silencers. The objective of this mission was to assassinate Prime Minister Fidel Castro.

extemimly about this, but it is not my intention to point out gemeralities but facts,
facta in which the dil has participated in activities against revolutionary interesta

Historically, the 014 has been a principal factor in the coordination, financing.
direction and absolute control over these counterrevolutionary groups. Oddly enough,
they consider themselves bulwarks of rebellion and heroian as well as possessors of
a high level of idolegical independe nos in the struggle for recovery of the liberties
removed, asaɑrding to them, by the Cuban revolution. These are the same groups that
have carried out various activities against Cube, financed and coordinated by the CIA.
These are the sam arcups which have proudly assumed responsibility for the cowardly
attack against Cuban fishermen last 8 April, which the world will have to judge and
conde an
My relation with these elements began in 1970 and it specifically began with the
group and, of which I was coordinator for the Chicago cell at the very beginning.
Later, in 1971, beae ARDALA coordinator for all cells of the midwestern part of
the United States. My fundamental mission as CIA agent was to penetrate the ABDALA
organization at the highest level in order to concretely evaluate its political
orientation, have the recessary information to be able to fully and effectively
control the organisation and, through it, be able to control other counterrevolutionary
organisations associated with ABDALA.
I began my activities by attempting to determine the possible affiliation of some
members of the organization with the illegal drug traffic in North America. This CIA
task was aimed at sscertaining the relations of these elements with the Cuban.
Revolutionary Government, in other words, to demonstrate that those persons were
acting as counterrevolutionary elements to cover up the illegal drug traffic under
orders from the Cuban Government..
After a year of investigations, that theory was not proved. Despite that, the CIA
and other organs continued to look for evidence aimed at involving Cuba and distorting
its foreign image. In 1971, the CIA leadership decided to transfer me to Bbw York
State where I was given the identification of a high-level official in the drug control
commission of the state. These activities did not affect my ties to the AEDALA group
but, on the contrary, helped strengthen my ties with the organization's board of
directors.
Brackenhouse, fires CIA
I maintaireė relations with the following CIA officials: Brackenhouse,
agent to contest m and reoruit m; and Richard (Tomly), staff officer of the Holean,
Virginia, Operations Office, who conducted my initial training and acted as evaluating
supervisor in the ARDAGA organization. By then, the main interest of the CIA in
ABDALA was in determining the operational capacity of this counterrevolutionary group,
the possibility of uning it in terrorist activities and predicting its future develop-
ment. The ABDALA program was known not only to the CIA but also to other governmental
organimations and their respective intelligs noe organa.
At the time the ANDALA leadership, which was tied to terrorist nativities, was made
up of Gustave Marin, que noinosa, Lazaro Alvares, Eduardo Lima, Lee Viots and
myself. The GIA Operatinna office considered ALDALA to be one of the best possibilibian
as opposed to the rest of the organizations, which are believed to be made up of
Affective elements and charlatans who waste the agency's funds without any results.
