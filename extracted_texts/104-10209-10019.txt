Representatives of the FBI Laboratory have been previously
briated on the IEST which we believed had been used yton
working on the PORKILM letter and which established the presence
of on the latter.
2. We have now beeu nivised by a field representative that a
modified version of this process was actually used and it is possible
that tha så la detectable by this version of the test, but not by the
regular test of which your Hureau has the details.
3. It should be noted that our work on inom systals romaled
two cases exhibiting the same type of ficeting detection as was noted
on the 201RILIN latter. This, of course, does not mean that the
AHRILL latter is written in one of these systems, but morely that
fleeting detections can occasionally be expected with this variation
of the 172UTE TEST.
L. Agency beadquarters laboratory has not completed a compari-
sen of the original and modified MFUB procechres so as to confirm
the finding of our field laboratory that the modified test is moS
sensitive. It is being provided to your breau at this time, however,
Bicos it is a technique which has been used successfully in a current
CASO.

file number 105-93295.
2. As reported in referenced CSCI memorandum, a letter pur-
portedly from Subject vas tested for secret writing. Secret writing
was seen by one technician and its presence confirmed by another
technician. However, the message had disappeared before a third
technician co:ld observe it. The technician who tested the letter
has said that only one line of hand-printed secret writing vas dia-
tinctly visible. There were traces of 3/W on other parts of the
letter but this was very indistinct. The cover letter was in
Longhand. The disappearance of the writing did not permit photog-
raphy or recording of any part of the 8/W mesange.

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of 28 February 1961 on
Subject.
2. He plan to discuss with French Liaison the receipt by Daytro
GHYP and Antin MYCZYFORUK of the letter containing secret writing
from Subject, who will be identified to the French only as a resident
of the United States. We believe such a discussion is desirable in
view of its pertinence to the current investigation of the intelligence
activities of Vasiliy MYAKUSHKO (member of the Soviet delegation to
UNESCO from April 1957 to August 1360). If such a discussion would
adversely affect your interest in POHORILIW, please advise us as soon
as possible.

1. Reference is made to the following correspondence:
2.
Bureau report of 14 February 1961, made at Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania and Subject as above;
b. Memorandum from Deputy Director (Plans), Subject as
above, dated 9 January 1961, and mumbered CSCI -
3/763,211;
C. CIA Teletype, Subject as above, dated 16 November 1960;
d. CIA Teletype, Subject as above, dated 17 February 1961.
He would appreciate being informed whether or not you have
had an opportunity to compare the hand writing of Semen POHORILIW
and that of the letter bearing his name and address, which ve sent
to you with reference 1.b..
3. In a review of our files we note that the lack of elabor-
ation in cur earlier correspondence might cause your Jureau some
difficulty. Our statement in reference 1.c. that the POHORILIW
letter bore indications of secret writing was based on the findings
of our technical staff. One of our technicians applied a test
that permitted him to see writing which, although it was not
legible, could be seen to be other than that of the overt text.
This writing remined visible long enough for another technician

to confirm its presence. There have been reports that our· source
is considered by the Sovieta to be American controlled. Thus it
vas considered that, if this letter were a Soviet intelligence
communication, it was likely the Soviets would consider the oper-
ation compromised when our source's possession of the letter was
reported. For this reason, we decided it was best to forge a copy
of the PORCRILIW letter and make every attempt to develop any
secret writing it contained. Unfortunately, we were unable to
do so, and the original letter was destroyed in the process. As
ve reported in reference 1.d. on 8 or 9 January 1961 our source
delivered to Antin NYCZYPORUK the forged copy of the POHORILIN
Latter. To date there has been no report of any reaction to
HYCZYPORUK's receipt of the forgery.

Dmitrio #GNYP, born 13 October 1898 at WASNICZU, Pungary - child of
Wassile and JAZWINSKA Paraska, Ukrainian refugee, has lived for about the
past twenty years at 211 rue de Bercy, Paris 12eme.
He has been employed, since 1945, as night watchman for the "Societe
de Transports de Vehicules Automobiles", 60 rue St. Perdinand, Paris 17eme.
His monthly salary is about 60,000 old francs.
From his first marriage, he had two sons, Baseli (36 years old) who
lives in Pdand and Lvitomir (34 years old) who lives in the USA.
Lintour
From his second marriage with Martha MASLY, born 9 September 1903 in
LHOW Poland, he had a third son Jean, born 22 May 1940 in Paris (12th arrondiesment)
who chose a French nationality.
During the German occupation, GNYP who has been in France since 1925 went
to work in Germany as a volunteer for the organization TODT. Returning to Prance
in 1943 he worked until the Liberation as a chauffeur for the "Legion SPEER
at Enghien Les Bains.
In 1944, with the liberation, he was arrested and interned at Fresnes
for collaboration, but this detention was not followed by condemnation.
In the milieux of Ukrainian refugees he is considered as an opportunist.

Antin *NYKYPORUK, born the first of January 1912 in Karkow (Ukraine),
bachelor, has most recently lived at 86 rue de Montreuil-arrived in France in
1950.
He first of all was a manual laborer, and then an electrician.
Bothered with mental troubles, he has been interned since 1954 in
various psychiatric hospitals.
His last stay was in 1959 at Villejuif.
Since his departure, his ectivity and sources of income have not been
known because his unemployment payment has been refused by the "Bureau de la
Main d'Oeuvre”.
His ordinary resident's card has lapsed since 15 August 1960 and he
is actually violating the law for Foreigners.

It is a question of a violent individual when he has his mental crises.
On several occasions the police have intervened to control him before
interment.

b. Antia NYCZYPORUK (according to GNYP his true nause is
WYKYPORETZ) was born about 1910. He is married and had a wife and
two children in lieginak. Prior to 1944. he was a professor of
Ukrainian and West European Literature at a pedagogical institute
in Kiev. KYCZYFORUK left the USSR in 1944; from 1945 to 1948 he
was in an International Refugee Organization camp in Salzburg,
Austria; he has resided in France since 1948.
4. The following details on GRYP's and WYCZYPORUK's involvement
with Soviet intelligence were obtained by our source from GfYP and
other Ukrainian enigres in France. During the period 1950 to 1960 GHYP
and Vasiliy MYAKUSHO, Third Secretary of the Soviet Delegation to UNESCO,
frequently visited with each other at the Soviet Embassy and at GRYP's
apartment on 211 Rue de Bercy. At the end of 1959 CMP introduced
NYCZYPORUK to MYAKUSHKO. MYAKUSHKO asked NYCZYPOЕUK to contribute literary
articles to Soviet publications; it is not known whether WYCZYPORUK wrote
any such articles. Early in 1960 HYCZYPCHUK developed a persecution com-
plex and was confined to a sanitarium for a short period. CHIP, fearing
that NYCZYPORUK might expose the GNYP-MYAKUSIKO relationship, provided
KYCZYPORUK with free board and lodging in his apartment and with spending
money. MYAKUSHKO dropped NYCZYPCRUK as soon as the latter's mental con-
dition became obvious. In May 1960 the Soviet Embassy advised NYCZYPORUK
to repatriate to the USER as soon as possible, and offered to help locate
his family in the USSR. (As you already know, in October 1960 the Soviets
sent HYCZYPORUK a letter reporting his family was not in Roginsk. See
attachment.)
5. There is a rumor in the Ukrainian emigre colony in Paris that
KYCZYPORUX has been a Soviet agent since about 1949. This is based on
his close relationship with Josef (aka Osyp) KOZAK since 1949. KOZAK
moved to France from Jamich in 1946. Until his expulsion in 1950 be
was quite active in the Organization of Ukrainian Nationals/Bandera
(OJR/B) in France. He was ousted from the CUR/B because of his excessive
curiosity about CUN/B members and their relatives in the U33R. Subse
quently it was learned that KOZAK vas in contact with the Soviet Embassy
in France. KOZAK is presently residing at 26 rue Gaston Jaillon, Vesines
Chalette, Loiret.

dated 22 November 1960
1.
The purpose of this report is summarize the laboratory work
done on two letters trommitted to us originally as attachmento to
Reference fl. For identification purposes in this report we shall
refer to the letter postmarked in Philadelphia as Letter #1 and the
one postmarked in the USSR as Letter #2.
2. In order to facilitate a better understanding of the results
some interpretative data on the cat performed is included,
3. Because of the requirement that the letters be left in good
condition to penit their delivery to the addressed, the initial
examination consisted of the custonary visual and U.V. inspection
(including long wave and short wave), and the so-called KETOTE test,
This latter test has only recently been introduced and constitutes
the most formidable test known to us against SW. It was by means of
this test that the presence of 54 in Letter #1 became apparent. In
the application of this test a portion of the SW is actually physically
lifted from the item being tested and subsequently through a process
involving both chemical and physical reactions, the SW is made visible.
The degree of visibility varies from completely negative results to
completely legible ones. According to the technician who performed
this test the results ootained with Letter #1 were not quits legible,
but definite enough to permit checking to establish that they were
not due to the visible ink of the letter. The time interval during
which this particular detection is observable lasts but a few minutes
which the technician used to verify that he was detecting SW and not
visible text. By the time he called in his two colleagues the reaction
had progressed to the point that only one of these technicians was able
to observe the SH. Thus the operator and one other technician saw tha
4. At this point the letters were returned to Paris with Reference
2 which reported "definite traces of Sin Letter #1.
+
5. Before giving an account of the work done during the second
phase of the investigation, (i.c., after the letters were returned to
the laboratory for development) it should be pointed out that the KEMFOTE
test, though an extremely effective test for the detection of SW, does
not identify the system involved. Complete development of the secret
message under these circumstances would have been almost impossible.
The only alternative available to the chemist, and the one he followed
in this particular case, is to proceed with a series of chemical tests
applied directly to the document under investigation. These tests are
applied in sequence, one after the other, each requiring for its execu- .
tion that a portion of the page be sacrificed. It is therefore impor- :
tant that those tests affording the greatest probability of developing
the SW be applied first; thus if and when, a test is found capable of
developing the ink, the remainder of the page (i.e., the portion not.
affected by previous chemical applications) is treated with it.

SUBJECT:
1.
Semen Spiridon PCHORILYJ also known as Semen PORORILIN
Internal Security – R
Reference is made to previous correspondence from this
office regarding the subject and to your file mumber 105-93295.
2. An official French liaison soures reported in early
September 1961 that Antin NYCZPCRUE received a letter with the
return address: (fra) DIALNAWSKI, 63/N. 7 Sh. (sic) Philadelphia
23, Pa. Tho address was also received from an official U.S.
scuros as 13/# 7 SA. but this is believed to be a typographical
error. It has not been possible to verify the address as the
envelope was not photographed but was passed routinely from the
post office to NYCZFORUK. The letter was not tested for secret
