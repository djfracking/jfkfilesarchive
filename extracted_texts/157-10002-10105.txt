and had, as far as I know, personally, at least, nothing to do
with assassination.
I have checked pages 1 and 2 and 3 and my page 4.
Mr. Schwarz. Are pages 4 through 7, in your judgment;
5 pages that were written by Mr. Arnold Silver?

Mr. Harvey. As a guess, I'd say they appear to be in the

Mr. Schwarz.
Are pages 8 and 9 pages that are written by

I would also like to point out that from page 4 that

was not a part of this so-called Project Outline, these I
14 would guess were probably Arnold Silver's notes and probably
15 based, at least to an extent, on discussions he had with me,
and certain sort of problems and questions and principles that
I tossed out to be considered and cares to be exercised.

Mr. Schwarz.
Then pages 8 and 9 are in your handwriting,

Mr. Harvey.
Pages 8 and 9 are in my handwriting.

22
Mr. Schwarz. And at the bottom of page 8, does that
indicate that you had a conversation with ir. Silver on January
26th?

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it does.

Your note has a report to the DCI, the

Mr. Harvey. Yes, I'm sure that's Arnold Silver.
Mr. Schwarz. Then it appears to say f-a-n-f-o-r-n DCI

Mr. Harvey. I am not sure. The closest I could come to
that is a fairly illogical Fanfani,, and Fanfani was never
even dreamed of, as far as I know, in any such context.

as a general problem.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, the material commencing on handwritten
page 4 and commencing in the middle of page 3 of the Senator's
notes, reflects in your judgment the conversation that you had
with Mc Silver and it is his notes about that conversation, is
that right?
Mr. Harvey. That is my best guess.
It may also, however, include his own thinking and so forth.
it certainly would not include any
9
I doubt if it includes
10 specific discussions, I don't think,, with other officers,
11
12
13
14
15
because Arnold Silver was under specific instructions not to
discuss this as such with anybody else, at least without clearing
it with me first.
Mr. Schwarz. And he starts, for example, by talking about
"Legal, ethical, morale, operational problems" and so forth,
and that reflects the conversation you had with Mr. Silver?
Mr. Harvey. Yes, it does.

Mr. Schwarz. Down toward the end of entry 3b

Mr. Harvey. There was a general philosophic discussion of
9 assassination and assassination techniques. There was also a
discussion on a number of other things that were of particular
and specific interest to the communications intelligence field
and the clandestine service's responsibilities aspects, if you
will, and as best I can recall this conversation, this was a
12
13
15
14 sort of an exchange of ideas and briefing session, probably
held at the request of Sid Gottlieb in my office shortly after
he either took over a new job in TSD or took over as actual
Chief of TSD, which was the Technical Services Division of the
clandestine services.

use and propriety of assassination as a technique was.

This "translating machine" was an experimental device,

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it is.
Mr. Schwarz. And it followed your conversation with Mr.
Bissell that you have recounted?
Mr. Harvey. I think probably that might be well, when
I first looked at this, I thought this, well, this has got to
be '62, but I am almost certain now that it is not. If this
is true, this might place the first discussion that I had with
Dick Bissell n early January And this is difficult to pinpoint
because there were several such discussions in varying degrees
of detail during the period in the spring, and very early in
'61 to the fall of '61 period, but I did find out fairly early
on that Silver had or that Bissell had discussed the question
of assassination with Arnold Silver, and this discussion at
the very least, had to take place after I know Bissell already
had discussed the matter with Silver

counterespionage for a brief period against the Japanese and
the Italians and the Russians in '41. Then during most of the
War, against the Germans, and then beginning in early '45 until
the middle of '47 against the Soviet service again.
Mr. Schwarz. And then in 1947, did you join the CIA as
head of the Soviet Intelligence Branch?
Mr. Harvey. That is correct.
Mr. Schwarz. Is that also counterespionage?
Mr. Harvey. Yes, it was.
Mr. Schwarz.
And then between 1947 and 1952, you worked
11 on Soviet counterespionage and certain special operations in
12
13
14
15
the Department for Plans, is that right?
Mr. Harvey. Well, that is correct. It was a particular
command and staff responsibility on communications intelligence
and for a period of, I would think probably eight to ten
16 months, I headed a planning staff, along with that.
17
Mr. Schwarz. In 1952, did you go to Berlin as Chief of

Mr. Harvey. Frank Rollett, who for many years was one of
the, if not the most, knowledgeable senior officer in the
8 Cryptologic group
9
10
11
And one of the reasons I went to Berlin was to attempt to
mount this operation.
In substance, what it amounted to was setting up a fairly
12 complex cover within a cover installation in West Berlin and
13
driving
ing a tunnel approximately 500 meters, well underground
14 across the sector boundary, and tapping into three main
15 telephone,an telegraph, and teleprinter cables.

had a total of around 900 circuits of these,

Mr. Harvey. But I would like to clarify it, if I may,
13 Mr. Schwarz. It was the division of the clandestine services,
14 which was the focal point and was responsible for primarily two
15 things: the procurement of communications intelligence through
16* operational and clandestine sources and the control and utili
177 tion of the product of communications intelligence, às

19
We had nothing to do beyond that with the general sort of
20 research and analysis use which was handled in a separate
21 COMINT shop in the what I believe was the DDI, Deputy Director
22 Intelligence.
23
Mr. Schwarz. Did Staff D include within its responsibili-
24 ties the surreptitious obtainin
õus obtaining of code information.

of assassination is obviously a two-pronged subject, ours and
2 theirs. We spent countless hours over the years trying to
01
determine the parameters of how far the Soviet service was
4 willing to go. This was partly a question of assessment;
5
this was partly a question, to put it just as bluntly,
6 of self-protection.
7
00
I will try to summarize what I think are fair conclusions.
In the field of political assassination, although I cannot
9 document this by evidence, I have no question but what the
10 Soviet service has, does, and will continue to use the tool of
assassination to accomplish political gains inside and outside
11
12
of the USSR. In the intelligence field, I think you have to
make a distinction, the distinction roughly and I'm over-
14 simplifying this slightly but a distinction into perhaps
13
15
16
three classes.
One, their own ethnics or nationals. Secondly, indigenous
agents of third countries.And thirdly, the recognized official
18 staff officers of other intelligence services.
17
19
20
21
During the seven years that I spent in Berlin, which was
the longest continuous period that I was exposed in depth to
Soviet Executive Action, we lost a great many Russians, a great
22 many Germans, a certain number of Czechs, Poles and other
23 nationalities.
24
25
- Mr. Schwarz. When you say you lost Russians, you mean
Russians who were working with the United States?

documentation for the authority which was later signed off on

Beginning on my page 4, your middle of page 3.
Mr. Schwarz. Well, just a moment. Page 1 is a cover story,
not the real story, the objectives –

assassination or assassination capability.

14
15
16
17
18
Mr. Harvey. Which, I would like to point out, was a
perfectly legitimate objective and was not in a sense, a cover
story except that if this project had gone so far as to the
actual recruitment of any agent for assassination or the target-
ting of any target or the mounting of any operation, it would
have been under this as a cover. But, those assets that were
spotted by QJWINN, for instance, under ZRRIFLE were also
honestly considered for possible clandestine procurement
communications intelligence outside the U.S.
maybe I'm not making this clear, it's a cover
19
20
21
So it's
22
23
Mr. Schwarz.
24
25
in a sense, but it's not a phony cover, in other words.
Dual purpose.
Mr. Harvey. It was a dual purpose.

Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned QJWINN. Was QJWIN an agent
who you did hold in reserve for possible use in connection
with the Executive Action program?
Mr. Harvey. No, QJWIN is an agent that I considered for
possible use and used for a limited period through Arnold Silver
for the spotting of individuals with criminal and underworld
connections in Europe for possible multi-purpose use, none of
whom were ever advised of the use, none of whom, as far as I
9 personally know, were ever used.

Faiz
Mr. Harvey. Only the sense that had we ever been saddled
with a flat, if you will, command performance on assassination.
I might have considered the people spotted by WIN as possibil-
