1. As a result of the recent review done of the LIFEAT
and LIENVOY Project, it came to Headquarters attention that
LIENVOZ-8, who was believed to have been terminated, was still
covered by the LIEKVOY Project.
3. According to HOMA-14876, LIENVOY-8 was the caune of
a security problem for LIENVOY in February 1960 when he requested
relesse from LIENVOY and a transfer to his parent organization, the
General Staff of the Presidency. LIKNVOY-8 was described as a
"scur” nationalist who disapproved of ODTOKE's sharing of the
LIENVOY take.
3. Headquarters now notes that LIENVOY-8's clearance has
Levor been cancelled and there is no Agent Service Record or
termination report in his file. LIENVOY-8 was included in the
LIENVOY Project renewal request for the 1961/62 project year, but
not for the 1962/63 year. The field project renewal request for
the 1963/64 year included him again.
4. It is requested that the Station inform Headquarters of
the present status of LIENVOY-8 (201-118406). If he has been
terminated, please forward an Agent Service Record. If he is
still being used, please provide a current analysis of his relis-
bility and comments on any security probelms present in light of
his actions and reputation in 1960.
