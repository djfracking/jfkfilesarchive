capability for exploiting his cover for specific and aggressive operational undertakings.
As has been stated in past fitness reports, his present capability directly and openly
to approach operational targets through the vehicle of his cover is the result of his own
efforts, in which he has devoted a tremendous amount of work not only to establish and
enhance the foundations of the cover, which requires a considerable amount of work for
the cover company, but to devise and exploit ways and means by which the cover activity
may be applied directly to operational tasks and programs. In addition to operational
activity in his country of assignment, he has also been used in Hqs-directed activity in
other countries, usually involving direct contact with target individuals, and in addi-
tion he has contributed greatly to the acquisition of operational information for the
use of Has components in their overall approach to Soviet scientific and technical tar-
gets.

objectives. He shows considerable resourcefullness in devising logical and credible

This employee combines the relatively rare combination
broadly
experienced intelligence officer under working cover providing both long-term status
in his country of residence (and in Europe in general) and aquess for a variety of
operational functions, including spotting, assessing, contact with Soviet bloc
nationals of specific interest, investigative measures, assessment in depth of
ostensibly cover-company hired persons, and attendance at a broad range of national
and international specialized meetings. Development of the capability operationally
to exploit his cover has been the achievement of the employee himself. In so doing
he has at the same time achieved genuine acceptance by his cover company associates
(most of whom are unwitting) and his colleagues in his cover profession and related
professions.
1
In undertaking operational tasks this employee has consistently shown initiative
imagination, security consciousness, and application of both operational and substan-
tive background to the problem at hand. He has put a conscious effort into improving
his already excellent command of the French language, and his grasp of a variety of
specialized scientific and technical fields has been achieved basically as a result
of his own efforts.
Hia management of operational reporting, finances, and the administrative
problems connected with his cover status has been exemplary.
It should be noted that during the reporting period, this employee has not had
the benefit at all times of specific pinpointed operational direction. As of the end
of the reporting period, Headquarters assumed control of his activities against

approaches to operational problems and personalities, and expends considerable
effort in maintaining a level of specialized knowledge sufficient to backstop his
cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organi-
zations and individuals. His command of spoken, written, and technical French is
excellent.
From the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position re-
quires guidance only insofar as to identify specific targets and for him to protect
himself in situations where he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to
official files, specialized information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision
other than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.
This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of
operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his
reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing
the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to
be desired.
Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no
responsibility for the programming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and
funds.
With respect to dedication to his job, this employee has practically speaking
single-handedly built his present cover/operational position despite a number of
negative factors inherent to his situation such as relative isolation, meager oppor-
tunity for contact with his professional group, and expensive area of assignment,
and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover is compounded
by the necessity of avoiding mistakes which might Jeopardize cover. His dedication
to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness
to continue on in it, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would per-
haps justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the main-
stream of competitive organization progression.
This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his
proven mobility in the execution of operational assignments attests.
It should further be noted that with respect to the problem endemic to deep-cover
assignments of allocation of time between cover work and operational activity, this
employee comes very close to the happy norm of making cover work complement opera-
tional work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhance-
ment of cover.
While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-man show, it
is recommended that serious consideration be given to expanding the operational com-
plex which he has created in order to capitalize on his experience, the work he has
put in to date, and his own management capabilities.
*(Section B) - No special recognition of Subject's "Outstanding" overall performance
is being requested at this time.

The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover

slot which was cut from the Station's ODACID allotment of personnel positions.

accepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom he

This employee requires a minimum of detailed operational supervision;
it is necessary in specific cases only to indicate the operational or infor-;
mational objectives.
From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to
detail and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in
terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes. Additionally, he brings a
great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assignment.
During the period covered by this report he has displayed great industry and
devotion to duty in a variety of circumstances and achieved notable results
in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his
unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in
many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless. This, however,
is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the necessities of his
operational work although it often shows in office relationships.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.
Subject is an exceedingly well-equipped operations officer. He is nature,
intelligent, has a thorough background in operations in his area and the ability
to grow in his job. His operational planning and execution is usually impeccable.
He has the loyalty of his subordinates and the respect of his equals and super-.
visors. He is particularly effective in dealing in the liaison field where his
good sense and disinterest in "fighting the problem" produces a maximum of
cooperation and good will. If he has any minor fault as a supervisor, it is not
in impatience with his subordinates, as reflected in previous evaluations, but
in an occasional unwillingness to say no to them.
SECTION D.

During this period Mr. Richardson was promoted from Deputy Branch Chief to
Branch Chief, in recognition of his extremely good performance. Not enough time
has elapsed to be able to evaluate him fully on all aspects of his new position.
However, his handling of the Branch has been unusually good from a management
point of view and there is every mason to believe that in the planning and
direction of operational activities the same high standard will prevail.

Chief, Mr. Richardson has performed his duties, taken as a whole, in a superior manner.
His timely and efficient preparation of intelligence annexes, logistic and fiscal require
ments and reports has been particularly outstanding. During three to four months of the
past year, Mr. Richardson has acted as Branch Chief. The review of Branch operations under
Mr. Richardson's direction, during the writer's absence, indicated his complete competence
in supervising Branch activities. His supervision of the planning and preparation for apt
proval of basic plans and projects of the seven (7) desk chiefs has been superior.
Richardson also participated in the planning and dispatch of a difficult operational mis
sion, acting in the capacity of Senior Case Officer. On this mission his liaison with
representatives of one of the Military Services was conducted in a manner which enhanced
cooneration between that Service and this Agency.

12. IN #MAT RESPECT IS THIS PERSON'S PERFORMANCE ON PRESENT JOB MOST NOTICEABLY GOOD OR OUTSTANDINGT
Mr. Richardson's performance was noticeably outstanding with respect to his thorough know-
ledge of every activity of the Branch. He was in position to assume direction of Branchi
activities at any time. He also kept himself thoroughly briefed on Division policies and
planning in order to give timely instruction and guidance to the Branch overseas stations.
13. ON WHAT ASPECT OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD THIS PERSON CONCENTRATE EFFORT FOR SELF IMPROVEMENT?
Mr. Richardson has a very thorough background in two (2) languages, French and Japanese. He
would benefit substantially by learning the fussian language. He is meticulous with res-
pect to his attention to details, sometimes to the point of concoaling the broader picture
from his view. It would be well for Mr. Idchardson to direct his attention to the broad
score of Branch activities rather than to concentrate on its details.
14. COMMENT ON THIS PERSON'S ABILITY TO HANDLE GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE,
Mr. Richardson is fully qualified to assume the duties of the chief SR Division representa-
tive at a field station. In order to assume this responsibility in the most officient
manner, it is recommended that Mr. Richardson serve a minimum period of time of approximate-
ly six (6) months as the assistant to the present chief of the field station.
15. ARE THERE OTHER DUTIES WHICH BETTER SUIT THIS PERSON'S QUALIFICATIONST (Recommend appropriate
possible.)
þussignment,
Mr. Richardson could serve effectively in a staff function for either FI or PP activities.
This does not mean, however, that his present duties are not better suited to his qualifi-
cations.
16. WHAT TRAINING OR ROTATION DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR THIS PERSONY
Mr. Richardson has already been recommended for overseas assignment in the For East during
the past year. He has area knowledge and command of the Japanese language, having served
in Japan previously with the United States Army. His duties at Headquarters have been so
pressing that his departure for overseas assignment is being delayed until an adoquate
replacement may be trained.

• I planned, developed and exploited an adanted non-official cover to
mask the onerational activity, interrated into the further-ranging

I mrned the non-official cover activity as a viable professional/
commercial activity, including many business and production aspects,
as well as the local handling of the firm's funwittingl personnel.

I assisted other Stations and Bases, at their request, in spotting-
assessment activities, in local search and surveill. nce activities,
and in recruitment.

As part of my criminal non-Neial cover wit' ored because of a

cover provided by a major firm of technical periodical publishers.,

and report in writing on the progress of my cover development and

For operational reasons, I develop and assess operational leads in
the FI, CI and CA areas, principally against denied area targets.

described above, although I would like eventually to add more super-
visory and managerial functions to my responsibilities. I would like
to expand the operating base provided by the cover organization by
taking on several journeymen case officers to work with me against
both denied area and host country targets, and to make the cover
facility and the access it provides of more versatile use to both the
station and to KUDOVE as a whole.
second choice would be to return to Hg, and use the knowledge and
experience I have gained in my present

anisms propmer, (3) train our personnel for the proper discharge of
their total responsibilities while serving under such cover.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS/CSB
SUBJECT
Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-15
Jacques G. RICHARDSON
REFERENCE
Your memorandum dated 8 October 1958
1. The SR Division and the Chief of Station, Tokyo (FJTT-1950,
attached) recommend the promotion of Jacques G. Richardson to GS-15.
On 17
2. Mr. Richardson was last promoted 16 January 1955.
February 1955 he arrived in Tokyo to serve as the senior SR officer
in the FE field area, his present assignment. In this position he
has continued to display qualities of leadership, initiative,
imagination and thoroughness which resulted in his rapid rise in
the Agency.
3. The very facts of Mr. Richardson's youth in relation to
his responsibilities and the fact that promotion to his present
level has been rapid, caused the Division and the Chief of Station,
Tokyo to hold until this time a recommendation for his promotion
which was submitted in June 1957. Most careful consideration has
convinced us that not only is Mr. Richardson deserving of the
recommended promotion, but his elevation to the higher grade will
be in the best interest of the Career Service and meet definite
Division requirements for a senior officer at the GS-15 level.

25 November 1958
1. In line with paragraph 2 of Reference, after a period of
six months we submitted an additional promotion fitness report on
RICHARDSON under cover of 5JPT-0301 dated 28 May 1958. Inasmuch as
Baker was then at Headquarters on TDY, we requested that he review
this fitness report and assumed that in doing so he would also
discuss with Maury RICHARDSCN's promotion, which both he and Nelson
felt was to be strongly recommended.
2. Baker was, however, not shown this fitness report at
Headquarters, nor did he have the opportunity to discuss RICHARDSON's
promotion with Maury. In reviewing our records we are now concerned
at the possibility of some administrative slip-up and would appreciate
a word of advice as to how this promotion action is proceeding. We
would like to reiterate that we now have not the slightest hesitation
in recommending RICHARDSON for promotion and find that the fitness
report submitted with FJTT-0501 still reflects our current high
appreciation of his abilities and progress.

SUBJECT
. Nominations for Promotion to GS-15
REFERENCE
Memorandum dated 14 May 1958 from
Secretary, CS Career Service Board
ļ
1. After reviewing GS-14 employees assigned to the
SR Division, I wish to again recommend the promotion of
Jacques Richardson, Chief, Soviet Branch, Tokyo to GS-15.
"I concur also in the attached recommendation for the pro-
motion of Paul Haines prepared by the Chief of Base,
Berlin.
2. The Chief of Station, Tokyo and I recommended
Mr. Richardson's promotion in December 1959. This earlier
recommendation presented the personal qualities of Mr.
Richardson. I wish simply to point out at this time that
since early 1954, Mr. Richardson has more than fully dis-
charged responsibilities at the GS-15 level. I believe
that it is definitely time to elevate him to the level at
which he has been performing more than satisfactorily for
over 5 years.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Performance is unacceptable. A rating in this category requires immediate and positive remedial action. The nature of the action
could range from counseling, to further training, to placing on probation, to šeassignment or to separation. Describe action taken
or proposed in Section C.
Performance is deficient in some aspects. The reasons for assigning this rating should be stated in Section C and remedial actions
taken or recommended should be described.
Performance is satisfactory. Desired results are being produced in the manner expected.
Performance is characterized by exceptional proficiency.
Performance is so exceptional in relation to requirements of the work and in comparison to the performance of others doing similar
work as to warrant special recognition,
SPECIFIC DUTIES
List up to six of the most important specific duties performed during the rating period. Insert rating lotter which best describes the
manner in which employee performs EACH specific duty. Consider ONLY effectiveness in performance of that duty. All employees
with supervisory responsibilities MUST be rated on their ability to supervise (indicate number of employers supervised).

more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts
than in that of more than short-range operational development.
Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.
Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
"digest" the information contained in his reports.
Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses and has exercised good security.
During the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs
directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

substantial. In a word, is it worth it?
We do not yet know,
although our initial impressions are favorable.
On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "S" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately
deserve an "0", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "p" category, rather than "S",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a
frequent basis.
In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be-
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be commenting upon it subsequently, as we gain experience
and knowledge.

8. PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING NEXT ASSIGNMENT:
--
I would like very much to use my fluent French in my next assignment, as well as
make use of my extensive exposure to science and technology both operations and
and the larger world of the scientist and the enginear in today's evolving societies
and economies. I would most especially hope to use my long experience in non-
official cover activities and the managerial exposure accumulated thereby.
LIST YOUR MAJOR DUTIES DURING CURRENT TOUR (see special note on transmittal form).
(also attach personal cover questionnaire in accordance with CST-F 240-3)
• I planned, established and operated a long-range S&T spotting-assessment activity
against sensitive targets, and a shorter range similar local activity during a
period marked largely by an adverse political climate.
•
I planned, developed and exploited, and modified a non-official cover in order to
mask our operational activity, and integrated these into the broader ranging
overall activities of a major field Station.
• I managed the non-official cover activity of viable professional/commercial cover
organizations. The tasks included many business and production aspects as well as
management of the firm's (unwitting/ personnel in the field and from the home office.
I assisted other Stations and Bases, upon their request, in spotting-assessment
activities, in local search and surveillance of targets, and in recruitment.
•
• As my original non-official cover became modified as a result of mergers, I was
able to develop, alone, continuing cover to serve our needs of operational access
as well as those of 'status' cover.
10. TRAINING DESIRED:
INDICATE WHAT TRAINING YOU BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS
(a) the senior-most management course offered through the Organization;
(b) a review course of activities within the CS and the Organization as a whole;
(c) at least audit the S&T course, if that is still being offered.
If (a) is possible through a civil school away from Headquarters, I would have
no objection to the displacement involved.

During the period under review, Subject managed to gain full-time
employment as a senior executive of an HBSPRITE government subsidized
scientific publication at a time of economic slowdown when jobs were
not easy to get. He did this without help from Headquarters or the
Station. Such an achievement is a tribute to Subject's fluency in
French, his ability to write, his general scientific know-how and his
good buisness sense. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid
by this company. In converting to full-time employment, a major ad-
justment, Subject's contribution to the Station operations in the
MHILARSH and TPFAST fields against which he is targetted temporarily
decreased somewhat. Subject continued, however, to maintain contact
with three local MHMARSH officials and initiated contact with three
others. He also continued to search for new leads to personalities in

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely
appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite
conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat
longer period than that reflected by this report.
On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to
greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more
aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity
to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear
on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent French, a solid and
exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community.
Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in
depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue
them actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-
tion from further development, for whatever reason.
In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this
officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits
that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have
been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately
be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than
the latter.
This reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared
the Fitness Report.

officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years.
In fairness to him, however, it is equally true that an officer under non-official
cover reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type
of guidance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case
officer. Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not
been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub-
stantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that if the Station
can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

(b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the inside.
In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of

utility to the CS. In effect
In effect, the top officers and middle
managers of the cover corporation (who are not cleared and witting]
have to be satisfied that their demands are met (or cannot be),
else manipulated in order to neutralize or reject their demands.
After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal,
workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding,
it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards
of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of (b) which derives from (a) and can prove to
be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served,
the incumbent is required to manage a span of human contacts at
several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance
its value to the CS. This means planning, directing and
managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of
technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to
improve the [cover firm's] relations with similarly widespread
individuals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate
vice-president, president, and chairman of the board.
levels are scattered not only through industry, but have their
analogs as well in government, higher education, and professional
'societies.
These
Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied-
areas operating component of a major field Station, I can report
quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed
'the former despite the apparent lack of "supervisory
responsibilities" in my present position.

3. It is difficult to place in the proper perspective the
contribution of this senior staff agent to Paris station operations..
On the one hand, Subject has established superb cover in the
scientific and technical field which should have afforded him
virtually unlimited access to persons of interest to us, both
Soviet and potential access agents. In evaluating the manner in
which the employee set up and managed this cover, I would tend to
agree with his comments to the fitness report on the managerial
demands on him although these comments are somewhat overdrawn.
The principal difficulty has been the time it has taken to
relate the cover potential to the specific operational require..
ments of the Station. We have not received from CASASIN as many
leads and assessment reports to persons of operational interest
It may be

that the earlier listing of the project (viewed as a regional
undertaking) contributed to this.
.
Recently we have noted significant improvement in that we
have received responses to requests we have made for assessment
and development of potential acedes agents within a cover context.
We hope, therefore, that this last year of CASASI's stay will
be the most productive ever. It is unfortunate that the cover
must and because of the cover company's decisions over which we
had no control.

have the impression, However, that the employee is responding to his supervisor's
guidance and is not by any means simply drifting along paths indicated by his

case, rather limited contact with his colleagues who work under official cover on
the same target. I thus concur in the evaluation on the basis of limited knowledge.

professional officer in every sense of the term. He is a thoroughly organized self-
disciplined person who can operate effectively outside a normal suction complex. He
has the suppls mind required to learn highly technical cover tasks and perform these
in a skilled manner. He organizes the performance of these cover duties in such a
manner as to extract the most operational mileage. Subject has spotted, assessed,
developed, and in special cases recruited. He is extremely articulate, and an
excellent writer. Despite his deep cover status, he submits timely finished operational
and information reports. His management, administration, and record keeping of both
his cover and operational duties is excellent.
Although Subject has had long experience in supervisory capacities, his present
singleton cover status does not require supervisory duties.
