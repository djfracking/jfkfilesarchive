Subject is a commercial representative from Yugoslavia.
Information was received from CIA that an individual with the same
last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS).
However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of
YIS. CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject
is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to
remain in the U. S. âœ“ CIA desires verification of this information
because if it is true/CIA may wish to consider contacting subject
in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under control
of CIA. Ssubject is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of
April, 1963. Approach to subject by FBI is not recommended because
New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is not engaged in
intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance
for approach in similar case.
