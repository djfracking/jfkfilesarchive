Exchance of Intelligence on Cuban Subversion
Department of Defense
Engineering installation work continued on radio
stations for Managua, Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa,
Honduras. No further progress has been made in reaching
agreements with Colombia and Ecuador for rights to
establish radio stations in those countries. Installation
of the new trans-istimian commercial cable in Panama

Central Intelligence Agency
CIA Stations continued their exchange of intelligence
information with local intelligence Agencies. The
following actions are of special significance:
The CIA Station in Buenos Aires furnished the
Argentine State Intelligence Service (BIDE) with
information on the travel of Argentines to Cuba, and re-
quested that SIDE provide name traces and debrief these
travellers on their return whenever feasible. SIDE
provided the traces, but did not conduct any debriefings

this omission in view of the parsommel changes expected

c. At the urging of the CIA Station in Line, the
National Intelligence Service (SIN) instructed one of
its penetrations of leftist groups to campaign for a trip
to Cuba in order to receive guerrilla warfare training.
This asset has been offered, and has accepted, an opportunity
en
to make the trip by the Leftist Revolutionary Movement
(MIR), primary vehicle of Cuban subversive activities
in Peru. Briefing and debriefing of the asset will be
done by the SIN.
The Peruvian Naval Intelligence Service (PNIS) has,
in response to the efforts of the Station in Lima, sent
one of its agents to Chile where he will sign aboard a
Chilean freighter calling at Habana. The asset has been
given specific intelligence requirements to fulfill.

Instructed Embassy Rio to make a new approach to
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry to express our concern
at Cuba's continuing use of "charter" flights to Brazil
and the laxity of Brazilian officials in the control of
passengers. During the course of the month the Brazilian
Government began tightening controls against Cubana
flights. Specifically, all requests for landing permission
were henceforth to be processed by the Foreign Office,
with appropriate delays. Also tighter passenger, crew
and cargo controls were to be instituted when a Cubana
flight is permitted to use Brazilian facilities.
Determined that the U.K. had specifically warned
Cubena that no aviation fuel was available in Barbados and
that H.M.G. would, in the future, respect Shell Company's
decision to deny fueling to Cubana planes.

resumption of ferry service between Cuba and the U.S.
which a British citizen, Harold Derber, has been attempt-
ing to establish during the past several month.
