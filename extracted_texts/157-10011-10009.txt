OCCURRENCE:
"Pursuant to our telephone conversation this afternoon, it would seem worthwhile
to get the consensus of the group's views as to the type and timing of the
activities in Phase II."
In my opinion, the following numbered activities may pose possible policy questions
20 (balloons), 23 (SWAN radio), 27 (sabotage), 32 (attack agriculture with
chemicals), 40 (COMINT), 48-50 (Cuban exiles, Carribbean nations), 54 (post-
Castro).

Meeting of SGA On Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962. Discussion of LANSDALE's
suggestion #32 (agricultural sabotage). GENERAL CARTER emphasized the extreme
sensitivity of any such operation and the disasterous results that would flow
from something going wrong particularly if there were obvious attribution to ✓
-the-U.S. He went on to say, however, that it would be possible to accomplish
this purpose by methods more subtle than those indicated in the paper. He men-
tioned specifically the possibility of producing crop failures by the introduction
of biological agents which would appear to be of natural origin. BUNDY said that
he had no worries about any such sabotage which could clearly be made to appear
as a result of local Cuban disaffection or a natural disaster, but that we must
avoid external activities such as release of chemicals, etc. unless they could

OCCURRENCE: When RFK asked Helms for his comments, helms stated that "we were prepared.
to get on with the new action program and that we would execute it agressively."
Helms pointed out, however, that the objective of Operation MONGOOSE would have to be
determined at some point since the Cubans with whom we have to work were seeking a
reason for risking their lives in these operations. Helms detailed his conversation
with the young Cuban from the DRE (?) who pointed out that they were willing to
commit people only on operations which they regarded as sensible. Helms defines.
sensible in Cuban terminology as meaning an action which would contribute to the liberatio
of their country, another way of saying that the United States, perhaps in conjunction
with other Latin American countries, would bail them out militarily. Helms' point
was specially echoed by Huston and Ryan.

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA AVTORED teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to e
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
SOURCE:Would logically have led to the discussions at the timp
of the Matahambre operation."

etc.) had come to a stop---didn't want the U.S. embarrassed and Gilpatrick wanted to

Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense.". The pressure led to several
very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pig:
and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1062. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. After-
ards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
'economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries
Rineluding an attempt to stop the sale by the Leyland Bus Company in Spain of buses

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a-telephonic-conversation-on-the-evening of 30-Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever
which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.
I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his
conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.
During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief
discussion of the COBRA and AMMORID teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheeve
recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
