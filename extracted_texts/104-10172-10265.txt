TEPLY did not in fact meet GOLLISTA as
previously stated but only knew of her and GOLITSYN
from her parents.

Source is quite clear about GOLUSEY's instructions
and had not confused the names of GODITSYN and HOSHIKO.
COLUSCY had been sent a directive from Roscow setting.

direct words in order to put him on the right lines.
Source did not deduce from what was in this directive
that the K.C.B. believed that either man was living in
England. It certainly stated that NOSERNO had visited
England after his defection and that GONITSYN had
visited England several times. Source knows only what
GOLUBEV told him and what was in the directive; he has

defectors had visited the U.K.

Para, 3-b : The wording of this paragraph is almost identical
to nuch of paragraph 3-b of Source's report on Yuriy
Ivanovich NOSILO, regarding COLUREY's instructions,
#67 belief that both defectors had visited England,
Let aftenpts to locate then, etc. The unlu différence
as given in these reports is that NOSTRO is said to
Bave been in the UK in 1965, and COLITEYN "several
times". Since NOSENKO did not visit the UK in 1965
but we understand that GOLITSY: did nake several visits,
was wonder (in view of the strong sinharities in wording)
if there may be a garble in Source's reporting. Does
Source have any idea as to why the KG: believed either
of the two defectors had visited the UK?
