Visit of U.S. Immigration Official to AMMUG-1
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
ACTION REQUIRED: None, FYI only.
1.
MICROFILM
During the undersigned's most recent meeting with
AMMUG-1, the agent stated that a Mr. Rex M. Griffin, an
investigator of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) had visited him on 13 April 1971. According to AMMUG-1,
the purpose of Griffin's visit was to inquire into AMMUG-1's
present welfare and to determine his relationship to
Mr. Rodino. (COMMENT: Mr. Rodino is the sponsor of
H.R. #2076 which will expedite AMMUG-1's application for U.S.
citizenship by waiving the standard waiting period.) When asked
about his relationship with Mr. Rodino, AMMUG-1 simply explained
that Mr. Rodino was a friend of his from Washington.
.2.
Griffin explained that the reason that he wanted to
talk to AMMUG-1 personally, was the fact that nearly all of the
information surrounding AMMUG-1 was held in INS office in
Washington. He added that the information that was held by the
Miami office was closely held and access to the files was
severely restricted. During his visit, Griffin asked AMMUG-1 if
he noticed any unusual interest in his comings and goings, to
which AMMUG-1 replied negatively.
3. In view of above, believe it reasonable to assume that
Griffin suspects that JKLANCE is somehow involved with AMMUG-1.
This position is concurred in by Station Officer who maintains
liaison with the Miami office of the INS.
4.
AMMUG-1 characterized Mr. Griffin's visit as being
very pleasant and commented that he was "muy amable".
In sum,
there does not appear to be any need for intervention on
AMMUG-1's behalf or on that of the Station. If the need does
arise, we will promptly, inform Headquarters.

to AMMUG-1, FRANCO is G-2, and is one of the individuals he
approached (at our behest) during the Pan American games

FRANCO dismissed AMMUG-1's initial approach out of hand
stating that he was a Marxist-Leninist. According to AMMUG-1,
while a follow up was supposed to be made in Caguas, Puerto
Rico, the staff officer who was accompanying AMMUG-1 decided
against it.
FR
Jorge E. GARCIA-BANGO Dirube (201-736492). AMMUG-1
commented that GARCIA-BANGO was the other individual that
he tried to approach during the Pan American games. Like

His old DGI chum, Ramon Cesar CUENCA Montoto,.
appeared to be settling down for an extended stay
in Caracas.
Consequently, our people had decided to study him
in depth and decide at a later date what action, if
any, could or should be taken against him.
i.e.
to pitch or not to pitch.
Our office had asked me to thank him for his offer
to assist in any operation and would keep him in
mind in any future plans. S-1 was grateful to hear
these words and reiterated his willingness/availability
to help out in this or any other Operation.
I thought this to be the most diplomatic and effective way
to treat this issue. I wanted to give him an answer yet not
say we didn't think him the most likely candidate. 5-1 nas
always been PRESENT when we needed volunteers. He longs to
get back in the "business" and there is no doubt he can do
the job. They don't come any "gutsier." We never know when
we'll need him and its good to know he is there.

B. SLALOM-1
a CURAPESCA Representative who is currently in Tokyo.
SLALOM-1 states RAMIREZ is approachable because RAMIREZ
is definitely not a Communist, and he thinks very much
like him (SLALOM-1)
He is close to Nestor RAMIREZ
C. SLANK-1 He mentioned to PACHANKIS that
he had been close to Roberto RODRIGUEZ, Llompart, a Cuban
Mining Official who often travels to Mexico and Canada.
D. Gustavo MAS Brother-in-law of the current
Cuban Ambassador to Mexico. MAS has advised: PACHANKIS:
that he is willing to help us only to the extent of
determining the feelings of his sister and the Ambassador
at any given time, but no more. He will not accept any
remuneration from us and will foot his own bill to visit
his sister.
E. SECCOL-1 and SLACE-1
In describing the
former, PACHANKIS referred to him as from another
generation, i.e., of the ROA class, who could possibly.
be used with any older Cuban officials that might still
be around. He cautioned however, that SLCOOL-1 had
undergone a delicate concer operation two years ago
As concern SLACE-1,
which might impede his usefulness.
PACHANKIS suggested that we were probably better off
forgetting him. He described SLACH-1 as very problematical
and then went on to add such adjectives as avaricious,
sly, secretive, and a person inclined not to follow-
through on any task given him.
-6. PACHANKIS believes that much can be done with
the above defectors against the targets mentioned and,
himself, is anxious to get involved in another recruitment
operation as soon as possible.

VLADIMIR RODRIGUEZ LAHERA
JUNE 19, 1972-Ordered to be printed
Mr. EASTLAND,' from the Committee on the Judiciary,
submitted the following
REPORT
[To accompany H.R. 2076]
The Committee on the Judiciary, to which was referred the bill
(H.R. 2076) for the relief of Vladimir Rodriguez LaHera, having
considered the same, reports favorably thereon without amendment
and recommends that the bill do pass.
PURPOSE OF the bill,
The purpose of the bill is to enable Vladimir Rodriguez Lallera
to file a petition for naturalization, notwithstanding the fact that he
was formerly a member of a proscribed organization.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
The beneficiary of the bill is a 35-year-old native and citizen of Cuba,
whose status was adjusted to that of a lawful resident alien on No-
vember 7, 1966, retroactive to April 29, 1964, the date on which he was
paroled into the United States from Canada. He resides in Miami, Fla.,
with his wife, a lawful resident alien, and two daughters. The bene-
ficiary was employed in Cuba with the General Directorate of Intelli-
gence, and served in the Cuban Rebel Army. Without enactment of
the bill, the beneficiary would be unable to petition for naturalization
until 1974.

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT
5 APR
1972
1.
Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lailera has cooperated with
this Agency since his defection on 21 April 1964 at which time he
turned over to CIA documents from the General Directorate of
Intelligence (DGI) he had collected during the preceeding several
months. In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate and
valuable information on the organization of the Cuban intelligence
services, their operations, staff members and agents.
documents and information have given us the potential and
These
opportunity to take effective measures to safeguard United States
Government interests. Subject has been of great value in the
past, and will continue to be in the future, in the CIA recruitment/
defection program. His wide acquaintance among and knowledge
concerning high level Cuban diplomats and Cuban intelligence personnel
provides the Agency with the necessary background in planning
operations against them and makes Subject ideal for use in carrying
out the operations. His talents and contacts have been used not
`only in furthering the defector program, but in other types of
political action, psychological warfare and recruitment operations.
2. As a result of technical interrogations of RODRIGUEZ
on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, and objective operational
testing since, his bona fides have been established not only for
intelligence exploitation purposes but also for the purpose of
resettlement in the United States. There is no reason to believa
that “KODRIGUEZ is under the control of any hostile
intelligence service.
3.
The psychiatric and periodic medical examinations have
shown that RODRIGUEZ has no serious medical or psychiatriç
problems.
4.
Mr. RODRIGUEZ has adjusted well to American life.
He has been trained as a dental technician and for the past two
years has been working for the Marriott Corporation, specifically

JGO) Met with Mr. Garner J. Cline, Counsel,
Subcommittee No. 1, House Judiciary Committee, who told me that there would
be no problem with the Democratic objector relating to H. R. 2076, a bill for
the relief of Vladimir Rodriguez La Hera. Mr. Donald Benn, Associate Counsel
of the Judiciary Committee, has not touched base as yet with the Republican
objector but will do so before the private calendar is called on 7 March.
Mr. Cline told me also that the Davis bill, H. R. 5176 was formally
tabled by the fall Committee in its meeting of 22 February. The tabling was
without discussion on the basis of an adverse recommendation by the Subcommittee.
See Memo for Record dated 11 February 1972 on A. Trevor Gallaher.

The delay in responding to Refercice A's request that
a picture of Subject be reviewed with the appropriate assets
was due to the fact that prior to the receipt of the Reference B
photographs, we lacked a good picture of Subject. We felt
that the picture of Subject, #143 in Volume 1 of the Cuban
Mugbooks, was something less than satisfactory for the purposes
of positive identification.
2. Immediately upon the receipt of the Reference D
photographs, the undersigned reviewed with ATHUG-1 the one of
Nelson *Quesada Rivero with negative results.. AMGAME-1,
however, did recognize the name of Quesada and identified him
as being AMSTAFF. Needless to say, we will show AMGAME-1
the photograph of Subject at the earliest opportunity to
determine how well he knows him and if warranted, will debrief
him in detail on Subject.

3. The Reference D photograph of Subject will be reviewed
with the other AMSTAFF/AHQUAKE assets residing in the JMCOBRA
area and we will promptly inform you of the results.

SUBJECT

: Security Officer
: Ralph NOSEDA
1. Reference your memorandum OS 189-71..
2. Pursuant to your request this office contacted a senior
official of the Marriott Corporation in Washington, D.C., who
approved the travel to Europe of a Miami based Marriott employee
who is affiliated with WH.
3. The Marriott official, Mr. James MCALLISTER,
contacted his Miami representative, Mr. Halph NOSEDA, and
advised NOSEDA that your asset was free to travel to Spain on short
notice.
4. NOSEDA was advised by MCALLISTER that this was a matter
of interest to the Department of Defense. NOSEDA, to the best of our
knowledge, has not been approached by anyone else in Miami or Washington
on this matter since the initial call from MCALLISTER in March.

MICROFILMED
1. During JKLANCE's most recent attempt to contact
AMETROPIA-1 via AMMUG-1, it became readily apparent that
the cover story AMMUG-1 utilized with his immediate
superior was unsatisfactory from two points: First, it
did not permit us the operational flexibility so necessary
in an approach of this sort and secondly, if AMMUG-1 had
not returned when he did, his job security would have been
jeopardized.
·
2. To correct the above deficiency, WH/Miami has
arranged the following with the Miami Field Office (MFO):
In the future, if we again utilize AMMUG-1 to approach a
PBRUMEN official, we will ask that the MFO arrange to have
one of their representatives from their Headquarters
component contact the appropriate senior official of
AMMUG-1's company. This senior official will in turn
notify AMMUG-1's immediate superior that AMMUG-1 is to be
permitted to travel on matters of importance to the
Department of Defense.
3. Transmitted under separate cover is a copy of
a memorandum we received from the MFO concerning the above
arrangements.

At the time and place indicated

with AMMUG-1 Volumes II and III of the Cuban Mugbook, with
the following results:
Volume II
FR
Armando V. Estrada Fernandez ((201-809440) Photo #39
AMMUG-1 correctly identified the pseudo of Estrada as being
"ULISES". AMMUG-1 added that he had last spoken with Estrada
in February of 1964.
German Wigner fo
a mos
Cita
Photo #42
AMMUG-1's only comment was that he wasn't sure if Ramos was
his correct name.
FR
Roque Dalton
Garcia
✓ ((201-215097)) Photo #118
AMG-1 commented that he had spoken with Dalton in September
of 1964
ER
Manuel Carbonell Dique
(201-739081)) Photo #159
AMMUG-1 commented that he knew Carbonell from circa 1960, when
Carbonell was a captain in the police.
Volume III
AMBOG-1 did not recognize any of the photographs contained in
Volume III of the Cuban Mugbook..
Fay
:
2. AMBUG-1 was also shown the photograph of Luis
Martinez Menocal (201-769095) which was forwarded in
UFAW-1118 of 7 May 1971. while AGUG-1 thought the face familiar,
he was unable to identity the photograph.
3. In addition to the above, ALLUG-1 was also shown the
photographs of the following individuals with negative results:
Jorgo o lis Garcia (201-838320) and Sergio Tolon
