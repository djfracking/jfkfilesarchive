MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE
18 October 1970
-
31 October 1971
To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture
is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her
competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female,
young or merely well-preserved. Concerning her fitness be
it recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of
the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any others
I can think of at almost any grade. I venture to rate her
over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING.
Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organiza-
tion is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this
organization will be weakened.

William R. Johnson
Chief, CI/OPS/FE
☐ 6 FEB 1972
Date
Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently
turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-
standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager
who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor
and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization.
I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for
the many years she has made substantive contribution to the
CS.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Miss Ann L. Goodpasture-
THROUGH
SUBJECT
* Administrative Officer, CI Staff
: Application to Purchase Service Credit
1. This is to advise you that your application to purchase service credit
under the CIA Retirement and Disability System has been processed. The pe-
riod of your service which is not covered by retirement deductions and the
amount due to cover this period are as follows:
Redeposit Period
11 Mar 1942 - 8 Sep 1943
Total Amount Due
$241.00
2. Postponing payment will cause the amount due to increase because of
additional interest at the rate of 3 par cent compounded annually. However, so
long as the amount is not paid, you have the use of this money for other purposes.
You may postpone payment until you retire.
3. If the redeposit is not made you will receive no credit in the computa-
tion of annuity for the period of service covered by the refund. This usually
results in a sharp reduction in the amount of your annuity.
4. If you wish to make payment for the redeposit period, please make your
check payable to the Treasurer of the United States and forward it to the Chief,
Retirement Operations Branch, 205 Magazine Building. If you prefer, you may
make installment payments or arrange for bi-weekly payroll aliotments of $25.00
or multiples thereof. A receipt showing a statement of your account will be sent
to you acknowledging each installment payment.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE
1
18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971..
To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture
is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate. her
competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female,.
young or merely well-preserved. Concerning her fitness be
it recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of
the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any others
I can think of at almost any grade. I venture to rate her
over all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING.
Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organiza-
tion is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this
organization will be weakened.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWINg official:
Vi
William R. Johnson
Chief, CI/OPS/FE
116 FEB 1972
Date
Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently
turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-
standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager
who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor
and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for
the many years she has made substantive contribution to the
CS.

IV. COMMENTS: Miss Goodpasture's handling of the problems. Indicated that
1
slie is capable of shrewd mialysis. She overlooked some points which
might have been considered in one problem and dealt with the other
problem in too brief zaion, hab in general her analysis reflected
her actual experience and suggested that she is perhaps stronger in
analysis than in making operational decisions. She presented a rather
complex case and demonstrated that she not only understood the case
but was able to give a clear account of it.

IV. CO: Miss Goodpasture's handling of the problems indicated that
she is capable of shred analysis. She overlooked some points which
might have been considered in one problem and dealt with the other
problem in too brief fashion, but in genral her analysis reflected
her actual experience and suggested that she is perhaps stronger in
analysis than in making operational decisions. She presented a rather
comlex case and demonstrated that she not only understood the case
but was able to give a clear account of it.

Present Positions

At the present time. I am working in two placess one position is with the
War Relocation Authority in the Placement and Training Unit of the
1
"
Personnel Management Section which consists principally of clerical duties;
the other position is with Congressional Intelligence, a private news' service,
the work consists of preparing for publication various legislative reports,
press releases and current congressional information. The combined salaries
amount to $204. per month.
The Civil Service position which I now have is a grade. CAF-3 $1620. Although
am now doing personnel work, I do not feel that I am utilizing to the
fullest extent my experience and educational qualifications and would be
interested in transferring to any position for which I am qualified. I would
prefer a position with a salary which would not necessitate my being on two
jobs at one time.
I have no objection to a secretarial position if it is of a responsible
nature, however I feel that I am better qualified for a Junior Administrative,
Personnal or clerical accounting position.

1.
David Konan has asked that I state my preference with
regard to home leave and reassignment. I will be eligible for home
leave in July 1953 but it is not urgent that my leave be scheduled.
exactly when due. I would like, however, to know what opportunities
exist with headquarters and whather I should be looking elsewhero
for employment after July 1953.
2. With regard to another two year tour of duty in
Nonterrey, I would prefer a more responsible job than is forsssabla
hére. Now that the station files are set-up and the administrative
routine is established, my job, while termed Administrative Assist-
ant, is mainly that of a clerk-typist. The practice in typing naa
been good for me but I would like to look forward to a more re-
sponsible job for the next tour of duty. For instance, as a GS-9
I am performing the same type Job which I did in 1945 at a CAF-4
and a considerably less responsible job than the one performed at
headquarters as a P-2. While I have been taking Spanish lessons,
I know that I am not proficient enough in the language for an
assignment in Latin America, and feel that I would be better off
in another area.
3. For the benefit of the case officer in assigning a
replacement, Konan has suggested that I outline the duties which
my replacement should be trained to perform, The routine can be
learned in the field within two or three weeks.
'
a) Copy typing. About 75% of the time will be taken
up with routine typing.
b) Index carding. About 600 index sards a week are now
being typed for the card files and for the visa section
files.
c) Preparation of courier mall. Couriers usually go
to the border approximately every two weeks but there is
no regular schedule, and pouches are sometimes prepared
on a few hours notice.
d) Communications. The incumbent should have complete
training for our codes for he will not have much practice
in the field as only two or three messages ara transmitted
monthly.

e) Photography. At the present time, considerablo
operational use is being made of a darkroom at m
residence. In addition to my om photograpte
equipment, the station photographie equipment is
used there. My replacement should be trained in the
use of the duo-printer and in 35mm copy work. If he
has no personal photographic equipment, headquarters
may wish to issue him a camera as there is only one
camera at the station. Most of the copy work has bean
done with my personal rolleiflex and enlarger.

Administrative Reports.
(1) Station Punds.
He will be responsible for
dispensing funds, keeping records and preparation
of the monthly accounting reports.
(2) Property.
He will be responsible for keeping
records of government property and preparation of
periodic reports and inventories.
(3)
Exchange commodities. He will be responsible
for keeping records and preparing periodic reports
and inventories.
g) Maintenance of Files. The station files are set-up
along the lines recommended by headquarters, and should
require little time for upkeep.
h) Information Reports. Dependent upon the clerical
workload, he may assist. Konan in the preparation of
information reports.
1) Cover Job. Hone. If there are only two people at
the station, the replacement for my job would not have
time to perform a cover Job and consequently, would have
no regular working relationship with the DYMARCH employses.
4. A resourceful person can find Monterrey a vary
er.joyable post. From a social point of view, the city is not a
dull place and either a single girl or man can find plenty of
things to do. There are a limited number of single parsons here,
but one can always find somewhere to go and something to do. The
American colony, as a whole, is the friendliest group that I have
known at any post and they are very gracious with invitations to
their homes. If headquarters has someone in mind for this post
and would like elaboration on living conditions in Monterrey, I
shall be glad to forward them on request.

Miss Goodpasture has been on sick leave since July 1972 awaiting
medical retirement in October 1973. She is a charter member of the Agency
having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations. Her
career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-
standing performance, all of which is fully documented.
In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasturė
served in support of the successful coup against the communist government
in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty in Bombay, Monterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred during
her service in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a
"trouble-shooting" case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-.
master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as "intelligent, hard
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent CI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."
Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 1970-October 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: "..I venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the bough warp-threads on which
this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organi-
zation will be weakened." The reviewing official agreed with the above
and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recogni
tion she so richly deserves for the many years she has made substantive

DATE: 12 December 1947

-FROM : Chief, FEZ
SUBJECT:
Ann L. Goodpasture
Temporary Promotion
1. Subject is administrative assistant at our installa-
tion in Bombay, India. Due to the increased cost of living in
Bombay, request is malle that she be given a temperary promotion
from a CAF-7 to a CAF-9. The increase in selary, plus the addi-
tional cost-of-living and quarters allowances, will be suffi-
cient to permit Miss Goodpasture to meet the highly inflated
cost of living in Bombay, an impossibility for the past several
months..
2. A review of subject's reports on living conditions in
Bombay reveals that since her arrival in April, she has had to
live in temporary quarters on a day-to-day or weck-to-week basis.
The rooms cccupied by subject have been shared with at least one
other girl and sometimes two or three. Bathroom silities are
also shared with the other occupants or the hotel. During a
period of several months, subject and her roommate cocupied a
nine by twelve room on the fifth floor of a "walk-on' and shared
a bath with four men. This room cast them $150 th each..
At the present time subject and her roommate are living in a
single room, without private bath, and for the privilege are
paying $ Rs. 200 a week each (approximately $60.).
3.
In a dispatch dated 28 November, subject stated that
"I am now spending more than my combined salary and allowances
to maintain only a moderate standard of living. It appears at
present that it is unlikely that any permanent quarters will be
found for unmarried members of the staff. . .since Your officers'
families are en route to Bombay and three such families presently
in Dombay are without places to live. Any acconciations secured
through the Consulate will of course be made available first to
the highest ranking officer in need of housing. y accommoda-
tions found through other channels have so far been prohibitive
in price.
4.
In support of subject's statement of conditions she
attached, at the Consul General's suggestion, a csgy of his
report to the State Department dated November 7, 1347. Pertin-
ent portions of the Consul General's dispatch have been

excerpted and are appented to this memorandum.
5. Subject's presont salary, minus retirement and income.
tax, is $105.12 per two-week pay period; her present living and
quarters: allowance amounts to $78.45. The proposed increase to
₫ CAF-9 would bring her not calary to [127.43 per two-week pay
period and her living allowance to $103.07 - a difference of $46.92
every two weeks. A promotion to a CAF-8 would be insufficient,
since her allowances would remain the same and the salary
increase would amount only to $10.75 per pay period.

Despatch No. 637.
File No.

SON J. MACDONALD, ad
Bombay, India, November 7, 1947
.
THE SONORABLE
THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WASHINGTON
I have the honor to refer to my despatches naderod 93, 281 and
* dated April 5. June 19 and September 13, 1947 respectively, and to
report that the housing situation in Bombay is getting more critical
mailj.
Not only is living at hotels, unsatisfactory in this climate, but
** is far more expensive than any member of this staff can afford. So
far the staff has accepted the unitisfactory and expensive living condi-
Ses without undue complaints but this situation cannot continue without
seriously affecting moralo and foreing resignations, or requests for trans-
Pers which I cannot conscientiously disapprove. The local authorities have
be requested on numerous occasions to assist this office in obtaining
living quarters and, although they have been making vague promises ever
since my arrival last February, no houses or apartments live matorialized.
It is not likely that anything will be obtained through the Government
mless a substantial bribe known locally as "pugree" is paid. It is gener-
ally recognized now that only persons and firms paying "pugree" get living
accomodations.
An endeavor is being made to find a suitable residence for the
Nasul General and staff quarters that can be purchased, but the deaand
for all types of dwellings has resulted in fantastically high prices and
it is doubtful that anything will be obtained.
This office had an opportunity of leasing a floor of a building
hat could have been made into three apartments as reported in my telo-
No. 366 dated October 13, 1947. This request was disapproved by the
Department and it is most unlikely that another opportunity of this sort
will arise. It must be pointed out that is any places do become available,
the landlord will demand a lease on behalf of the Department before he will
er consider renting the place. Landlords with whom I have talked informed
me that if any of their places de become available they will not lease them
to members of the staff but will lease them to the Department.
I cannot stress sufficiently the seriousness of the present situa-
en particularly, from the financial standpoint and request that the
Department increase the rent allowance for members of the staff who are

DATE: 5 November 1946
Through: Acting Chief, FEZ
FROM Acting Chief, Div. 1, FBZ 189
SUBJECT: Ann Lorene Goodpasture.
Division 1, FBZ, requests that the above subject be trans-
ferred from SSU Registry to Div. I, FAZ. Three copies of her Form 57
are attached.
It is planned to send Miss Goodpasture to Bombay upon com-
pletion of her CIG and State Department training. Her present grade
is a CAF-5, but her duties in her new position entitle her to a
promotion to a CAF-7 upon her arrival in Bombay. A job description
is attached.
When Miss Goodpasture first made known her desire to return
to the Far East, this division contacted Registry and found that they
were willing to release her for an overseas assignment. A¨ replace- i
ment has already been obtained for her and Miss Goodpasture will be
on leave from 4 November to 2 December, 1946. Registry agreed to.
carry her on their rolls until their personnel is terminated by
SSU or until she can be picked up by CIG--which ever is sooner.

further attention and treatment. After release from the hospital
she will go to her home in Tipton, Oklahoma.
'
In view of the above facts, we shall show Miss Goodpasture

paid since 9 February.
It is requested that her case be checked and necessary
stops be taken to reimburse her. Misa Goodpasture has been
a Clerk-Stono, CAF-5, $2320 with the SI office since 16 Dec.
1945. She departed from Shanghai on 5 March and arrived in
Fashington on 30 March.
'
Misa Goodpasture is being hospitalized immediately, due
to a serious ear ailment which developed on the trip back,
and will probably be out for approximately one month. Any
payments should be mailed to her in Tipton, Oklahoma (no
Street address), until further notice..
