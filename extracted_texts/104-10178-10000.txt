MICRONUN
1. On approximately 5 March 1972, a Station asset, CIFENCE-4,
while acting in his cover capacity had occasion to detain and question
one Ricardo MORALES Navarrete, a Cuban resident of Miami.
2. Morales N. told CIFENCE-4 that he, Morales, is employed by
LNERGÓ from whom he receives a salary of US$700 per month. Morales said
that he was on route to Colombia on a drug case at the time. During the
conversation Morales admitted to CIFENCE-4 having been responsible for a
killing in Florida.
3. CI-FENCE-4 reported to the Station the above, as well as stating
that Morales has an extremely poor reputation in the Cuban community,
where he is prone to tell nearly anyone willing to listen of his affiliation
with LNERGO, with the implication that his employer sanctions his
activities.
4. Morales also told CIFENCE-4 that a Cuban (true name of CIGOAL-5)
who works with SIFA in Caracas is an agent of BKTRUST.
5. Attached is a copy of the reentry permit of Morales, as well as
a clipping from the Miami press relating to the killing which Morales
allegedly confessed to having committed.
6. The above is for the information of Station WH/Miami and further
action as deemed appropriate. No coordination with LNERGO in Caracas has
been effected due to security considerations involving CIFENCE-4.

Cuarto 1309, Hospital Jackson Memorial, 7:10 P.M.
Miércoles Dietembre 4 de 1968.
"Yo. JULIO ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, del 752
S.W. Cuirta calle, Miami, Florida, casado con Mar
Constanzo, la cual estf aquí presente, declaro lo st-
gutente: Nach en Palma Soriano, Oriente, en Cuba,
Tel 22 de Mayo de 1936. Yo tengo 32 años de edad. Me
case el 10 de Marzo de 1933 en Miami, Florida.
Yo no soy un ciudadano de Estados Unidos, Yo soy
un residente, y tengo una Mija, Elizabeth, la cual cum-
plirà cinco años de edad el 24 de diciembre, la cual
nació aquí, en este Hospital, Jackson Memorial.
Mi prapósito de hacer estas declaraciones se debe
al hecho que la polle ha permitido que pascá varios
¿ías, y la gente que intentổ quitarme la vida estí afuera
en la calle, libres.
El 22 de noviembre, alrededor de las 8.30 de la noche,
a unas tres cuadras de mi casa, yo estaba caminan-
do y me bas de la acera en la avenida y la Segunda
calle, en la sección del S.W., cuando of a alguien lla-
marme "Azón", y mirể para ver quien era, y enton➡
ces yo senti que ellos me disparaban, y yo volas ar-
mas con silenciadores.
Yo a Ricardo Morales Navarrete, y el estaba
en un Chevrolet Impala 1965, de dos puertas, amari-
llo con dos luces de cola. Estaba situado en el medio
de calle.
Este hombre, Ricardo Morales Navarrete estaba ea
el asiento de atrás, en la lado izquierdo. El tenía un
fusil M-3, con un silenciador, el cual dispara balas
calibre 45.
Otro hombre camba manejando, y yo lo conozco de
vista, pero no sé su nombre verdadero. Lo llaman coa
ei spodo de "El Gallego". Este hombre, E: Callego,
tenía una pistola que parecía una Beretta, con un siè
lenciador adaptado.
Ambos me dispararon. Yo recibf 15 heridas de ba-
la y 21 perforaciones.
Un tercer honibre estaba en el carro, llamado Fran='
cisco Rodríguez al que apodan "El Mejicano”, el cual
no disparó.
Yo identifico & Ricardo Morales Navarrete como al
mismo hombre qué testifies para el Gobierno en el jul-
cio de Orlando Bosch.
Dos dias antes yo lo va & con esta otra persona,
El Gallego, observandome en frente de mi casa. Ellos
estaban en otro carro, un Polara,
Yo conozco a este Morales Navarrete de La Habana,
Aera Jefe Asistente de la Sección del G-2 en el Aero-
Puerto de Rancho Boyeros, Habana, Cuba.
Yo no he hablado con él, pero otro hombre, Eddy
Fernández Pla, hace casi dos meses, vino a mi casa.
a eso de la una de la madrugada para darme un mensa–
je de Ricardo Morales Navarrete y del Mejicano Fran
cisco Rodriguez Tamayo los cuales no. querian ser
mis enemigos, que el enemigo era Batista, y que debía-1
mos ser amigos porque las cosas iban a cambiar.
Yo te dije que no quería tener ninguna amistad con
gente que trabajaba para Fidel Castro.
La noche que Eddy Permináez Pia víno a mi casa,
& estaba con otro hombre, Rogelio Fernández, el cual
es un vendedor de o Pirestone.
Yo tengo una bain niojada cerca de mi corazón y tie-
ne que ser extrafda con un aparato especial, según me
dijo el médico.
En estos tres últimos días no me he sentido blen
y como tengo todos estos tiros en mi cuerpo sé que es.
toy en una mala condición y me siento como que voy
a morir, v si mucro, no quiero morir sin que este gran
pars castigue a estos, asesinos, los cuales son nefastos :
para toda la sociedad.
Hago estas declaraciones completamente consciente
de sus conte nidos, sin coacción y de mi propía y libre
voluntad.
He tenido atención médica para aviar el dolor, y no
me siento bajo la influencia de ninguna droga, pero me
siento muy normal y hago estas declaraciones por las
razones antes expuestas”.

puurtos on las cercanion de la región del Gua-
niɑmo y mɔs pequeños adn en cada una de las må
nas que van apareciendo y doddo co agrupan tom
poralmente gran número de personas.-
Puntualizando lo antes dicho existo un coropuer
to que sirva como Base do Operaciones en la región, iden-
tificado como Aeropuerto do "La Contella", con una longi-
tud de ochocientos (800) motros do pista de tierra, aien-
do este el dis mayor tamaño y desde donde se hacen los
trasbordos en avionotas mas pequeñías que calun a los pro-
pios cempos minaros, situados on un årsa no mayor de quin
co (15) minutos de vuelo.
En el caso de "La Selvación", este campamento-
minero se encuentra exactamente a unos siete minutos de
vuelo saliendo del Aeropuerto "La Contella". La pista de
atorrizaje es igualmente de tierra con apenas trescientos
ochanta (380) metros de longitud, lo que hace sumamente -
poligroso au utilización, mas aún cuando observamos que
8ª encuentra rodeada de árboles gigantescos que alcanzané
40 y 50 metros de altura. Por las características descri-
tas, en esta pista han ocurrido varios accidentes aéreos-
causando muertos, heridos y varios aparutos destruidos de
los cuales actualmente se pueden apreciar en el sitio cin
co totalmente inservibles; igualmente no so utilizon 100
equipos de radio entre las avionetas y los aoropuertos, &
xistiendo el poligro latento do un accidento por el cho--
que de aparatos tanto en el aire como en la propia pista,
ya que generalmente existen nubos muy bajas quo aponaa
pormiten ver la pista como un pequeño cloro en medio do
la selva; esta situación empeora cần mas por la irrespon-
sabilidad de las líneas aéreas y los propius pilotos,
quiones buscando mayor beneficio sobrecargan los aviones-
a veces hasta con el doble del peso permitido, sin que 0-
xista ningún control de Comunicaciones para regular tal A
normalidad. Un ajemplo claro lo constituye la Línea "A--
SERCA", que on un año registró trece accidentes en la re-
gión.-

2. 1. Las condicionas de vida do la población que ad
canza aproximadamento a unas 6.000 persones
(pero que llegó a toner al año pasado unas
15.000), dejan mucho que desear on el aspecto-
sanitario, habitacional y moral. Los aquas
quo corren por el lugar están contaminadas por
el esparcimianto indiscriminado de excrementos
on las márgenes, de las quebrados y pequeñas
ríos, así como en el interior del propio pobla
do. Las enfermedados, como el paludismo y ami-.
biasis, se observan con bastante frecuencia
pòr falta de asistencia y control sanitarioj
‘las enfermadadas vondreas abundan por no exis-
tir un riguroso control sobre el gran número
da prostitutas que existen en la población. La
totalidad de las viviendas estan construidas
con cartones, tablas y láminas do zinc, que as
casamente protegen a sus moradores de las in--
clemencias del tiempo, siendo mas grava la si-
tuación por la gran cantidad de niñies, qua son
llevados por sus padres al lugar, por damás pa
ligroso e inapropiado para ellos, sin quo tam-
poco exista ninguna regulación a control al
respecto.-
La prostitución cobra marcado incremento en es
tas zonas, atrayendo mujores desde diferentes-
lugares de la República y de paises vecinos co
mo Colombia y Brasil, que se agrupan an impro-
visados bares situados dentro de la población,

entre ellos los siguientes:
•

Que cuando ol Teniente LUIS PRIN VILLEGAS era
el Jafe de la Guardia Nacional en "La Salva -
ción", existía al Bar "Bajuquero", cuya dueña-
aparentemente era la ciudadana PETRA GUAPE,
quien era públicamente amanta del Teniente
PRIN, ya que azan vistos caminar tomados de la

ella en el local dal mismc Bar, lo grave de --

te ordenaba el cierre de todos los demás bares

los propios Guardias que si querian seguir to-
mando podían continuar en el Bar "Bejuquaro",
donde en varios oportunidades se vió a los
Guardias uniformados despachando cervezas a
los clientes on el interior de ese Bar, por lo
qua se generalizó entre los pobladores la idea
de que el Tta. PRIN tenía parte en el negocio.

VILLEGAS, especialmente el Cabo PIÑATË, se da-
ban a la tarea de padir a los mineros parto de
la tierra que sacaban y donde podría haber o-
nó diamantas; igualmente cobrahan una especie-
de impuesto a las personas que administraban
las casas do juages. Narran las personas entre
vistadas que en una oportunidad los mineros, u
no do ellos menor de edad, se jugaban de manos
en al pueblo, resultando golpeado el manory -

Generalmante los mineros forman grupos de tro-

las que se repartiré la ganancia que logran of
toner, pero como carecen de recursos indispan-
sublos so ven obligados a incluir como socios-
personas que les prestán los implementas
trabajo o que financian su alimentación, cone-
tituyaddo esta forma una especie de explota
ción si se toma en cuenta que generalmente exa
geran los cantidades consumidas por los mine-
ros. Los compradores de diamantes aprovechan
la Decesidad de vender los diamantes encontra-
dos por los mineros, para pagarlos a precios
muy por debajo de su valor real y los especula
dores aprovechan para elevar los precios de --
los alimentos, medicinas, etc., llegando an o-
portunidades de escasez a vender hasta en Ba
la
40 un kilogramo de arroz. Actualmente dada
competencia y los constantes viajes que efec
tuan al lugar las diferentes líneas aéreas, en
tro ollas: "ASERCA", "AEROVEN", "GATIZSA", "LA
TINCARGA", "AEROTECNICA" y "COHERAVIA", los
precios han dejado de ser tan exagerados.❤

JOSE TOMAS GAONA ESPINOZA, pero el verdadero
control sobre la población es ejercido por la-
Guardia Nacional y para el momento de la pre--
sente averiguación estaba constatuida por un -
grupo de cuatro Guardias, comandados por un Ca
bo de apellido CARPIO; este grupo es completa-
mante nuevo en el lugar, a raíz de la salida
del Toniente LUIS PRIN y de su segundo, un Ca-
bo de apellido PINATE, quiones fueron someti-
dos a investigación por su propio Comando a

ción, no opuso ninguna resistencia y volunta--
riamente manifestó a la Guardio Nacional que
estoba dispuesto a enviar al médico por ou
cuenta a su amigo y a pagar un arresto si era-
necesario, cosa esta que no sucedió pues el -
Toniente ordenó esposarlo y propinarle cinco
planazos en presencia del pueblo para así sen-
tar un precedente de respeto, según expresó.-
Sa pudo conocer que el año pasado, por el mes-
de Noviembre, por orden de la Guardia Nacional
se llevó a cabo una reunión en el Bar del Sø--
for ZABALA, y donde asistieron además el Coro-
no1 VALDERRAMA y el Tta. Cnel BECERRA, proce--
dentes del Destacamento acantonado en San fer-
nando de Apure. En esta reunión sa planted la-
necesidad de que cclaboraran los comerciantoa-
de la localidad para la construcción del Coman
do de la Guardia Nacional en esa mina; los co-
merciantes aceptaron hacerlo y negocio a nogo-
cio fueron visitados dando on 100 y 200 bolíva
res cada uno; esta colaboración no fué del a-
grado de los comerciantes, pero por temor a ra
presalias prefirieron colaborar no pudiendo de
terminar la cantidad recogida, pero se estima-
he varics miles de bolivares; con la suma de
dinero donada se construyó un galpón de zinc,-
cercado con alembres de ɲdas que en la actuali
dad hace las veces de Comando de la Guardia Na

SITUACION EXISTENTE EN VENEZUELA
Generalidados
En 1970 la producción dismantifera Venezolana alcanzó 508.661
quilates, siendo esta producción la más alta en la historia de
esta actividad en el país. Cón relación a 1959 la producción
ha triplicado según se desprende de los cusdros anexos da pro-
ducción.
Esta producción ha sido lograda en su casi totalidad bajo el ·
sistema de libre aprovechamiento, sinónima da sub-desarrollo
en los aspactos técnico, social y económica. En el aspecto téc-
nico el sub-desarrollo se manifiesta en los sistemas rudimenta-
rios de explotación que mo permiten el cabal aprovechamiento del
yacimiento.
En el aspecto social son de todos conocidas las condiciones in-
6 frahumanas en que se desenvuelve la vida dal minero, con la Pal-
⠀ta de servicios elementales, vías de comunicación, falta de seguri-
dad personal imposibilidad de lograr una suparación personal a tra-
vés de una comunidad y familia estables.
En el aspecto económico los circuitos de marcadeo existentes hacen
que el minera se encuentre a merced de los compradores organizados
a quienas vanden su producción en las condiciones que le son fija-
das.
⠀ Por otra parta hay qua señalar que el libra aprovechamiento sola
puede ser utilizado donda concurren ciertas condiciones fisicas
como alta concentración del diamante y agua suficiente para las
técnicas primitives de lavado.

Con el nivel de producción actual y la riqueza potencial exia-
tento se hace nacesorio efectuar modificaciones an la forma de
aprovechamiento, introduciendo técnicas industriales de trabajo.
Igualmanto es de señalar que la lay y reglamento actuales de Mi-
nas datan del año 1944, cuando la producción diamantifera no al-
canzaba ni siquiera al 10% de los niveles actuales. Su modifica-
ción es imperativa a efectos de introducir nuevas regulaciones
consonas con las técnicas existentes inclusive en paises manos de-
sarrollados que Venezuela.
No se pretende recomendar la eliminación de la explotación del
diamante bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamiento por las impli- ¨
cáciones socio-politicas que esta modida tendría, pero sí comple-
mantarla con la utilización de métodos industriales de aprovechamien-
to enmarcada dentro de una legislación actualizada.
El Ministerio de Minas conoce los pormenores de la explotación
bajo el libre aprovechamiento desde hace tiempo, recalcada por los
Ings. Francisco Izquierdo y Oleg Andreiev, expertos del MMH, en
varias oportunidades.
La actividad diamantifera en Venezuela reviste anorma importancia
según puede apreciarse en las cifras siguientes, (sobra datos de
1970):
*
.
•
•
Representa el 1,5% de la producción mundial, estimada ofi-
cialmente on 46 millones de quilates.
Utiliza una fuerza de trabajo entre 10.000 y 15.000 mineros.
De la cifra anterior es dificil determinar al porcentaje de
Venezolanos y de Extranjeros indocumentados que trabajan en
asta actividad.
Aporta a la Nación ingresos Piscalizados de 30.millones
de bolivares de los cuales el Gobierno percibe en calidad
de impuesto de explotación un 3%.

12.- Especificaciones del Digmento venezolano
Origan
El diamanto venezolano proviena do Guayana ( Provincia de
Roraima y Cuchivero).
Es un diamante de aluvión 6 ses que se encuentra en el cauce de
los ríos, 6 forma on terrazas aluvionales depósitos ubicados a
poca profundidad; 3 a 15 metros de acuerdo a la topografía.
En algunas regiones del mundo, los diamantes se encuentran en
"chimeneas" 6 "pipas";: únicas fuentes primarias de diamantes
conocidas- ejemplo: Kimberley (Africa del Sur) - en otras en
depósitos aluvionales como en Venezuela 6 an las playas del Sur
Deste de Aftica; 6 an una combinación de ambos - ejemplo: Yaku-
tia, Rusia.
3
No todas las "chimineas" son productivas y 75% de la producción
mundial proviene de aluvión.
La riqueza de los depósitos depende:
Tenor
->
· del tenor en diamantes del material extraido
- de la proporción entre los tipos, talla-industrial-bort
--
- de las características de las piedras (morfológicas y de
color)
En Venezuela la cantidad de quilates por tonelada métrica es sa-
tisfactoria; para el Guaniamo se puede evaluar en 0,4 – 0,5 qui-
lates por tonelada métrica - cantidad que justifica la permanen-
cia en el sitio del Minaro de Libre Aprovechamiento. ( 1 quilate”
0,2+ gramos)
12
Los valores promedios de los tenores de los yacimientos del grupo
De Beers en Africa del Sur son de 0,2 a 0,3 - según se desprende
del Informe Anual 1969 de De Beers Consolidated Mines LTD.

✓ cubo.
formas intermedias entre las 3 anteriores
La forma cúbica es la más rara; generalmente en Venezuela hallamos
octaedros; muy semejantes a los de Sierra Leone y que aparecen en
la hoja - DIAMANTE DE TALLA - DIFERENCIAS MORFOLOGICAS.
Siendo de origen aluvionario se puede apreciar que presentan aris-
tas redondeadas y no nítidas, significativo de un posible arrastra
hasta su lugar de extracción.
Los octaedros de "chimeneas" tienen aristas nítidas y perfectas
(foto). En la operación de talla, el octaedro es el mas apropiado
para la talla americana 6 full cut 6 corte clásico del brillants.
Estructura
Característica morfológica que corresponde al modo de cristalización
de la piedra, observandose una de las dos particularidades siguien-
tes:
- estrías en las facetsзs 6
- estratos en el cuerpo de la piedra
Generalmente nuestras pideras presentan estas capas é estratos,
perfectamante observables al microscopio binocular, lo cual pueda
marecer un cuidado especial en la operación talla.

Las piedres grandes son rarás En 1970 fuá descubierta en el
Guaniszo una piedra de 57,85 quilates, ( adquirida en el sitio
'por 8s. 55.000 avaluada en 104.000 B. por el M.M.H. a los efectos
dėl Impuesto de explotación.)
En esta aspecto, el comercio ilícito hace errática toda investiga-
ción y salo se dispone tanto en Venezuela como on gran parte de

las áreas de producción de datos indicativos relativós al tamaño“:
por eje: lo en Ghana es frecuente la piedra de más de 2 quilates;
en Dutcitspan Sur Africa, el ritmo de aparición de piedras de
50 a 200 quilates es más frecuente que en cualquier otro sitio
( mines controladas por De Beers).
-
En los placeres aluvionales de playas del sur cesta africano las
piedras grandas se encuentran en is desembocadura del río Grange,
disminuyando el tamaño a medida que se aleja uno de la desembocadura
(20 piedras/quilate a 200 millas de la desembocadura; explotación en
el mar)
Color
El color es otra característica que se toma en cuenta en la avalue-
ción da la piedra bruta. En la piedra tallada su importancia es menor
ya que el valor lo determinan en orden: las proporciones de las fa-
cetas, inclusiones, color y paso.

De les Condiciones de vida del minaro
El Minero organizado en grupo da trabajo, tiene ingresos provaṇion-
tas da:
• uña actividad diaria que rinda Es 100 a Bs 500 semanales por perso
na.
• una actividad de envergadura consistente en una explotación a ma –
yor escala donde interviene la rezación de "grunas” o bloques da
varias toneladas en una quebrads; la apertura de un "telin" o ca -
nal de desvío o corte de meandro; sctividad que ocupa generalmente
a cuatro a cinco mineros y que rinds por ejemplo Bs 20.000,00 en
un mes al grupo de trabajo.
Los gastos de existencia dal minero son por otro lado muy elevados
dėbidos a las condiciones mismas del sistema de Libre Aprovechamien-
to o sea aislamiento, hostilidad del medio, etc.
Podemos ilustrar lo costoso de la vida con los precios siguientes:
- un almuerzo (presa de pollo +arepa)
- un fresco
- una cerveza
- un kilo de cambures
- periódico
->
- pasaje en helicóptero para un vuelo
de 5 minutos aproximadamente (aqui-
valentes a trayecto caminado en 6
horas)
Bs 10,00
'88
3,00
-
• Bs 5,00°
Bs 6,00
8s
2,00
Bs 100,00
Por lo expuesto podemos ver que el minero necesita un nivel acepta-
ble de ingresos para hacer frente al alto costo de la vida que impo
ne el medio, viéndose obligado en esas condiciones a aceptar los
precios que se ofrecen por la producción encontrada.
En conclusión la explotación bajo el sistema de libre aprovechamien
to hace dificil la determinación de los costos unitarios de produc-
ción, los márgenes de utilidad entre intermediarios y en general to
da evaluación racional de tipo económico, incluyendo la producción
misma.

1332.- Precios a los efectos de liquidación del Impuosto de Explotación.
La Ley de Minas admite que el imcusste de explotación de 3 an el
caso del libro aprovechamiento, saa cancelado por el compresez en
caso de que el minero no pudiera hacerlo. La liquidación de esa in
puesto tiene lugar en Ciudad Soliver y es generalmente un mayoris
ta que centraliza los diamantes provenientes de varios compres
el que presenta una solicitud de liquidación según el model anexo.

(Utilidad teórica)
1333.-Progresión del nivel de precios.-
Es difícil establecer la ganancia de los intermediarios.
-->
es decir
Se puede aceptar una utilidad de 5% por participante
que dosde el minero hasta el mayorista exportador (dos o tres in-
termediarios) el precio de una piedra aumentaría en un 10 6 15%,
lo quayno parece excesivo.
Son excepcionales las variaciones mayores: del estudio del regis-
tro de ventas de los compradores que tienen actualizada su situa-
ción en la fiscalía del Ministerio de Minas en Ciudad Bolivar, se
pudo ver por ejemplo que en Mayo de 1970 el Sr. Ramón Peña vendi6
al Sr. Visnel Alvarez en Bs. 9.000,00 un lote adquirido en Bs.
6.800,00 6 sea realizando una ganancia de 30%. Normalmente este már
gen oscila entre 4 y 7%.
-
En verdad, a través del circuito se opera una selección de las pie-
dras que trae como consecuencia un aumento en el valor de los lotes.
Esto lo apreciamos en el ejamplo del IVIC Instituto Venezolano de
Investigaciones Científicas el cual adquiere diamante industrial
destinado a lo fabricación de las cuchillas de diamante, siendo pia
dras escogidas.
-
De cualquier manera, puede apreciarse que los exportadores de dia
mantes aún haciendo una ligera utilidad de 5% en cada operación, de
do que ésta se repite muchas veces a lo largo del año, hacen un al-
to beneficio, proporcional a la rotación de su capital durante el
período.

14.- Aprovechamiento del Diamente en Venezuela.-
1
i
Dal total da diamantes producido en Venezuela (en 1970 508.000,00
quilates) es infima la ports aprovechada en el País.
-
-
En lo que se refiere al diamants de talla existen unos poccs ta
lleres que en pequeña escala trabajan la talla del dismante. Tana
mos el ejemplo en Ciudad Bolivar dėl Teller Caroní, con S perso
has donde se talla aproximadaments 400 quilates por año, saçún in
formación recabada en el Taller mismo. Existen otros talleres en
Puerto Ordaz, Caracas y la Colonia Tovar.
1
Se ha estimado que actualmenta no excede de 2.000,00 quilatas por
año la talla del diamante en Venezusla.
-
El Gobierno Regional en el Estado Solívar está impulsando el esta
blecimiento de una escuela de talla en Ciudad Bolivar, habiendo
ordenado ya los equipos necesarios. Esta actividad merece todo el
apoyo gubernamental con miras a desarrollar en Venezuela los equi
pos humanos para que estos pusdan competir en el Marcado Interne-
cional al cabo de unos años, una vez adquirida la experiencia noce
sario, lograda en otros paises en varias generaciones.
Hay que estar conscientes que la talla del diamante es una activi-
dad altamente especializada y compatida en Estados Unidos, Europa
a Israel. Por ejemplo en esta último país existen 12.000 tallado-
ras que devengan en promedio sueldos mensuales de 900,00 Ss., de-
termiņando esto un costo reducido de talla.
En Israal tuvimos la oportunidad de visitar los Talleres Barik qua
producen mensualmante 5.000 quilates tallados, variando los costos
de la talla entre 15,50 $ y 27,60 $ por quilate.
Can respecto al diamante industrial, con excepción del Institute
Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, practicamente no existe
el aprovechamiento de este tipo de diamante. El IVIC aprovecha
*proximadamente 200 quilates al año, como se detalla an fiche ane-
xa.

Ejemplo.- Aprovechamiento del Diamante Industrial.-
Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificos.-
El IVIC utiliza el diamante industrial nacional para la Pabricación
do la cuchillas de diamantes, para cortos ultrafinos, según técnica
desarrollada por al Cientifico Venezolano Dr. Humberto Fernández M.
Precio de compra del dismante y circuito del mismo.-
El IVIC aprovecha anualmente 200 quilates de diamantes reseleccions
dos de tipo industrial, por el cual paga a razón de 80,00 us/ quilg
te: .

El circuito de adquisición de estos diamantes es:
Minero Comprador de Campo (empleado del mayorists)
✈ Mayorista de Ciudad Bolivar
de Caracas
Mercado Externo.-
IVIC
i
Mayorista Exportador
Con diamantes de buenas dimensiones y peso inferior a 1 quilate el
IVIC fabrica las cuchillas para microtomo de primera calidad las
cuales factura así:
}
•
Cuchilla de 2 mm. de ancho, más soporte
120,00 dólares
•
Cada 0,1 mm. adicionales
20,00 dólares
1
:
El quilate de diamento de este tipo ha sido pagado al minero a razón
de 50,00 6s/quilate. (diamante de primera, panelas), según se despren
de de las planillas de declaración del mayorista de Ciudad Bolivar,
valor aceptado por el Ministerio da Minas.
Adquiriendo el diamante a 80,co Bs/Qt. observamos que hay una diferen
cia de 30,00 P/Qt. que viene siendo la utilidad de los intermediarios
esta ganancia no puede considerarse excesive, máxima tomando en cuen-
to la selección da la piedra, pero al cabo de un año de negocic do es
ta naturaleza el intermediario puede llegar a un rendimiento de 200 %
sobre su capital dependiendo de la frecuencia con la cual eu capital
sea rotado.

CTRAS RECOMENDACIONES
-
Las recomendaciones que a continuación hacemos guardan relación
directa, aunque no aparenta, con el objeto mismo de nuestro estudio
y estan destinadas a corregir, completer o reconsiderar algunos as-
pectos de la actividad diamantifera en Vanezuela.
Algunas de las recomendaciones no conciernen directamente al Ministe
rio de Minas e Hidrocarburos.
Liquidación Impuesto Explotación
Seria recomendable estudiar fórmulas que permitan agilizar los trá-
mites y la propia operación de fiscalización sin restarla su debida
importancia.
Se ha pensado que ea podría contemplar a partir de un estudio esta-
dístico amplio una liquidación en base al paso de los lotes o sea -
bolivares por quilate sin entrar a considerar calidades.
-
En efecto ei existen 2.500 calidades de piedras, ¿porque entrar a
considerar & clasificaciones dentro del diamante de talla?, ademas
no es raro que la talla malogre la piedra por cambio de color, rotų
ra etc. quedando el concepto de calidad sin fundamento.
-
El estudio estadístico sobre un gran número de lotes con distinción
de Talla
Industrial-Ecrt, permitiría establecer 3 valores que equi
valdríchal actual 3% percibido sobre el valor del lote 6 posiblemen-
te superior al 3%.
Concretamente, suponiendo que el cuadro de producción para el año
1970 sea un cuadro standard, observamce lo siguiente (Libre Aprovecha
miento).

Ejemplo.- Valorización de la piedra al tallarla.-
:
Durante el transcurso del estudio se pudieron observar varias opera-
cicnss de avalúo efectuadas en al laboratorio da gemología del MMH -
Ciudad Bolívar, a petición de compradores interssados en conocer el
valor de una sortija personal.
->>
El 15/10/70 sa efectud la exparticia de una piedra presentada por
el Sr. Splendiani de color amarillento, con un paso dc 6,27 quilates
(peso estimado con tabla "Weight Calculator" ya que la piedra estaba
mantads en sortija).
En la operación de evalúo se toman en cuenta por orden de importan
cia:
1.- Las proporciones de la piedra tallada (lupa y microscopio)
2.- La existencia de inclusiones, carbones y accidentes dentro
de la piedra (microscopio)
3.- El color
4.- El paso
La piedra en cuestión fuß evaluada en 24.000,00 F. (de haber tenido
mejor color hubiera podido alcanza. s. 120.000,00)
En la operación de talla el rendimiento es de 50% aproximadamente, o
sea que la piedra bruta debió pesar 13 quilates aproximadamente.
El costo de la talla as 8s. 100,00 el quilate a sea que en esto caso
costó 6s. 1.300,00
Tomando en cuenta el tamaño y calidad de esta piedra, el valor en el
sitio da explotación as do Bs. 10000,00, como máximo, haciendo notar
que según la especificación del MXH en la fiscalización habría sido
evaluada en un mínimo de Bs. 4.140,50.
->
Puede apreciarse en consecuencia la valorización habida por la piedra
en el proceso de talla pasando desde aproximadamente Ss. 12.000,00
revendida por los intermediarios hasta Bs. 24.000,00 evaluación dal
gemblago.

Licencias de Compradores
En vista de qua las 2/3 partes de los compradores con licencia no cum
plan con la Ley, sería conveniente reconsiderar el modo de otorgamien
to de dichas licencias.
Ministerio de Hacienda
De acuerdo a la Lay, Artículo 144, las Administraciones de Aduana daben
enviar copia de los Manifiestos de Exportación de Diamentos al MMH. Es
to no se cumple. El 5 de Junio de 1954 mediante oficio No. 5903 MMH
pidió al Ministerio de Hacienda el cumplimiento de dicho artículo. Se-
ría conveniente reiterar la solicitud.
Control de Lotes de Diamantes en las Aduanas
Parece irrisorio que on las Aduanca de la República no se controle el
contenido de las cajitan con diamantes on bruto que se exporten, y
cuando se hace como es el caso en Ciudad Bolívar, so coloque el paque
te que puede paser bruto 100 gramos o menos sobre una balanza TOLEDO,
que sirve para pesar bultos de hesta 250 Kilos.
Se recomienda utilizar una balanza adecuada, y lacrar los paquetes p
ra evitar el cambio de su composición.

Recomendaciones de interés industrial
i
A.- Se recomienda evaluar la riqueza de los materiales ya expļotados
en los placeras de San Salvador de Paúl, con miras al aprovecha-
miento industrial del diamanta-eventualmente mediante licitación
pública-ya que ensayos privados han demostrado la posibilidad de
recuperar aproximadamente cien dólares en diamantes por metro
cúbico.
8.- Se recomienda considerar la posibilidad de aprovechar a mayor
escala, la experiencia del IVIC en materia de fabricación de cu-
chillas de diamante para microtomo; experiencia que a través de
doce años le ha válido al IVIC an el exterior un gran prestigio.

15. CIFENCE-A is currently assigned to the section of CIRAGÈ
with basic responsibility for guerrilla activity. As a result ho
is required to spend between 50 and 75 percent of his time outside,
of Caracas. While this has made him somewhat less accessible to
the Station, he in well placed to obtain advance information, with
regard to possible plans for urban violence or kidnappings, high
on thelist of Station priorities. He has contributed to two
reports during the period. A change in the Minister of Interior
has recently been announced, which could result in changes down
the level of CIFENCE-, especially should CIPENCE-1 leave his
position. In the meantime, CIFENCE-b¨ continues as a valuable
Station penetration of CIRASH.

CIFLUTE
July
Operational Report for Period XXXXXXXthrough December 1971

1972
5. CIFENCE-4 has been handled since August 1971 by Edgar B. MARTEGANI.
It was decided for security reasons to take this agent out of the goup of
agents handled by the Station Officer conducting liaison, and CIFENCE-4
is thus handled as a truly unilateral penetration of CIRASH. During the
reporting period allegations arose as to affiliation of CIFENCE-4 with
JKLANCE. (See WH/Miami 12203 and Caracas 17730). The Station is avare
of this situation and the agent is handled accordingly. CIFENCE–4
successfully passed his ump-teenth ECSWIRL examination on 3 October 1971
and the Station's opinion of this individual continues to be favorable.
(See HVCW-9612 for SCSWIRL results). As an indication of the continuing
high esteem enjoyed by CTFENCE-4 within the GOV, he was chosen by CIFENCE-1
to accompany the present Venezuelan Minister of the Interior on a month
long European vacation in September 1971. It is widely acknowledged that
the Minister of the Interior is the leading candidate for the COPEI
presidential nomination; should this occur and he be elected the next
president of Venesuela, CIFENCE-4 should have a valuable friend. In
summation, the Station continues to regard CIFENCE-4 as a valuable Station
asset who has an excellent reputation within CIRASH and the GOV. He
contributed to two intelligence reports during the reporting period, but
his value to the Station lies primarily in operational reporting and his
status as a unilateral penetration not known to be in contact with JKLANCE
in any way.

ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1. A POA was requested on Subject in January 1968 for his
use as a penetration of Venezuelan General Directorate of
Police. Cancellation was requested in February 1968 because
of indications that Subject was involved in "clandestine sabotage
activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi-
tion to CIA_Thor after, Subject was treated as a "hostile".
the ensuing months Subject was described as "an extremely
valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate
intelligence information and operational reports. Subject was
given a polygraph examination to clear up questions about pos-
sible affiliation with Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-
tion with gangster elements, etc. His responses showed no
information which would prevent CIA using him for ops purposes.
Request for POA was ‘again requested on 7 September 1968. This
POA request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being
an "agent of a foreign power."
2.
Since that time Subject has continued to provide verbal
and written information reports concerning Communist and subver-
sive elements, guerrilla activities, Soviet activities, sabotage,
etc. Subject continues to report accurately and often and has
a very pro-U.S. attitude. Subject was again polygraphed on
29 November 1971 (a copy of which is contained in Subject's
CI/OA folder). His responses indicated no deception concern-
ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA, no compromise of his
U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms
dealings, etc.

fully. Apparently Subject is unaware of any compromise of his LNLUTF
connections; has been truthful in his reports to JKLANCE; has not been
involved in any illegal arms dealings other than smuggling weapons into
IDEN A for his personal use and the personal use of other members of
IDEN D and related organizations; has not been asked to work against
LNLUTE and has received no information from or about IDEN F or IDEN G.
DETAILS:
Subject was co-operative throughout the SGSWIRL and did not
hesitate to assist in rephrasing questions and explaining his responses.
He seemed open and frank in response to all queries. Subject exhibited
a response to the question concerning IDEN F and IDEN G. Discussion
of the issue elicited the information that Subject had received some inform-
ation concerning a son of one of these individuals. He also mentioned
that on a trip to IDEN H a few years ago he had spoken by telephone to
IDEN I but no mention had been made of IDEN F or IDFN G. Subject
also showed a response to the question concerning illegal arms dealing.
He explained that when he travelled outside of the country he brought
back pistols, rifles, and on one occasion a shotgun. These weapons
were for his personal use or were purchased for friends such as IDEN E
or members of IDEN D. He stated that the weapons were brought in
illegally and that even possession of the rifles (which were for his own
use) was illegal. Specific questions concerning these arms dealings
were asked. Based on the sessions results, it appears that while Sub-
ject has smuggled arins into IDFN A and possesses illegal arms, he has
not been involved in smuggling large amounts of arms for personal profit
or engaged since May 1968 in smuggling weapons of war into IDEN A.
Specific questions utilized during the SGSWIRL were as follows:
Were you born in IDEN J? Yes
Did you reside in WOCORK? Yes.
Are you concealing the identity of anyone who knows you work for JKIANCE?
No

SUBJECT: CIFFNCF/4
29 November 1971
IRD# 72501
BACKGROUND;
Subject, CIFENCE/4, is a 43-year-old, male, citizen of IDEN A
who has been of continuing interest to JKLANCE since initial contact.
He has permanent resident alien status in WOCORK as does his wife.
He was last SGSWIRLed on 23 May 1968 with favorable results. Subject
claimed that during service with IDEN E and previous service with
JKLANCE, he had been SGSWIRLed and estimated the total number of
SGSWIRLS he has had at twelve to fifteen.
PROCEDURE:
On 3 November 1971, CIFENCE/4 was given a SGSWIRL at a covert
site in IDEN C. Both the English and Spanish languages were utilized in
discussing the SGSWIRL and the Case Officer, Edgar B. MARTEGANI,
served as interpreter. During the SGSWIRL, the English language was
used. The undersigned was introduced as Mr. Bob MOUNT from WOCORK.
PURPOSE:
The SGSWIRL was requested by Fdgar E. MARTEGANI to determine

CIFENCE-4
CIFENCE- continued to be a reliable, steady Ștation
asset who continues to be one of CIFENCE-1's closest and most
trusted associates. CIFENCE-1 has a great deal of confidence
in CIPENCE-k and always assigns him the most difficult jobs which
be feels none of his other employees can handle. During a great
deal of this reporting period, CIFEĊR-4 was out of Venesuela on
special missions for CIFENCK-1. He travelled to Lima, Peru to
send a bomb which would not explode to the home of Perez Jimenes,
went to Curacao to conduct a special investigation and spent
considerable time on the Colombian border. He contributed to two
disseminated intelligence reports dealing with military intel-
ligence about Colombian activities collected by a Venezuelan
security service and the reported presence of eleven Venezuelan
fishing boats and one varship in Colombian territorial vaters.
CIFENCE-1 has appointed CIFENCE-4 chief of the division of CIRASH
continued...
which is responsible for coordinating all of the activities of
the CIRASH offices located outside Caracas. Such a position
should offer CIFENCE-4 access to various types of information
and targets of interest to JKLANCE. As vas said in the last
CIFLUTE operational report, the Station continues to think very
highly of CIFENCE-4 and looks forward to a continuing productive
relationship with him.

recontact as described for CIHURON-1, but with entirely
different locations, will be used for emergency recontact
with CIFENCE-4. If all personal contact between CIFENCE-4
and RIJOCK is deemed unwise, another Case Officer or an
outside agent handler with proper bona fides and recognition
signals will be used to contact CIFENCE-4.

CIFENCE-4 is met clandestinely
in a Safehouse or the automobile of either CIFENCE-4 or
RIJOCK. Meetings are scheduled at previous meetings or by
use of the system described in Attachment 2 of HVCÄ-17565,
dated 21 April 1970. The only change in the system
described in Attachment 2 of IIVCA-17565 is that the word
"peluqueria" has been substituted for "the usual place".
(which means the Safehouse) and "costurera" has been sub-
stituted for "the location near my home".

CIFENCE-4 continued to be a reliable, steady Station
asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close
working relationship with CIFENCE-1. During most of the
reporting period, he was in charge of the surveillance of
the newly arrived Soviet diplomats and was quick to pass
to the Station any information coming into his possession
A which he felt would be of value to JKLANCE. Because most
of his time was devoted to coverage of the Soviets, he was
unable to give the Station the large variety and number of
reports' which in the past has been his custom. The Station
continues to think very highly of CIFENCE-4 and looks
forward to a continuing productive relationship with him.

4. CIFENCE-4
CIFENCE-4 continues to be a reliable and steady Station
asset who enjoys the confidence of and has a very close working
relationship with CIFENCE-1. His recent acquisition of Venezuelan
citizenship has increased his stature with CIFENCE-1 and among
the Venezuelans with whom he works. He continues on his own
to provide information coming into his possession which he feels
will be of interest to JKLANCE and also continues to pass to
the Station numerous reports from CIFENCE and other security-
intelligence agencies. His most valuable contribution during
this reporting period was the information indicating that a
CIFENCE officer had information which could have led to the
discovery by CIFENCE of the Station's CIGRAPE operation.
CIFENCE-4 was able to convince this officer in a very discreet,
innocuous manner that the information was of no value and should
not be brought to the attention of CIFENCE-1. The officer was
convinced, and no investigation was conducted. In the meantime,
the Station completely disbanded the CIGRAPE operation.
At .
each meeting with his Case Officer, CIFENCE-4 is asked if there
is anything new in regard to this case and he has replied there
are no new developments and feels the issue is a dead one. The
Station feels the original information from CIFENCE-4 is the
type that really proves the value of a good asset. Interesting
documents provided by CIFFENCE-4 during this reporting period
include a list of all personnel working in Venezuelan diplomatic
missions abroad, a CIFENCE report about the investigation of the
purchase of arms in Miami by unknown elements in the Venezuelan
Ministry of Defense, a package containing several documents from
CIFENCE and other sources about Communist activities in Venezuela,
a report dealing with possible conspiring against the GOV by
Venezuelan military officers, a list of various subversive
organizations located in several different countries, a report
about the possible presence in Venezuela of Colonel Caamano Deno,

a list of personnel employed by CIRASH, a key to the communications
code used by CIRASH, the CIFENCE report about the surveillance
of YEBALM during his most recent trip to Caracas and copies of
CIFENCE reports about the surveillance of the first two Soviet
diplomats now in Caracas. In addition, CIFENCE-4 has conducted
name traces and identified automobile license plates for the
Station and soon will provide unidentifiable license plates for
use by the Station on vehicles rented for surveillance and other
operational needs.
!
CIFENCE-4 is chief of the operations section of CIFENCE and,
as such, has responsibility for surveillance of Soviet and Bloc
personnel in Venezuela. Through him, the Station has the means
of monitoring quite closely the movements and activities of
these persons. Also, we are able, to direct CIFENCE-4 to conduct
special surveillances of Soviet and Bloc person who may not be
under surveillance by CIFENCE as a routine procedure. The
current position of CIFENCE-4 within CIFENCE is very good and
should remain so as long as CIFENCE-1 remains as head of CIFENCE.
CIPENCE-4 feels there is a good possiblity that if CIFENCE-1
leaves his present position he (CIFENCE-4) will be removed from
CIFENCE.. Should this happen, the Station will lose access to
an important position within CIRENCE and CIFENCE-4 will lose his
principal source of income. CIFENCE-4 has said several times
he would like to have a career with JKLANCE and would be willing
to work in any country of the world for us. If CIFENCE-4
eventually loses his position within CIFENCE and is unable to
obtain another position in Venezuela that would provide access
of interest to JKLANCE, Headquarters may wish to consider using
him in some other country.

Paragraphs 2 and 3 below
1. I appreciate Caracas' offer for possible future contact
with "CIFENCE-4 in the event of another emergency situation in
Trinidad, a possibility which should not be totally ruled out.
I was aware that four or five Venezuelan officials had arrived
in Port of Spain shortly after the declaration of a state of
emergency, but I had no contact with any of these individuals
during their stay here.
2. I agree with CIFENCE-4 that it would have been to the
station's advantage to have had contact with him during the
period of the Regiment mutiny. To this end, I propose the
following contact arrangements. When CIFENCE-4 has arrived in
Port of Spain and has gotten himself set up, he should call
Identity A on Identity B during normal office hours (0800-1700).
One hour after telephonic contact has been made with Identity A,
In

order to establish bona fides, the case officer will ask of
CIFENCE—4" "Are you a friend of Pedro's?". CIFENCE-4 should
respond "Yes, and of Tomas also.". Recognition signals having
been exchanged and authenticated, I would feel free to ask
CIFENCE-4 to keep me informed of developments from his side as
they occurred.
3. Please provide a physical description of CIFENCE-4.

1. CIFENCE (IDENTITY under separate cover for Port of Spain), an

22 April 1970 and 24 April - 3 May 1970. CIFKNCK-↳ said the purpose
trip vas to protect Venesuelans in Trinidad and to collect informs –
tion about the situation in Trinidad for the Government of Venezuela. He
gave the Caracas Station a copy of the report he prepared for the Venezuelan
Goverment about his activities in Trinidad. A copy of this report is
being sent under separate cover to Part of Spain for the information of
the Station only.
2. CIFENCE-4 said it was too bad he had no contact with JKIANCE
while in Trinidad, as he feels he could have provided timely on-the-spot
information. If a situation in Trinidad similar to the previous one

happens, he is willing to have contact with JKIANCE if so desired. The
Port of Spain Station is requested to advise the Caracas Station if this
contact would be desired and, if so, to sand Caracas a contact plan.
Upon receipt of this plan, Caracas will advise the name and recognition
signal CIFENCE-4 will use. CIFENCE-4 speaks fairly good English, so there
should be no language barrier in communicating with him.

CIFENCE-4's current Case Officer is Gordon K. RIJOCK
who meets with CIFENCS-4 in safehouse number 45 which was obtained
during this reporting period. When RIJOCK wants to schedule a
meeting with CIFENCE-4, RIJCCK's wife who speaks native Spanish
with no American accent, telephones CIFENCE-4's home, identifies
herself as "Maria" and asks to speak with the true first name of
CIFENCE-4. If CIFENCE-4 is at home, RIJOCK's wife tells him
she wants to meet with him at a certain time on a certain date
at 'the usual place" (which means the safehouse) and asks if
the time and date are acceptable to him. If CIFENCE-4 says
yes, RIJOCK meets with him at the sifehouse. If he says no,
RIJOCK's wife asks him to set a time and date. If these are
acceptable to RIJOCK, the meeting is thereby scheduled and
held. IF RIJOCK Wants CIFENCE-4 to pick him up in his auto-
mobile, "Maria" says she wants to meet him at a certain time
on a certain date "at the location near my home" If the time
and duto are acceptable to CIFENCE-4, RIJOCK then walks to a
site a few blocks from his home where CIFENCE-4 picks him up
in his private automobile. If the time and date are not
acceptable to CIFENCE-4, then "Maria" asks CIFENCE-4 to set
a new time and date which, if acceptable to RIJOCK, serve as
the schedule for the cur pickup meeting. If CIFENCE-4 is not
home, "Muria" requests that CIVENCE-4 telephone "Maria" a's
soon as possible. Upon returning to his home and receiving
the message, CIFENCE-4 telephones RIJOCK's home from a public
telephone, identifies himself as "Mul" and asks to speak to
"Roberto". If RIJOCK is home, he and CIFENCE-4 talk directly
and arrange a meeting. If RIJOCK is not home, CIFENCE-4 says
"Raul" is calling and either he wants "Roberto" to contact him
or he will call "Roberto" later. If the message is for "Roberto"
to call him, then "Maria" telephones CIFENCE-4's home and follows
the procedure described above. (NOTE: RIJOCK's wife makes all
telephonic contact with CIFENCE-4's home, to give the impression
to anyone monitoring CIPENCE-4's telephone that a native Spanish
speaking "girlfriend" of CIFENCE-4 wants to talk with him.
In the event RIJOCK wishes to contact CIFENCE-4 while he
is in his office, "Maria" telephones CIFENCE-4's wife, identifies
herself as "Maria", says she wishes to speak with the true name
of CIFENCE-4 and asks his wife to tell him to call her at a
certain time. CIFENCE_4's wife then telephones him in his office
and gives him the message from "Maria". If the time is acceptable
to CIFENCE-4, he telephones RIJOCK's home from a public telephone
and either arranges a meeting schedule with "Maria" (per prior
instructions from RIJCCK) or speaks directly with RIJOCK to

SUBJECT:
Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles (A 12 419 708)
DATE: 24 April 1970
1. Reference is made to previous correspondence concerning
this case.
2. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, by letter
dated 16 April 1970, has granted the benefits of Section 316(b) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act to cover the subject's absence
from the United States from 20 March 1970, to an indefinite period,
thereafter, and so long as he remains absent on behalf of the United
States Government, with the understanding that he will prove to the
satisfaction of the Naturalization Court when he files a Petition for
United States Citizenship, five years after entry for permanent
residence, that he has been absent during this period for that pur-
pose. The benefits of this Section of the Act also permit subject
to count the period of his absence toward both the residence and
physical presence requirements for naturalization, provided that,
since becoming a permanent resident of the United States and be-
fore applying for naturalization, he has completed an uninterrupted
period of one year of physical presence in the United States.
3. The letter is being retained in the files of this Office and it
is requested you so advise Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles.

operations smoother. Unfortunately, CINTURON-l's men are
already planning a roarguard action to make CIFENCE-3's job
as difficult as possible. The net result of this switch,
however, has been to somewhat increase officiency of the two
services and to materially increase JKLANCE unilateral access
to each. For awhile, this reorganization will be beneficial,
but-because of the personalities of CIRASH-17 and CÍFENCE-1-
we do not expect either CIHURON-1 or CIFENCE-3 to indefinitely
have smooth sailing.
CIFENCE 4.
CIFENCE 4
provided verbal and written information reports
about various subjects of interest such as activities of
Communist and other subversive elements, guerrilla activities,
counterfeiting of money and documents, sabotage, information
about and activities of Soviets visiting Venezuela, kidnappings
of well-known persons in Venezuela, CIFENCE operations and
internal problems of CIFENCE. His position in CIFENCE as
Chief of Operations provides him access to practically all
written reports and documents prepared and received by CIFENCE.
His daring as a dedicated agent for JKLANCE has enabled him to
provide the Station with copies of several of these reports and
documents. During this reporting period he has provided 119
copies of such reports and documents
Some of the more significant requests levied on CIFENCE–4
during this reporting period include the following: 1) 888888-
ment for the Station's SB Section of an employee of the Venezuelan
Government's Oficina Central de Informaciones (OCI), 2) for the
SB and CP Sections of the Station, collection of information
about and assessment of a former employes of the local TASS
office in Caracas, 3) provision for the SB Section of a list
of the names and license plate numbers of the users of all
diplomatic automobile license plates in Venezuela, 4) investi-
gation for the Station's CP Section of the robbery of a large
sum of money reportedly destined for financing the clandestine
manufacture of arms, and 5) for the Station's Case Officer in
charge of student operations, collection of information about
and assessment of a former Station asset in whom there is a
renewed operational interest.

arrange a meeting. If the time is not accept able to CIFENCE-4, .
he gives a new time to his wife who immediately thereafter.
conveys the new time via telephone to "Maria" who in turn
conveys it to RIJOG. If CIFENCE-4 is not in his office,
his wife leaves message for him to call her as soon as
possible. In such case, his wife advises "Maria" that
he is not in his office but when he calls her, she will tell
him to call "Maris" as soon as possible. A meeting is
scheduled when CIFENCE-4 calls and telks to either "Maria"
or RIJOCK. If it is urgent for RIJOCK to talk to CIFENCE—4
as soon as possible, CIFENCE-4's wife tells CIFENCE-4 that
"Maria" wants to speak to him as soon as possible.
If an
emergency situation necessitated immediate contact with
CIFENCE-4 in his office and his wife was not available to
telephone him, "Maria" would telephone him in his office.
I
In the event RIJOCK and/or CIFENCE-4 do not want to
meet in the safehouse and do not want a car pickup at the
site agreed upon, a new site is agreed upon during the course
of the telephonic contacts described above. For future use,
CIFENCE-4 and RIJOCK will make a list of primary and alternate
meeting sites and assign numbers to each site selected. During
telephonic contacts to establish meetings, only numbers will
be used to designate the location of the meetings.
CIFENCE-4 and RIJOCK will discuss and prepare plans for
contact under emergency/contingency conditions and for emergency
re-contact. These plans will be forwarded to Headquarters
as soon as they have been prepared.
SRAC is not used or contemplated for contacts with
CIFERNICE-4.

Passport" and would not consider it acceptable in any event
without U.S. visa. Mentioned that it presumed that CIFENCE-4
and family have been out of U.S. longer than one year and
therefore will be probably questioned by INS/Miami. WH/Miami
has contacted INS Inspector in Miami who will handle case
discreetly if complications arise after couple enters U.S..
**Reported no problems foreseen when CIFENCE-4 and family enter
U.S. and replied to questions from WH/Miami on how couple is
to fill out their requests for U.S. reentry permits and

Subject provided detailed information on the GOV
guerrilla "pacification" program which became the
basis of an intelligence dissemination on the
subject. He continues to keep the Station abreast
of all CIVISTA activities together with CIVISTA-5's
personal feelings regarding his liaison with the
Station. AMCLEVE-15 is now chief of CIVISTA's
investigative group; as such, it is expected that
he will provide an excellent source of information
on coup planning within the military.

MOC reflecting a raise in salary from Bs. 1,000 to Bs. 1,500

1. The attached outline was taken from a confessed
guerrilla, recently arrested by CIRASH in the city of
Barquisimeto, Venezuela. When interrogated by AMCLEVE-15
and others, the arrestee said he did not know where the
outline came from; what language it was in; and, in fact,
said it did not belong to him.
2. Various Station officers and assets have studied
the outline, and the consensus of opinion is that it is
probably Turkish or a middle-eastern language.
3. It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate offices in an attempt to ascertain what language
the outline is written in, together with a translation of
its contents. Although Station personnel contacted felt
it unlikely, the possibility exists that the outline is in
code.

operational information as a description of the capabilities,
layout and equipment of DIGEPOL telephone tap operations.
Included in this information was his report that at least on
papër, the U.8. Embassy was a target for tap operations. He
has also reported on the personalities and workings of the
organizations with which he is associated. At the same time
the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved
in a

hye to obtain curare poison for approximately forty
J
hypodermic needles. To avoid exposing the source of their
information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the
matter. The Station said that they disapproved of his involve-
ment is wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restric-
tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing
this involvement with him.
Th
In May 1968; the Station informed Headquarters that
they believed that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,
further, they believed that he would not expose, inform, or
work against CIA. They added that Subject was still capable of
engaging in independent Cuban exile activity without informing
his Case Officer. The Station also requested a polygraph exam-
ination for Subject.
-
6. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve
specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban
Intelligence through relatives, unreported association with
gangster elements, thefts from CIA and other questions
Involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject's
responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners,
appear to contain no information which would prevent CIA's
operational use of Subject. On only one question, that involv-
ing. Subject's association with an alleged racketeer, Lefty Rosenthal,
did sensitivity persist. The examiner commented, "...Ir fairness
to Subject this sensitivity is believed generated by genuine un-
certainty over the amount of Para military items which he had
been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile
arms supplies."
6. Station Caracas has requested that they be allowed to
cease treating AMCLEVE-15 as a "hostile" and that the restrictions
cited in Paragraph one, above, be lifted to permit more effective
utilization of this well-placed penetration agent. WH Division
concurs in this request. CI/OPS concurrence is requested in
authorizing full operational use of AMCLEVE-15 as a penetration
agent into the Venezuelan General Directorate of Police (DIGEPOL)
and as a penetration of Remberto UZCATEGUI's Special Group
within DIGEPOL.

Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile."
The Station was advised that they could maintain contact with
Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL

2. The Station acknowledged their instructions but

3. In the ensuing months the Station came to describe
Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the

For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan
military in a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba . And, he also
reported on a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

1. Attached are four copies of Subject's NOC.
2.
As the Desk is aware, the last word from Headquarters was
that AMCLEVE-15 was to be treated as a "hostile" and that full
clearance was being withheld pending his SGSWIRL. He has now been
SGSWIRLed, and to the Station's howledge, the test was favorable
although an official Headquarters: port has not been received. A
PRO Part I was submitted on Subject on 29 May 1968. Therefore, it
would be appreciated if the Desk would contact the appropriate
Headquarters officials and advise the Station of AMCLEVE–15'8_
official status. We assume that he will be fully cleared and that
a POA will be issued followed by an OA after the Station submits
PRQ Part II.
3. Headquarters recently inquired as to Station thoughts on
including AMCLEVE-15 in the CIFLUTE Project rather than making
AMCLEVE a separate project. The Station is completely in accord
with this idea although it will probably necessitate funds being
shifted from CIGUSTY to CIFLUNE. However, a separate dispatch will
be prepared on this subject.
4. The Station realizes that ANCLEVE-15's clearance has been
a thorny problem to the Deak and hopes that we can now clear it up
once and for all.

IMPLEMENT ITS PREVIOUS PLAN TO MONITOR THROUGH A SENSITIVE
TECHNICAL OPERATION- THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION
TO THE BORDER, NEGOTIATIONS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN ROME, ITALY,
ON 19 MARCH 1973. THE VENEZUELAN 14-MAN GROUP FROM THE
DIRECTORATE OF THE SERVICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND PREVENTION
(DISIP), WHICH WILL ACCOMPANY THE VENEZUELAN DELEGATION TO THE
TALKS, WILL LIMIT ITS ACTIVITIES TO THE PHYSICAL AND
ELECTRONIC SECURITY OF THE VENEZUELAN CONTINGENT. SHOULD
THE OPPORTUNITY ARISE TO USE SECURELY A TECHNICAL OPERATION
TO MONITOR THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION, ANOTHER DISIP TEAM of
FROM FOUR TO SEVEN VENEZUÉLÁNS WILL BE SENT TO HANDLE THIS.
(SOURCE COMMENT: BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT A VENEZUELAN
FOREIGN MINISTRY COLDE OFFICER PASSED INFORMATION TO THE
COLOMBIANS BASED ON THE VENEZUELAN TECHNICAL OPERATION TARGETTED
AGAINST THE COLOMBIAN DELEGATION AT THE LAST ROUND OF TALKS,
THE VENEZUELANS FEAR THAT THE COLOMBIANS WILL BE EXPECTING
A SIMILAR OPERATION AND MAY TRY TO RECIPROCATE BY MONITORING
THE VENEZUELAN DELEGATION. FOR THIS REASON, THE VENEZUELANS
HAVE DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT COUNTER-ESPIONAGE RATHER THAN
ESPIONAGE OPERATIONS DURING THIS SERIES OF TALKS. ALSO,

18. WKSCARLET-3:
During this reporting period WKSCARLET-3 produced
eleven disseminations and contributed to four others. As a chief of one
of the operations sections of his service, it appeared that he would
continue to have excellent access. However, in December WKSCARLET-1
reorganized his service, and ostensibly reduced our agent's area of respon-
sibility and access. WKSCARLET-3 was slightly depressed at this occurrence
as he believed, and rightly so, that he had not merited this reduction.
After the holidays, however, it became apparent that WKSCARLET-1 would
continue to use WKSCARLET-3 in special operations and that the reduction in
responsibility was solely to take WKSCARLET-3 out of the limelight.
Thus,
our agent is still able to report on the sensitive operations of his ser-
vice. As a result of this and his past performance, WKSCARLET-3 was given
a salary increase beginning January 1973.

Although KSCARLET-3 continued his fine production during
this time period, it was !HABYSS activity which produced the real interest.
Through other cables and dispatches we have reported his involvement in this
irregular activity, which if proved true will end in his termination as a
BKHERALD asset. At the present time WKSCARLET-3 is the security team leader
for the Venezuelan delegation to the Gulf of Maracaibo talks presently
being held in Rome: It is planned that soon after he returns, and if we
have sufficient hard facts, we will confront our agent in an attempt to
clarify his :GIABYSS connection.

FIELD NO. live-0525
1972)
An experienced police investigator whose position gives him
access to information on matters affecting the internal
security of Venezuela. He reports without the knowledge of
his superiors. His information has been frequently con-
firmed by independent sources. He provided a copy of the
reorganization document.
1. On 8 December 1972 the Directorate of the Service
of Intelligence and Prevention (DISIP) was reorganized by its
Director, Dr. Remberto Uzcategui Bruzuali.
(Source Comment: Uzcategui believes
DISIP will be in line for criticism during the election year
of 1973 and he wants to remove from positions of responsibility
any of his controversial section leads.) The gist of the
document issued by Uzcategui reorganizing DISIP follows.
2.
The Director of DISIP sets the general policy based
on instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and has
ultimate control of the Services. The Deputy Director assists
him in carrying out these responsibilities and substitutes
for the Director during his absence. As its supervisory and
fiscal units, DISIP has an Inspector General of Services who
has the responsibility of disciplining personnel and investi-
gating employees, and an internal comptroller who verifies
the administration of the Services.
3. The following are the DISIP executive positions:
a. Secretary General of Services, which has been
Dominguez.

STATUS OF PROJECT AGENTS:
13. This period showed that while WKBCARLET-3 does have a highly
responsible position within his organizablon, he still is being ordered to do
special assignments by the chief of the service. These assignments usually
involve out-of-town travel and/or long and unusual working hours.
This pre-
cludes regular scheduled meetings; however, the agent is contacted on the
average of once a week. WKSCARLET-3, along with his normal routine duties,
vas involved in a number of varied activities during the reporting period
which he dụly reported to the Station. He continues to investigate all
possible leads in the kidnapping case of Carlos Domingues. In August he led
a small team to Cucuta, Colombia where they uncovered and destroyed a small
printing shop which vas engaged in the fabrication of false Venesuelan identity
cards. He continues the investigation of the activities of Sergio Pineda Ruíz,
the Prensa Latina chief in Caracas. The problem of agent/case officer
communications has been somewhat alleviated. The agent now contacts the case
officer at the latter's home during the evening hours. This doesn't obviate
the need for an RS-708 system, but until the details for a concealment device
that will be appropriate for WKSCARLET-3's rather spartan office are worked
out, phone contact is necessary. During the reporting period WKSCARLET-3
produced three disseminations and contributed to one other.

:
.11. In mid-April CIFENCE-k was placed in charge of yet another of
the CIRACH divisions, with added responsibility and importance. This change
has allowed him more time in Carseas, and reflects a continually improving
position vis-a-vis CIFENCE-1, the CIRASH Mrector. This coupled with what
now appears the likelihood that CIFENCE-1 will retain this present position
until the government changes in early 1974, makes the longevity of CIFENCE–4
with CIRASH somewhat more certain. As part of his new responsibilities,
CIFENĊE-4 has initiated an extensive investigation of Prensa Latina and its
Caracas Director, Sergio Piñeda Puis. This operation was interrupted in early
June by the kidnapping of Venezuelan industrialist Carlos Domingues, with
CIFENCE 4 being placed in charge of the CIRASH investigation of the as yet
unresolved case. As of this writing, CIFENCE-4 has been devoting all of his
time to this kidnapping ease, to the detriment of other operations. Because
of the unpredictable work schedule of CIFENCE-h and the security precautions
observed by the Station in contacting him, operational communication has
been less efficient than desirable during the reporting period, while
security has been maintained. The arrangements have been revieved and improved,
but the Station is looking for a more satisfactory system. The Station
tentatively plans to request an RS-708 system for this agent in the
near future. CIFENCE-à contributed to tvo reports during the April
through June quarter.
