Chairman, QSI Honor and Merit Award Panel
Request for QSI:
William M. Kent, GS-14
I
1. It is recommended that Mr. William M. Kent be
granted a Quality Step Increase in recognition of his out-
standing performance as Chief of the SA Section and Acting
Deputy Branch Chief of WH/6 during the tension-filled days
which preceded and followed the Chilean military coup of
11 September 1973. The nature of Mr. Kent's service to the
Agency during this period has been described more fully in
his most recent fitness report, which evaluated his overall
performance as "Outstanding.
2. Mr. Kent served as Acting Deputy Branch Chief of
WH/6 for five months, from mid-June to mid-November 1973,
while concurrently continuing to direct the large and im-
portant Chilean covert action program with exceptional
competence. Mr. Kent thus was handling two exacting jobs
simultaneously during the entire coup period. This was a
time of particular tension for the Branch, since developments
in Chile were of international importance and generated almost
daily requests for special papers and briefings for top U.S.
Government leaders. Mr. Kent performed at a consistently
high level in both his SA and managerial capacities: his
propaganda and political action guidance was timely, imagina-
tive and effective, while his managerial decisions as pro-
visional head of a 15-man branch reflected sound judgment
and an across-the-board foundation in clandestine operations.

3. A self-reliant and exceptionally talented SA officer,
Mr. Kent was personally responsible for the creation and
implementation of two successful Division programs
the political action and one in the propaganda field which
have made an important contribution to the achievement of
U.S. policy objectives with regard to Chile. These programs
are being continued even though Mr. Kent has now left the
Branch to handle an exacting new staff assignment.

Commendation
Mr. William Kent
i
1. Mr. Kent was assigned to a high priority
Task Force in WH Division from 21 September through
30 October.
2. During this period Mr. Kent assisted in the
preparation of propaganda material and was in charge
of black operations. Based on his knowledge of the Cuban
Intelligence Service and Cuban modus operandi, Mr. Kent
prepared several highly imaginative black operations and
provided much needed advice to the Task Force on this
subject. The biographic material he pulled together on
a major proponent of our little drama was of exceptional
value and was delivered to several U. S. as well as
foreign newsmen who made extensive use of it. Mr. Kent
is a well trained and resourceful Clandestine Service
Operator whose work showed the stamp of professionalism
and whose attitude was marked by a deep interest in his
work. Mr. Kent is to be commended for his efforts on the
behalf of the Task Force and for the unusual talent he
brought to the job.
3. A copy of this commendation will be placed
in Mr. Kent's personnel file.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Commendation of Mr. William Kent
th..
During the last five months I have turned to Mr. Kent
on two occasions to help the Latin America Division in
connection with Senate Select Committee's investigation
of covert action in Chile. When confronted with a need
to produce a paper on Chile in a short timeframe, I
instinctively turned to him. It was not only because he
had expertise on Chile, due to service in the Chile Branch,
but because he is highly skilled in written presentation.
He organizes his material well and presents it in a lucid,
highly readable manner. On the first occasion, he helped
us prepare a paper that was eventually used by the Director
in his presentation before the Senate Select Committee on
14-15 July. On the second occasion his contribution was
used by the DDO in his appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers were
excellent and have withstoood critical scrutiny.
Aside from Mr. Keng's ability to write I would like
to take this occasion to record my overall high esteem
for Mr. Kent as a professional and as a person. I have
always considered him to be one of our more able and pro-
mising officers. His dedication is exemplary; he has spent
untold extra hours of his time carrying out his duties.
has good judgment and common sense.
Ha
Mr. Kent has a very
attractive personality and excellent personal presence.
From all standpoints he is an excellent officer that deserves
to move ahead in the organization. I am convinced he has the
ability and potential to do s0.

Subject is a bright young officer who has made an outstanding contribution
to the operations of the Station since his arrival on duty. He is unusually
well motivated and energetic in his work. He has shown a high degree of
imagination and intelligence in his direction of KUCAGE operations. He has
handled his agents and other contacts in an exemplary fashion.
The only factor that has had to be discussed with Subject is his need
for greater patience, tact and understanding in his dealings with fellow
workers.
Subject has great potential which should not necessarily be limited to
KUCAGE type activities. His abilities and attributes are of equal value to
KUTUBE operations.

Clandestine Service, one of my prime responsibilities is to try to
reestablish the integrity of the current letter evaluations used in
fitness reports and one of the first places for me to start is in my
own Staff.
With that said, I do wish to underscore the fact that Mr. Kent
is a responsible and responsive professional who knows what he has
to do, does it with a minimum of fuss, writes clearly and to the point,
is dedicated and in my judgment fully warrants an overall evaluation
of strong. The above comments will be shown to the rater as well

Section F 3.
I agree with the rating officer that the subject has a
great deal of enthusiasm and interest in his job and in many
aspects performs his duties in a highly professional manner.
I do not, however, for reasons stated below, believe that
his over all rating should be higher than 4+.
While it is true that he demonstrates considerable
imagination and energy, he is headstrong and develops
prejudices that prevent him on occasions from being objective
in handling operations. This in my opinion is due to his
youth and lack of experience in dealing with a particular
situation of the kind with which he is now faced. This is
by no means meant to be a reflection on his qualifications
or future potential.
I emphatically disagree with the last sentence of Section
E for the reasons set out above. He should not be, at the
present time, given greater individual responsibility but
rather should be subject to close, strong supervision of a
senior officer.

Subject has a unique flair for planning and conducting political
action operations. His previous field experience in dealing with Latin
American political action agents and his facility Rob the Spanish
language have made him an unusually strong ass in the conduct of
current operations in the Dominican Republic. His personality and
background enable him to establish rapport with foreign nationals with
remarkable ease. He uses imagination in developing new operations and
is aggressive in follow-up procedures. He is well qualified for a
Headquarters position which would give him greater individual
responsibility.

languages (Spanish and Italian), and his admirable command of English
prose which enables him to write crisp operational communications
with speed and precision, all aid him in carrying out his responsibilities
in a superior manner.
Subject does not become a victim of routine. In addition to
developing the effective referrals system noted above, he has also
on his own initiative created our own "skills bank" in which we are
able to locate suitable NOC candidates, and those on board, in terms
of needed professional or area experience, rare and esoteric language
skills, etc. to the point that we can supply "leads" to divisions
in a matter of minutes. (Several hundred NOC applicants and on-board
personnel have thus been listed by skills bank criteria.)
Subject constantly seeks to make the NOC Branch a more meaningful
and useful management tool. I find him a thoughtful and canny colleague,
careful to observe in full the regulatory limits of our activity but
quick to perceive opportunities to support and assist the divisions
within those limits. He is a firm, fair, no-nonsense supervisor of
Branch personnel. He speaks his mind, honestly but tactfully, when
differences occur between him and me. It is my conviction that he is
ready to enter into the upper reaches of staff and supervisory echelons
of the Directorate and has by now proven that he is as adept at staff
responsibilities as he was previously impressive in his field and
desk operational responsibilities. In short, a comer and a cherished
colleague.

Mr. Kent's greatest strengths are 128,6nalytical mind, skillful
handling of agent personnel, fluency in languages, intimate background
knowledge of targets and assets, strong loyalty up and down, good sense
of humor. He has the ambition to go on to jobs calling for greater
responsibility, and he has amply demonstrated his readiness to move on
to such jobs.
On occasion he may forget that good staff work includes not only
defining problems but recommending sound solutions as well. This is only
a transitory weakness that will be corrected by more experience and
training.
The undersigned would be happy to have Mr. Kent as a colleague
during any future assignment.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if
applicable.
During the approximately six months of Mr. Kent's association
with WH/5, the Branch CA effort was almost exclusively concentrated
on a special operation with which Mr. Kent was not directly concerned.
His assigned task was to act as Headquarters case officer for those
CA projects not directly involved in the special project and for
peripheral aspects of some which were. He performed his assigned
duties competently and demonstrated that in the graphic aspects of
CA work he has few peers.
At the same time, Mr. Kent did not show any large measure of
initiative in developing those projects assigned to him, and seened
to treat his assignment as a temporary one (as indeed it turned out
to be) to which he was not fully committed and in which he was not
overly interested.
Mr. Kent is a pleasant and cooperative officer who doubtless
can perform capably in a position with supervisory responsibilities,
although his duties with WH/5 gave him no opportunity to demonstrate
his competence in this area.

Mr. Kent has been under my supervision and has occupied his present position
of responsibility for propaganda matters for less than four months, but in that
time has demonstrated an unusual ability to provide native, timely and useful
propaganda guidances for covert field use. He is very sensitive and perceptive
to the capabilities and limitations of WHD media operations and exploits their
possibilities to the maximum. He has been particularly effective in the exploita-
tion of leads provided by KUTUBE sources as the basis for "black" operations.
In this regard he has shown great initiative, imagination and professional ability.
Kent regularly makes sound suggestions for increasing the effectiveness and
security of WHD media operations, and with more time on the job, and an increased
knowledge of specific country operations, he should further improve his ability
to assess and review WHD projects.
This officer is admirably suited for his present assignment; he is creative
and an industrious worker, producing quickly and with a minimum of supervision;
his guidances are well written and easily understood; and he has sole responsibility
for his functional duties as part of a small three-man staff team.

Mr. Kent has sustained the same high degree of competence, imagina-
tion and conscientious application to his duties noted in the last fit-
ness report. He is unusually well qualified for his present job by
reason of experience, knowledge and sensitivity to the Latin American
culture and mentality. Although he is a person of strong convictions,
not always tactfully expressed, it is to his credit that he has adapted
to the role of a staff officer with admirable self-restraint and self-
discipline.
Were it not for the fact that Mr. Kent cannot accept a permanent
overseas assignment at this time for family medical reasons, he should
now be considered for assignment to a senior position at a country desk
preparatory to a Field Station assignment. Under these circumstances,
Mr. Kent is making a valuable, perhaps even indispensable, contribution
to the covert action mission of WHD and should remain in his present
position for the immediate future.

Mr. Kent is indeed a professional in his field an expert in
propaganda operations which require area knowledge, technical
know-how, and imagination. In a specialty where it is only too
easy to go off the deep end, Mr. Kent has always kept his wits
about him and avoided parochialism. He is a lucid writer who
focusses on the essential. By nature, Mr. Kent is an impatient man
who has certain biases which sometimes get into the way of his
operational judgements. He is keenly aware of this and his efforts
to remain as "uninvolved" as possible are commendable. In summery,
Mr. Kent is a "doer" who in his field contributes much.
Mr. Kent has no supervisery duties to perform. He is highly

In February 1976 00 ollowing the emergency hospitalization and
retirement of my deputy, Subject became my new deputy, a position he
has filled since that time in addition to performing most of the
assignments he had been tasked with earlier. His undiminished energy
and enthusiasm for his work is a hall-mark of his performance since
that time. Subject has, on his own initiative, developed our referrals

specific area priority needs) to a point where it is serving the entire
Directorate with distinction and precision, especially in the "crisis"
areas of NOC needs, such as Africa and Near East Divisions.

I became C/CMS on 1 October 1976 and thus my comments must be restricted

narrative comments but do challenge the letter evaluations. While Mr. Kent's
performance has been strong and he has amply demonstrated he is a GS-15 level
officer capable of assuming greater responsibilities, I cannot concur that his
performance "is so exceptional to requirements of the work and in comparison of
others doing similar work as to warrant special recognition". On purely technical
grounds there is no other officer serving as DC/CMS/NOC and thus the comparison
is invalid. Secondly, as Chief, Career Management Staff and administrator of the

There is but little which can be added to the comments made in
the fitness report covering the period 1 January to 3 December 1965;
Mr. Kent is an excellent officer in his specialty; he holds strong
opinions on certain issues, but - over the years has learned to
bend. His projected non-official cover assignment will utilize
his talents for dealing with Latin Americans and for translating
ideas and concepts into meaningful action. We wish him well.

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)
Subject devised a first-class cover relationship with the
priority (REDTOP) target of this Base. For a period the relation-
ship was close, and in our judgment it was wholly unsuspicious
because Subject made it seen so natural. This was a very delicate
operation which Subject handled with distinction.
Personal characteristics of this officer which should not
be overlooked in this review are loyalty, responsiveness, willing-
ness to accept any direction.
In conclusion I want to emphasize my conviction that this
officer's assignments should be limited to the area for which
he was trained and in which he feels confident: Latin America.
This officer is reasonably cost-conscious. I have had no
opportunity to serve his capability for supervising other case
officers.

the period under review he was diverted from Latin-American affairs
toward a variety of higher priority targets.
This re-orientation
was not uniformly successful, and should not be continued, because
Subject seems to have no natural interest in foreign nationals (with
the apparent exception of Latin Americans) and in most foreign affairs
(with the exception of Latin American affairs).
Subject's strongest characteristic is his ability to live and
to utilize his commercial cover. He showed great aptitude and
commendable imagination in devising new modes of commercial access
to foreign nationals residing in Washington. For example his use
of his cover was the matrix of several successful recruitments for
which other case officers received the ultimate credit, even though
the recruitments were based on this officer's discovery of the
potential agents and his initial development of them before they
were transferred. Conversely, when Subject retained the contacts
through the development phase, the contacts languished.

Base, he has made no recruitments of foreign targets. His propensity
for living his cover was so strong that it suggests his future operational
utilization in the field should be in spotting and assessing rather than
recruiting.

policy, CCS will not okay engaging in recruitment activities
people who are under cover of legitimate firms (such as my
cover firm, WWIS). The risk, he said, is too great, adding
that where recruitment responsibilities are envisaged, a
devised facility cover rather than that of a real firm, is
provided. He suggested that I call Mr. Will Burke, current
Chief of the Corporate Cover Branch in CCS, for further de-
tails and confirmation.
5. I spoke with Mr. Burke on the morning of 29 June.
In essence, he said the same thing that Biladeaux had said,
allowing that there are occasional exceptions such as an
instance where an officer assigned abroad might use an alias,
or on the rare occasion where a person might, in effect, re-
cruit himself. With specific reference to WWIS, when I had
that cover recruitment activity was precluded.

REVIEWING OFFICIAL'S COMMENTS:
I concur generally in this evaluation. Subject is always on the
look-out for new leads. While in general this is commendable, it
should be noted that his assessments are not in depth. It would be
preferable if he concentrated on a few good prospects, leading to
a solid recruitment, rather than enlarging numerically his stable of
contacts.

August 1966. In
Subject has been under the supervision of Branch 6
August Subject was transferred PCS to New Orleans where he was responsible
for all aspects of the operation of proprietary foundation JMCLIPPER. During
the reporting period, he has consistently demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm
and operational initiative. Although operating under instructions not to expand
foundation activities too rapidly, he has not waited for an official "go-ahead"
but has shown unflagging energy in planning operations for the period when
JMCLIPPER could expand activities. He has shown an unusually keen perception
of areas of CA ope rational needs and of imaginative thinking on how to fill these
needs.
Subject has shown himself fully capable of exercising the self-disciplined and
self-motivation necessary in an unofficial cover position. His proficiency in
Spanish has been useful in meeting and entertaining Latin American travelers of
potential operational interest passing through his city. He has handled his.
cover situation well. The cover office has been well run with no significant
financial, administrative, or personnel problems having arisen during the period.
Subject has exhibited an above-average cost consciousness.

1. During the early days of my assignment to DO/Washington
Base, the matter of my cover was discussed a number of times
with DO Personnel and CCS. Eventually, CCS came up with World
Wide Information Services, Inc., of New York, as a legitimate
firm which would provide me with the needed cover. It came
out loud and clear during the discussions that this cover
would allow me to spot, assess and develop targets of interest,
and would allow me to handle recruited agents, but, because
of the high risk involved in the use of a legitimate firm for
cover purposes, I was not to engage in recruitments.
2. Despite its one limitation, the cover was ideal.
Among other things, I:
a.
Handled a recruited Venezuelan agent assigned
to the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington;
b. Handled a recruited code clerk assigned to one
of the embassies in Washington;
c. Contacted and assessed a high official of the
Soviet Embassy, made arrangements to have him met by
another Base Case Officer under alias who continued
the development which eventually was to lead to a re-
cruitment pitch%3B

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Mr. William M. Kent, Period: 1 January 20 May 1977
-
1. As I depart from the assignment as Chief, Non-
official Cover Branch, Career Management Staff, I should
like to make a final comment on the performance of Mr. Kent
who has served with me during the entire period of my
assignment and who, since March 1976, has been my deputy.
More specifically, the period since 1 January 1977 has been
a trying one for this component and has culminated with its
sudden transfer from one component (CMS) to another (ADDO/D).
2. During this most recent period, Mr. Kent has
demonstrated his capacity for growth and leadership. He has
himself handled virtually all of the transition aspects for
the Branch, involving briefings and counsel for his new
overall chief (the ADDC/D) and for his new branch chief.
He has served in the past 30 days substantially as acting
branch chief, given my fairly lengthy TDY absence abroad
during that period. I can only reiterate my judgment in the
last fitness report that Kent is a senior and mature supervisory
officer, very well organized in his work habits and capable
of making measured judgments and decisions. His continuity
in all aspects of nonofficial cover and its ramifications makes
him a valued and valuable staff officer. I would say his
future contribution lies in the entire area of managing and
guiding Directorate personnel.
I have noted the clear progress
he has made in the past year in taking supervisory decisions
involving personnel, firmly and crisply.
3. Given his impressive field and Headquarters experience,
Kent should be given an opportunity to display his worth in
future Directorate assignments involving discretion,
professionalism and maturity. I give him an unquestioned "Strong"
for this final period he has served with me.

JUN 31 11 15 AM ’71
Mr. Kent came to this branch from a non-official cover job which
had little in common with the duties of a country desk chief. More-
over, he found himself in the sometimes difficult situation of taking
over a position just vacated by the newly appointed deputy branch chief.
Despite these, to him, minor obstacles, he called upon his close
association with Latin American affairs for many years, his wealth of
experience on WH country desks, and his inherent ability to deal suc-
cessfully with people and situations in asserting leadership and quickly
bringing the Peru Desk under his own independent control.
During the year that Mr. Kent served as Peru Desk Chief he domon-
strated conclusively that he is equally talented in all fields of
clandestine activity. There is little question that Covert Action is
what he likes and does the best, as once more evidenced by a written
commendation he received for this type of work while part of a special
WH task force in September and October 1970; however, it should be

I have little to add to this comprehensive narrative with which I
fully agree. I, too, have worked very closely with Bill for most of
the period under review, which witnessed rather hectic days in the life
of the Lima Station: it was comforting to be able to rely on his keen
perception of latent trouble, clear analysis of events, and sound and/or
imaginative, as the case demanded, proposals for approaching problems.
Because he has the potential for career advancement, I would strongly
recommend that he be soon transferred back to a "like" position, again
with managerial responsibilities.

Mr. Kent has competently directed the covert action activities
of Branch 6 since being named Chief of the CA Section for the Branch
in December 1970. He was selected for this position because of
his aggressiveness in the CA field and especially because of his
years of experience and success in the propaganda activity. In
closely monitoring the actions of the Allende Government (GOC) Mr.
Kent lived up to his reputation and demonstrated his unique ability
to recognize propaganda vulnerabilities and to attack them with
effective and imaginative propaganda guidance.
0572 During his brief tour in the Branch Mr. Kent developed one
economic warfare operation against the GOC which shows indications
of partially satisfying the USG objective of discouraging foreign
investment in Chile.
Mr. Kent is fluent in the Spanish language and on at least
two occasions he has proven himself as a translator for two meetings
between senior officials of the USG and Latin American officials.
Mr. Kent has effectively supervised the personnel of the CA
Section which, besides himself, consists of two officers and one
clerical. In the management of the Branch's covert action programs

In my capacity as Branch Chief during the period January to April 1971,
I had ample opportunity to observe the work of Mr. Kent and had the pleasure of
working directly with him on a variety of sensitive and important activities. In
addition to his highly imaginative yet realistic approach to the problem of Chile,
he amply demonstrated his ability to deal with persons who were out to sell bills
of goods to the Agency. His clear understanding of the role of the Clandestine
Service protected the Agency from disagreeable encounters that might have
resulted in compromises or embarrassments. His forte is clearly in the field
of public relations and propaganda well-adjusted to the role of the Clandestine

to inhibit foreign investment in Chile. The responses to the first
phase of this operation were highly favorable and the initial reactions
to the second phase have also been very favorable.
It should be noted that during this period Mr. Kent served for
three months as the Acting Deputy Branch Chief, including two weeks
when he was the Acting Branch Chief. In both of these positions
he performed very capably, showing excellent judgment and managerial
abilities in handling Branch-level matters. He showed similar
managerial ability in his handling of the two officers and secretary
in his Section throughout the rating period. He has consistently
shown a high degree of cost consciousness in all phases of his work.
Mr. Kent displayed his talent for dealing with non-Agency
personnel at a meeting of publishers from all over the hemisphere
held during the latter part of 1971. At this meeting he skillfully
handled several key Latin American assets with the result that
some of the Agency's objectives for influencing the meeting were
achieved under difficult circumstances.
In sum, Mr. Kent made a notable contribution to the Branch's
efforts in 1971 and we are looking forward with pleasure to working
with him in the coming year.

efforts undoubtedly have played a role in Chile's increasing dif-

In the course of his duties Mr. Kent was called upon to meet
and handle several key Chileans concerning matters affecting covert
operations in Chile. In one case he made the first Agency contact
with an important Chilean business leader who will be taken over
shortly by the Santiago Station. This individual is a leader of
the Chilean private sector which has become of increasing interest
to the Station's operations.
Mr. Kent ably supervisied the activities of the two other
officers and secretary in his Section during the rating period.
In addition to his regular duties, he has frequently been called
upon to fill in for the Branch Chief and/or the Deputy Branch Chief
during absences of the latter two officers. In all such cases he
displayed sound judgment and a thorough grasp of both the FI and
CA operations being conducted in Chile.
In conclusion, it should be noted that Mr. Kent has turned in
an unusually strong across-the-board performance during the highly
active period covered by this report. It has been a real pleasure

During the rating period Mr. Agent continued to direct in a highly
effective manner the large-scale covert action program carried out by
the Branch against the Chilean target, including political action
operations, propaganda, economic warfare, black operations and a
militant action group. Mr. Kent is uniquely qualified for his present
job since he combines an active and imaginative mind with a background
of twenty years of operational experience in the Latin American area.
He also possesses an unusual degree of fluency in the Spanish language.
In addition to directing the Branch's overall covert action
program, Mr. Kent personally handled the majority of the propaganda
effort conducted by the Branch. He turned in a very strong performance
in originating and coordinating propaganda guidances on the Chilean
situation for use in the Western Hemisphere as well as other areas
such as Europe. He showed a real flair for spotting propaganda
vulnerabilities and then coming up with fresh ideas for the exploitation
of these vulnerabilities. He particularly excelled in staying on
top of fast breaking situations requiring a steady flow of propaganda
guidance.
Mr. Kent also conceived and executed the second phase of an
effective propaganda operation in the economic field which is designed

During the past year Mr. Kent continued to direct the CA
Section of the Chile Branch in the same highly effective manner
noted in the previous fitness report. In this position he was
responsible for directing the Headquarters support for WH Division's
largest and most active covert action program. This program is
generally credited with having achieved a number of successes during
the past year in a wide variety of activities against the Chilean
target.

Mr. Kent possesses an unusual combination of talent, language
capability and experience that makes him one of the top CA officers
in the Division. He is particularly effective in conducting propa-
ganda work and his imaginative exploitation of the Chilean situation
has been superb. As a result of his efforts, the Branch has been
able to conduct a continuous and effective hemisphere-wide propa-
ganda campaign against the Allende government during the past year.
In addition, he has brought in key European stations to assist in
this program on numerous occasions.
Among the more significant contributions made by Mr. Kent have
been his activities in the economic field. He has successfully

he has an uncanny talent for coming up with an appropriate CA remedy

is wide and deep, making him undoubtedly one of the best officers in

I am in basic agreement with these comments and with the overall rating of Strong.
Unfortunately, due to the physical separation of my office and that where Mr. Kent
labors, I find it difficult to provide meaningful substantive comments. I have served
as C/CMS only since 1 October 1976 and, while individual branches within CMS are
widely dispersed, I have been lucky in having each managed and run by a senior
experienced officer of supergrade rank. This was true in CMS/NOC and I am more
than willing to accept C/CMS/NOC's evaluation of Mr. Kent. In my own dealings with
Kent, I have found him to be responsive, informed, articulate and an excellent team
player. I am also aware of certain innovations developed by him and implemented
within CMS/NOC which have benefically contributed to the Directorate's NOG program
A good, solid officer with additional growth potential.

ability to act on his own and get things done, he also has a decided
capacity for working as a team member.
While the Outstanding rating necessarily must be assigned spar-
ingly, I believe it is merited in this case. Mr. Kent did a really
superb job in the tension-filled days leading to the Chilean coup.
His performance and intellectual abilities place him among the top
10% of SA officers in the Division and probably in the Agency.
As far as future assignments are concerned, I believe Mr. Kent
is best qualified by experience and personal inclination to handle
staff jobs calling for a large measure of political and economic
astuteness. The new job he is taking over in the economic section
of WH Division will test his talents, but I believe he has the growth
potential to rise to positions of even greater responsibility.

operational experience. His ingenuity, originality and flare
are balanced by sound common sense and enriched by his sense of
humor and personal modesty. Mr. Kent was personally responsible
for the creation and implementation of two important Division
programs one in the political action field and the other in
the propaganda field, which were designed to influence foreign
attitudes toward the Allende Government and to dissuade foreign
governments from providing economic assistance to Chile. These
programs were highly successful, and since the same techniques
can be applied in support of the new Chilean military government,
the programs are being retained and hopefully will continue to
produce results which make an important contribution to the
achievement of U.S. policy objectives.
Mr. Kent continued to supervise the SA Section in the same
highly effective manner noted in previous efficiency reports.
He also continued to meet and handle several key Chileans,
including a top civilian adviser to the new Chilean government.
He put in long hours, working eleven or twelve hours a day during
crisis periods.
Mr. Kent's transfer to the economic section of WH Division
will enable him to make fuller use of his talents in the
specialized and important field of economic intelligence, in
which he has a particular interest. It is, however, a severe
loss to the Branch, which has benefited immeasurably from his
imaginative yet level-headed approach to operational problems
and challenges. He is much liked as well as respected by
Branch 6 personnel and has contributed greatly toward main-
taining the high morale and effectiveness of the Branch as
a whole.

In this context he has made invaluable suggestions on how we

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Retirement
Kent, William M. effective 30 June 1978
1. The retirement of Subject, effected as a result of
a memorandum from the Head of his Career Service stating that
he is surplus to the needs of the Service and that his retire-
ment will be recommended under the provisions of the CIA
Retirement and Disability System pertaining to involuntary
retirement, in no way implies an adverse action. Subject
voluntarily opted for involuntary retirement under CIARDS to
qualify for an immediate retirement annuity.
Any inquiry received concerning the nature of the
separation of Subject from the Agency should be confirmed
simply as a retirement.

:
Chairman, GS-14 Evaluation Board
Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-15, William M. Kent
1. This memorandum recommends the promotion of
Mr. William M. Kent from GS-14 to GS-15. Mr. Kent is a
46-year old Operations Specialist who has been in grade
since December 1968.
3.
Performance in current grade. During the
seven years that Mr. Kent has been in grade, he has served
as a case officer assigned to the Washington Base of the
Foreign Resources Division and, in the Latin America
Division, as Chief of the Peruvian Desk, Chief of Covert
Action activities for the Chile Branch, and Deputy Special
Assistant in the Economic Intelligence Collection and
Operations Staff. Since August 1974, Mr. Kent has been
serving on a rotational tour with the Nonofficial Cover
Branch of the Career Management Group (CMG/NOC). Mr. Kent
has occupied a series of increasingly important positions
since his assignment to Headquarters in 1970. During his
tenure in the Chile Branch he was personally responsible
for developing two important programs one in the political
action field and the other in the propaganda field -- which
were designed to influence foreign attitudes towards the
Allende regime in Chile. These programs were highly suc-
cessful. He received overall Outstanding ratings in his
Fitness Reports for the period 1972-73 and for his work
with CMG/NOC in 1975. Mr. Kent received a Quality Step
Increase in 1974.
b. Potential. Throughout his Agency career Mr.
Kent has demonstrated that he can assume broader and in-
creased responsibilities and perform effectively in
challenging situations. His special strengths lie in the
Covert Action and Nonofficial Cover fields. He has distin-
guished himself in his ability to apply imaginative solu-
tions to operational problems involving Covert Action. In
particular, he is noted for his work in exploiting the dis-
covery of the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela in 1963, and
to support U.S. actions during the January 1964 riots in
Panama and the April 1964 revolt in the Dominican Republic.

Mr. Kent has also served as the field representative for
a Latin America Division funding and cover mechanism. Mr.
Kent's past service in a nonofficial cover status has well
qualified him for his present Headquarters assignment at
a time when nonofficial cover is taking on even greater
significance in Agency operational planning.
C. Personal characteristics and qualifications.
In fulfilling his various responsibilities, Mr. Kent has
demonstrated that he is imaginative, perceptive, energetic,
and a person of sound, independent judgment. He is extreme-
ly
versatile and has a first-rate mind. Invariably, when
a crisis situation arose and talent had to be mobilized with-
in the Division, Mr. Kent was one of the first officers
whose name came to mind. He writes quickly and with a
polished style. During the past year, he was called upon
on two occasions to draft papers concerning Agency involve-
ment in Chile which were used by the Director and the Deputy
Director for Operations in their presentations before the
Senate Select Committee. Mr. Kent speaks and writes fluent
Spanish in addition to speaking very good Italian and some
French.

2. Mr. Kent meets all of the general and specific
criteria for promotion within his category. He has a total
of 24 years of Agency service, of which 23 years have been
involved with operations. He has served overseas tours in
Panama City and Caracas in addition to his domestic assign-
ments in New Orleans, Miami, and Washington, D.C. He has
successfully developed and managed new programs in the
Covert Action and the Nonofficial Cover fields in which he
is presently engaged. Mr. Kent is a man of enormous
energy who is eager to take on challenging assignments.
has yet to reach his peak within the Agency. Mr. Kent has
demonstrated that he is an effective supervisor, having
served as Desk Chief, Acting Branch Chief, and Section Chief.
Mr. Kent is entering into competition for promo-
tion carrying the strong recommendation of this Division
as well as that of CMG/NOC. His rotational tour with the
Nonofficial Cover Branch will end in July 1977. Because of
family medical reasons, Mr. Kent is presently subject to a
medical hold. Upon completion of his tour with CMG/NOC,
he will return to the Latin America Division with a
projected assignment in a senior staff position.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group

SUBJECT
: Chief, Latin America Division
: Mr. William M. Kent, Recommendation for Promotion
1. Mr. Kent has been on a rotational assignment to the
Nonofficial Cover Branch from Latin America Division since
August 1974. From the outset, he has displayed a most
impressive ability to switch gears from his natural operational
initiatives and to focus that initiative into his staff
officer role. His rapid absorption of management and personnel
principles and problems, with especial emphasis on the non-
official cover program of the Directorate, has been remarkable
even in an officer with his experience.
2. Specifically, Kent's innovative and imaginative drive
has, in a relatively short period of time, enabled the Branch
to create a NOC referrals section headed by him, in which he
has become a principal PDO coordinator for hundreds of leads
involving job applicants which are derived from letters written
to the Agency, from our field recruiters, from the CT program,
our management skills bank, and other sources. He has created,
in his development of this referrals system, a language and job
skills record of available applicants who do not fit any specific
Agency criterion such as the Career Trainee program. Under his
guidance, referrals files are prepared on specific applicants
and are forwarded to all DDO components which he knows would be
interested in the specific candidate. He handles all replies
and indications of interest, and arranges that candidates of
interest are cleared, contacted, interviewed, and assessed.
Often he handles the contacting, interviewing and assessment
himself. In its first full year of operation, his referrals
system has assisted in placing impressive candidates in a variety
of DDO field assignments.

##
3. The above has been accomplished in addition to Kent's
initially assigned responsibilities for close support of the
NOC programs of two very active divisions, Latin America and
Africa. This task calls for experienced and tactful direct
cooperation with the NOC referents and senior operations
officers in the divisions concerned. Ordinarily, such area
division NOC responsibility would be a full-time job for an
officer of this Branch. Kent handles this assignment, as well
as his development of the referrals program, with dispatch and
poise.
4. Kent's recent fitness reports will indicate his out-
standing qualities. They include an enormous and enthusiastic
capacity for work, a fine and precise writing ability, a
genuinely rare imagination and a willingness to move far beyond
the daily work requirements to get his job done, or to increase
the value of his assigned task. This officer is constantly on
the move to devise new and effective means of enhancing the
nonofficial cover program. He has proven a patient and
sympathetic guidance counsellor for numbers of officers either
in the NOC program or those interested in it. It is to his
credit primarily that we have created the referrals system
which not only coordinates the reassignment of NOC personnel
across division lines to appropriate new areas and opportunities,
but also serves as a central clearing house for personalities
who indicate interest in working for CIA in an non-staff capacity.
5.
Kent's primary area of operational experience has been
Latin America, including years of NOC officer status. A look
at his file reveals over a half dozen commendations for unusual
service and initiative. Linguistically he speaks native Spanish,
very good Italian and some French. He has a supervisory ability
far above the average, and has a highly developed diplomatic
skill in his pursuit of new operational and staff goals which
has stood him well on countless occasions. He is a harmonious
and cooperative work colleague. Clearly he is a most unusual
operations officer who has mastered staff skills and abilities
to the point where he is capable of taking on a wide spectrum of
future field or Headquarters assignments.

1. Having been appointed to my present position on 23 May 1977, this
report covers seven months. In this time I have learned to appreciate
Mr. Kent's excellent performance in supporting and guiding the mission
of this branch. Considering the outstanding evaluation he received from
my predecessor, it must have been a great disappointment to Mr. Kent
that he was not advanced to become branch chief. I make this observa-
tion because Mr. Kent has never demonstrated his obvious disappointment
to me. On the contrary, from the first moment he has shown extraordi-
nary and enthusiastic willingness in providing the needed continuity to
run this branch which controls the career progression of the NOC officer
complement consisting of between 275 and 300 officers at any given time.
No doubt the reader is aware of the intricate, complicated and at times
confusing bureaucratic machinery which governs the NOC officer program.
Mr. Kent has done a superb job in helping me understand and cope with
this maze.
2. With the creation of the Office of External Development and conco-
mitant issuance of new, precise and explicit regulations we now hope to
streamline and simplify this bureaucratic machinery. Mr. Kent's
knowledge of past practices coupled with his eagerness and at times

RESUME
William M. Kent
556 Van Buren Street
Virginia 22070
U.S. Army (1946-1948).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND:
Department store manager-
trainee, El Salvador, Central America (1950-1951). Twenty-six years as
an intelligence officer with the Central Intelligence Agency, covering
progressively higher-level assignments in Latin America, Washington, D.C.
and other domestic locations. Varied experience in both operational
and staff assignments in areas of management, personnel recruitment and
training, intelligence collection, liaison, propaganda and political
action, field investigations.
OPERATIONS: Selected, assessed, recruited and trained operational
assets in the field for intelligence collection purposes. Initiated and
developed productive liaison and social connections with foreign
political, military and business personalities, in almost all cases
using foreign languages. Sent on special assignments to conduct on-
the-spot field investigations, collected material evidence and
corroborated suspicions. Organized, instituted and supervised individual,
regional and world-wide propaganda and political action programs in
response to high level directives and in consonance with U.S. policy
objectives. Much of this work required a thorough knowledge and under-
standing of the psychology, culture, aspirations and motivation of
foreign individuals and peoples in order to influence them, through
verbal as well as written means, from one point of view or ideological
preference, to another. Essential to the work were imagination,
innovation and drive, as well as a complete understanding of a given
subject, a knowledge of journalism and other media, and well-
developed writing and verbal skills. Assignments required a willingness
and ability to assume effectively and convincingly, a variety of roles;
have served as a graduate student, an author, an American diplomat
serving in an Embassy abroad, as the head of a voluntary organization,
as a businessman, etc.
MANAGEMENT: In Washington headquarters and in the field, served in
numerous middle level and senior management positions; have had
responsibility for a 26-person operational branch; as a desk chief
for overseas stations; as the responsible officer for major political
action and propaganda operations; as recruiter and manager of human
sources of intelligence; as liaison officer to high level exile and
indigenous personalities; as a staff section chief, staff deputy chief,
and staff acting chief; and as the deputy of a special assistant to
a very senior Agency officer. Responsible for evaluating the work of
subordinate personnel and for support and assistance to promotion panels.
Planned, disbursed and accounted for operational budgets of up to
several millions of dollars.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
:
Chairman, GS-14 Evaluation Board
Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-15, William M. Kent
1. This memorandum recommends the promotion of
Mr. William M. Kent from CS-14 to GS-15. Mr. Kent is a
46-year old Operations Specialist who has been in grade
since December 1968.
a.
Performance in current grade. During the
seven years that Mr. Kent has been in grade, he has served
as a case officer assigned to the Washington Base of the
Foreign Resources Division and, in the Latin America
Division, as Chief of the Peruvian Desk, Chief of Covert
Action activities for the Chile Branch, and Deputy Special
Assistant in the Economic Intelligence Collection and
Operations Staff.
Staff. Since August
Since August 1974, Mr. Kent has been
serving on a rotational tour with the Nonofficial Cover
Branch of the Career Management Group (CMG/NOC). Mr. Kent
has occupied a series of increasingly important positions
since his assignment to headquarters in 1970. During his
tenure in the Chile Branch he was personally responsible
for developing two important programs one in the political
action field and the other in the propaganda field -- which
were designed to influence foreign attitudes towards the
Allende regime in Chile. These programs were highly suc-
cessful. He received overall Outstanding ratings in his
Fitness Reports for the period 1972-73 and for his work
with CMG/NOC in 1975. Mr. Kent received a Quality Step
Increase in 1974.
b. Potential. Throughout his Agency career Mr.
Kent has demonstrated that he can assume broader and in-
creased responsibilities and perform effectively in
challenging situations. His special strengths lie in the
Covert Action and Nonofficial Cover fields. He has distin-
guished himself in his ability to apply imaginative solu-
tions to operational problems involving Covert Action. In
particular, he is noted for his work in exploiting the dis-
covery of the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela in 1963, and
to support U.S. actions during the January 1964 riots in
Panama and the April 1964 revolt in the Dominican Pepublic.

3. The above has been accomplished in addition to Kent's
initially assigned responsibilities for close support of the
NOC programs of two very active divisions, Latin America and
Africa. This task calls for experienced and tactful direct
cooperation with the NOC referents and senior operations
officers in the divisions concerned. Ordinarily, such area
division NOC responsibility would be a full-time job for an
officer of this Branch. Kent handles this assignment, as well
as his development of the referrals program, with dispatch and
poise.
4. Kent's recent fitness reports will indicate his out-
standing qualities. They include an enormous and enthusiastic
capacity for work, a fine and precise writing ability, a
genuinely rare imagination and a willingness to move far beyond
the daily work requirements to get his job done, or to increase
the value of his assigned task. This officer is constantly on
the move to devise new and effective means of enhancing the
nonofficial cover program. He has proven a patient and
sympathetic guidance counsellor for numbers of officers either
in the NOC program or those interested in it. It is to his
credit primarily that we have created the referrals system
which not only coordinates the reassignment of NOC personnel
across division lines to appropriate new areas and opportunities,
but also serves as a central clearing house for personalities
who indicate interest in working for CIA in an non-staff capacity.
5.
Kent's primary area of operational experience has been
Latin America, including years of NOC officer status. A look
at his file reveals over a half dozen commendations for unusual
service and initiative. Linguistically he speaks native Spanish,
very good Italian and some French. He has a supervisory ability
far above the average, and has a highly developed diplomatic
skill in his pursuit of new operational and staff goals which
has stood him well on countless occasions. He is a harmonious
and cooperative work colleague. Clearly he is a most unusual
operations officer who has mastered staff skills and abilities
to the point where he is capable of taking on a wide spectrum of
future field or Headquarters assignments.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Career Management Group
VIA
SUBJECT
: Chief, Latin America Division
: Mr. William M. Kent, Recommendation for Promotion
1. Mr. Kent has been on a rotational assignment to the
Nonofficial Cover Branch from Latin America Division since
August 1974. From the outset, he has displayed a most
impressive ability to switch gears from his natural operational
initiatives and to focus that initiative into his staff
officer role. His rapid absorption of management and personnel
principles and problems, with especial emphasis on the non-
official cover program of the Directorate, has been remarkable
even in an officer with his experience.
2. Specifically, Kent's innovative and imaginative drive
has, in a relatively short period of time, enabled the Branch
to create a NOC referrals section headed by him, in which he
has become a principal PDO coordinator for hundreds of leads
involving job applicants which are derived from letters written
to the Agency, from our field recruiters, from the CT program,
our management skills bank, and other sources. He has created,
in his development of this referrals system, a language and job
skills record of available applicants who do not fit any specific
Agency criterion such as the Career Trainee program. Under his
guidance, referrals files are prepared on specific applicants
and are forwarded to all DDO components which he knows would be
interested in the specific candidate. He handles all replies
and indications of interest, and arranges that candidates of
interest are cleared, contacted, interviewed, and assessed.
Often he handles the contacting, interviewing and assessment
himself. In its first full year of operation, his referrals
system has assisted in placing impressive candidates in a variety
of DDO field assignments.

corroborated suspicions. Organized, instituted and supervised individual,
regional and world-wide propaganda and political action programs in

objectives. Much of this work required a thorough knowledge and under-
standing of the psychology, culture, aspirations and motivation of
foreign individuals and peoples in order to influence them, through
verbal as well as written means, from one point of view or ideological
preference, to another. Essential to the work were imagination,
innovation and drive, as well as a complete understanding of a given
subject, a knowledge of journalism and other media, and well-
developed writing and verbal skills. Assignments required a willingness
and ability to assume effectively and convincingly, a variety of roles;
have served as a graduate student,

serving in an Embassy abroad, as the head of a voluntary organization,
as a businessman, etc.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Commendation of Mr. William Kent
During the last five months I have turned to Mr. Kent
on two occasions to help the Latin America Division in
connection with Senate Select Committee's investigation
of covert action in Chile. When confronted with a need
to produce a papar on Chile in a short timeframe, I
instinctively turned to him. It was not only because he
had expertise on Chile, due to service in the Chile Branch,
but because he is highly skilled in written presentation.
He organizes his material well and presents it in a lucid,
highly readable manner. On the first occasion, he belped
us prepare a paper that was eventually used by the Director
in his presentation before the Senate Select Committee on
14-15 July. On the second occasion his contribution was
used by the DDO in his appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on 28 October. Both of these papers were
excellent and have withstoood critical scrutiny.
Aside from Mr. Kent's ability to write I would like
to take this occasion to record my overall high esteem
for Mr. Kent as a professional and as a person. I have
always considered him to be one of our more able and pro-
mising officers. His dedication is exemplary; he has spent
untold extra hours of his time carrying out his duties. He
has good judgment and common sense. Mr. Kent has a very
attractive personality and excellent personal presence.
Prom all standpoints he is an excellent officer that deserves
to move ahead in the organization. I am convinced he has the
ability and potential to do so.

SUBJECT
Chief Special Security Division
(Pseudo)
#57514 OLIVER H. CORBUSTON
1. Reference is made to your memorandum, dated 14 May 1952, in
which a covert security clearance was requested to enable the WH Division
to utilise the Subject's services as an Intelligence Officer (Staff Agent),
in Fort Amador, Canal Zone. Reference memorandum indicated that Subject
will be used on Project HYPOTHESIS, under military cover.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in the Director's
Memorandum of 14 February 1949, entitled "Security and Operational
Clearances", a covert security clearance is granted for the covert use
of the Subject as described in your request as set forth in Paragraph 1
above.
3. The Subject is not to represent himself as, nor is he to he
represented as, an employee of CIA.
4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
Clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-9. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request for
clearance to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this
office.
5. This clearance becomes invalid in the event the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this memo-
randum.

preserve the security of your cover position.
a. All annual and sick leave which will have accrued to your
credit at the time of integration into the Foreign Service will be
held by CIA pending your transfer from the Foreign Service to CIA.
While assigned to the Foreign Service you will be permitted annual
leave, sick leave, statutory leave, and leave without pay in ac-
cordance with the regulations of that organization. Upon completion
of your integration in the Foreign Service your accrued leave will
normally be transferred to your credit with CIA. If security con-
ditions require that you be given a lump-sum payment for accrued
annual leave, you will be required to pay the gross amount of any
such lump-sum payment to the CIA at the time of your reinstatement:
including any withholding tax deducted by the Foreign Service.
b. Upon your integration in the Foreign Service, you will
continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service
Retirement Act, as amended, and you will be subject to payroll
deductions for retirement purposes (now six percent).
6. If the CIA considers it undesirable for you to continue the use
of your Foreign Service cover, your services will be utilized whenever
possible in some other appropriate capacity as designated by CIA, unless
the circumstances are such as to warrant your termination for cause.
7. Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be
responsible for compliance with CIA rules and regulations.

INTEGREE AGREEMENT
Dear Mr. Kent
This is a memorandum of agreement between you and the United States
Government in regard to your employment by CIA. It is hereby mutually
agreed and understood that:
as
1. As an employee of CIA, at the present grade and salary of 08-11 $7270
per annum, you will accept cover employment in the Foreign Service effective
88 of 23 July 58. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic respon-
sibility to CIA, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies
of the Foreign Service in order to appear as a conventional member of that
establishment. Your appointment to the Foreign Service is being effected
at the class of FSR-7 and salary of $6435 per annum.
2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your
overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed
tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour
consists of a period of two ( 2 ) years from the date of your
arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated
earlier for the convenience of CIA, and the length of your tour of duty,
as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by CIA in order to
conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of the Foreign
Service. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely
for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are con-
sidered by the Agency to be beyond your control or if you are terminated
for cause either by the Foreign Service or CIA before you have completed
the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival
at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel
or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States
at Government expense. If you request termination of your overseas assign
ment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that
are considered by the Agency to be beyond your control or if you are
terminated for cause either by the Foreign Service or CIA before you have
completed one (1) year of service from the date of your arrival at your
overseas post of duty, you will be required to reimburse the Government
for all its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of
your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post
of duty.
3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the
United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER
The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall
determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance
with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and
acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.
This form should be checked for holding of office, pension, suitability in con-
nection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the
following:
(1) Identity of appointed. It is the duty of the appointing officer to
guard against impersonation and to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the
appointee is the same person whose appointment was authorised. The
appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application
and/or other pertinent papers. If the appointee qualified in a written exami-
nation, the signature on this form should be compared with the signature on
the declaration sheet, which was signed in the examination room. His physical
appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointed.

(3) Age. If definite age limits have been established for the position, it should
be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment.
Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.
(3) Citizenship.-The appointing officer is responsible for observing the
citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) appropriation acts.
Form 61 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of
citizenship status in the absence of conflicting evidence. In doubtful cases the
appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from
the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.
(4) Members of Family.-Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that
probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other
whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under

Request for Quality Step Increase (HR 20-37),
Mr. William M. Kent, GS-13
1. On the basis of the information presented below, it
is recommended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for
Mr. William M. Kent.
2. Mr. Kent has made a most valuable contribution to
the Covert Action mission of this Division.
the discovery of a Cuban arms cache in Venezuela in November
On occasion of
1963, of the January 1964 riots in Panama, of the April 1965
revolution in the Dominican Republic, of many other crises
and situations which have developed, Mr. Kent immediately
took the initiative within and outside this Division for the
initiation and coordination of Covert Action efforts to
safeguard the U.S. image and support U.S. objectives in each
case; this, of course, without neglecting his other, routine,
day-to-day responsibilities. Mr. Kent has been energetic,
imaginative, and professional in his work to a degree much
beyond that normally found or expected.
Spanish, and this has been an essential ingredient in his
He speaks excellent
critical abilities in the handling of his assigned tasks.
3.
Mr. Kent has been with the WH Division's Covert
Action Staff since 1963. In 1964, he attended the Mid-
career Executive Development Course No. 4. He has con-
sistently maintained a very high level of competence, con-
scientious application, and strong dedication to his duties.
In this connection, despite an illness which lasted from
December 1964 to July 1965, he took only two days of sick
leave and did not allow his work performance to suffer.
There is every reason to believe that Mr. Kent's exceptional
proficiency and effectiveness will continue.
