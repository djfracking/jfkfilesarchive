On Friday, 7 August 1964 Subject claims to have
made a long distance phone call from the telephone at the
Apt., 587-8534 to a cousin, Pablo Rodriguez, 2852 (sic)
West 20th St., New York, N. Y., telephone number HI 9-1359.

3. It is requested that your office ascertain if this
call was actually made on the 7th, including the time at
which the call was made. It would be appreciated if you
could ascertain if any long distance phone calls were made
on 6 August. It is further requested that you attempt to
identify the subscriber to the New York number, HI 9-1359.
No Pablo Rodriguez is listed in the New York telephone
directory, and the address is obviously an incorrect one
as street numbers in Manhattan do not go as high as this
number.
Game to DFO
It would be appreciated if results of this inquiry
could be communicated to this office by 12 August 1964.
