by it and clearly interested in pursuing that long murky
path to "enlightenment.”
did an outstanding job in
setting the stage, describing the target, and then explaining
step by step how he and CRPHONE/1 and PAUPEROS would work
together as the operation progressed.
upcoming trip in the U.S.
Regarding QRPHONE's
explained exactly how
CRPHONE should act as he meets each of his friends and how
he should develop his new-found "interest" in studying
Marxist-Leninism as he moots with those various people.
QRPHONE was very responsive, took notes, had ideas of his
own, but more importantly appreciative of the
described. QRPHONE/1 will meet
"
the following people over the next ten days.
Richard Ward in New York City.
b. Libel Bergman in Newark (on three different
occasions)
0. Benjamin Blake, Hilton Henry and a fellow
named Boggs in Detroit (he's with NAR).
d. Don Wright, Herb Block, and Sidnoy Lens all
in Chicago.
LPWEAKLY/1 and family in Chicago
f. Davida Fineman and Saul Landau in San Francisco.
g. The Martin Luther King Foundation in Atlanta.
6. All of the above were carefully chosen because of
who they were, what organization or philosophy they repro-
sented, or their interest in the Chinese, and the extent to
which the whole would knit together and form a viable base
which QRPHONE CAR use as a springboard when he returns to
London.
Urged QRPHONE to join, or in some cases rejoin,
Hoist study groups in London including the one conducted
by Manchanda. The role that TPHONE should play with these
groups, as well as others in Europe who were singled out
during various parts of the conversation, was also spelled
out in detail. By the end of the evening CRPHONE had clearly
in mind what it was all about, what he should do next and
the purpose of our reconvening on the 24th and 26th to decide
finally what it all amounts to.

1. Being forwarded USC are copies of the QRPHONE/1 training
report, the JBMINIMUM evaluation, contact reports of meetings with
QRPHONE/1, a WOGKAR review of QRPHONE/1's book and some notes made
by the STFLIMFLAM Headquarters officer, Harvey B. DAITCHMAN (IDEN),
after his meetings with QRPHONE/1. These are for the information
of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give
you both the flavor of the variety of measures taken to assess the
operational potential of QRPHONE/1.
2. During PAUPEROS' TDY at Headquarters we discussed the
necessity of having QRPHONE/1 undergo an intensive seven day
STFLIMFLAM training program to be conducted by DAITCHMAN. It is
our opinion that in order for this training to be of maximum
benefit, QRPHONE/1 and DAITCHMAN ought to be ensconced in a
safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an
atmosphere conducive to learning. It is important that the
training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give
bis full attention without being disturbed by his multitude of
business and social contacts. Therefore, we recommence that LCPIPIT
rent a cottage or beach house away from London for the duration of
the training cycle. In discussing this with QRPHONE, he readily
agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in getting
away from his family for as long as we thought necessary.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Training
ATTENTION:
SUBJECT:
Chief, Covert Training/OS/TR
Covert Trainlag for QRPHONE /1
1. This is to confirm telephone conversation between Mr.
Caleb L. Batton and Miss Diane L. Chatelan, Chief, Counter
Front Branch, requesting covert training for subject contract
agent.
2. We would like to have this training begin 14 October
1970, and can make the agent available full time for three days
only. We are planning to have the training take place in New
Yort: City, and Mr. Lasarus has already indicated orally to Miss
Chatelan that he will be available.
3. Our mala objective is to provide ORPHONE/1 with
firm understanding of what is required for good intelligence
reporting and also the skills needed for spotting and assessments.
ORPHONE/1 has been an Agent for over five years and has
absorbed a good deal of tradecraft in the process. He has not,
however, had any formally organized training.
4. We would like to have QRPHONE/l's outside case officer
(handler) present during this training.
5. Subject and his operational background represent a highly
sensitive area and we would appreciate the selection of a training
site with this in mind. Biographic background as needed by your
instructor will be provided by Chief, CA /CF with whom all further
arrangements for this training should be made.

How-
5. In organizing alreport exercise, 'he did extremely well.
exercises Reparating fact from inference, he did only fairly well,
considering his background and compared to trainees with no where near
his experience or education. He has a slight tendency toward jumping
to conclusions and reading meanings into words. He realized this and
from then on he overcase this werkness to a considerable degree.
ever, 0781 on the last day, writing reports based on New York Times
newspaper Articles, he twice (out of five reports) substituted his
own word for a word in the article for no valid reason and which new
word in feet changed the meaning of the sentence, though only slightly.
6. Mills small weakness is not unique to QRPHQ2/1. It is also
true of other equally highly literate trainees, who, like QRPHONE/1,
unconsciously substitute their own language for that which has been
directly Liven to them, not realizing that they thereby sometimes
change the meaning of that which they are reporting. Happily, QRPHONE/1
realized this during the exercises, recognized the changed meaning,
and earnestly stated that he will watch it in the future.
7. In observation and description exercises, he did well after
a rocky stert. Here, he at first concentrated on individuals, almost
completely i moring the actions they were engaged in. He soon saw
that he has a mental capacity to watch both at once and there was no
problem tlureafter.
8. He was excellent in his ability to separate hard facts and
put those in the body of his reports while listing as comments those
items which legitimately were comments and which had no place in the
report itself.
9. For the final session, he had been asked to do assessment
reports on two people. He was mortified when he came in on the last
morning, Happily handed in his five intel reports and suddenly realized
that he had completely forgotten to do the other reports. However,
in discussing spotting and assessment reports, it appears that he now
understands them.
10. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,
we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in November 1971 from
the field station.
This report should indicate the extent to which the
training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and should
evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which training was
conducted; negative as well as positive comments are solicited.
station's report should also include the trainee's own comments. Please
ask the field station to slug the report WCHOLD/QRPACIE/1/PERSHING. Upon
receipt of the report at Headquarters, please forward a copy to the
undersigned.

BACKGROUND:
Subject is a 39-year-old, married, male U.S. citizen who
has been utilized by this organization since 1966 as a covert ac-
Hon asset. He was granted a POA on 23 May 1966. His previous
polygraph examination was on 13 June 1965.
PROCEDURE:
On 21 September 1970, Subject was interrogated and given
a polygraph examination in a Commodore Hotel suite in New York
City which was used as a covert site. Subject's interrogation and
examination were conducted in the English language.
PURPOSE:
The examination was requested through Miss Diana Chatelin
of the CA Staff. ADDP approval was granted for the examination.
The examination was conducted in order to determine if Subject had
revealed his covert relationship with this organization, whether or
not Subject had been approached by any other intelligence organiza-
tion seeking his cooperation, whether or not Subject was maintain-
ing a secret relationship with any other organization, whether or
not Subject was deliberately withholding any contacts which he has
developed from this organization, and whether or not Subject is
currently subject to blackmail or other direct forms of coercion.

7. I asked QRPHONE to call on the sterile line
using the "Mr. Stanley" indicator on Monday afternoon,
21 July. This is simply to check in and let us know he is
on the way and how things have come thus far. He calculated
that he needed another $500.00 for the U.S. portion of his
overall trip since LCPIPIT apparently had not anticipated
this when he was given his original advance. I arrangod
through the good offices of in New York to get $500.00
to ORPHONE today.
8. QRPHONE asked if we had any intelligence require-
ments for him to pursue while he is in Halta. I said Kon
would brief him on those requirements on the 24th of July
if we had any. Incidentally, QRPHONE mentioned that Libol
Bergman comes to New York City every Thursday and told
QRPHONE that he could be reached on telephone number 265-2500.
QRPHONE said if we cared to we might want to track that
number and see where Bergman hangs out.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Final Contact with QRPHONE/1 in New York City
.
1. As arranged previously, I met with QRPHONE/1 at
the WOHOLD safesite in New York City from 1000 hours to
1230 26 July. The meeting was intended to wrap up loose
ends, convey our decision to pursue the STFLIMFLAM program
(providing QRPHONE/1 himself was amenable), and to make
clear that we expect measurable operational progress within
the next year.
+3
2. Although QRPHONE/1 had been debriefed on 24 July
by other Headquarters officers regarding his trip around
WOCORK, I asked him to review it again for my information
so I could put it clearly in perspective as it related to
our plans for him in the coming year. I'll not bother with
the details here because such bave already been written for
the record elsewhere, but suffice it to say that QRPHONE/1
was both pleased and relieved at the reception he got from
his old contacts because of the reflection these receptions
had on his own bona fides. The allegations of his BKTRUST
affiliation which had floated through Europe were never
mentioned by his WOCORK contacts; on the contrary at least
one of them urged QRPHONE/1 to return soon to WOCORK because
this is where the action is. This same individual gave
QRPHONE reading materials on the Communist dialectic and
urged him to study them closely. This greatly impressed
QRPHONE because it showed how accurate were the briefings
given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM officer and
demonstrated that we knew our tactics.
3. I then reviewed with QRPHONE/1 the reasons for our
long close scrutiny of him and his performance these last
several months followed by our selection of him for advance
training, testing, and redirection in the strong hope we had
that he would accept this new task because of its priority
importance to our national collection requirements. I asked

For the record we are forwarding, u/s/c, a copy of the
letter to QRPHONE/1 from his Paris lawyer which outlines the
status of QRPHONE/1's action against Jacques Verges. As Head-
quarters will recall this letter was used by QRPHONE/1 to
good advantage in connection with his recent trip to Algiers.
The letter says, in effect, that Verges has proposed a settle-
ment of the matter and has agreed to pay this settlement in
Algerian dinars. Needless to say, QRPHONE/1 has yet to receive
payment. Nevertheless QRPHONE/1's purposes are well served by
this attestation of Verges' expressed willingness to pay, with
its implied admission of guilt!

A de nombreuses reprises, Maître VERGES a proposé
de régler votre affaire et notamment le 1er juillet 1967
** il a proposé ce que j'ai accepté immédiatement de
vous régler ainsi qu'à votre forme > en dinars, lors de
votre urcaier vovage en Alrérie, une somme équivalente
la moitié de vos demandes respectives.
J'ai vu dans le cadre de nos pourparlers, la pro-
position manuscrite de Maître VERGES, dont les termes sont
assez fidèlement reproduits ci-dessus.
A plusieurs reprises, Maître CAIN m'a confirmé
l'accord de Maître VERGES pour régler sur ces bases ;
toutefois ces derniers mois, il m'a fait savoir qu'il ne
l'avait pas revu depuis un certain temps.
Pour vous permettre de discuter utilement avec
Maître VERGES, si vous le rencontrez, je vous rappelle
le montant des deux demandes :
1°).pour vous-même : salaire : 4.500 Ar

QRPHONE/1 his impressions of it all, his reaction to the
STFLIMFLAM proposal, and whether he would accept its
demanding obligations. QRPHONE said he certainly would
and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and
his operational skills. The tedious study of the dialectic
would not deter him. His only concern was how he should
actually play it as he developed relationships with
appropriate party members and, ultimately, the Chinese in
SMORANGE. I pointed out he needn't concern himself with
the last point because that would be part of the purpose
of the ten-day training program in SHORANGE in September
which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM
officer. I said the training would require total emersion
for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach
house on the coast where all involved could reside full
time. He said this would present no problem cover-wise;
he would simply tell his family he had gone to the continent.
I said that PAUPEROS would be working out the details of
this with him, probably after bis return from vacation.
4. I said that given QRPHONE/1's past performance,
his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent
interest in vigorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAH program ve
expected to be able to measure in six to eight months the
likelihood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAM
objectives based upon the progress he would have made by
then with his Chicom contacts. Should it appear that the
STFLINFLAM operation would not succeed we would be discussing
alternative courses of action with him by the end of the
year. He did say that of all the countries in Europe where
his STFLIMFLAM and radical left potential is probably the
best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.
5.
I told QRPHONE/1 that his meeting with PAUPEROS
had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed his
European vacation plans and his Halta trip and wished him
the very best of luck. At this point QRPHONE/1 certainly
seems willing and able aggressively to pursue our operational
plans. We shall see.

of those European leftist groups active on this issue. (See ODPA 2227)
This in turn led to his being invited to attend the Congress of bulosuåne
Solidarity Committees which was held in Algiers in late December. (e

contacts (that of an unwitting informant). We feel that given this
situation Q?PHONE/1 is doing as well as might reasonably be expected.
-
OEPH 858 was a much appreciated analysis of QRPHONE/1's recent reporting
on the Italian target and explained why much of this has not been judged
disseminable. Having reflected on this we realize that this is actually
not surprising. It should be recalled that Rome Station specifically
requested that QRPHONE/1 get away from rigid formal CS-type reporting and
render more opinionated journalistic type reports. This type of reporting
has been judged quite useful by Rome Station but it is useful in an
operational manner and for general appreciation of the situation. Thus
it was not surprising that an analysis of this particular group of reports
turned out as it did. Rome Station has crally noted to LCPIPIT that
ORPHONE/1's visits will continue to be welcome and his reporting of definite
use - even if this utility is outside the CS framework.
-
-
In the past
In general we feel that this operation is progressing well.
there may have been a tendancy on the part of certain "customers" to
exaggerate QRPHONE/1's potential with a consequent let-down when the
realities of ORPHONE/1 the man and his access to targets was brought home.
We now feel that this is behind us. Judged against the realities of his
situation, his access and the nature of his targets, we think that QRPHONE/1
makes excellent progress against those targets assigned him.

WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements
× In general, the author has done a reasonably good job
describing the historical development of the various African
liberation movements, especially when one considers the com-
plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred
within and among the movements over the years. There are
several glaring inaccuracies, however, in the author's con-
clusions about the current position and effectiveness of the
several Portuguese African liberation movements.
Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the MPLA as an
ideologically-oriented group (i.e., Soviet doctrine) that has
failed to grasp and utilize to its advantage the tribal realities
that exist in Angola. The author fails to acknowledge, however,
that the MPLA has had some success, albeit limited, in building
a movement that is national and multiracial in character rather
than tribally oriented. Despite its urban intellectual leader-
ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support in
rural eastern Angola.
.
By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second. From inception,
its primary base of support has been the large Angolan refugee
population of Bakongo tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire.
Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo
kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola, it has failed
to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional
and tribal make-up. Moreover, Roberto's unwillingness to
delegate authority or compromise have produced chronic disputes
at the leadership level. The author's conclusion that GRAE is
a formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola
is contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the
largest and most effective of the three nationalist groups
opposing the Portuguese in Angola.
MOZAMBIQUE
The present FRELIMO leadership does not appear to be in the
state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.
Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present
leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure
of Simango in late 1969. For the present, any internal squabbles
that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting.
abilities inside Mozambique.
RHODESIA, SOUTH WEST AFRICA, SOUTH AFRICA
Reasonably straightforward and up to date. No serious
deficiencies.

1. At their most recent meeting QRPHONE/1 reported to RODIGAST
that he had lost his passport in Paris during his recent visit to
France. The loss occurred on 8 November in the departure lounge at
Orly Airport as QRPHONE/1 was waiting to board AF 822 for London
(leaving at 1755 hours). QRPHONE/1 had shown his passport to the im-
migration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the
duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes
for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slipped
from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for
these items. At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight
was airborne.
2. QRPHONE/1 had no difficulty re-entering Britain using his Home
Office Certificate of Registration. He reported the loss to Air France
immediately but as of his meeting with RODIGAST on 13 November it had
not been located.
3. On 10 November QRPHONE/1 went to the U.S. Embassy in London
and obtained a new passport (the number of this passport is IDENTITY
u/s/c).
4. We advised CHALEMSKY, of Paris Station, of this loss during
his visit to LCPIPIT on 14 November.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, CA Staff
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
LCPIPIT Request for QRPHONE/I Salary Increase
OEPA - 2122
1. The following is a breakdown of QRPHONE/l's salary history:
Starting salary, June 1965
1 September 1966
1 July 1967
$600 per month
$700 per month
$800 per month
All of the above figures are tax free. In addition, as of 1 May 1969, Subject
was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution
toward some form of insurance against the future (endowment, lump sum
cash valus, or whatever the Field and he finally selected). This appears on
the books as a salary increase. However, although to his ultimate advantage,
It does result in a small decrease in take-home pay since 0/1 is also required
to make a contribution to the payment of the premium.
2. In addition, Q/l's MOC also provides for $10,000 indemnification in
case of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10,000 to his wife in case
of his total incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance
had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent
chance for travel to Peking; this year we included the provision as a general
benefit, not tied to any particular type of hazardous travel alone. Finally,
this year's amendment to his MOC also included a severance bonus of one
month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3,200 in a
special escrow account to cover his previous four years' service, and are
providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that
escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been
surfaced either to QRPHONE/1 or to RODIGAST, by decision of LCPIPIT (a
decision which I believe was wise).
3. It is my feeling that the proposed salary Increase of $250 tax free
per month is way out of line. I believe that paragraph 3 of the reference,
comparing Q/1 with a hypothetical GS-12 is a rather specious and unrealistic
argument. Q/l, although an American, is an agent, and nothing more, and as
you note in your penciled comment the question of quarters, allowances, and
periodic step increases is not relevant. In addition, while I do not subscribe

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his production, the fact
remains that I have not seen any marked improvement during the past two
years in the quality of the material he provides us. As time goes on and
the realistic criteria of what is disseminable and what is not are applied
more and more to his production, and this production in turn remains at its
present level of superficiality, we will see less and less of it qualify for
dissemination. Since he is an FI agent, this has considerable significance,
although it of course does not present the full picture of his capabilities. His
operational intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually
his initial coverage of a subject is very well received and often whets the
appetite of the recipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" never
seems to materialize they get more of exactly the same caliber, but
little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies in QRPHONE /1,
in which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a true
FI agent, but a sort of "operational intelligence butterfly." Perhaps, on the
other hand, the fault lies in RODIGAST's handling of the man, not in terms of
the personal relationship which RODIGAST has been able to build up with him,
but maybe even because of that relationship. I remember when I first talked
with RODIGAST I quickly realized that he felt he knew more than Headquarters
as to what was important for Q/1 to cover and what was not; I am sorry I
missed RODIGAST on his TDY here and when I was in London, and that his
home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself
whether RODIGAST stil felt that way. Whatever the reason, I am by no means
giving up on Q/1, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that
he will have a fair shake at showing what he can do when he is not allowed to
cover the waterfront.
4. What the above paragraph is leading up to, is that I do not in all
honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except
build longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that
newspaper job offered to him (his preference, in any event). However, I do
realize that a man must have an incentive, and would like to propose that we
suggest to LCPIPIT that a more realistic increase might be in the neighborhood
of $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned in paragraph 2 above
might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to Q/1 as a new benefit.
5. Attached for your ready reference is a copy of the QRPHONE quarterly
report for 1 April to 30 June 1969; this is the last one we have received.

1. SUMMARY OF OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING PERIOD: Pursuant to plans
developed as a result of Marie R. LUEBBERT's TDY, QRPHONE/1 made a
continuing effort to deepen his contacts with various African person-
alities connected with the "London group". Although some progress has
been made with persons who seem of secondary importance, QRPHONE/1 still
is unable to gain the confidence of the central characters such as Dennis
Phombeah and Oscar Kambona.
2.
3.
4.
QRPEONY's one week stay in the U.K. was a week of intense activity for
QRPHONE/1 and saw his local "credentials" put to a most demanding test.
QRPHONE/1 performed extremely well throughout the week. See OELA 51297
for details.
-
QRPHONE/1 has been able to monitor the activity of Belgian Communist Rene
Raindorf who is attempting to become a key figure in the Palestinian lib-
eration movement.' See OEPA 2037, 2099 and 2123.
-
Following an overature from a U.S. newspaper QRPHONE/1 made a quick trip
to New York to consult with Headquarters officers regarding the impli-.
cations of this overature on his RVROCK status. See LCPIPIT 4222 and
DIRECTOR 28728 for details.
Through two unwitting female informants QRPHONE/1 was able to obtain re-
porting on the Algiers Cultural Festival. See OELA - 51298.
ORPHONE/1 has continued his monitoring of the activity of various African
liberation movement figures in London.
SPECIFIC MATTERS OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER: QRPHONE/1's vacation
in Italy with his family produced a marked improvement in his domestic
situation with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the
entire operation. This remains a matter of concern and one which will be
carefully monitored.
-
QRPURE is now entering into a more meaningful overt correspondence with
QRPHONE/1, including discussions of his participation in the new magazino.
This will have a positive impact upon QRPHONE/1's cover as a "representative
of QRPURE.
A new means of funding QRPHONE/1's salary is being sought to replace BIKNEE,
which is no longer functioning due to unrelated problems encountered by the
principal agent of that operation. For a review of the security implications
of this matter (which are thought to be minimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178.
ESTIMATE OF AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREE OF ACCESS TO TARGETS: QRPHONE/1's
access to his various targets remains substantially unchanged.
EXTENT TO WHICH AGENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS INCLUDING
INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: QRPHONE/1 has approached all his assignments with
enthusiasm and energy. He has fulfilled these assignments to the maximum

degree feasible - given his cover and the unwitting informant-type nature
of his relationship with his many contacts. QRPHONE/1 makes every effort.
to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply of back-
ground information greatly facilitates his elicitation of added details
from his informants. However, this limitation is one which will always
be with us in the case of QRPHONE/1 and it is one which can sometimes be
particularly frustrating. During the past quarter QRPHONE/1 has been the
source of 11 intelligence reports prepared by LCPIPIT/Reports.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD: ORPHONE/1
will make a trip to Italy in late September and early October in order to
survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. This
trip is one which has been requested by Rome Station. (The trip will have
been completed by the time this report is received by lieadquarters.)
QRPHONE/1's contact with an official of the Eritrean Liberation Front led
to a TDY by AF Division officer Geoffrey B. DRANSTON to brief LCPIPIT on
the ELP and to discuss possible operational exploitation of this contact.
QRPHONE/1's trip to the United States has been deferred until spring 1970
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's return will be
relatively unlikely.
An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by
QRPHONE/1's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation
movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA-2044.
A re-scheduling of QRPHONE/1's trip to Germany has been proposed and
Headquarters and Bonn have been asked for guidance/requirements.
AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIGNMENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,
PERSONAL SECURITY, ETC.: QRPHONE/1's response to assignments, like his
performance, continues to be enthusiastic and energetic. The comments
made in previous quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation
remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and LCPIPIT are able to judge.
7. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING OR CRITIQUE OF HIS
REPORTING TECHNIQUE: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant personality and re-
lates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of
information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a
pleasant and uncomplicated experience. QRPHONE/1 accepts case officer
handling including direction and criticism well and in a constructive
vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. please see pre-
vious reporting on this subject for added details.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROMOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of
We
funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. This has been the subject
of several items of correspondence between Headquarters and LCPIPIT.
plan to consult with the SGFLAG representative in Bern on this matter.
QRPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his Chicago bank (an
apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high
service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is not
able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him
to change banks.
At LCPIPIT's insistance QRPHONE/1 has begun to invest a portion of his
monthly salary in a reputable Mutual Fund of his choice. This modest
investment program will enhance his financial security in the event of
termination and/or a rainy day".

Direct Psychological Assessment
of
ORPHONE/1
1
The psychological evaluation consisted of an extended inter-
view and the JBMINIMUM test. His intelligence as measured by the
JBMINIMUM is within the Bright Normal range by U.S. standards.
The test scores were not as high as would be expected in compari-
son to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due
to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is
working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction
and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal
of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a
- book. His talents are much more in the field of journalism.
Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening
around him. These same traits would serve him well as an access
agent. However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because
his memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events
that are of interest to him. He naturally has good manual-
manipulative skills, plus a practical bent that should enable him
to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques.
-
out of
Emotionally, Subject is fickle. "Out-of-sight
mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for
this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and
liked. Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and
because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely
becomes involved. If separated from someone with whom he is
involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins to
look for another way to satisfy his needs.
An important fact which his case officer should remember is
that he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person
who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his
case officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to
the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense
handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists
authority. He has the tendency to think that he knows it all,
as witnessed by his never completing a degree.

1. As previously reported, we related to JAGUAR the incident
in which Lionel Morrison is believed to have searched
QRPHONE's papers while the latter was out of town.
-
As you know, there have been some indications in the past
which might be taken to suggest that Morrison was a JAGUAR
contact he works for the Daily Telegraph and seems to
be in touch with David Floyd, and on one occasion provided
QRPHONE with a report (on QRPEONY) which came almost
simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up
to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR
would be involved in the harrassment of QRPHONE. Even if
there was no JAGUAR contact with Morrison, however, we felt
it might be possible that JAGUAR could add to our understanding
of this peculiar development from sources available to their
own net. JAGUAR's reply is as follows (CORONET is the agreed
crypt for QRPHONE):
"With reference to your letter of 24th April 1969,
we have been informed by a secret and delicate source
that David M. SIBEKO, the newly appointed P.A.C. rep-
resentative in London, has recently been told by Elias
NTLOEDIBE, the P.A.C. representative in Nairobi, of the
incident of MORRISON's search of CORONET's papers.
According to Elias, MORRISON had written him a letter
in an attempt to blackmail him. Elias told SIBEKO that
what annoyed him was that MORRISON had sent photostat
copies of Elias's own correspondence with CORONET.
"Elias went on to say he was satisfied that MORRISON
must have had covert access to CORONET's personal effects.
Elias' was surprised that CORONET had not replied to letters

he had written to him about the A.N.C. and enclosing
press cuttings. He has asked SIBEKO fo find out if
CORONET got those letters, and to warn CORONET that
MORRISON or someone acting for him has been stealing
mail from his (CORONET's) house.
"Elias speculates that the spy, whoever he is,
may be working for Black Power or Marxist/Leninists
or The Telegraph or even M.I.5., and wants CORONET
told of this.
"Elias has written to MORRISON telling him to go to
hell and that he (Elins) and his friends will stand
by SIBEKO.
"Elias has said that he held no brief for CORONET,
but he notes that CORONET was introduced to the party
by MORRISON and that in June 1968, MORRISON wrote
an article in the Zambian Mail describing CORONET as
a great Afro/American and a great revolutionary.
"According to Elias, CORONET was then living in
London and he recalls that there was correspondence
between CORONET and MORRISON at that time; and that
CORONET used to supply MORRISON with pocket money.
SIBEKO wonders when MORRISON began to work for CIA
and infers that he and his friends should no longer
be taken in by the 'coloureds.'
"In view of the delicacy of the source I should
Be grateful if the above information is not passed
on to CORONET."
2. This reply does not of course answer all our questions,
but it does seem to be in accord with what we know of the
incident from QRPHONE. It seems reasonable to attribute
Morrison's actions to factional fending with PAC - a crossfire
in which QRPHONE happened to be caught.

ORPHONE/1
Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not
be operationally advantageous to have him switch roles, for he
(cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time.
He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could
not cope as effectively with a new one.
Conclusion:
Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive
Individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency
by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a material-
istic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyal-
ties, i.e., the far left or radical movement in this country.
Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life
history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his
future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances.
One statement that can be made is that, given his personality,
it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances.
But if not personally involved with someone from this agency
who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look
Helsewhere for his need satisfactions.

1. As addressees are aware QRPHONE/1 has officially been
denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order
was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A,
which was then receiving money from the Chinese--in violation of
Swiss neutrality. A similar order was also issued at that time
for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.
2.
It is now some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least
overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist. He is not a
member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--
although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of
leftist individuals in pursuit of his operational tasks. QRPHONE/1
has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland--
in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that
if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should
also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1
obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future
operational benefit could be gained if QRPHONE/1 were again able
to enter Switzerland.
3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report
written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy
in London on this matter. We are also forwarding under separate
cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he
formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

4. You will note that the Swiss Embassy suggested that
QRPHONE/1 work through the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have
told QRPHONE/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with
the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working
journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain this from the appro-
priate professional organization (of which he is a member) in
London.
5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy in London will be
forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being
advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which
may come to the attention of Bern Station. Any advice which Bern
Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/1's pursuit of this matter
will be welcome.
6. Of course Bern Station should continue to be guided by
the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss

Mr. Charles Henry Bruggmann,

London, 7.1.
Dear Sir,
17th April, 1969.
Following our telephone conversation & few days njo,
I am now writing formally to you to request that the bon
on my entry into Switzerland be lifted. This ben, whici.
dates from 1963, was never personally directed against me
but against the publication for which I was then working
as an Editor. That publication, 'African Revolution', no
longer exists and I note that its former Algerian publisher,
Me Jacques Verges now visits Switzerland frequently. In
any case I am now in no way connected with Lin.
As you know, I co the overseas representative und
correspondent, based in London, of Negro Press Intern:tional,
the major Negro news and features agency in the United States,
which serves some 270 newspapers. This is a bonic
commercial_journalistic enterprise and serves no political
purpose. I personally in a member of the loreign Press
Association and the Association of American Correspondents
in London and an accredited to the Foreign and Commonses lti.
Office here.
It is part of my duties to report on the activities
of the United Nations and its agencies. I have been, for
many years, accredited at United Nations Headquarters in
New York and I was also an accredited correspondent at the
founding conference in Geneva of UNCTAD. Many important
meetings are scheduled to be held in Geneva daring this your
and I have been asked by my firm to cover these confernces.
Therefore, I ask your consideration and cooperation in

On 15 April 1969, I spoke with Charles Henry Bruggzann,
First Secretary at the Swiss Embassy in London and vio
handles press affairs, by phone. I tried to arrange a persoral
meeting with Bruggman, who insisted on knowing the exact
nature of my business with him. He claimed there was
nothing he could do for me in London, except to forward
a letter from me through channels to the proper authorities
in Berne. (I later sent hin him such a letter.) Braggzann
urged me to work through the U.S. State Department, whi ch
could take up the matter through the Embassy in Berne. If
the U.S. Embassy would only vouch for me as a professional
journalist, Bruggmann added, I would be almost certain to
get the ban lifted.
Naturally, I have made no efforts to contact anyone at
the Embassy in London, but perhaps something might be
done to get the Embassy in Berne to acknowledge at least,
when queried by the Swiss, that I am a bonafide journalist
in the employ of a reputable U.S. nows and features agency?

it odd that he was being treated in that fashion and
suspect that the Home Office was aware of his role which
would not help your relationship with him. Alternatively
(a) would obviously be a nuisance to say the least, so we
felt that the obvious answer was (b) i.e. an extension of

Review of the laboratory studies from the initial dispatch
and the one dated 28 February indicate a definite improvement
of the liver function tests. It is our opinion that the individual
has recovered from his hepatitis and should have no complications
if he continues to follow his doctor's advice as to diet.

Notes on QRPHONE by Harvey B. DAITCHMAN
1.
Revolutionary Image: Discussed, briefly how it is
obtained. Pointed out there is a pattern to it which is dis-
cernable among revolutionaries. It is usually issue oriented
in the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it
gradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical activities
which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work
in an organization. Also connected with this process is the
gradual development of a different "outlook." It is usually a
mixture of idealism and Marxism-Leninism-socialism-Mao Tse-tung
thought. Usually unstructured but developing.
· It is possible in this stage to move from one group to
another without any particular approbation being attached for
this transience. This is particularly so if one starts way
outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite
a different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.
Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study
a variety of revolutionary literature. This can take one into
different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,
socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter
it must be done logically.
2. Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled
contacts which seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection
of info not necessarily one nor always one. Purpose is to lay
ground work for future developments. Purpose to establish certain
contacts which can be later used in either positive or negative
fashion. Structured conversation is also essential. It too
should seek to accomplish something, directed so as to be useful
to future development of op: e.g., desire to have an explanation
for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation
with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation
for interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It is
checkable.
3. Study: Most important aspect in opening phases of op.
Without correct study and without development (understanding)
of "correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,
outside looking in, someone who is useful to them "under certain
conditions," but not someone who is reliable, and not a dependable
revolutionary. This is really the key, the ideological tool,
it will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.
4. Contacts: Those to be exploited now and those to be
used in or for future time. In the beginning the contacts which
are developed are to be used as a means of building his
justification for having begun the serious study of Marx,

explains how and
This must be discussed with people so that many
These conversations will be later used when he
why and when he became interested.
5. Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse
nature. It is necessary to make many contacts. Some will be
more useful than others, but all have potential for use in
one circumstance or another. Since we have no way of knowing
how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek
out, or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume
that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest
in Mao, etc. We can assume that through some of his activities
Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when
we go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their
dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various
things were reported.
Etc.
6. Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions
or detours which might become permanent. This would include
targets of opportunity, etc. Must always maintain correct
operational line and cannot reach target by following various
diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting
marginal intelligence. Must be prepared to sacfrice diversionary
- tasks in pursuit of main goal or objective. If tangential
things are folled up we then have a different op, and a new op
line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for
whole op from beginning to end.
7. Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so
as to insure forward development of op. Something must be seen
emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop-
ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it. Tactics
are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day
running of op. They must be paid attention to, must be contrib-
utory, must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep
in mind that at one or more points it is these details which will
be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION, even if they
may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not the same as
communist logic.
8.
Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be
divided into steps, phases, stages, segments, whatever. Each
phase should dovetail into the next. To some extent a general
outline can be developed. Each of the major phases should
be sub-divided into stages so that they can be dealt with step
by step. For example: Three broad categories:
*1st Phase: All initiatives are ours. We do all the work,
lay ground for future stages. We have a flexible line which
permits making maximum contacts to be correctly exploited. We
give training. Also devise concrete activities for him to carry
out.

Attached find contact and subject reports covering
activities of KULPA during the month of January 1963. The two
outstanding characteristics of this project remain a helter-
skelter operational pattern and the usual difficulties in
administration.
2. We can not really blame KULPA for the former, His
forte is moving around and being able to convince. These two
qualities are rare enough not to demand in too loud a voice
for the third--serious concentration on a long range target.
It is not that KULPA lacks the professionalism, rather it is
the tempo of his personal and professional life that inclines
hin to speed rather than accuracy. As last month was marked by
the stop and go of SCIMITAR/6, so this month was hampered by
the upcoming Congo voyage. It is not that these ventures are
unimportant, it simply remains difficult to judge KULPA's
performance on events occuring outside our area of competence.
3.
We can say nothing new or nothing untrue on the admin-
istrative aspects of the project. The cry is the same from
all small stations--why must so much valuable time be spent on
tiny administrative detail. In KULPA's case the matter is
perhaps compounded by his transfer from Casablance but his
complete file is living evidence of the imbalance of the outside
staffer. In the regular four way breakdown, the file reflects
almost no paper in Plans and Development, Production is not
fat, Operations is fuller but transitory, Support is a swollen,
blistering monster. We see no end to it. Our present agenda
for the next KULPA meeting calls for a discussion of eleven
separate administrative items. One more chestnut and we are
finished. The KULPAS of the world take precise careful case
officoring with sufficient time prior and post the meeting to
bring order: from chaos. It is just this time that a small
station lacks. 80 far, we are glad to state, KULPA seems to be.

On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his
British visa valid until 15 February 1970.
2. Since QRPHONE/1's file at the Home Office indicates an
interest on the part of JAGUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted
prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in
the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily
imply an "agent" status. Of course WOFIRM is not mentioned at all
in this file.) In coordination with London Station it was decided
that a re-newal of QRPHONE/1's one-year visa was preferable to the
granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have
been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum from JAGUAR
to London Station on this matter:
"The choice was between:–
a) an extension of two months
i
L
b)
an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what
was granted to him last year
· c)
that his temporary residence should be made
"unconditional" which would be the normal
procedure if there were no special considerations.
Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/1's cover purposes (c)
would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it
they might think he was being treated over-generously in
view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such

editor (he was unrated) and Michel will re the zuiding genius. Color will be
used for the cover and adds inside, the plates being made in est Gemany. An
Arabic edition will be issued later.
2. Kichel plans to use three photographers for the magazine, înu Laxhdar aka
Dianal (trained in Czech), Dimal Tehandell (if he consents to use a camera
instead of a movie camera), ar mē. (ere) said he had to use Algerians even
they we e not "hotographers", but that he needed no to rack them up technically.)
He has already taken twerty-some photos from me and has riven me a long Histor
others he wants. He has promised to pay 150 francs each to start, with raise
in pay as the mara-ine propresses. I said y present work carns my living, and
a question ofprestice was more important than pay for the o ent. (Comment: I'm
not sure how serious Michel is, nor if he has the authority to use ze. At least
he talks a good game, and he has taker sore hotos to show the diitor for use in
the first few issues.)
3.
Before Michel offered employment on the rapazine, he asked if I would be free
to spend tiree or four weeks in An ola and the Congo with Roberto Hoiden to take
"sev ral thousand" photos which could be used for the next several years in a
continuing campaign for the liberation of Arsola, with me retaining seiling right s

photos of his interview with Ben Bella. I will be there.
4. Michel then said the Atlas once underway would not be his responsibility, just
as he had loosed the reins of Al Shaab once it as started. Then he will publish
an entire series of slitk, one-ti e publications on the various phases of the
Algerian government and its efforts, & photo book on aperia, photo bocks on the

The Congress was officially sponsored by the Algerian
Committee of Solidarity with Palestine.
2. The participants, for the most part, espoused
the Chinese thoses regarding the "People's War" and applied
these theses to the Palestinian struggle. while not directly
criticising the Soviet policies 12 the Middle East, it was
evident in the Congress documents that the Europear militants
sought to do so. For example, they strongly condemned the
United Nations resolutions on the Rettlement of the Middle
East conflict. The main conclusions of the Congress vero:
an acceptance of the Al Fatah as 'eing the only geruine
Palestinian revolutionary organization, and a decition to
croate an information bureau in Algiers which will be run
by Palestinians. The bureau will provide information on
developments in the Palestinian revolution to all the
Palestinian committees throughout the world and to all
revolutionary movements which support the Palestinian people.
In conjunction with those Palestine committees, the fureau
will sponsor meetings, lectures, delates, film shows and an
sonual conference. (Source Comment: Abu el H a cson,

Radical European who attended the Congress. His reporting
has been generally reliable.
Summary: The First International Congress of Palestine
Solidarity Committees in Algiers was sponsored by the
Algerian Committee of Solidarity with Palestine. About 200
dolegates, most of whom vore Western &uropean pro-Chinese
militants, attended the event. In the proceedings of the
Congress these militants sought to apply the Chinese theses
of the "People's Var" to the Palestinian struggle. The
Congress firmly backed the notion that Al Fatah and the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) were one and the
same body with Al Fatah noting as the vanguard body for
bringing about unity among all palestine commando/liberation
organizations. A major decision of the Congress vàs the
acceptance of a Palestinian proposal to create an information
bureau in Algiers. The Algerians claimed that fifteen
countries were represented. There was no list of delegates
and the Algerian hosts went out of their way to resure
anonymity among the participants. End Sugary.
1. The Presler Congres International des Comites
"Palestine" (First International Congress of Palestine Solidarity
Committees) was held at the Club des Pins conference site
ten miles outside of Algiers from 26 to 28 December 1989. It
was attended largely by pro-Chinese militants from Western
Europe. The total number of delegates was 188 -- 148 foreign,
20 Palestinian and 20 Algerian. The French delegation was the
largest one present and the most divided into various factions.

British citizen of Indian descent who is chairman of the pro-
Chingan Brilish-Yig'ṇag Solidarity Frock (B/SZ). (Soure) Comment:
Manchanda confided that ho was not completely satisfied with the
text of the document, but considered it worthwhile nonetueless
because it came close to what he considered vero general Chinese
positions, although it did not condemn the Soviet Union by name..
Abu El Hassen and other Palestinians congratulated Manchanda for
his success in ramming through such a hard-line political
document. Manchanda had in fact dominated the final plenary
session of the Congress on 28 December which voted affirmatively
on the declaration, \ On un» occasion during the discussions in the
Political Commission, Yazid tried to persuade the Commission
(whose revolutionary commitments he claimed to share) that it
should go easior in its condemnations of the United Nations.

will exploit this interest. After he has completed first phase
we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese. In
these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology;
is interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.
Will use as negative examples: his book, Panthers, some aspects
of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature
of most revolutionary activists in U.S., particularly among the
blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is
made. However, will seek their help to further his study and
will indicate recognition of need to return to U.S. in order
to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle. At this
stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese. We will be
able to determine whether we can expect progress or not. If
they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide
his further study, to help him. Through this help they will
be able to see the development which has taken place. We should
get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a
couple of meetings. If we are shut out then must make ops
judgement from that point on--can always target against Soviets
and use Chinese as negative example. If they are interested
we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in essence
the more initiative we lose to them, the more they try to
direct him, the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is
our objective--one of them. He must continue his study.
3rd Phase: Continue his study; continue his contacts all
around, but by now should have significant contacts and can
dispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain
of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking
to study after which he wants to return to U.S. and take active
role.
Recognize that this may be a sticking point. We don't
want him here. However, this idea has to always be in the
forefront as far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they
have little reason to be interested in him. This MUST appear to
be his goal. We may be able to circumvent it later for one
reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back
temporarily. This decision must be reserved for that time.
These stages and sub-stages must be further divided if
we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry
it out correctly. Each action he is asked to undertake must
be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another
step. The whole op goes STEP BY STEP. We do not insert
unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but
may be difficult. This is a waste of time. We only seek to
do what is possible--possible is what can be turned into reality.
Emphasis must be made on "step by step" approach and must
be maintained. Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to
accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM. For

th Federation disbanded, other oprosition dispersed or too unorganised to be
effective, and the people persuaded to give Bar Bella's govemment a lengthy

emerging froʻprison, Bor. Balla is getting six or seven hours sleep per mant.
He is relaxed, confidert.

2. Algeria's greatest probles now is reconstruction of the economy, incluing.
housing, agricultrual refor, dire and irrigation, and so se roads. In this
respect, foreign aid is essential. He wishes that talks with the U.S. could
start as soon as possible, and feels the best method to do this is to have an
econda delegation visit Alieria to see on the spot the noods and special
conditions. (He re'sato: several times that he wished the talks co ld start
as soon as possible.) is for aid, he does not wish aid "which will help us
eat better or have a higħer sta'dard of living" but rather aid "dich vill
be of a developmental, constructional type" to permit the Algerian esonoz;
to hr lp itself. In reply to the question whether he hoped more zid would
cow from the U.S. than from Russia, he said "I hope so, I hope so." (He
gave the all-ht impression he felt the U.S. was much better equipped to aid..
The preliminary estimate of the goverment co mittes for the resinstruction
↑ Algeria is one hundred billion france. This figure
might go higher, but the final figure will be what Algeria will ask from France
in additional help over the next two years. He stressed his appreciation for
the American Athassador. 'r. Porter, saving one of his most valuable qualities
is that he actually loves 1's Algerian people, a truit extremely appreciate i
by his and the Algerian. ¡eople.
3. The above he p is in addition to the regular agministrative budget and
the operational budget. The adtinistrative budget of 280 billion francs is
a balanced budget, with receipts -o maially because of the new taxse-expected
without fail to equal expenditures. de mentioned several ti es that Algeria
is too proud to ask anyone albe to pa. its adsinistrative budget, 1.e., pa its
running exenses.
4. On the question of the counoy, there will be a code cotablished soon which
will delimit the private and public sections of the eco?«arty • He was posted that
some people do not believe there will be a private section, and said "People
will someday 1 arm to take ne at gy word. if I didn't mean it, I didn't have to
say it. And if I change my kind, I will say that too, and I dll give the
reasons. But, there will be aprivate section of econoxxy, and we do want foreign
private invest¬ant."
Land reform in Algeria is and will be an experiment never tried anywhere.
here will be both collective and state faro-Ben Bella does not bellev in
giving land to individual peasa ta because cu -up plots are econuically
un-productive. And in any case, the question of comunal lands has bear, a tritel

example: He has read Marx and Lonin. We might say he's quite
familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and
after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this
is true. He could say it and act like he and others thought
a Maoist should act. However, appearance and essence are not
synonomous. It might appear to non-Maoists that our troop is a
Maoist because he can talk as good a game as anyone else--or
better than those who have not studied as much--but the essence
of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialities.
Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist so contained.
He cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find
acceptance with the Maoists. They know the process it takes to
get there: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good
results." (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.)
9. Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand
correctly how they wield their weapon, the dialectical method,
it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp.
Through proper study and understanding we can devel op and promote
Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists
he will be much more acceptable and his intel product will
probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might
not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and
also he will have better recognition of key developments in
Marxist world through better understanding of their reality.
Some activities which we might consider enroute.
1.10.
a.
Start His Own Study Group: Chinese would be very
interested. Unlike most study groups with which I am familiar
he would stress study of ideology--in correct way. However, to
prevent them from profiting from such study they can be tied in
knots for months dealing with a variety of ideological problems.
There is no point in our developing for their use good
revolutionaries. However, it would provide reason for frequent
contact with Chinese in order for them to help him in the
development of his group. Would probably lead him into contact
with other interesting types. Might have it for "Americans
only" abroad--to avoid problems with Brits: whatever:
b. Might Talk About Starting a One Man Institute for
Studying African Revolution: could put out a four page broad-
sheet for peanuts. It would discuss various African problems.
His book gives him good reason for such study. He might draw
one or two people to him. Can use this too as basis for approach
to Chinese. He will have come to recognize that he had not
painted the true picture of national lib struggle in his book
and through his broadsheet he seeks to rectify some his ideas.
C.
He could seek to do another book on "The Dialectics
of African Revolution." Here again the help of various communists,
Marxist-Leninists, and particularly the Chinese in providing
guidance (correct guidance) would give him frequent access and
contact--providing the Chinese are willing to help.

million hestars of Biem Taoente (abandoned French landa) now belig put into
production. He contrested this with the resistance of the Russian peasant
which caused the slaughter of xi lions of Russians from which Fundian
agriculture has not yet recovered". He feels even if prodiustior on thees

worth it, sines the profits won't go to on, rich class which spends the money
on the Riviera but will greatly boost the peasants' standard of living.
In this respet, he was definitely not in agreement with Prof. I·mont's
major criticisms of Algeria given on ♬ January, and co told t e professor in
private.
6. With respect to Cuba, He was disappointed to return home to find that the
nisale bases did exist. His main hope in visiting Cube-as he told President
Kennedy quite frankly but¨@ Prostly was to help lower tepentures. He had
advised President Kennedy not to invade, andhe had advised Castro to be more
discreet in acceptance of are. The and result was not disappointment, however,
sings "no man em be disapointed if a relear var has been avoided.".
7. The U.S. reaction to the Yaman revolution disappointed his also, and he felt
ULS. early actions were distakes. It had appeared relations between Cairo
and Kashington were going to well prior to the Yeran crisis, andit had been
a shans to ruin good relatione. U.S. rosognition of the Republic of Yemen
however was highly valcome to him, and he feels this will do much to return
U.S./Cairo relations to the previous high plane.
6. With respect to a United North Africa, he feels the time to act is now on
a cultural and economic leval. He feels identical textbooks, exshange of
teachers, cult ral exchanges, lowering of frontier curtos and administrative
barriers, ete. will start a movement which in the and will fare constantly
greater unity, even if the politicians don't really feal the time is ripe.
He feels this is especially true in education and the exchange of economie
advantages, such as procud ng electricity from Oujda for Marnia or flexsen
instead of from Oran.
•
9. "Upon his honor as a man” he swore he nor any Algorian had anything to do with
the attempted assassination of Bourguibs. He also felt sure the two Youssefista
in Algeria, who are good friends of his, had not ing to do with it. He felt his
friendship with these two persona ught have led to plus suspicions that
Algeria was involved. He said "th t is not my way, and I have too many problems
of my own to middle in Tunisian af'airs. It was a plot mounted andsupported in
Tunisia itself."

Sotif when 65,000 people were slaughtered, which marked his entry into polities.
That action branded him for life, and he realised that forse was the obly answer

to leave for Koronto on 9 January, but stared over to get an interview with
Bam Balla stish was to be arranged, or "guaranteed" as he put it, by Bonglin.
From there he is to go to the States. I asked him what he was doing here, and
The replied just traveling. Dooglin hadto'i no he was a sociologist with a study
grand, but Schleifer denied home a sociologist, volunteering nothing about a
grant. He told me Gibson was staying in ligions to put out & Law paper callod
a
"Afrique Revolution" which was to be a big, alick publication with many photos
and a selling price which would enable it to replace Jeune Afrique throughout
Africa. When I asked about finsning, he said the Algeries goverment wa

photographer at a maminal salary. I replied I would be interested more from the

at the moment as plans are now being made for the Algerian army to ensure the

view which may be called ultra-revolutionary. For example, in his legal
defence his theory was always to Matify an sol of killing by an accused

Almost from the very beginning and in any case from 1951 Vergon

31 Jan 63
1: Jean Marie Boeglin: Saw hin three times, his home, office of Remintion
Africaine, and Brasserie en Barry, 30-31 Jama ry. He Erranged meeting with
Janques Verges, Director of Revolution Afrique, having told Verges that I
was "practically a militant" who would work wall for the cause instead of
the salary. He also offered me the "exclusive" job as photographer for the
Information Bureau of Diens Vacants, with all expenses for trips ete paid
for by the ministry, but with very little extra salary. I eccpted, saying
that was a good method to study the reforme agraire deeply for an ice.
Yves Kathica vill be my boss in that job. Dooplin the took me to the Opera
there no nas an office in capacity as Technical Director of the Katáonal
Theatre. He requested me to furnish kin with photos he could use for the
Theatro posters and for the programs for the first production sedued in
mid-March. I agreed.
2. Jacques Vergest Saw him 1100 31 Jan in the office of Esvolution Afriqning,
of which to is director. Yadıma Raban bitat is to be the editor in chief of
this publication. Verges immediately offered me a job as a regular salariei
photographer of Evolution or as a piece-Real photographer. I indicated I
thought payment by the job was better, girse my cover outfit is not "liberal"
as I am. Regular salary for everyone on the paper, from the lowest secretary
to Verges himself, as decided by Verges, is to be 100,000 francs per month.
Ky job payments dil emount to about that much. I will take a trip ones a wook
with Goorges Armo (phonetic) to do photos on the feature article on Algeria
for each wock's publication. Verges also ordered six photos femmes from ny
contest prints, and took one photo on the spot for the cover of the second
Lesung due cut 9 February. The cover of the firstiscas of 2 February is to
be a photo of Lumaba. Verges took us around to introduce me to the rest of
the staff—all allen characters who hardly cald ballɔ with the exception of
Cinat, the ex-Express cartoonist-and showed no the physical legunt. He imkan
invited me to the opening cocktail party for Saturday night also. Eosglin inter

him from Botras' house. Michol had with him "an FLN responsable” wao wasbyto
comission ne to produce the photos for an FLN publication, click style one-whot
but presented as a "weekly", on Algerian women. He set up a meting for Saturday
morning to discuss it. We will take a trip into the Entgle area to start these
shots of women.
4. Bjanal Tchanderii: Saw his jom tom, said he wanted to discuss something
important with me, made date for tonight, but he didn't show. Will see him tomo:

Eleiman is in New York since Christmas with rumored sick wife-ha may be getting

1、 Sorge Michel: Saw him Aletti hotel, his house, and three times my house.
He says Yazid is de facto Minister of Information now, and will become Minister
of Information over the mxt for weeks or month. Michel stayed with Kl Chanb.
long enough to get it on its foot, then moved on to plans for Atlas. When Atles
is established, he will move on again to looks on Algeria and ene-shot publications.
He is ming to the Congo in early April for a week to gether material for articles
on Angoia and the fongo. He is taking the line that Kennedy and thrusthey are
"allies", with De Gaulle and Hao as enemies; thms Algeria should not ea prort nor
attack either one too much. He feels the Afrique Revolution is making political
mistakes in this respect by attacking the United States (presumably with an
article en Meredith & Mississippi) and can be termed the extreme left in Algeria.
He foels Afrique Revolution will be taken over by Atles staff in six months or
less, and run on aless violent basis. Serge talked of his ancestore, soling they
voro all from Georgia, and that a translator was used when he talksċidth his
grand parents who only spoke Georgian not Emssian. He is an apatride with a
Moroccan passport (which I saw but uldn't get the mumber) which contains his
nationality as Moroccan, as opposed to other Moroccan passports for Algerians
which have the nationality lined through. His father was apatrids also, and
Serge claims he feels more for Algeria than any other country. He arrived hare
the first time when he was 20 years old, and from that time lived with Algerian
robais. He is Al years old now. He has three boys, about one par, four and
oix, all with Russian first names, and occupies a vilza in Ryer. His wife
speaks French with an accent, Russian I believe. His infant is very sick with
athena.
2. Richard Gibson & wifes Saw them in his office es result of his request for
photos for Dave Watts in New York for the latteris Liberatos" publication, which
is a click, leftist publication with a format something like a cross botenen
Newsweek and The New Yorker. I gave him fourphotos without my name, but be
ingisted on putting my name on the back for credit. He said Katts would pay r
directly, since he had my address already. He also said I would probably get
photo requests from London from a person whose name he didn't remember. This
person and Katte are also correspondants for Afrique Revolution in their cities.
Ere. Gibson is white, and appeared to me to be jaress, probably from Bycöklyn,
Judging from her accent. However, she could be foreign since the accumb is
difficult to place. Eduardo dos Santos was in the office, but wasn't very friendly.
Gibson know of my trip to Angola, probably from dos Santos da the Congo embassy
in Tunis, and wanted some photos when I returned.
3. Joan Mario Boggling Boeglin phoned me, after having missed a lunch son uith
me last week. He has acted on my request to speak to Jacques Verges about usins.
me when possible for Afrique Revointion. Verges is to meet me tomorrow to discuss
photos. I am to bring ons--violent action if possible thich is to be used as the
first cover of Rev.union, if it is a suitable phot). Boeglin will be there, and
we are to meet today to plan the conversation with Verges to make sure I benefit.
4. Djnal Tehanderli: (brother of U.H. 'Chanderli, although name spelled differently).
He came to my home with Kichel. He is going to the Congo to film Angolans in
March, and wanted my agreement not to film for my cover company while there.
Finally agreed, extracting a promise from him that be would not take myphotos,
thus leaving me that monopoly in exchange for the film monopoly. He & Michal real

Abroad: This would give him contct with a wide variety
of radical U.S. types abroad. It would also have feed back
into the American scene and in part fulfill his requirement to
have an active role with U.S. revolutionary developments.
Etc.
Etc.
e. There are other activities which he might also
undertake. The above are a few ideas of what we can do to
"promote" QRPHONE. He can do a number of different things
at the sametime since much of it overlaps and is hence com-
patible. However, each must be structured, carefully handled,
with great attention to the details. STEP BY STEP.
✓ Some Words of Caution: Our experience clearly indicates
that it is incorrect to rely upon either the agent or the
station to provide the impetus. This seems to be true for a
number of reasons. Case officers change often, chiefs of ops,
bases, or stations change--there is not much continuity. We
are thinking of a long term operation which, as it grows,
becomes very complex. It is not easily understood by someone
who gets involved after it has been going for sometime. It is
even more true of changes in station leadership whose attitude
is largely developed on his subjective feelings from reading
only cable traffic. The initiative, the operational ideas,
etc. are best kept in Hqs. There is so much more information
here to work with, people with whom one can talk, staffs, etc.
Also most officers in the field simply do not have the time to
sit down and plan in the kind of detail that is needed to
continue and develop the op. It calls for solid knowledge of
the communist reality in order to insure that no errors creep
in those contacts he may make. It calls for someone to have the
time to read, study, certain publications, articles, etc., and
then to figure out whether or not a given publication or article
can be used to make a useful contact, write a useful letter, etc.
If so, how, and then go the field with the idea, and concrete
directions about how it should be used. Case officers most
likely won't be exposed to the same material and probably wouldn't
have the planning time necessary, or the various resources of
Has to do what needs to be done.
This is not to suggest that the field has nothing to say.
However, if the understanding can be clearly made that this is in
fact a joint operation, with Hqs having an opportunity for big
input, with the understanding that the only thing which matters
to all concerned is the correct development of the operation in
the given concrete conditions and not either the Hqs or the field
trying to establish some kind of supremacy of rights over the
other--there is a good chance of success.

1. LCBEFORE reported on 17 January 1964 that Subjecte, both of
whom are mentioned in reference dispatch concerning Révolution
Africaine (GIBSON is a US citizen) and were working from that
publication's Lausanne office, have left Switzerland at the request
of the Swiss Unvernment. According to LCBEFORE, VERO29 departed
Switserland on 25 November 1963 for Latin America (possibly Brasil
and GIBSON departed on 15 December 1963.
2. LCBEFORE believes that in part it can take credit for
these axpulsions in view of the faot that LCBERES-inspired publi
oity about Revolution Africaine has appeared in the Swiss prees
and that this publicity helped to draw the matte: to the Swiss
authorities' attention, thus prompting them to expel these twɔ
propagandists.
3. LCBEFORE also noted on 17 January 1964 that the November
1963 issue of Révolution Africaine lists Lausanne as a burea.
(and Paris as the Main Office) whereas the Cotuber 1953 iseue
listed Lausanne as the Main Office and Faris as one of the
bureaus.

2. SKIMPISH also remarked to me, on one recent occasion,
that he bad learned that Richard GIBSON had been expelled froe
the staff of Revolution (as is indicated here), but the reason
that SWIE PISH gave Des that GIBSON had been accused of working
un behalf of "subversive" elements, which SMIMPISH implied to
mean BARK. Maybe SMIMPISH was speculating on or misquoting
this JAGUAR report. I haven't been able to go back to SMIMPISH

Reports received from a number of sources make it clear
that "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" has been in difficulties
for several months and it appears that the last issue wre No. 11 dated
March 1964. The trouble began, apparently, when the French authorities
seized copies of issue No. 7 of the French edition, "Re slution", dated
March 1964 because of in article is contained on French overseas
territories. Creditorn became alarmed, fearing that the publication
sight be banned, and demanded settlement of their debts lub ware than
estimated to exceed £10,000. Jacques VERGES, the publication's
Director, tried to effect administrative economies in order to cope
with the situation but according to VERGES, Richard GIBSCH, the
Editor, argued that the Chinese should be asked to pay the debts.
Hatters worsened when, again according to VERGES, GIBSON persuaded the
Lausanne printer to write to Peking and ask the Chinese to settle the
publication's debt to tin. VERGES regarded 135ON's cotivities as
deliberately dismptiv: and designed to produce proof of China's
support for the publio.tion.
2.
Also, VEGIS complained that GIBSON was working for
Communist splinter groups in Europe to the detriment of the
international Communist movement, and that he was dealing tactlessly
with the magazine's agents and contributors. The situation was such
that VERGES visited the U.K. in rid-July to discuss the position with
PAR, who is now Minister of
State for Development Cunning of the United Republic of Tanganyika
and Zanzibar, was in. Inden for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers'
Conference.
201-33923 RABU, a member of the Mitorial Board.
3.
In July 1964 there were rumours that the English edition
had gone bankrupt but these were denied by GIBSON who sugested that
the English and French editions should be mano quite separate, and that
the former should be ablished in London. At about this time the split
between VERGES and GIISON became complete and the latter was removed
from his position as Lliter and from the Editorial Board, which issued
the following "varing ':-

"Colgradas from New York, London and Accra (Ghana)

These charges have been confirmed and underlined by

Richard GIBSON from all his responsibilities and expell
him from the Clitorial Board.

AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA
REVOLUTICH
ap
Oxicia
The monthly publication "Africa, Latin America, Asis Revolution".
is the successor to "African Revolution" which was the monthly English
digest of the Algerian weekly "Revolution Africaine". "Revolution
Africaine", which is published in French, first appeared in February
1963 with the declared aim of helping is build soolalim in Africa. I
order to increase its effectiveness it segan to publish a meathly edition,
"African Revolution", consisting largely of material selected from previous
issues of "Revolution Africaine". The editorial office of "African
Revolution” was established in Lausanne, Switzerland by March 1963 and the
first issue appeared two months later.
2.
Then the first editor of "Revolution Africaine", Jacques Mansour-
VEROES, was replaced by Mohamed HARBI in May 1963, ho left Algiers and
took control of "African Revolution" in Lausacne. After two issues had
been published the connection between it and "Revolution Africaine" was
covered and "African Revolution" becaze "Africa, Latin America, Asia
Revolution". In December 1963 the editorial board moved from Lausame to
Paris, and the publication now appears monthly in English and French,
although the two editions are not identical. The former is printed in
Switserland and the latter, which carries the title "Revolution", is printed
in Paris.
"Editorial Polloy of "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution
3.
The Editorial "Europe too . . in issue No. 8 (December, 1963)
urged the European working-class movement to take up the revolutionary
struggle. Thus "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" made it clear that
it intended its message to have a world-wide application. At first,
however, it had directed its attention to the destruction of colonialism in
Africa and the establishment of national independence and socialism, and
had later acknowledged the logic of its arguments by changing its title to
"Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution".
4.
To begin with, "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" did not
give the impression that it was advocating any particular brand of
socialism. The Editorial on "Ideology" in issue No. 3 acknowledged the
existence of various types of socialism in Africa and recognised that they
were based on the "profound logic of experience". In time, however, it-
became increasingly apparent that the publication was lending its support
to the Harxist-Leninist theory of revolution, and the Chinese Communist
interpretation of it. The principal article in issue No. 7 (November, 1963)
which had the anodyne titie "Third World? Which Third World?", was largely
an exposition of the Chinese Communist attitude towards the national
liberation movement, drawing material and inspiration from the Chinese
Communist Party's document "A proposal concerning the general line of the
International Communist Movement". (This was the lotter, dated 14th June
1963, from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; it is a major
document in the ideological dispute between the two parties.) The article
contained the following quotation from the Chinese letter:
"The various types of contradictions in the contemporary world
are centred in the vast areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America;
these are the most vulnerable areas under imperialist rule and
the storm-centres of world revolution dealing direct blows at
imperialism.

As if to emphasise the extent of Chinese influence in the publication's
policies and at the same time to doniprato those Communist Parties which
supported the Soviet line, the Mitorial in issue No. 8 referred
scornfully to "the proponents of the peaceful road to socialism" and the
#truason of the revisionista", and proclaimed the end of the "isolation
in which revolutionary Marxista have been held tocause of t'as.
revisionism of the leaderships of the Communist parties", Clearly,
therefore, "Afrios, Latin Amerios, Asiá Revolution" supports the Chinese
Communist argument that it is most unlikely that socialism can be
achieved by peaceful moans.
5. "Africa, Latin America, Asia revolution" has for the most part
shunned theoretical discussion, although issue No. 9 (January, 1964) has
a heavier ideological content than previous issues. It has made its
appeal in oxtranoly practical tormas its range of subjects has been wido
and by no means confined to politics. Appendix A contains a list of the
artioles, and the names of their authors, which have appeared in issues
1 - 2 of "African Revolution" and issues 3-9 of "Africa, Latin America,
Asia Revolution".
Chinese Support and Influence
6. When VERGES was in Peking in the early part of 1963, the Chinese
agreed to take out 3,000 subscriptions to "African Revolution" and these
were in due course transforred to "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution".
It is quite likely that this was a form of subsidy and, initially, when
the publication sold for 5s. Od., it was worth £750 a month. An artiole in
"Mewsweek" dated 9th Karch 1964 refers to a report that the Chinese Embassy
in Berne provided the publication with £25,000 in 1963. In addition,
each issue has contained at least one full pago advertisement of Chinese
Communist publications. In those circumstances, it is not surprising
that it has been stated that the Chinese are in a position to control to
some extent what appears in "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" but
no clear, reliable information is availablo to show how this is done. The
publication has also had contact with the Chinese through Abdul Rahman
Mohamed BABU, a member of the Editorial Board who is now Minister for
External Affairs and Tradə in Zanzibar. He visited China in 1960, became
the East African correspondent of the Now China News Agency in 1961 and
went to China again in October 1963.
Oban Support

▲ Spanish edition of the publication was envisaged as early as
May 1963 and it has been reported that members of its staff have been in
touch with Cuban diplomats in Europe with a view to the latter editing the
proposed Spanish edition. There is however, no confirmation that it has
yet been published in Spanish. It may be that this Cuban connection was
of assistance in providing the pictures of the Cuban revolution which
appeared in issue No. 3 (July, 1963).
Contact with the Communist Splinter Group in the U.K.
8.
By the end of 1963, "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" had
established contact with the Communist splinter group in the U.K. which
is sympathetic to the Chinose line in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
Publications of this group - the British Committee to Defeat Revisionism,
for Communist Unity – were advertised in issues So. 8 and 9. An articlo
on "The Fight Against Revisionism" by Michael McCreery the leader of the
group was publishod in issue No. 9.

Agent Profile
-
QRPHONE/1
12
:
QRPHONE/1 is an American citizen and a singleton agent
who has been a recruited asset for some seven years. He has
extensive contacts among leftist, radical, and communist
movements in Europe and Africa and was able to sustain his
relations with many such figures for operational purposes
in spite of a formal disassociation some years ago.
Originally a member himself of a radical pro-communist
group, his disenchantment with internal personal and
political dissension in an organization to which he had
firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an
operational relationship with the Agency. Although targeted
after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical
elements in Europe, essentially for intelligence collection
purposes, QRPHONE/1 has recently been redirected toward the
Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and
seeking their guidance and support as he demonstrates an
interest in more effectively acting on their behalf. Our
ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland
China which will lead to successively higher echelons of
contact within the Chinese Government.
To prepare QRPHONE/1 for this demanding task, extensive
retraining, assessment and remotivation were recently
accomplished and selective recontact was made by him with
his more influential and pertinent communist contacts.
Reactions to QRPHONE/l's alleged desire to more fully commit
himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance
rendered thus far by these communist contacts are encouraging
indicators of the potential success of this agent to achieve
our goal.
Although a complex man to manage operationally because
of his own background and the mix of his ideological and
professional motivations, QRPHONE/1's intelligence ano
personality are such as to well equip him to meet the
challenge of the tests the Chinese are likely to throw his
way. He is based in England, as is his case officer, and
operational meetings are held in secure safe sites, sometimes
on the continent.'
QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intelligence reports
on communist and radical targets in addition to his covert
action functions as a journalist and author. His long-term
tenure with the Agency will be determined in part by the degree
of success of his new Chicom directions.

The following information was received
in the first half of October 1964 from a source in alese
Souch with Richard GIBSON, the former Editor of "Africa,
Latin America, Asia Revolution".
20
GIES was aware that a mumber of people hed
thought that the Chinese Communists had provided some
financial backing for "Africa, Latin Anerios, Asia Revolution",
but this was true only to the extent that the Chinese had e
standing order for 3,000 copies of each issue of the English
edition. If the Chinese had given more general finmcial
assistance VERGES, the publica:imm's Director, would not have
hed to contend with the present financial difficulties and
possible bankruptcy.
3.
VERGES bai hat 2ccess to a relatively large
sum of money which had been held in Switzerland from the time
of the Algerian war of indepentance. When this had dried up
VERGES had been unable to repl wish it. Reports that VEROES
had stolen this money were not true.
4.
The publication owed $2,000 Swiss france to
a business-man, possibly Swiss, named KS and 30,000
france to the French printers. In GIESM's view too much
money had been spent on maintaining prestige offices at
40 rue François ler, Paris.
5.
When "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution"
vas banned in Switzerland all except 100 copies of issue No. 12
were seized by the Sviss mithorities. These 100 copies had
already been sent to GIBSON.
6.

The following information was receivod
in the first half of Cotober 1944 from a source in olose

CIESCH AS aware that a number of people had
thought that the Chinese Communists had provided so
financial backing for "Africa, 'atin America, Asia Revolution",
but this was true only to the _ tent that the Chines had a
standing order for 3,000 copies of such issue of the English
edition. If the Chinese bad giren more general financial
assistance VERCES, the publication's Director, would not have
had to contend with the present financial difficulties and
possible bankruptcy.

sus of money which had been held in Switzerland from the time
of the Algerian var of independence. When this had dried up

had stolen this money were not true.
4.
The publication oved 40,000 Sviss francs to
a business-man, possibly Swiss, named KESSEL and 30,000

money had been spent on maintaining prestige efficon at

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1
1. On 24 July 1972, Andy Ness (in alias as Andy),
Frank Falko (in alias as Frank) and the undersigned
(in alias as Ken) converged on the OTR safesite in
New York City to meet with QRPHONE/1 in order to debrief
him on his trip through WOCORK.
2. The discussion was started by having QRPHONE
relate the details of his trip on a city by city basis
describing the people he met and his reception by them.
It should be noted here that several of the individuals
that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or
unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these
individuals in order to maintain his relationship with
them.
b
NEWARK
QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home
and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.
QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make
a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-
Leninist (M-L) doctrine in order to become more
proficient in M-L theory and would like to join
the RU to further this ambition. Bergman's reaction,
according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic. Bergman
gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the
same as the literature Andy gave him several
weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.
Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested
in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should
return to WOCORK because that "was where all the
inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

take part in some M-L study groups but didn't
say what exactly would be studied. The
following are some general comments QRPHONE
provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like
Newark, he has been mugged several times and
would like to go back to California; however,
that is not possible at this time, so Bergman
will instead move to New York City. Bergman
is pleased with the current development of the
RU. He said that the recent trip to China by
several RU members was successful and that the
trip had been pleasant for them. QRPHONE
commented that it appears that Bergman does not
have the same control of the RU that he formerly
had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of
the RU.
NEW YORK
QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting
to sell the English language rights of
Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.
Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to
purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy
toward Wilfred Burchett, "that old Communist"
according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett
apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't
want to publish anything with his name on it.
QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and
convinced him to at least read the manuscript of
the book before he turned it down. Ward has a
South Vietnamese student living with him as a
combination houseboy/companion. This student,
whose name is David Truong, is the son of the
South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong
Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election
on a peace platform and who is now in prison.
QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large
collection of books on intelligence, that the
books are expensive and that he doesn't have any
idea where the money to buy the books came from.
He also said he doesn't think Truong has
immigration papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I
asked if Truong was in any way involved with the
recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE
stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have
known something about the attempted hijacking
because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's
apartment.

GEGRET RYDAY
Ward is going to France soon for a vacation
with a girlfriend he refused to identify because
he feels his apartment and phones are bugged
"by at least ten intelligence agencies." Before
he goes on vacation he intends to stop in Paris
and meet with DRV and PRG officials as well as
with Wilfred Burchett. (Ward also met with
Jane Fonda prior to her recent trip to the DRV).
Ward will try to visit. QRPHONE in London sometime
in September before he returns home Ward
claimed that a "wealthy benefactor" gave him some
$1000 to cover the cost of his vacation. Ward
himself is broke and makes only about $60 per
week salary.
DETROIT
QRPHONE was unable to see Milton Henry,
leader of the New Republic of Africa, who was on
vacation in Japan. He did manage to see
FNU Boggs, who is apparently no longer involved
with radical organizations but who is acting as a
clearinghouse for black and white radicals.
QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire
and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.
Boggs' feeling about the black radical movement
is that it is in considerable disarray.
CHICAGO
QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/1 who told him that he,
was trying to get an invitation to visit China.
LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would,
see about taking him along. This was the first k
that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/1's plans.
QRPHONE was unable to see either Sidney Lens or
Hal Block because they were out of town. He did
corroborate the fact that Block had recently
been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with
Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation
to China. Wright is now a full-time RU official
responsible for organizing RU cells in the
Mid-West and seems committed to revolution
although he doesn't speak in M-L terminology.
Wright stated that one problem now facing the RU
involves national exposure, i.e., getting
minorities to become involved with the RU.

It was reported that Emmza Alavi resigncé bacanda to sh
to the publication's pro-Chincce attitude. An internat
further change came with the appearance of issub Ee.16/11
Last July in which was prominently published a "Communique
Announcing the Almingel from the Advisory Board of Fichard
bron The Communique accused Richard Cina,
is an American Negro, of having "used his former position an
secretory to the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee” to inditrate
the International Revolutionary Hovement". Some details of
personalities are given at appendix.
% In Révolution No. 12 it is claimed that the total issue
of the new and enlarged bi-monthly magasine, including French
English and Spanish editions, will be 50,000. However, since
his dismissal, Richard Gibson has stated that, during his time.
on the magazine, shile about 20,000 copies of the French edition
were printed, the top sale of may issue was never more than
7,500 copics. In the case of the April No.8 issue, he says
that the total sale in France was 3,000 copies. The prices
of Revolution are given an: Africa: 2.5 dirham, 2.5 diners,
150 C.P.A. Europe: 4.50 Francs.
This represents a 15%
increase in the price of the French edition.
But this in
accompanied by a lowering of the price by 35% in countries
of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Those taking out annual
subscriptions are informed that they are entitled on request
not only to make use of Revolution's Documentation Centre
International Workers' Kovamant and the Struggle for National
Liberation, but also to free copies of the magasine Poking:
Information. Those taking out a long-term subscription not
will also be entitled to "publications in foreign languages
from Peking".
8. A main feature of issue No.12 is a leading article by
Jacques Verges entitled "Hiroshina, plus jamais!" Possibly
by coincidence, this was published at the same time as the

ATLANTA
QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King
Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin
Luther King Foundation, where he met with
Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization.
There was recently a split in the Center and the
Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out
of office. The office is still vacant and,
according to Porter, will remain so for the
immediate future. The reason for the continued
vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and
other members of the Board of Directors to
maintain direct control. Porter is a former
writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said
that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how.
QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a
brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said
that the Center is going to establish a foreign
affairs staff which will be headed by Jack O'Dell,
an old CP member.
3. After QRPHONE's discourse on his trip, Andy
discussed in broad terms what he could expect in the
next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese.
QRPHONE was told that once he was proficient in M-L
he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge
with various individuals and organizations in order to
gain access and become known to the Chinese. Andy
emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have
to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he
was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE
accepted this.

minority groups should form their own
organizations separate from the RU. QRPHONE
said Wright is very bitter toward the Black
Panther movement and thinks that Eldridge
Cleaver is "bad" and that Huey Newton and
Bobby Seale are "corrupt".
SAN FRANCISCO
In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with
Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared
in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin
Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated
into the English the entire Fundamentals of
Political Economy. He was once a member of the
RU.
Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as
she was several months ago, even though her brief
exposure to the world of labor union organizing
was a failure. Her comments about the RU were
to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos
Organization) which she said is going to bring
disaster to the whole RU because of its
predilection for violence before the groundwork
for revolution has been laid. Fineman feels that
Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild
and erratic than in the past and has in fact
become a good M-L.
QRPHONE saw Paul Richards, Hodee Edwards'
son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from
the Mid-West, which he left because of the people.
He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the
country where the Government ought to test nuclear
warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose.
Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he
must have caused some embarrassment to the
delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet
African revolutionaries, particularly members of
the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow-
oriented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send
him material on the various African liberation
movements. Lee Rose works for Bell Telephone
Company although Earl, her husband, is unemployed.

SUBJECT
:
ORPHONE/1
1. Attached is the psychological assessment of ORPHONE/1.
A preliminary verbal read-out was given on 7 July in which it
was stated that Subject was an emotionally stable individual.
We still support this statement, but a more in-depth analysis
revealed there are certain aspects of his personality that are
susceptible. These are discussed in the report. If any part
of the report is unclear or requires further discussion, please
contact us. Meanwhile, we would appreciate receiving follow-
up information on Subject's performance in order to help us refine
and improve our methods of assessment.

ORPHONE/1
Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not
be operationally advantageous to have him switch roles, for he
cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time.
He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could
not cope as effectively with a new one.
Conclusion:
Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive
individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency
by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a material-
istic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyal-
ties, i.e., the far left or radical movement in this country.
Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life
history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his
future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances.
One statement that can be made is that, given his personality,
it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances.
But if not personally involved with someone from this agency
who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look
elsewhere for his need satisfactions.

Direct Psychological Assessment
of
ORPHONE/1
:
The psychological evaluation consisted of an extended inter-
view and the JBMINIMUM test. His intelligence as measured by the
JBMINIMUM is within the Bright Normal range by U.S. standards.
The test scores were not as high as would be expected in compari-
son to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due
to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is
working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction
and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal
of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a
book. His talents are much more in the field of journalism.
Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening
around him. These same traits would serve him well as an access
agent. However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because
his memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events
that are of interest to him. He naturally has good manual-
manipulative skills, plus a practical bent tha should enable him.
to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques.
-
Emotionally, Subject is fickle. "Out-of-sight out of
mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for
this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and
liked. Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and
because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely
becomes involved. If separated from someone with whom he is
involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins to
look for another way to satisfy his needs.
An important fact which his case officer should remember is
that he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person
who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his
case officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to
the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense
handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists
authority. He has the tendency to think that he knows it all,
as witnessed by his never completing a degree.

17 July 1972
Chief, Covert Action Staff
Mr. Jim Anthony
Completion of Training Report for QRPHONE/1,
Training Program "SHAW"
Memo for Director of Training, From Chief,
Covert Action Staff, dated 23 May 1972;
Subject: "Covert Training for GRPHONE/1"
L
1
1. QRPHOME/1 was trained covertly in New York from 22 June to
14 July 1972. There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven
training hours.
2.
This was a happy reunion of trainee and instructor. Less than
two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please
see Completion of Training Report dated 10 October 1970). Just as then,
PHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment
of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the
instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought a sandwich with him daily
and took this lunch while listening to the instructer. Thus, every
minute of every day was made to count.
3. The only time lost was three hours for JBMINIMUM and on the
several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover
office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his
office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls
took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.
--
4. His cover organization work took up a considerable portion,
everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any
casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of commo plans for exercises.
For example, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plans, he
was not able to come up with anything till the last week and then
with only one written one and one that he reveiwed orally. As a result
he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of
his countersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental
exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to take time
out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight
I will make time to write it." And he did. And it was a good report.
5. On each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother
He used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

On Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the
publisher's teen age son and there went any hope of getting any casing
done that day. At least one time, he mentioned that he did not go
to bed till two that morning and as he had left the afternoon before,
he had stated that he had meetings starting at four-thirty that afternoon.
With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute
of every training session.
6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his
instructor played the role of operations officer and a real dumb-
dumb he was. In such circumstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking,
all the planning, all the casing for meeting sites, all the analyzing,
all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy
to watch this man, after each meeting and again before the next one,
go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted
to go, knew how to get there. When Mr. Rod Sweet, during the critique
at the end of the series of exercises said; "He did a beautiful job,"
PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself. The instructor's only
contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.
7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a low bow in
the direction of Mr. Sweet: He played his agent role excellently well
and made the exercise a meaningful one for PHONE. The three trips to
New York by Mr. Sweet must have been very taxing, particularly in view
of his immediately upcoming TDY trip, but they were efforts well spent.
8. No man, of course, is perfect. Each has an Achilles heel, a
weakness, or an all-too-human trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has
his. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies
on it, counts on it. This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-
discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment
pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a
3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, from
these few words, to run off his plan without a single pause for an
uh, hm, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition from a
dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares
everything in his mind, it appears, and does not like to write out
that which he feels he should not have to write out. While it is great
to have so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in full
so important an act as a recuritment pitch, might one day save grief
when an error would have been spotted had the entire plan been written
out then looked over for possible flews.
9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable
measure for PHONE's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till
the last days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report
orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he had been asked to do two)
on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in
front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing -- area

tail conscious. These are a typical New Yorker's habits. The instructor,
also a New Yorker, is quilty of the identical actions. We are highly
kinetic in our movements and as for looking both ways while crossing a
one-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: "There's always
one S.0.B. that doesn't get the word". By sheerest coincidence, when
the instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance
team's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways in crossing
a one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor
was carrying kept him from being knocked flat.
-0
15. Nevertheless, PHONE is now fully cognizant of the appearance
that his actions create and will watch it in the future.
16.
One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He
chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.
One example: The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
feedback on the first exercise and caught the men just as they returned
to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
They reported one incident as follows: "So rapid were PHONE's movements,
that when he met a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,
just waved him off". The second surveillant: "No, it didn't look like
that at all, to me. To me it looked like this Indian-looking person
stopped PHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE gave them and just
went about his business". PHONE's own report, which he wrote up before
he learned about the two different interpretations of the incident:
'--- where I stopped a foreign-looking man, apparently Indian in origin
and asked him for the Museum which I knew perfectly well is on 55th
Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
the same man in the grey suit, now holding his hat in his hand".
One,
17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note:
the team was surprised to note in PHONE's report that PHONE even had
the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he followed
PHONE into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team
compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but
could not possibly have made the third man. The team captain, on reading
PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE had indeed made the third
man also, but good.
18. PHONE had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-
mental acquisition series) with Mr. Harry Webster, an instructor in the
New York office. After relating the fine job that PHONE had done, Mr.
Webster's report concluded: "A first rate performance by PHONE, who's
obviously been around both coverwise and for real".
--
19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
faulted. For one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomants,
as Mr. Sweet held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

description, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and
cons as to suitability it was all there. He just didn't like to
write out that upon which he could report orally.
10. In writing reports on the two counter-surveillance exercises,
he dashed those off in jig time. No pause for thinking, no pause to
look up at the ceiling or out the window. Just straight writing, includ-
ing paragraphing. Mind and pen were as one. Same thing for his oral
analysis before and after each meeting -- no pause to think, to review,
to reconstruct, to remember just an IBM-type printout.

11. The instructor sets down this reluctance on our hero's part
to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk
and field officers that if they must have a certain report by a certain.
time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm. For example,
after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor
said: "I must have that report first thing in the morning.
Do you
want to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?”
And, as already reported above, PHONE preferred to save the training
time and he answered "I will make time to write it". In this case,
time was of the essence because Mr. Sweet had to see the report before
the next meeting. To sum up this item: When PHONE feels that an oral
report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to
find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write
a report and given a deadline, he meets the deadline and the report is
everything it should be.
12. His reports on his recruitment meetings, Mr. Sweet said, were
excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,
no omissions.
--
13. The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his
actions during the countersurveillance exercises, marvelled at the
completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE
had made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or
two shorter than the actual height which PHONE admitted he does
constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,
every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise,
sprung on PHONE without a moment's prior notice, he made one of his
two surveillants. In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,
he made all three of them. These were two different teams from the
New York Office of Security). Concluding his admiration of PHONE's
reporting, the surveillance team captain said to the instructor:
should be very proud of him”.

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teams criticized the
rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to
place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. Then off again at
a high rate of speed to his next stop. They also criticized his looking
both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him appear

Yet it was far enough away from the United Nations building to lessen
the chances that PHONE himself and his putative diplomat target would
be spotted by friends or acquaintances. His choice for the next meeting
was at an impressively named new restaurant near the Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts on the West Side of town. This restaurant wes
located in the safesite complex. He was thus able very smoothly to
invite his agent to the safesite from the restaurant for the recruiting
pitch.
20. He did very well in executing two recognition meetings and
two brush passes.
He had no time to write his own commo exercises
(as stated, he was able to write up only one dead drop commo plan)
so he was given commo plans written up by another trainee. To give him
variety, he was alternately the higher and the lower echelon, alternately
accepted and made the hand-off.
21.
In operational and intel reports, he did very well.
He very
successfully separated the operational from the intel info and the
source comments from the positive intelligence.
22.
Instructor's Observation: PHONE is a proud man, both as an
individual and as an operator. While he was very discreet about it,
very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that
he has, on occasion been handled with something less than pure genius.
This, like the previous item, is noted not to down-grade PHONE, but to
alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure,
positive, definite and strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that
would have those same words apply.
23. In sum: A very good man.
24. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,
we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in July 1973 from the
field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the
training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and
should evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which
training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are
solicited. The field station's report should also include the trainee's
own comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOMOLD/
QRPHONE/1/SHAW. Upon receipt of the report at Headquarters, please
forward a copy to the undersigned.

serves to accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of a very

Having accepted BKTRUST employment for a combination of reasons, it
must be added that CRPICME/1 clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with
international issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and the
opportunity to exercise his language capability. In short, the rather

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT:
Review of Project CRPHONE
7 MAR 1972
1. A review in some depth of Project QRPHONE was
conducted in January 1972 by DC/CA and me with Branch 3
personnel, with the participation of Richard Berkey
(now of Branch 4, formerly QRPHONE Case Officer at
LCPIPIT). Attached at Tab A are the questions which
formed the basis for the review. A full record of the
responses to these questions and the review discussion
is not practical so I have attempted below to summarize
the general conclusions which emerged. Attached at
Tab B are two charts prepared by Branch 3 for the review
plus a rough draft "CI Assessment" which they also
prepared.
2. FI and CA/ Excluding FBI Sensitive Reports,
QRPHONE dropped from 157 reports in FY 1968 to 6 reports
in FY 1971. His FI reports have evidently not been
used as a basis for CA activities since 1967. This
situation is apparently due to a variety of factors:
the character of the man himself, restrictions placed
upon him, a changing political context which compounded
targetting difficulties, the complications of his own
security situation, and the method by which be was
handled. It was agreed that QRPHONE does have inherent
skills which should have an application to either FI or
CA work. He is politically attuned; he writes well;
be can handle contacts in several languages; he knows
how to move internationally; he has an engaging social
personality; he has an established (if controversial)
reputation as a left-oriented journalist/writer with
some scholastic credentials. The problem remains one of
focussing his talents and determining the platform from
which he should operate.

4. Handling.
Handling. The method by which QRPHONE has been
handled, “T.e. mainly through Rodigast (although there
has been direct LCPIPIT contact recently), is un-
nessarily cumbersome and not suited to the close consul-
tation needed to explore ORPHONE's future directions
Having been declared to the British Services the most
secure place to meet QRPHONE is in the UK and he should
be handled directly by an LCPIPIT officer.
What be can

of allegations that he is Agency-connected.
do, however, is face-up to these charges, challenge them
and deny them. There may thus always be some clement
of suspicion attached to him, but, as time passes with-
out definite proof of such a connection, its impact on
his activities may be minimized and he may be able to
engage in effective work inspite of it.
6. Sub-agents. It was felt that QRPHONE may
possibly have a Hair for recruiting and handling sub-
agents. It was believed that this should be explored
and that he should be given relevant training, based in
New York. This would also provide the opportunity for
Headquarters exploration with him of his future develop-
ment.
7. Future Pocus. What QRPHONE's own thoughts might
be on his most natural course of development are not
clear. He may have an inclination toward African
Liberation Movements--the subject of his most recent
major writing--but it could be questioned whether on
this or on anti-fedayeen work, there is sufficient
Agency interest to merit such focus. He has no signifi-
cant base in the American black community (rather the
contrary) which would make him of interest to others on
this basis. His overt political orientation is described

as "radical," but it is an intellectual "radicalism,"
not revolutionary. Further, he is basically a theoreti-
cian not a personal activist by nature. He might be
asked and might undertake an activist role--but it is
felt that it would not sit naturally upon him and
would probably not achieve whatever access might have
been postulated. Within his theoretician, non-activist
context it was nevertheless felt that the probably-to-
be-expanded field of Chinese Communist activities in
Europe provided the focus which might most usefully be
explored. The expansion of Chinese Communist activities
in Europe may come quite slowly but, in view of the
probable shortage of assets in this field, it was a
matter on which we should have some patience. It is
also a field which could be explored without QRPHONE's
needing to move. Whether be focusses on this field or
another, however, QRPHONE needs to develop some job
or organizational base which will make him interesting
as a target himself to those we wish to focus him on.
At the present time his cover does not provide a power
or influence base and he is essentially completely
dependent upon us.
8. CA Staff Termination/Redirection Responsibility.
It was felt that in this process of redirection of
ORPHONE, CA Staff should retain responsibility for
QRPHONE. Even if a London-based assignment did not
work out and it was decided to move QRPHONE to another
area CA Staff should keep the project during the trial
period and with this the responsibility for termination
if the trial proved unsuccessful. If the trial was
successful, on the other hand, then we would have
discharged our responsibility for QRPHONE and could
relinquish control.
9. Some time has passed since the above discussions
took place. I am not aware of the extent to which there
may already have been a follow-up to them. Needless to
Bay, they have decided field implications in which
LCPIPIT needs to be consulted, should they be pursued.

the combination of the security factors operative in this
case and the unlikelihood of Q/1's continued access to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset.

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.
I doubt that we have really divined Q/1's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in Q/1's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indeed Q/1 has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of
a very impressive outfit.
c. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.
D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as "squealing" on his friends indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.
--
E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.
F.
Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1
clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.
G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

STATUS:
Contract Agent (Under
a Memorandum of Oral
Agreement)
OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: International correspondent for "Sunday supplement"
type color magazine distributed by twenty major newspapers in the
U.S. Also represents owner of this color magazine in other of
his business ventures in Europe. This overt job was assumed in
December 1970. Prior to that, Q/1 was the London representative
of small U.S. news service. Q/1 does free lance journalism and
is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.
COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
including Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.
PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: 2/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many unanswered questions this is generally
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable
to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.
ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE:

QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER:
Q/l's attitude is good. He has made
an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm.
MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which a good deal has been said over the course of this operation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS:
The past allegations of Q/l's
affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extr” dimension to Qi's cover situation. We have no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,
nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of
contacts.
ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION:
Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work well for extended periods without supervision.
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
burden. He is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset.
REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
is a definite limitation on his employment.

CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his handler that he hopes
to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3
SUBJECT
: Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/1's
Operational Potential
1. In continuing my efforts to probe operational
areas for the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at
length on 3 January with his former case officer
(Mr. Richard Berkey) and received a very favorable
prognosis regarding QRPHONE/1's mobility (i.e. his
possible move to another European city or to Africa),
his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional
training), and the prospects of making himself attractive
to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).
2. In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length
today with Mr. Andrew Ness, the FE Division expert on
long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs. I de-
scribed in detail QRPHONE/1's background, current status,
and the variety of plans we have in mind and received
Ness' reactions as follows:
A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE
has demonstrated thus far will never result in his
becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the
Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose.
While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential
FI source, the Chicoms would not even do that.
B. Chicom officers abroad are still totally
obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic
and tactical application to a degree significantly
more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.
Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets
the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as
far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned.
They are interested in only those who have a serious
intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and
a serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists
of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen
as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly
not the sort that they would take into their confidence.

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/l's wife is not witting of his
JKLANCE affiliation.; She was allowed to believe that he was
working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as far as Q/1 can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to accept the Chinese story. It should be added
that Mrs. Q/1 is British and is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/1's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.
RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.
--
--
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism provided it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.
RESPONSIVENESS:
Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
him. In this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired details.
JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.
PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1. has a good sense of personal security and his
handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

1. As stated in referenced memorandum we are
beginning a review in depth of certain CA Staff projects.
I propose to meet with you and relevant branch personnel
to examine Project QRPHONE on or about 21 January 1972.
Please advise me when the necessary preparations have
been made for this review and we will fix a mutually
convenient time.
2. Prior to our meeting, I request that the two
charts of Part A of the attached listing be drawn up
and copies sent to me and CA/PO. It is not necessary
to prepare written responses to the questions posed in
Part B of the attachment. These questions provide the
basis for our oral review at the time the meeting is

C. To become of long-term operational use
to us in the sense of exploiting his possible
long-term use to the Chicoms, QRPHONE/1 should
do two things: join an existing "acceptable"
organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a
black radical party and, at the same time begin
a serious study of Marxist/Mavist doctrine. As
he gets into this program (preceded by some ten
days training and close Headquarters direction)
he should begin to seek out Communist intellectuals,
party members, leaders of radical groups, etc., to
ask questions about the dialectic, seek additional
guidance, borrow books and so forth. In doing this
he will in time come into the attention of the
professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to
develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms,
in time, will find appealing. He should also in
this period seek out Chicom officials with the
same requests for help. The key here is to
demonstrate not that QRPHONE/1 is simply sympathetic,
with Maoism or any other Communist shading but that
he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.
D. A quicker way to come into the Chicom spot-
light might be for QRPHONE/1 to join the Black
Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups
with which the Chicoms are already known to be in
touch. He will obviously have to sweat out a period
of probation in joining any such group until he
divests himself of his tattered leftist reputation
and those JKLANCE accusations. Ness feels that a
successful passing of this baptismal period will
depend solely on QRPHONE/1's willingness to plunge
wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly
boring and lengthy volumes of the dialectic. As he
demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into
this field to the satisfaction of the "spotters" he
will be accordingly provided additional help and
encouragement by Chicom contacts and officials.
E. The Chicoms will be looking at him as a
possible asset in their long-range targetting of the
American revolution, hense QRPHONE/1's utterances
ought to be couched in terms of his ultimate aim of
contributing to and participating in the American
revolution. In other words the Chicoms would see
little or no use for QRPHONE/1 operationally in
Europe or Africa (just as we would assess and recruit
a Thai for operations in Thailand, not in Nigeria).

F. Ness felt that should we pursue the above'
as a long-term operational goal for QRPHONE/1, the
city in which this takes place is almost irrelevant.
He could do it perhaps as well in an African setting
as in Europe and his cover status i.e., with
LPWEAKLY, really makes no difference because the
Chicoms would test the fiber man himself and would
not be deterred by his external trappings.
3. In answer to my question, Ness said he would be
happy to meet with QRPHONE to assess his potential in this
area and then, assuming we all decided to go ahead with
such redirection, Ness could train him and guide him
thoroughly enough to get him well on the track by spending
some seven to ten days with him on a concentrated program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
QRPHONE
Your Memorandum, Same Subject,
Dated 29 November 1971
1. What follows below are some initial comments of mine on
the referent memorandum, per your request. We really feel in
Branch 3 that for a variety of reasons, we need more time to
deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational activity than the
previous two weeks. Partly this is due to extended absence by the
case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring
Illness--I believe you are familiar with this. It is also in part
attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the position and
having his time absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you
don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this
subject following the Christmas holidays. At that time we should
like to initiate some meetings on this matter both with yourself
and with other area components including representatives from
CI Staff.
2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by
an earlier one of mine which proposed that QRPHONE become
operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist
cell in either Paris or Rome. The purpose of this would be twofold--
namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Soviet Union
and mainland China through various low-key covert action undertakings.
and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials
as a Maoist activist. This tentative assignment, it should be noted,
arose because Branch 3 personnel had become increasingly aware of
the possibility that QRPHONE's project status might be terminated
in the not too distant future. While it is true that in the immediate
preceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence
reporting, it is all too clear that over the past two years, he has
been of diminishing utility to CA Staff and other area divisions. In
discussing his future with his recent case officer, Miss Chatelan,
her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him
In the near future, we should give serious consideration to terminating

the conditions which would confront QRPHONE in say Rome. But
If we are not to channel his energies in this direction, it is incumben:
upon us to think of something else for him to do before we begin
thinking about writing him off. And so when you suggest that .
"the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment
•
of the project. " I agree. And to this end, we should like a couple
of weeks more before coming to you with some general conclusions
of ours about the current viability of thle case and some future
alternative course of action.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3
SUBJECT:
Operational Redirection of QRPHONE/1
3
1. In response to your request that I examine the
QRPHONE/1 project to determine how it might best be
redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and
money involved, I have talked at some length with appro-
priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been
advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/1's dwindling
productivity are as follows:
A. Key centers of activity of the radical left
in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For
different reasons QRPHONE/1's access in these three
capitals is either circumscribed or off target. The
British have asked that he not operate in London MuchAoS
against African targets. His reputation among target
groups of interest to us in Paris and Stockholm has
been so tarnished that he has not taken into their
confidence significantly enough to be of value.
B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among
the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then
very brief when they do occur. Even his correspondence
to the more important radical leaders, which used to be
quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.
C. Because his contacts are so cursory, he has
been unable to develop a close and continuing personal
relationship with any one of them in order to develop
the intimate confidence so necessary for operational
exploitation.
D. His cover has always been thin and thus has
circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic
allegations of his being a JKLANCE agent.

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal
arose from a desire on my part not to terminate an asset of proved
capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity
to become useful once more.
3. CI Type Review/QRPHONE Personal Security: Your memo
makes out there have been frequent security reviews of QRPHONE's
security status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one
more. On this let me point out that in making such a security assess -
ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the
area division concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this
agent. One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should
be honored in the Interests of maintaining good relations even if its
fulfillment means redundant work. But apart from this, the case
officer also informs me that the case file does not contain any general
summary of the alleged security breaches involving QRPHONE and
their implications vis-a-vis his activities. It is true however that his
security status has been reviewed for each annual project review and
that assessments of his security status were made following each
-alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our own
gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he is still in
pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges
leveled against him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other
leftist colleagues(who do not have any Agency association) by their
rivals. And as for the structure of his case officer relationship--
that is, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent
country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (so much
so that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational
Inefficiency.)
4. Location: We tentatively agree that in all likelihood Paris
should not be the venue for our proposed operational undertaking due
the location of the Wright clan. Rome, however, might do very well.
If not Rome, perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another
locale. As for the question as to whether or not the Rome station would
want him permanently, only time and his own operational success could
determine this. One hazards that if QRPHONE were able to make his
way with some good local leftists and had promise of developing some
kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station
might come to regard him as a capital asset.

5. Substance: You noted that QRPHONE
simply show up and start a leftist nuclei. . ." Why not? Others
have. He is a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe
and has written many articles in praise of Mao. This should do
for a start. As for what he might have to offer local leftists . . .
money, energy and ideas will do. A great deal of money. of course,
is unneeded, but some is. We can supply it. As for ideas and
energy, he has both. Concerning the "bullt-In jealousy, animosity,
etc." which such action would likely engender on the part of local
rival leftists, this may or may not occur. But is this such a calamity
If it should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves
anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage
this agent. What we have to lose by not trying is an agent asset of
proved worth.
6. Credentials: You say in effect that QRPHONE has not
been known as an activist but only as an intellectual. (Frankly, the
distinction is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he
has written many articles on leftist subjects and has talked to
Innumerable leftists around Europe over the years. True, he has
not been involved in such actions as street demonstrations, but we
would not like him to be so personally involved in the future in any
case. What we would want him to do is to write pamphlets, informally
recruit associates to his group and provide a little money to the group
as might be required for various undertakings. Aside from the
organizing and funding, actually this is not very different from what
he has been doing--except that it will be in one place for a change.
7. Book Dispatch Sale: You may be very correct in saying
that shopping him around to European stations by book dispatch is a
poor way to solicit useful tasks for QRPHONE. But again, I took
my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines.
Certainly sending book dispatches wouldn't hurt any. If Spence is
willing at some future time to visit various field stations and to
attempt selling QRPHONE's services personally, we would be happy
to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he will be
available to do so, and time is passing.
8. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate
to you in some detail the success which Andy Ness once had with the
kind of undertaking which we have proposed for QRPHONE. It may
Interest you. On the other hand, it may be perfectly possible that
the situation which Andy Ness once manipulated is not applicable to

D. Both to give QRPHONE/1 time to cleanse his
tattered image and because there are almost as
important operational tasks in West Africa, the idea
is to move him (1) to Nigeria or (2) to Ghana for
perhaps a year. This is to be done in concert with a
suitable strengthening of his cover (i.e. two or
three more stringerships) and a concurrent mutation.
of his political posture to that of a plain old
anti-imperialist rather than the more confining
pro-Mao stance. He would be run directly by Lagos
or Accra Station against local targets but with
periodic trips to other parts of Africa for cover
as well as operational purposes. Meantime, in the
intervening months the dust may settle a bit in
Tanzania, the close association with opposition
elements would be allowed to fade and QRPHONE/1's
writings and pronouncements concerning Tanzania would
be calculatedly designed to support the Nyere government.
At the appropriate time, a year or so perhaps,
he then moves PCS to Tanzania.

E.
Close case officer direction has been made
very difficult because of the echelons existing
between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative
ve
infrequency of field case officer meetings.
F. What contacts he has within the African
target, for example, are rendered virtually useless
because his case officers are unfamiliar on a timely
basis with Africa Division requirements and also
miss valuable operational leads simply because they
do not recognize them. (This is no fault of the
case officers because they obviously have little
opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)
G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying
to portray a pro-Mao stance may help him a bit with
targets similarly inclined but renders him ineffective
with other political shadings among the left.
2. With all of the above in mind and without belaboring
the history of this project, the following recommendation is
offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and
Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.
A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/1's operational
utility in Europe is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be
directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer
PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control
transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.
B. From the point of view of MHCHAOS requirements
and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements
Telt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited in Tanzania.
It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for
the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and
Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to
East African stability.
c. However, because of QRPHONE/1's well-known
association with two exiled Tanzanian opposition
politicians in London and current reports that these
oppositionists are plotting the overthrow of
President Nyere (perhaps with Soviet assistance), it
would be very imprudent for QRPHONE/1 to arrive bag
and baggage in Dar es Salaam in the near future.
Nyere and his police might well conclude that QRPHONE
represents the advance probe of the coup plotters and
promptly throw him into jail.

PROJECT QRPHONE
PART A. CHARTS REQUESTED
Chart I: For the period FY 1967 through FY 1971
provide the number of disseminated reports according to
the subject field of the report. The headings would be:
Fiscal Year, African Independance Movements, Anti-US
Demonstrations, European Maoist Groups (etc., or whatever
other subject fields you wish to set up).
Chart II: List the specific events or organizations
against which covert action was in fact undertaken and
give the number of QRPHONE reports which were submitted
on such events/organizations.
PART B.
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
1. What is the basic reason for this being a CA
Staff project (other than history)? To provide multi-
divisional tasking for FI purposes of general U.S. intelli-
gence interest? To provide CA operational information
for possible DDP use?
2. As regards FI reports, which have lately been
described as being of only marginal interest, the main
criticisms appear to be a lack of depth and detail.
CA Staff's counter to this has been that QRPHONE goes as
far as he can, and can go no further through elicitation.
Have these depth/detail criticisms been valid? Is our
defense valid, or could he reasonably be expected to
elicit more depth and detail than he does?
3.
If he can go no further through elicitation and
we wish to keep him on the FI path, what is implied?
That he develop and run agents himself? That he actually
goes to work for an organization of intelligence interest
to us? How realistic would either of these lines of
pursuit be?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

REFERENCE:
QRPHONE
Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE
Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November
1971
1. I made some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon
first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best
to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form.
2. As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more
meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the
operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that
your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors.
a. Security: RODIGAST's and QRPHONE's personal security
cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected
QRPHONE from accusations of being CLA, which have haunted him
throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in
which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charges
leveled at him whether or not the Ollie Harrington incident had happened
in Paris.
b. Location: Apart from the efficiency of the French police,
there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of
QRPHONE's even going to Paris for a meeting, let alone being stationed
/ there (e. g., protection of RODIGAST's identity, the Harrington incident,
and the location there of the Wright clan). I cannot imagine why he would
consider it, or why we should advocate it.

MEMORANDUM OF MEETING
SUBJECT:
QRPHONE Operations in Europe
To this really
still true?"
1. Mr. Leo Horvath, EUR/CA, and myself briefly
discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November.
During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal
which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at
LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was
that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through
Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either Rome
or Paris for an extended period of time. In either of
these locations he would then attempt to identify and
to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting contacts
in the left sector of the student and youth population,
who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study
group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so
inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist
stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers
would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con-
text. Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts
as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist
group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger
such group say, in Britain. He would, of course, imply
to his followers that he is attempting to develop a
similar nucleus in (France) (Italy) or whenever, as
good Communists should.
2. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.
First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists
would follow along lines of a typical black Communist
cell, emulating the kind of notional movement which
Mr. Andy Ness developed in the Middle East some seven or
eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in
turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers
who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and
perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the
Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC.
Presumably their actions would result in some local
embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE,
himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials--
already strong--to the point where he might well become

heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this would fall),
and those three have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well:
Breckenridge, Hornstein and Friend. QRPHONE has talents and abili-
ties and weaknesses which can best be explained/sold in person, not
through dispatch. I think, that the way to do it, if at all, is by Spence
during a visit to these Stations.
--
f. "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often
this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand Horvath
asking for a security review he had no background knowledge of the
operation that would have given him this information.) I do not know
what you now expect to find. In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels
the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would
consider a Staff-internal review pretty much a waste of time.
--
3. Having gone around this problem several times in the past
several years with CI Staff and the pertinent area divisions (as the
files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider
QRPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it
costs to maintain him. We may be able to justify it since we attempt
(as no one area division would) -->> and to some extent succeed to target
him on a multi-divisional basis. In light of these considerations, and
since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability
of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe
that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of
the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course,
entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least three area divisions.
4. I will appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

invitations to Peking (as it did in Ness's case) and
possibly an FI operation of consequence vis-a-vis the
China target.

3. The efficacy of the aforementioned scheme seemed
to pose some doubts to Mr. Horvath. On the one hand, he
did not feel that either Rome or Paris Stations had
sufficient case officer strength on hand to direct and
support a tricky operation of this type which might have
only marginal utility, in their view. As for Paris,
the French police, being as efficient as they are, would
probably come upon QRPHONE's "black net" in time, and
could conceivably pose security problems for him. As
an alternative, Mr. Horvath proposed that CA Staff write
a general dispatch to all EUR Stations describing the
asset and indicating that the Staff would like to see
greater use made of QRPHONE's capabilities on the
Continent. The dispatch should ask the Stations to comment
on the service that QRPHONE might provide them and suggest
the means for accomplishing it. Mr. Horvath also asked
that, prior to forwarding the dispatch, a security review
be conducted of this case. He did comment that, if the
security review indicated no severe compromises of
QRPHONE's cover or personal security, it would be a
pity not to make greater use of this agent's notable
contacts in the European leftist community.

4. Accordingly, I agreed with Mr. Horvath's two
recommendations; namely, to conduct a security review of
the case and, subsequently, to forward a blanket dispatch
to the Field, if appropriate. I mentioned that we would
still like to raise the possibility of a black operation
in Paris and Rome in that dispatch and to this, Mr. Horvath
posed no objections.

A different cover for a move to Rome might be developed,
but not that of a Maoist developing new cells. Rome Station is glad to
have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever
he visits, but would they want him permanently??
c. Substance: More generally, QRPHONE cannot just simply
show up and start forming nuclei -- there are already Maoist nuclei --
the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be)
that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help.
If he were to have something to offer them money, preferably
they might welcome him with open arms. Otherwise he will encounter
built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all
over again.

d. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual
Maoist??), QRPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he
has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved
with is Manchanda's insignificant group and even with that he has
never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with
making up a placard. He has helped them with their press releases,
leaflets, etc. In short, with the written word, not the deed. By
nature which we must also take into consideration QRPHONE

is no longer a "doer" if he ever was one.
--
that he can at this stage in his life become a "doing" radical. We would
be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in
favor of dubious undertaking.
In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have
QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet
material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40,000??)
to Rome, but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about the "Andy Ness"
operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility
in a sophisticated European community.
e.
Book Dispatch Sale: Shopping him around to the European
Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place,
any Station likely to have a use for him is already extremely well up
on QRPHONE's background. There are only three Stations really

16. What are QRPHONE's real talents? Why hasn't
he been able to do more about establishing himself on
a more self-sustaining basis? Is it because of the
targets we keep pushing him on? What is meant by these
allusions to QRPHONE's "work discipline?" Do his talents
possibly point toward some covert action use in a role
where the CIA label is relatively less important?

that Rodigast was under some suspicion. QRPHONE has
been refused entrance at the border by the Swiss
authorities. Does anyone doubt that in view of the
groups and individuals he contacts on his travels he
has a dossier in each of these countries? Does anyone
doubt that in many of these dossiers the alleged CIA
connection is recorded? In view of this, isn't it a fact
that probably the safest place for him to be contacted
is London, in spite of whatever tradecraft he and
Rodigast may practice? In spite of a rapport and back-
ground knowledge elements which he undoubtedly benefits
from with Rodigast, are these factors worth the extra
handling complications? Doesn't this handling method
essentially double the cost of the operation?

12. What were the reasons for the break with "Fair
Play for Cuba?" the break with Verges? Does QRPHONE
have a power base at all among American negroes (SNCC
doesn't like him and it is recorded in the renewals that
blacks and revolutionaries sense that he is not "sincere")?
13. Can't we determine right here at Headquarters
the degree of interest in the Italian branch in having
a rather low-level propaganda operation involving anti-
Soviet propaganda ostensibly emanating from pro-Chicom
sources? Now that the PRC has decided to go "legit,"
what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they
will lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicom
fringe groups?
14. Other than on the above, if we asked QRPHONE
to become involved in depth with one of the groups he
is in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist
than the King," and wouldn't he be the first to come
under suspicion in case action against the group pointed
to a leak?
15.
If he could not take covert action himself
through such a group to what extent are we now or
potentially likely to become involved with covert
action by other groups against:

anti-Vietnam action
African liberation movements

New Left groups

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Heeting with QRPHONE/1
18 July 1972
Chron
1. I met with QRPHONE/1 for much of the 12th of July
and wearing two hats.
No first went through the third phase
of the training exercise in which I had been playing the role
of an agent prospect whom he was to assess and recruit, and then
later in the OTR safehouse I identified myself as the Headquarters
officer responsible for his project. Incidentally, he did an
excellent job in all three phases of the training exercise and
did particularly well on the recruitment itself. QRPHONE/1 is
clever, imaginativo, has an excellent grasp of this espect of
tradecraft and handled himself particularly well in a complex
and changing training scenario.
2. As the Headquarters staff officer responsible for his
project, I described in detail the reasons for the long, sorious
look at his performance these last several months, the changing
intelligence and operational requirements we face, and the care-
ful scrutiny he had been given as we began to map out new direc-
tions for him, all of which ended with this advance four-week
training program, testing, and evaluation and substantive
briefings. 'He said he was a bit confused by the WOMUSE brief-
ing of last week so I explained how that tied in with this evening's
planned discussion on the China program.
3. We discussed his itinerary, personal plans and the
pacing of the next several months, all of which were clarified
to his satisfaction.
8. He will be debriefed on 24 July at 1000 hours at
the OTR safesite in NYC following his return from the
operational trip around the country.
b. I will meet him for the final operational briefing
session at 1000 hours on 26 July in the same OTR safesite.

4. The charge is made that QRPHONE is too thinly
spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting
be better focussed. Can he in fact be better focussed
on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing, in
practice, result in his being narrowed down to a primarily
divisional target?
5. Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in-
discriminately used for character assassination in the
conspiratorial fringe in which QRPHONE has been operating,
isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of
the international character of this conspiratorial
fringe, won't it turn up wherever he goes? In this milieu
is there really much chance he will be given any signifi-
cant information (and not deception information) by anyone
who will do so because he wants the information passed
to CIA?
6. When he was looked into in April 1968 by a
Chicom official, what do we suppose to be meant by the
officials finding that it was not clear if he was
completely reliable in a Marxist-Lenist sense?
7. How eagerly sought-after are travelers to China'
now-a-days? What is the forecast as to demand for such
travelers by next summer?
8. With a reportedly anti-US, white, British wife
and 3 small children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a
PCS sense? If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new
location for a trial period and it didn't work out,
wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications?

In how many languages does QRPHONE have verbal
and written fluency?

which removes the previous restrictions on his stay in Britain.
There is now no limit on the length of his stay in Britain and he
does not need to report his address, etc., to the police. Further,
he may now obtain employment in Great Britain without the need
to obtain official permission.

The idea
constitutional problem with their responsibilities to IDEN.
of passing out political information on exiles is repulsive to him."
It should be noted for the record that JAGUAR itself has not given
such an explanation to JKLANCE, but, knowing JAGUAR's bureaucratic
position and its traditionally conservative role in the SMORANGE
community, it may be that JAGUAR in fact is thus inhibited.
5. As to QRPHONE/1, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March
1970 complaints to JADWIN about QRPHONE/1's contacts with expatriates
in London. SHOVID expressed JAGUAR's concern about QRPHONE/1's security
and its view that QRPHONE/1's information was of arginal value. SMOVID
emphasizing that he was expressing a view personally endorsed by
SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options: withdraw QFPHONE/1 from
the country; stop running and tasking QRPHONE/1 as an agent; or have
JAGUAR take over the running of QRPHONE/1. (QRPHONE/1 subsequently was
instructed to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targets.)
σ. Thus JKLANCE is stymied. The question is whether there is
anything that can be done to improve the situation. The one new factor
in the equation that possibly could be used to reopen the discussion
with a view to ameliorating the situation is the fact that there now
is a different IDEN than when the February 1970 SMOTH explanation was
offered. Even though JAGUAR has not specifically given that explana-
tion, to JKLANCE, the Station, without reference to SMOTH's explana-
tion presumably could elect to reopen the discussion in terms of a
possible change of atmosphere since the change of IDEN. Such a dis-
cussion at least should give an indication of whether SMOTH's explana-
tion is JAGUAR's (and JKLANCE's) major obstacle.
7. Were QRPHONE/1 permitted to resume his London contacts he
could obtain some information of the type JKLANCE would like to get
from JAGUAR. But, in view of the June 1970 S (UPSILON-approved SMOVID
Aemarche to JADKIN, it might be unwise, for the moment at least, to
sound out JAGUAR about reactivating QRPHONE/1. he would appreciate
receiving Landon Station's views on this subject.

8. One final point that should be noted is that McGRILLEN, in
forwarding the above-mentioned JAGUAR report on 24 December 1970,
mentioned that visiting ZIBET officer Jeremy R. FREYMARK recently had
discussed these JKLANCE requirements in London with SMOVID, SMENDIVE.
and SMEVICT and that it was McGRILLEN's understanding that "it was
generally agreed to limit our requests in the future to selected
targets on which there is evidence of coup plotting or subversion."
MCGRILLEN added that he looked forward to any followup questions based
on the above criteria that Headquarters wanted the Station to submit to
JAGUAR. FREYMARK's recollection of his talks with JAGUAR is at slight
variance with McGRILLEN's account. FREYMARK recalls that he had agreed
to limit JKLANCE's future requests to those cases in which JKLANCE™ had
An active interest and where there was good reason to suspect a real
threat to the stability of the African country against which the London-
based African might be acting. Accordingly, there is attached a select
list of individuals about whose contacts and activities JKLANCE would
like to have updated information from JAGUAR. The type of information
vo desire is indicated by the illustrative questions and other data
in support of our request. Whereas we would like to have unsolicited
77 and regular reporting on these targets, we realize that JAGUAR is not
equipped or prepared to accept such a continuing requirement. te believe
that the attached list along with the paragraph five discussion pegged
to a change of IDENS are good pegs for GIBSON or his designee in re-
gpening the discussion with JAGUAR.

1. For over a year ZIBET personnel have sought to stimulate more
MORANGE reporting on the activities of certain high level African
expatriates in London. Up to now the results have been meager and
discouraging, and in addition JAGUAR gained JKLANCE's agreement that
QRPHỌNE/1 should desist from pursuing these London targets.
San 2016 Perhaps stemming from the recent visit of SMOVID to Head-
quarters, however, we have just received an informative and useful
report, prepared by JAGUAR, on Osumba Lang i, the principal radical
Kenyan expatriate in London, along with promises of other studies on
targets mentioned during the Headquarters discussions. This is possibly
a hopeful note for the future.
3. Prior to this development, JKLANCE had received only one report
From JAGUAR in response to various appeals and the submission of require-
ments. That report, received in December 1970 was in response to
Headquarters-supplied requirements forwarded the previous February (and
resubmitted in August 1970), but contained very little positive informa-
tion. Furthermore, the report's format and tone suggested that JAGUAR's
reply was intended as a one-time affair. It certainly did not invite
further questions nor indicate an intention to volunteer further details
later.
In roviewing the correspondence on this matter, it was noted
that the verbatim minutes of February 1970 Headquarters discussions
with SMENCB and SMUMBRAGE contained a passage that may cast new light
on JAGUAR's position. In response to ZIBET officers' queries about
what JKLANCE could expect from JAGUAR (it previously having been made
clean by the SMOTH officers that the target was JAGUAR's), the visiting
SNOTH officers said of JAGUAR's position: "They have a quificĀSOT TOPI

ATTACHMENT TO DISPATCH NO. OLLA-26059
ZIBET would appreciate receiving from JAGUAR any current material on
the activities and contacts of the followin, Africans who either reside
in London or who visit there frequently. These tacts have been selectes
according to the criteria outlined in paraprapi. & of the referenced
dispatch.

William & E DO E-AN SA i - Consitive endarters' sources have
indicated that John K. T ETTEGAN is planning to return to rest
Africa. Since B E DO E-AN SA H is known to maintain contact with
TETTEGA if and was in fact responsible for TET 11 Gan's cepioy-
ment with a Japanese business firm in Cairo, we feel is may be involved
in any new subversive moves undertaken by TE TTECAH,
Kojo BOTSIO There has beer sore indication through sensitive
sources that BOT ; 10 has recently been travelling in Africa and that
tes may be involved in TETTE GA it's current activities.
(In addition we are still interested in the other targets mentioned
in Reference C.)

QRPHONE/1
PROJECT: QRPHONE
DATE:
18 January 1971
"
STATUS:
Contract Agent (Under
a Memorandum of Ora).
Agreement)
OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: International correspondent for "Sunday supplement"
type color magazine distributed by twenty major newspapers in the
U.S. Also represents owner of this color magazine in other of
his business ventures in Europe. This overt job was assumed in
December 1970. Prior to that, Q/1 was the London representative
of small U.S. news service. Q/1 does free lance journalism and
is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.
COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
including Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.
PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many unanswered questions this is generally.
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable
to elicit more information on a given subject.
--
--
PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.
ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
under Motivation.)
ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER:
Q/l's attitude is good. He has made
an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm.
MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which a good deal has been said over the course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
motivation:
A.
His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you
that he is now prepared to remove the restrictions on
your stay in this country. The conditions attached to
it have therefore been cancelled.
Cancellation of conditions means that you are now also
exempt from the requirement to report changes of address
and other particulars to the police.
There is now no necessity for you to obtain permission
from a government Department to take employment in
Great Britain. The Secretary of State would, moreover
have no objection if you wished to establish yourself in
business or a profession, but it should be clearly under-
stood that this does not relieve you of the obligation,
in that event, to conform to any regulations governing
the business or professional activities in which you may
be interested.
This cancellation of your conditions does not extend to
the Channel Islands which have their own laws relating
to aliens. You should therefore consult the Immigration

Go will depart New York the night of 26 July
on the 8:00 p.m. TWA flight to London.
d. This will get him in London in time for a
previously scheduled ops meeting with PAUPEROS on
27 July. He leaves on 1 August for a one-month
vacation touring most of Europe with his family and
spending one week in Halta.
4. Before the arrival of DẠITCHMAN we discussed other
operational matters as follows:
His friend in New York City, Richard Ward,
(Apt. 11K, 372 Central Park West) recently returned
from Hanoi and Paris with the manuscript of a new book
written by Cambodian Prince Nordom Sihanouk titlod
“Hy Var with CIA." Sihanouk gave the manuscript to
Wilfred Burchett who gave it to a North Vietnamese
friend to give to Ward, Ward was asked to find an
American publisher and he, in turn, asked for QRPHONE/1's
help. Burchett is an old friend of Ward's and stays
at his apartment whenever he visits New York. The
manuscript has already been given to a publisher in
Europe. QRPHONE/1 asked if we would be interested in
& copy. I told him to get one if he could do so
without straining his cover.
b. His friend, Lyle Stuart, the publisher, has
been trying to buy the American branch of the Oxford
University Press, and apparently is about to consummate
the deal. He offered QRPHONE a job as his European
representative if the deal goes through.
C. Per TEUTSCHMAN request I asked QRPHONE to give
his instructor a copy of the long list of names and
organizations given to him by Sibecho. Also por Ken's
request, and in answer to my question, QRPHONE said he
received the magazine published by the Turkish party
in Collards Book Shop in London.
5. From 5:00 p.m. until a little after midnight on
13 July, DALTCHWAN of FR Division briefed QRPHONE/1 in sub-
stance on the STFLIMFLAH program, our interest in having
QRPHONE/1 pursue such a role, and explained the great amount
of dreary work that would be involved in learning the communist
dialectic thoroughly if the whole venturo were to be success-
ful. I will make no effort to condense these seven hours

the combination of the security factors operative in this
case and the unlikelihood of Q/1's continued access to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset.

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.
I doubt that we have really divined Q/1's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/1's
affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extra dimension to Q/1's cover situation. We have no
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof,
nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of
contacts.
ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work well for extended periods without supervision.
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
burden. He is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset.
REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
reporter
--
style.
--
I-
PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
his efforts on a sustained basis.
LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
Italian and German.
--
WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel and even
enjoys it!
AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa
and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.
It
ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/1's present operating context
does not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents.
is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these
areas, however.
WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
is a definite limitation on his employment.
--
CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his. handler that he hopes
to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He
enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE:
•
Q/1's wife is not witting of his
JKLANCE affiliation. She was allowed to believe that he was
working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as far as w/1 can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to accept the Chinese story It should be added.
that Mrs. Q/1 is British and is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/1's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/1's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.
RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.
--
--
other
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism provided it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.
RESPONSIVENESS:
Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
him. In this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired details.
JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his
handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

Miss Diane Chatelan
Completion of Training Report for QRPHOME/1 (P),
Training Alias:
PERSHING
Memorandum for Director of Training dated 28 September
1970, Attention: Chief, Covert Training/CS/TR,
Subject: Covert Training for QRPHONE/1, Fron:
Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff
1. QRPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York on 14, 15, 16
October 1970. There were twelve hours of training in the three sessions.
2. In accordance with the reference training request and discussions
between the instructor and the two Case Officers, QRPHONE/1 was given
a concentrated dosage of reporting instruction with emphasis on spotting
and assessment reports.
3. QRPHONE/1 is a professional writer, so there was no problem
in the writing department. The need was for channelling the writing
capabilities of this man who has been an Agent for five years, into
our type of reporting and to end his "stream of consciousness" style
of reporting, as one Case Officer put it.
4. QRPHONE/1 quite quickly got into the spirit of the training
and by the end of the first session was obviously enjoying it and
appreciating the opportunity to learn to write our way. He pointed
out that his big problem is having to retain substantial amounts of
information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all down
the night before he meets his Case Officer. From his conversation,
it appeared that organizing a report had never occurred to him before
and he several times said "no one ever told me about this", "this is
the first I've learned of this, etc." These things were said in happiness
at having discovered ways of improving his reporting and simultaneously
making his reporting less of a chore and more of a joy.

"
B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in Q/1's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indeed. Q/1 has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be.
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of
a very impressive outfit.
C. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.
D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as "squealing" on his friends indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.
E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.
F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1
clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.
G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/1's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.
