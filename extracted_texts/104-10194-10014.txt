4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to
express himself well in both written and oral form. His career
is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-
formances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior
Security executive. However, I feel that he has not as yet applied
all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance
as DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extra-
ordinarily capable and effective in producing results. Conversely,
however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems

is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance.

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968
through 31 March 1969.
2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security
for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and
this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as
his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 August
1968.
3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision
of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,
he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to
our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the
Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1968,
Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of
these varied and complex activities. He is an alert and intelligent
supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-
cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate
which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was
instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division
made necessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security
staff in Frankfurt, West Germany. He is an astute manager and an

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

covered by this Fitness Report.
2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration
and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been
meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in

3. Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior
executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive
experience as a Security carcerist, both in Headquarters and
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing
responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance
in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive
for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of
his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,
that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for
the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and
initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

1. This memorandum will supplement the information contained
in Mr. Victor R. White's memorandum of 10 April 1967, since Mr.
O'Connell was reassigned to the position of Chief, Security Policy and
Executive Staff on 9 January 1967.
2.
This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March
During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the selection
for this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to
demonstrate his executive talents in this position.

3. Although the period for which he is being rated in this position
is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would say that
his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".

(Fitness Report)
10 April 1967
This is an annual Fitness Report on the above employee
for the period ending 9 January 1967. Mr. O'Connell was reas-
signed from Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS) to Chief,
Security Policy and Executive Staff, and the Director of Security
will add comments for the remainder of the rating period ending
31 March 1967.
As Assistant to the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Connell applied excep-
tional executive talent in sharing with me the responsibility for
the direction of the investigative and operational support programs
in the Office of Security. It is felt that Mr. O'Connell made an
outstanding contribution to the management of IOS at a time of
the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has
a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to
these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the
breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and con-
cisely in both writing and speech. As Assistant DDS(IOS), he
demonstrated sound management concepts and acute cost con-
sciousness. His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the
universal respect he enjoys among all subordinates.
I regard Mr. O'Connell's performance as ADDS(IOS) as
"Outstanding."

I found the seminar extremely informative and worthwhile from the standpoint
of examining the historical progression of the ADP from several points of view. All
the speakers were highly qualified in their particular field and their presentations were
well prepared. All were exceptionally apt in fielding questions.
Mr. Bert Engelhardt, Associate Director, ADP Management Center, CSC, was

has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate. If I were to single
out any weakness it would be Mr. Engelhardt's lecture. He spoke on the Systems
Analyst. In his presentation he seemed not to take into consideration the professional
level of the group and devoted an inordinate amount of time on basic managerial
precepts. This seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue
of their positions had considerable experience in the management field.
Overall I would say, notwithstanding the above observation, it is an interesting
and effective program.

(Fitness Report)¸
1. This is an Annual Fitness Report on the above employee
for the period ending 31 March 1966. Mr. O'Connell is currently
assigned as Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS), a position
he assumed in September 1965. He was promoted to GS-16 at the
time he assumed these responsibilities on the basis of a long per-
iod of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment
as Regional Security Officer for the Far East.
2.
As my Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re-
sponsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational
support programs of the Office of Security. He brings to this posi-
tion a wealth of experience, sound management concepts, and the
ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems. I have
implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect
of all of his associates. Mr. O'Connell has made an outstanding
contribution to the management and direction of IOS at a time when
our work load is the highest in history. He is susceptible to inno-
vation and has a keen appréciation of cost factors in meeting his
managerial responsibilities. He has a unique ability to put work
problems in the proper focus, does his job without fanfaré, and
maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.
3. Mr. O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion
to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been
in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered:
unusually strong with many outstanding aspects,

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD
!
Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories
contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid
terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action
skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for
-problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-
ture and Development.
The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of
level or experience. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In
Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solu-
tions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly
assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate effectiveness,
Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change
his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers
are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves.
About twenty to thirty hours of study are completed as prework. Insights
gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate
student achievement in this course.

Period 12 September 1964

31 March 1965
chief of the Regional KUSODA Support Staff for nearly
three years, is 43 years old and a career employee with more than
13 years service. Although this has been his first overseas tour,
he and his family are well adjusted to foreign assignment, and he
is apparently able and willing to serve in any position offered.
As the senior KUSODA officer in the Far East, he directs the
activities of six officers on his own staff as well as supervises
and provides guidance to all other KUSODA officers assigned in the
Far East; in addition he monitors the performance of three other.
KUSODA officers attached to this Station. In this supervisory
role, he has an excellent insight into the abilities of his staff
and definitely holds the respect of his subordinates.
As the senior KUSODA officer he is my principle adviser on
many KUSODA matters. His judgment is mature, his evaluations
usually sound. He is dependable and I believe his loyalty to our
service and his superiors is above question.
He operates his staff well, is cost conscious and requires an
absolute minimum of supervision from Station command.
He maintains excellent liaison relationships with other island
services.
will continue to develop and can assume positions of
greater responsibility.
I rate this officer as Strong--on the high side.

is Chief, Regional Security Staff, WE As such
he has performed a fine job in meeting the requirements of FE Stations
for security services and in gaining acceptance for the security program
The requirements have been considerably accelerated during past months
due to the unsettled conditions in the FE Area. Also support to Head-
quarters projects has been added to the security office. Perhaps too
frequently a job which falls to the station and which cannot be properly
identified with one component falls to the Regional Security Staff.
O'Connell while keeping his eye on his primary responsibilities has been
most helpful and cooperative in handling secondary duties.
He is a mature officer, seasoned by experience and training. He
is calm and poised in crisis situations. His dependability and person-
ality are genuing assets to the Station.
nct
is a good supervisor who promotes berun work anong his people,
who is opposed to waste, and has demonstrated his interest in efficiency
and economy.
O'Connell
makes a sincere effort to separate the Regional Security
office from the Station Begurity office, however, this is difficult if
not impossible to do. Paps the Station is as much to blage as the
overlapping of the various security functions. Surely it is under-
standable that the Chief of Station wants the best advice he can gat on
a security master of concern to him and will bum to the senior officer
available. This is an especially tempting recourse with such a fine
officer as
ploge at hand.
Connell
He has respond well to the call for economy and although he has
little latitude in this respect he has institubal some restrictions that
will result in savings. He writes lucidly and succinctly.
I am platiled that he is to be at this Station for another

Mr. O'Connell is completing ten years of Agency service and his
experience qualification includes four years of service with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from
St. John's University.
This evaluation covers Mr. O'Connell's first year assignment
as Chief of the Security Support Division. It is felt that the outstand-
ing accomplishments of this Division during this period are in large
measure attributable to Mr. O'Connell's managerial skill. During
this time the Security Support Division, without additional personnel,
has increased its production substantially and in the area of operational
support has handled many unique and diverse assignments.
Mr. O'Connell has a keen and analytical intellect and a broad
understanding of the investigative and security problems inherent in
his job. He applies these qualities with his talent for administration
to make for an overall outstanding performance.
Mr. O'Connell has the capacity for further development and
his future training should be directed to senior management courses
to insure the full development of this potential.

•
I want to express my appreciation to you personally.
and through you to Howard Osborn and the other of your as-
sociates who contributed so effectively to the visit of the
President on Friday. The arrangements were flawless; the
✓ security first-class without being intrusive. I am well
aware of the amount of work and planning which went into
the successful outcome. I particularly want to commend the
good sense and judgment which prevailed throughout. It is
easy to push people around. It is difficult to take proper
precautions and at the same time make everyone foel as though
it were his or her party. Thank you very much. Well done!

SUBJECT: Commendation for
1. When
Ernest dem Berkav
was moved to Saigon O'Connell
28
on rather short notice, I named
Acting D/COS. He served in this capacity from early
April until his departure on 16 June 1965.
2. Within a matter of days he was performing
the assigned duties in a superior manner. He most
certainly demonstrated sound judgment, dependability
and mature tolerance. The latter is an essential for
the daily problems unique to any post type service.
3. As to his executive or leadership qualities
I believe I can save several paragraphs by stating
simply that within a week of assuming his new assign-
ment I left on a G-day TDY and within 30 days de-
parted south for over 3 weeks and in each case departed
with absolute assurance the Station was in good hands,
and it was.
4. I would appreciate it if this document could
be passed to Chief, KUSODA and if appropriate a copy
placed in his personal file.

January 26, 1961
Dear Shel,
I would like to take this opportunity to belatedly
express the sincere appreciation of both my office and
the Broadcasting Service of this Agency for the assist-
ance rendered by employees of your staff, Mr. James
O'Connell and Mr. Ervon Kuhnke in September and
December of last year. This assistance consisted of
picking up tape recordings prepared by Radio Moscow
in the possession of Mr. Paul Frederick Dauer, 1923
De La Vina Street, Santa Barbara, California and
delivering them to my office for the information of our
Broadcasting Service. In addition to this service, Mr.
Kuhnke of your staff readily volunteered to see that
these tapes were returned to Mr. Dauer and this
latter service was performed last month.
The excellent spirit of liaison co-operation
evidenced by your staff is most gratifying to me and
it is hoped that I might be of service in some similar
matter in the future.
Sincerely,
i

SUBJECT
: Commendation
1. Upon your reassignment from Chief, Operational Support
Branch to Deputy Chief, SSD, I wish to forward my personal com-
mendation for your many years of outstanding performance in
operational support. You have displayed not only an unusual apti-
tude in the security handling of support, but have evidenced a
highly professional intelligence approach to the many problems
given you. As example, I cite a recent case where through certain
assets of this office, you arranged for and directed the spotting,
recruitment, briefing, cover and cut-out arrangements for an
agent engaged in a very sensitive operation of interest to the high-
est authorities in the Agency, and conducted it on an "Eyes Only"
basis.
2. In this operation, as in many others, you have exercised
imagination with both judgment and discretion; all of which has
brought great credit to this office, the Deputy Director (IUS), your
Division, and, of course, yourself.
3. I congratulate you and am confident of your continued suc-
cess in the office and in the Office of Security Career Service.
4. I am arranging to file copies of this letter in your Person-
nel and Administrative files.

Commendation of Security Office Personnel
1. It is with pleasure that I wish to plug to your
Special Security Division a personal commendation of two officers
who have assisted materially in the establishment and continued
successful management of the AEFILTE project.
2. Confronted with a sudden requirement to deploy
several security officers to a new activity here in the United
States, Mr. James P. (Cornell)
11 Jr., contributed materially to
the project The scoretion of several neighborhood checks,
re-assignment of several Security Office personnel, the prepara-
tion of two safe houses on short notice, and the reception of
sensitive alien personnel under the strictest security precau-
tions. Kr. O'Connell has put in many hours on this project, well
beyond his normal routine, and several times at great persona
convenience.

d his job not only thoroughly but quite
cheerfully, despite actual personal hardship.
4. It is all too seldom that the Divisions get around
to giving credit where it is due, even in the domestic activities

tion is the least token that can be proffered to two devoted and
skilled civil servants.

accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER
The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall
determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in oncformance
with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and
acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.
This form should be checked for holding of office, pension, suitability in con-
nection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the
following:
(1) Identity of appointee.-It is the duty of the appointing officer to
guard against inpersonation and to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the
appointee is the same person whose appointment was authorized. The
appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application
and or other pertment papers. If the appointee qualified in a written exami
nation, the signature on this form should be compared with the signature on
the declaration sheet, which was signed in the examination room. His physical
appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointee
may also be questicaed on his personal history for agreement with his previous
clatements.
(1) Age. If definite agé limits have been established for the position, it should
be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment.
Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.
(3) Citizenship -The appunting officer is responsible for observing the
citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) appropriation acts.
Farm 61 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of
citizenship status in the absence of conflicting evidence, la doubtful cases the
appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from
the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission,
(4) Members of Family -Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that
whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under
probational or permanent appointment in the compentive service, no other
member of such family is elighie for probational or permanent appointment in
the competitive service. The appointments of persons conted to veteran
reference are not subject to this requirement. The members of family provision
does not apply to temporary appointments. Doubtful cases may be referred to
the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission for decision.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
: Narrative Fitness Report
Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security
1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1-April
1971 to 31 March 1972. The rating period covers the third full
year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of
Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.
•
2. The directorate which Mr. O'Connell supervises is
geographically widely separated in the Headquarters area. This
separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the
directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,
operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities.
During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's
directorate took or on important, added responsibility--the security
of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity
of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with
serious security problems because of the severe compaction of
information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability of
technology in the field of data handling. The achievements of the
Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Over-
seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina -
tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified
security policy.
3.
In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely
located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved
effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging their
responsibilities..
4. Mr. O'Connell also spearheads the security program
which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic
operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal
interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to
the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security
carecrists to those positions.
5. During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr.
O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding.'
He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant
an OUTSTANDING rating.
6. Mr. O'Connell has seen this Fitness Report.

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1-April 1968 -
through 31 March 1969.
2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security

his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 August
1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision
of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,
he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to
our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the
Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1968,
Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of
these varied and complex activities. He is an alert and intelligent
supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-
cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate
which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was
instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division
made nécessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security
staff in Frankfurt, West Germany. He is an astute manager and an

Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security
:
1. This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the
period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.
2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served
as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and
Overseas Secarity. The rating period covers his second full year
in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has
gained added importance and increased attention during the year.
It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to
the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell
has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our
vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from
Mr. O'Connell
domestic efforts resulting from national unrest.
has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon
sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his
people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to
simplify their solutions.
3. During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's
performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding
features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient
addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his
over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties
broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices.
He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary
obligations within his Directorate.
4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to
express himself well in both written and oral form. His career
is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-
formances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior
Security executive. However, I feel that he has not as yet applied
all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance
as DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extra-
ordinarily capable and effective in producing results. Conversely,
however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems
in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't
feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that
he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I
am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and
is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance.
his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features.
I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and
excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the
Agency.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive
_ for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of
his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,
that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for
the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and
initiative. Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics.

Deputy Director for Support
Narrative Fitness Report
James P. O'Connell
Chief, Executive Staff
29. APR 1968
:
1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of
this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period
covered by this Fitness Report.
2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration
and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been
meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving
this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective
in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the
initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the
assignment of action with appropriate coordination.
3. Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior
executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive
experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing
responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance
in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security
1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of
Security for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security.

separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the
directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,
operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities.
During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's
directorate took on an important, added responsibility--the security
of automatic data processing. This function covers the complexity
of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with
serious security problems because of the severe compaction of
information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability of
technology in the field of data handling. The achievements of the
Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Over-
seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-
tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified
security policy.
3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely
located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved ·
effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

innovative manner and have been effective in discharging their
responsibilities.
4. Mr. O'Connell also spearheads the security program
which furnishes Security Officers to overseas stations and domestic
operations as necessary. Mr. O'Connell has taken a personal
interest in this activity and has been of considerable assistance to
the Office of Security Career Board in the assignment of Security
careerists to those positions.
5. During the last Fitness Report, the description of Mr.
O'Connell's performance was raised from "Strong" to "Outstanding."
He has continued his performance in such a manner as to warrant
an OUTSTANDING rating.

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security
This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the
period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.
1.
2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served
as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and
Overseas Security. The rating period covers his second full year
in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has
gained added importance and increased attention during the year.
It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to
the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell
has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our
vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from
domestic efforts resulting from national unrest. Mr. O'Connell
has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-
sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his
people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to
simplify their solutions.
3. During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's
performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding
features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient
addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his
over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

: Narrative Fitness Report
Mr. James P. O'Connell
Deputy Director of Security for
Physical, Technical and Overseas Security
!, This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1969
through 31 March 1970.
2. The rating period covers the first full year that Mr.
O'Connell has served as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
Technical and Overseas Security at the GS-16 level.
3.
The year encompassed in the rating period has seen
myriad complex and varied additional responsibilities develop
within Mr. O'Connell's Directorate. Specifically, he has super-
vised the activation and implementation of the Overseas Security
Support Division, a new component within the Office and an
extremely important one. He has supervised the first full year
of implementation of the Interagency Training Center at Hedgeneck,
Maryland, which falls within the purview of the Chief, Technical
Division. Finally, he has been a participant in an overall survey
of the security of the Headquarters Building and has supervised
the Chief, Physical Security Division in developing and applying
new physical security techniques and realistic principles of physical
security. Mr. O'Connell is a capable and efficient supervisor.
He is a veteran in the Office of Security and has a knowledge of all
of the various ramifications of the Agency's total security mission.

4. Mr. O'Connell is poised and expresses himself very:
well, both in oral and written form. . I evaluate Mr. O'Connell's
performance over the past year as STRONG with several outstanding
features. I have confidence in his judgment and ability and consider
him a valuable career asset of this Office. His has been a difficult
task in that as well as assuming new and additional functions, he
has been burdened with the supervision of one Division Chief who
has proven to be extremely difficult to handle over the years. In
fairness to Mr. O'Connell, I should add that no one in this Office
has been particularly effective in supervising this individual who
is now slated for early retirement. I believe that with this individ-
ual's departure Mr. O'Connell should be able to achieve a more
coherent integration of his Directorate's functions in the interest
of further efficiency and effectiveness.
