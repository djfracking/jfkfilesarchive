Subject is Max LKSNICK y Menendez, non-immigrant visa applicant born 8
September 1930 in Vueltas, Las Villas, Cuba. Profession, salesman
President of Juventud Ortodoxa and Orthodoxo party leader in opposition
to BATISTA. He is currently in hiding from police until the heat is
off. In 1954, he signed the Comite Cubano declaration in favor of
Guatemala. Pe was referred to as a Communist sympathizer through
collaboration between Ortodoxos and Communists and friendship well-
known Cuban Communists possibly embracing Section 212 (a) (27) and (26).
Security checks show no indications of collaboration with Communists.
Latter at times tried to get on the bandwagon of all opposition groups
including the Ortodoxo. Specific information from Cuban Government
sources regarding Ortodoxo-Communist pacts were later, admitted to the
local CAS as fabrications. LESNICK states that he signed the Pro-
Guateriala declaration against big foreign business domination of Latin
American affairs as did many other Cubans. He states that he is only
acquainted with student Communist leaders at the University of Habana
He denies that he collaborated with the Communists during the past or
resent and brings published articles dating back to 1950 which indicate
This anti-Communist stand. His name appears in the Soundex for
questioning.
+
:
The local CAS is especially interested in the case. A favorable
decision is recomended by the visa officers.
LESNICK plans attend Inter-American Press Association meeting to be
held 12 October in Washington, entering New York 12 October at 1:35:
p.m. via Cubana airline.

4. GARCIA Baroona feels that the Ortodoxo Party has only about a 25 per cent chance
of winning a Presidential election -- not because it could not command enough
votes, but because the current regime of terrorism would not dare permit an
opposition party to come into power. They have gone too far on the road to
government by assassination, imprisonment, and robbery to give up their power,
he said. Nevertheless, in his opinion there is no alterative to an election.
He feels that, even if the Ortodoxos cannot alect a President, they may elect a
mimber of Senators and Representatives in Congress. He will propose that
Reman BARQUIN be run as a candidate for the Senate even if BARQUIN is still in
prison at the time of the elections. He did not believe that there were any
legal obstacles.

Regarding Fide CASTRO
ASTRO Rus, he said that CASTRO was an impetuous and perhaps even
an irresponsible leader, but one who could not be ignored in any new government
because to the youth of the country he represents an ideal and for this reason no
stable government could be fomad without him. He d he differed with CASTRO on
the matter of military principles. He does not believe that CASTRO will be able
to attract my significant defections or support from the Army. He said that CASTRO
originally believed that, if he could only establish a beachhead in Oriente, shou
strength in that area, while at the same time show-the army that he had supporte
in Habana by agitating here, he would be able to find support in the Army Itsole:
particularly in Camp Columbia. This was CASTRO's big mistake, according to
GARCIA Bárcena. Since CASTRO cannot take Camp Columbia, he is isolated. GARCIA
Bárcena did not believe that CASTRO was ultra-nationalistio but that apparently
some of his followers were from the tone of some of the propaganda of the 26th of
July Movement. GARCIA Bárcena, because of his previous influence among Cuban
youth, apparently sees himself as the person to offeet or balance the impulsiveness
of CASTRO if his group ever comes to power
Held Comments

Rafac CARCIA Bárcena was one of the founders of the Partido del Pueblo Cubano
(Ortodoxo) but separated from it because of differences of opinion with the
leaders Roberto AGRAMUNTS and Jose AFDO Llads. He had been a University
professor and instructor of military psychology at the Cabaña Fortress and
one time had considerable following among Cuban youth and many friends in the
Cuban Army. In Aril 1953 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for
conspiracy against the BATISTA Government but was released by amnesty in June 1954.
Since then he has refrained from revolutionary activities and has been occupied
with writing mildly anti-Government articles for various publications and
maintaining contact with the principal leaders of the opposition parties. In a
forthcoming article to appear in Bohemia, he will exhort the youth of Cuba to give
up their violent revolutionary activities and to weak power through elections in
1958.

Military Intelligence Service) received information that the Partido Socialista
Popular (PSP, Cuban Communist Party) had plans to launch a strong anti-Government"
campaign based on the subject of the proposed a Cuba" canal. The PSP planned
to main behind the scenes and to use as many excmonts of the opposition as it
could to sponser its propagand line that the present Coverment had cold out to
the United States and that the proposed canal was morely, an extension of the
Panama Canal. Groups from the Ortodoxo Party (Partido del Pueblo Cubano (Ortada)
A by MaxMTS, reportedly collaborated with the PSP in the planning of the
protest campaign against the canal. Cuban intellectuals and professional men,
sympathetic to Communion or connected in one way or another with the PSP, were to
bo the ones who would launch the campaign stressing the selling-out-of-sovereignty
themo and the road for a miler referendum before any Cuben goverment made any
treaty or agreement affects the territorial integrity of the nation.

Report of Revolutionary Preparations in Central
America Against Cuban Government
No additional information conceming alleged plans of the Caribbean Legion-
to attack the Batista government has been received by the Higsico.” The
latest available information regarding revolutionary activities against
that government is contained in HXH-6.78.
Reports received in the past concerning the Caribbean Legion a attempts to
enlist BATISTÁ support for Legion revolutionary activities have been
given a low evaluation (as to content), as indicated in the pertinent
portions of HKH-467 and HKH-397. To date the Kission has received no
information which would warrant changing sich an evaluation.
3. Indications here, are that the Batista regine is too preoccupied with a
possible revolt: attempt originating within the country to perdt planning
for any offensive action against any other country in the Caribben
Recent friendly overtures by BATISTA, in the form of decorations bestowed
on Hector TRUJILLO of the Dominican Republio and PEREZ Jimenes of Venesuela,
also serve to indicate that the present Cuban goverment is not contemplats
any action against those countries.
As to
12
possible attack on the Batista regine from outside Cuba, the Cuban
Armed Forces and security agencies have long been alerted to a possibi
air attack on key installations in Rabana as well as multiple assmil

1. The RSP (Partido Socialista Popular Cuban Communist Party)
high command maintains continued interest to a very large degree
in the Juventud Socialista organization. One of the principal.
tasks of the communist party is to maintain the direction of
a strong comunist youth novelient which will respond only to
the ideological foundation of the communist party. In the PSP::
the most insistent voice of this coniunist principle is that
of BLAS ROCK who takes a personal interest in the direction
of the Juventud Socialista and constantly watches over its'
activities through trusted lieutenants. Many of the present
leaders of the PSP were formerly leaders of the Juventud Com-
nista, the former Juventud socialista. Men of this type. are
Sévero, AGUERRE, ɛse SUAREZ, and Osvaldo CEZ, prominent
PSP member in Canagley Province. On its om part tho Juventud
Socialista maintains a close liaison with the National Executive
Committee of the PSP through its leader, Flavio, BRAVO, Tho
attends the weekly meetings of the National Committee.
"
The caliber of the Juventud Socialista direction is high...
Its leaders are militant communists and many members of the
Juventud Socialista National and Provincial Committees have.
been political candidates for various government offices in
past elections. Secord to Flavio BRAVO in the leadership of
the Grow is Luist. As ARTI; both of these men were political
candidates in recent elections and have attended various con-
ferences abroad. Other leaders of note are: Lionel Soro,
SOTO,
President of the School of Philosophy, Habana University;
Bienvenido and his wife, Yolanda LOPEZ PERSZ; Federico,
Rita and Georgina VILAR, all children of the well-knom con-
munist leades César VILA, who are educated in Russia; Julio
ACHADO; Bientenido SUAREZ, RVALDES VIVO; Ramón CALCINES,

The structure of the Juventud Socialista is like that of the
PSP. It has committees in all the districts (barrios) of the
City of Habana and in the larger cities of the interior. Up
until now the Juventud Socialista has not had, according to
source. clandestine leaders to take the place of the present
overt leaders in case the party is outlived, nor does it now
have these clandestine leavers. However, source feels that
there are many secondary and less well-krom leaders within
the Juventud Socialista who would be able to assume the direc
tion of a clandestine comunist outh organization if the
PSP decided such an organizatio should be set up. Source
supplies the following names a possible clandestine leaders
of such an organizations JulACHADO, "response juvenile

de Cuba) (Communist) a few years ago Bienvenido SUAREZ, Mo

Habana Province.
L&
The P310 Administrative's anti-conmunist attitude over the
past six monthsms not visibly affected unfavorably the wilty
of the Juventus Socialista, according to source. Source gives
as a reason for this the fact that the ranks of the Juventud
Socialista are composed of proven con:unist militant youths..
Source claims he knows of only one case of defection from the
Juventud Socialista rants, that of a youth named Elion CAPESTANY,
Juventud Socialista leader in the Escuela de Artes y Oficios
who has joined the Juventud del PAU.
Comment
As is well knom, in other communist parties under
similar circumstances and as we have previously re
portod, sone comunists have been instructed to in
filtrate other political parties. It is difficult
to understand how source can conclude positively
that the CAPESPAIY case was one of defection from
the Juventud Socialista.

It is true, however, that the PSP has examined very carefully
the ranks of the Juventud Socialista Dor signs of bourgeois
weakness. The barrio committees of the PSP established simi-

The Comisión Juvenil of the cic (Communist) is the some

The
in mind of gaining new members for the party as a mole.
methods by which they tried to attract new members for the
Juventud Socialista were made up of sewing clubs for girls,
English classes, parlor cames, and, from time to time, dances.
This method had good results as far as getting the youth to
draw closer to the Juventud Socialista; however; racial feel-
ing militated against the complete success of this method.
for many ite girls found that they were expected to nix
and dance with negroes, which was against their personal con-
victions. As a result of this racial prejudice, the majority
of netro girls among the Juventud Socialista ranks is noticeable.
The PSP has no hanaged to purify the ranks of the Juventud..
Socialista in preparation for a harder life ahead. The former
sewing circles, paflor-canes, and dances; have disappeared and
in their lace entertainment less conducive to stirring up
racial prejudice, such as excursions into the country, etc.
are taking place."Today, the Juventud Socialista rants
can more or less be counted upon to act in a united fashion
for the good o PSP and to follow the orders of their
leaders.
16. Although there are no official figures on the membership of
the Juventud Socialista, source uses as a yardstick the fact
that on one occasion Flavio BRAVO stated that there were more
than 15,000 socialist youths in the nation and that of these
more than 10,000 were in the City of Habana. Sourae believes
that there is probably an overlay between a member of the
Juventud Socialista who is of voting age and also affiliates
with the PSP dering elections. Taling into account this
duplication of membership, source believes that the 15,000
figure is correct,
The present activities of the Juventud Socialista are listed
as, follors:
The cost important job of the Juventud Socialista is its
support of the peace partisans movement. This consists
of street demonstrations, making signs for various parades,
collectire signatures, etc.
B. The Juventui Socialista constant tries to maintain good
relations with other solital youth organizations, such
as the Juventud del PAU, of the Ortodoxos, and of the Autén-
