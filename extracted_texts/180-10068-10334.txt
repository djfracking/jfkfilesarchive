STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 9
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515
December 21, 1978
Hohorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
U.S.House of Representatives
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Chairman:
One of the Committee's employees, Eileen G. Dinneen, used her
annual and sick leave in July, 1978 for maternity reasons.
Upon her return to work on August 1, 1978, she elected to work
25% of her time at 25% of her previous salary.
On September 1, 1978, the amount was raised in both instances to
50%. And then, on December 1, 1978, she returned to full-time status to
assist the Committee on the final report.
While the action on December 1, 1978 was duly approved, through
some error the Committee's budget officer was not informed. Consequently,
no payroll authorization form was processed to increase her salary.
am now enclosing a payroll aothorization form to correct this
error by increasing her alary to the proper amount of $16,100.00.
I would appreciate your approving this new authorization so that
Mrs. Dinneen will receive the additional amount due her in the December,
1978 supplemental payroll.
