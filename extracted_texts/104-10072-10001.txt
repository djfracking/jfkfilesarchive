If the business failed for one reason or another, it does not signify anything
more than a loss of time and some short-range hopes, but not in an importas i

'finca mi morena'. I think that, depending on how things appear, we should
sotivate our requests and also contemplate new solutions to the large problem.
I am writing today to the farmly to maintain a contimity of action and to
see if the prevailing circumstances can be taken advantage of and given a
purpose.
"I consider it extremely important that we maintain ourselves in closer
correspondence than up to now. I understand that it is I who have failed to
answer you, but I hope that the explanation of the events are sufficient.
Failing to do so would be to fail to show interest and would even result in
everything becoming cold and paralysed for who knows how long.
"The big carl? Arrote me very affectionately. I think that the problems that
they cause each other are completely negative and that they cause us to deviate
from the only road which should be followed."
