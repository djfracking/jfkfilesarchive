1. We have been notified that the POA for GICITRON-4 was
cancelled on 22 October 1970 because we failed to provide a
PRQ Part II showing the details of our present relations with

1. The receipt of Reference & Provisional Operational Approval for Subject
vas much appreciated. We were puzzled, however, by the request for PRQ Parts I
and II on GICITROH-4 since all biographic and operational data on him with the
exception of References and DIRECTOR 006731 is on record only at Headquarters as
far as we are avare unless Mexico City has retained their old file on him. Fara-
graph 3 of Reference B specifically requested that pertinent material from Subject's
201 be forwarded to Bogotá, but we have never received it.
2. Errol C. Lythgoe, despite his old friendship with Subject, has no present
justifiable reason consistent with cover to question him regarding all the bio-
graphic details required for preparation of a full FRQ Fart I. Nor could Lythgoe
logically elicit from Subject the answers to such PRQ Part II items as "How, when,
where, why and by whom Subject was first contacted or developed" by RWROCK, "List:
other case officers who have handled Subject or whom he knows or has known...", and
the like.
3. Subject's proposed present operational use is detailed in Reference B, and
Headquarters has the rest of the basic data necessary for preparation of both parts
of the PRQ. It is therefore suggested that this be done at Headquarters, with
copies. being forwarded to Bogot& for updating.
