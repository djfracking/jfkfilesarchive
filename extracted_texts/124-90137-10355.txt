include the following: in this summary stating it comes from our

numerous Bureau reports written during 1957 and 1958." CIA

written by subject Alicia Merino Fuentes) and states that our (5)
report dated 10/12/56-contained information that she was an
active communist. This report was in the case on Merino Fuentes

A review of this Bureau's file on subject fails to
revent thatche wrote bank drafts to active communist workers
with the possible exception of Alicia Morine Fuentes. with
regaf to her, the only allegation that she was an active
communist worker was made in February, 1941, by a person whose
reliability was unknown to the United States Embassy in
Mexico City, D. F. Our investigation failed to substantiate
this allegation and you were so advised by letter under above
caption dated September 24, 1959. Furthermore, at the time
subject's bank draft to her was written (February 10, 1958)
subject and Perino Fuentes were both connected with the Mexican
Mission to the United Nations.) a fact which tends to reduce the
intelligence significance of this payment.
Based on information in the files of this Bureau
appears inadvisable to include in your summary to the Bundeant
fuer Verfassungsschutz (BTV), Germany, that subject wrote bank (S
drafts to active communist workers of to suggest that he "was
used as a means of financing Communist Party activities (2)
