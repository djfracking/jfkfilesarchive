1. JEREMY K BENADUM, WHO HANDLES [LITEMPO VISA CHANNEL, BELIEVES
PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE GET MEXICAN VISA BY APPROACHING MEXICAN CONSUL
MIAMI OR SJAN. PROBLEM IS GETTING GOBERNACION VISA PERMIT. GOBERNACION
HAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS STACKED UP ON WHICH ACTION
NORMALLY BUROCRATICALLY SLOW ANYWAY AND ON WHICH GOBERNACION DOES NOT
REALLY DESIRE TAKE ACTION, BECAUSE OF DANGER CUBANS WILL BECOME PUBLIC
CHARGES. BEST CHANCE IS FOR ANY HIGH LEVEL MEXICAN OFFICIAL IN MEXICO
CITY FRONT FOR AMBANG-1 AND FOLLOW UP CASE CLOSELY THROUGH GOBERNACIÓN.
NEXT BEST CHANCE IF A-Ì HAS NO SUCH HIGH LEVEL CONTACT IS TO USE
ANY CUBAN FRIEND OF HIS MEXI WHO HAS SUCH HIGH LEVEL MEXICÂN CONTACT.

THIS IS USUAL METHOD. USE OF STATION LITEMPO CHANNEL WOULD NOT

NECESSARILY BURN ODYOKE INTEREST IN A-1 BECAUSE HIGH LEVEL GOBERNACION
