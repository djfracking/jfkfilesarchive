December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 2
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.
Substitute Language: SSN

-
INVESTIGATOR
It is my recommendation that
Clarence Day be hired as an investigator
for the JFK Task Force. His resume is very
impressive and his long career as a law en-
forcement officer certainly qualifies him
to be an investigator for this Committee.
Equally important were his re-
actions to the questions I posed to him. He
came across as an intelligent man who is well
versed in the law as it applies to the rights
of individuals, and he impressed me as a man
who would be a valuable member of our task
force.
