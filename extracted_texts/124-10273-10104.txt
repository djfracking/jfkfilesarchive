In connection with developments in the case
716-18-97
captioned NK 2264-S,) (IS-R," Bureau file 134-9824,] the [SD
(CRCNCK
Director hoted "I note more and more we are telling CIA
about our domestic operations and always to our detriment.
I want this trend stopped. H." (A separate memorandum is
being submitted concerning a new development in the afore-
mentioned case).
On 3/15/67, the Liaison Agent met with Richard
Helms, Director, CIA, and took the opportunity to review
the status of relations between FBI and CIA. It was
felt that this was an opportune time to do so in view of
the Director's concern as expressed above.
Corpo-
Helms stated that he personally was pleased with
relations between the two Agencies. He stated that sometimes
he is irked or disturbed when people outside and inside of
the Government ask the question "How are you getting along
with the FBI?" He indicated that this question is frequently
asked by members of Congress. Helms stated that he
religiously has followed a practice of lucidly and firmly
advising such people that relations are excellent. He
stated that he personally believed that this was true.
The Liaison Agent commented that working relations
are good, but there was an area which might not be getting
proper attention. The Agent stated that there was reason
to be concerned regarding effective coordination on those
cases which are of interest to both FBI and CIA because there
appeared to be developing an atmosphere where people in both
Agencies felt that there was now wide-open liberty to conduct
operations and activities of a joint nature. The Agent
stated that he wished to emphasize that such an atmosphere
cannot exist and that Mr. Hoover would never condone any
trend in this direction. The Agent commented that work in
this area had to be very efficiently coordinated and that we
in the Bureau were closely scrutinizing each situation as it
develops where both Agencies had an interest. The Agent
suggested that Mr. Helms might desire to alert appropriate
subordinates in the Agency on this point. 62-80752.

On 3/31/67, the Liaison Agent advised (Mr. Leo [C]
Dunn of the change in handling alien interview requests [C]
at FBI Headquarters. [Dunn was advised that the overall (CJ
coordination for handling these requests would be handled
by the Bureau's Name Check Section under the coordination
of Special Agent J. W. Brown.
Inasmuch as CIA occasionally makes a telephonic
request when expedite matters are involved, the Liaison
Agent obtained the names of Eugene Young and Becky Vaughn.
as the persons who would call Special Agent Brown in the
event an expedite matter is involved. CIA is well aware
that the use of this telephonic request should be held to
a minimum and used only at times when time is of the
essence and the matter is of sufficient importance to
deviate from the normal request procedures.
