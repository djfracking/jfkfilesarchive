I really don't know. It was a small

Yes.

Sternfield went down
there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was
in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.
And have those operations been terminated entirely
or are they now run out of the Washington area?
24

A
All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

Q
Is there a CIA station in Puerto Rico?
2
A
No. There was but there isn't any more. There
10
hasn't been one there for years.
When was it disbanded?
A I think the station was established around 1958
6
and
7
perhaps it was established before that. I think it
went out of existence in 1958.

Q
Do you know why it went out of existence?

A
No, I don't. I don't have any idea.

Do you know what function it was performing?

12
Q
You mentioned earlier that Bernard Barker worked
13
in the Cuban community for the CIA?
14
A
He worked with these fronts, too.
15
Q
Was he performing any intelligence function in the
16
community?
17
A
Intelligence functions. Well
18
Q
Was he collecting information?
19
A
Sure. If he got information that he thought was
9
20
worthwhile he would pass it on.
21
Q
Now, would he have been considered one of the three
22
or 500 persons employed or assigned to the Miami Station?
23
A
Yes. He was a contract employee.
24
Q
And were intelligence requirements levied on such
25
contract employees?

I beg your pardon
does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

A Well, actually one can fall into the other. The
paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days
we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was
media placement. We had a number of operations at legal-
type operations, harassment operations.
For instance, Fidel
seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a
Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in
the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings
that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned
in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in
the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I
guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from
about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like
15
that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because
some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutt
this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,
this type of thing. So subsequently,
we found out that he was)

A Well, we used all-source information to find out what
his commercial dealings were. When we would see well, for
instance, the Nicaro Nickel Mine which is a source owned
by the General Services Administration, finally got back into
production and nickel, of course, and still is
supply. We had a French firm, Societe le Nickel,
was in short
who was
buying almost the entire output of the Nicaro mines. And this
French firm ex ported to the United States. So we went to
the Treasury Department and to the Foreign Assets Control
people and said, isn't there something we can do to stop these
le Nickel exports coming into the United States? So they looked
into the thing and indeed they did.

Who owned the mine?

It was this type of thing that obviously he was
trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any
money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

they would either approve the operation or say

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

Obviously, these guys trained. In order to run one
of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to
see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our
own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We
contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped
it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking
down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have
everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive
equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going to

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveilla
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the

of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureaus
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biographic

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches,
obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

It could range from
anything from a first mate, a captain or chief engineer of a
Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people
as possible recruitments, for possible recruitment, we would ask
that all the information on that individual be assembled so that
we could do a complete target study

everything right down the line. In case of some of the more.
important ones, of course, we had psychological studies prepared
where we had enough information. But this is one of the things

these people did. If we said we want everything you have on the

start looking through the papers or anything else to come up

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require
ments on them if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently
because the common interests,
we have a common interest in
what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular
operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubans
were doing, then we would task our people with that.
For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into
Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then
there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.
But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the
boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, who
it came back on the air. And this is the type of thing. As
a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200
Cuban troops.

United States, talked about and believed that they were involvet
in the CIA sponsored activities. Is that true?

November 22, 1963, was a Friday.
When you say that
records reveal that he was on a duty status the next day

It was a Friday. Then I was mistaken.

Does that mean he was on duty the following Monday

A
No. I really wouldn't know, but the relationship was
a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these
people as well as they were assigint us.
Q What assistance would you render for members of
the press in Miami?
A
Well, in the case of the Latin American editor
we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of
areas he periodically visited and the Chiefs of Stations
would give him background briefings and this type of thing
on the developments
A
within a given country.
Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?
Predominantly, I would say probably the Miami

And what was the nature of that relationship?
Traditionally the Chief of Station maintained the

Latin American editor, as well as relationships with staff
members of

hink it is the Miami News and stringers for
the other newspapers and periodicals stationed in Miami.

What was the purpose of those relationships?
A. I really couldn't say what the prupose of the relation-
17
ship was. I mean, the same reason that we establish a relation-
18
ship with the press in this town. There were certain things that
19
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

might come to the attention of the press involving true names
and incidents that we felt should perhaps not be surfaced at any

Well, the membership varied. As I said, we were
principally interested in the leadership of the organizations.
Once the organization was established and the leadership took
over, then they would take care of enlisting the, I guess,
getting membership from the Cuban exile community to join.

What were their functions, the fronts?

Well, it was to bring some unity out of this chaotic
