HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY PERSONAL RIVALRIES AMONG THEIR TOP
OFFICIALS. PART OF DISIP'S DIFFICULTIES ARISE FROM CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT IN THE HANDLING OF THE ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN
IN THE EASTERN STATES. ANOTHER PART STEMS FROM MUTUAL DISTRUST
AND BACKBITING AMONG ITS LEADERS. DISIP'S EFFICIENCY, WHICH UNDER
NORMAL CONDITIONS IS NONE TOO GOOD, IS NOT UP TO ITS USUAL
STANDARD. DISIP DIRECTOR GIMENEZ HAS VOICED HIS LACK OF
FAITH IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF DISIP OFFICERS AND HAS
