STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIONS TAKEN
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO
COUNTER SUBVERSION FOR THE
PERIOD 1 NOV - 1 DEC 1963
3. Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arms.
On 9 November 1963 the Commander-in-Chief, US
Southern Command (USCINCSO) advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS) of reports concerning suspected subversive arme smuggling
into Venezuela or Colombia from the Colon Free Zone, Panama.
USCINCSO initiated surveillance at first light on 9 November 1963
to detect and track surface vessels which might be engaged in the
subversive traffic. The JCS directed the Commander-in-Chief,
Atlantic (CINGLANT) to commence surveillance with radar equipped
aircraft and to keep USCINGSO advised of all information. Sus-
pected craft were not positively identified or intercepted; however,
there were indications that an unidentified surface vessel off the
Ric Hacha area of Colombia and in Colombian watere was probably
in contact with small boats operating from the Colombian coastline
at night.
b. As directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USCINESO
developed a plan under which the United States could provide assist-
ance to Venesuelan forces, on three levels of participation, designed
to prevent the surreptitious movement of Castro-Communist arms
and personnel into Venezucia. To be fully effective, the plan calls
for US elements operating from Venezuelan territory which is not
considered a likely subject for approval by the Government of
Venezuela at the present time.
A joint survey and mobile training team of eleven men was
provided by USCINCSO to Venezuela on 22 November 1963, upon
approval of the concept by the Government of Venesuela. The purpose
of the team is to train Venezuelan military personnel in organizing
and operating a joint operations center; in improving capabilities
in the plotting and coordination of intelligence data, and aerial photo-
graphy; and in coordinating all Venezuelan military and paramilitary
organisations involved in surveillance and intercept operations.

5. Strengthening of Counterinsurgency Capabilities.
Two minesweepers from the US Atlantic Command, Uss
STURDY and USS SWERVE with Commander Mine Division 44 cm-
barked, commenced a schedule of visits to Caribbean ports in Costa
Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Visits are intended to assist cach
country in improving its coastal and off-shore surveillance effort,
to improve intercept capabilities with respect to the prevention of
infiltration of arms and subversive personnel through the countries'
territorial waters, and to establish procedures which would provide
for US assistance in final interception when requested. Visits in
November, under the supervision of USCINCSO, covered Puerto
Limon, Costa Rica; Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua; and
Puerto Barrios, Guatemala.
b. Seventy-eight Latin American officere, previously en-
rolled, were in attendance during November at courses stressing
counterinsurgency conducted by the US Army Canal Zone school.
Two officers graduated from the US Army Counterinsurgency Course
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on 12 November 1963 and two addi-
tional officers are now in attendance.
Seven US Army Counterinsurgency Mobile Training Teams
based in the Canal Zone, consisting of twenty officers and thirty-five
enlisted men, provided training in seven Latin American countries
during November.
Nine enlisted men from Chile were in attendance at
Marine Corps schools at Camp Pendleton, California in November.
US Coast Guard training in small boat operations was
provided in the Canal Zone for fifteen students from five Caribbean
countries in the operation and maintenance of forty-foot Coast Guard
utility boats. A Coast Guard mobile training team of one officer and
two enlisted men, based in the Canal Zone, provided training in
Costa Rica for the reconditioning of Coast Guard utility boats. Five
members of the Costa Rican Guardia Civil are receiving on-the-job
training in connection with reconditioning of the boats.

into Ecuador. Ship movement information had been provided to the
US Naval Attache Bogota by the District Intelligence Officer of the
Fifteenth Naval District. There was no apparent involvement of
Cuban arme or Cuban trained personnel in this instance.
7. Other Special Actions.
Construction is now in progress on the Latin American
Military Communications System (LAMCS) in Quito, Ecuador; the
terminal station is expected to be completed in December 1963.
The station in Nicaragua is expected to be completed in early
December 1963.
b. In response to à request by USCINCSQ, action was taken
on 15 November 1963 to expedite delivery of communications equip-
ment required to implement a Jamaican integrated coastal surveillance
system. The system was originally approved as part of the $500
thousand one-time grant of Military Assistance material directed
by the President in April 1963, but world-wide shortages of specific
items threatened to delay shipment in some cases until FY 1965. In
view of the urgency of this requirement, priorities were adjusted
to provide delivery by 1 January 1964. The items include:
12
3
AN/CRC radios and installation kits
AN/ARC 3 radios
AN/PSM 6
Wattmeter
c. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of Public Safety,
State-AID, are studying the possibility of increasing the stock level
of certain items of Riot Control Equipment in the Canal Zone, in order
to meet rapidly and effectively multiple contingencies that may occur
in Latin America. In the past, the size of some requests have neceɛti-
tated shipment of certain items directly from the United States,
with
resultant increase in cost and time. USCINGSO has been asked for
his recommendations on stock levels.

£ A US Air Force counterinsurgency team of five officers
and eight enlisted men, based in the Canal Zone, provided training
for Ecuadorian Air Force personnel in Ecuador.
g. At the request of USCINSO, and with the enthusiastic
support of the Venezuelan Government, a small boat program has
been initiated to provide security for the Lake Maracaibo region.
Arrangements have been made through the US Navy under Military
Credit Sales agreement for the manufacture of six (6) 25-foot and
four (4) 31-foot inboard-outboard, fiberglass hull boats by Bertram
Boat Company, Miami, for delivery in December 1963 or early
January 1964. A SEAL-trained Mobile Training Team (MTT) of
one officer and five enlisted men will be provided by the Navy and
will report to the equipment supplier in time to become fully ac-
quainted with the boats by 15 December. The MTT will accompany
the boats to Venezuela and will remain up to two months in country
to provide necessary familiarization training.
6. Exchange of Intelligence on Cuban Surveillance.
Upon receipt of intelligence pertaining to suspected arms
amuggling from the Canal Free Zone, Panama into Colombia or
Venezuela, the USCINCSO relayed this information to Colombia and
Venesuela by the Military Alerting System. The US Ambassador to
Colombia conveyed the information to the Government of Colombia.
Colombian Navy and Air Force elements were assigned increased
surveillance missione in the Caribbean coastal area of Colombia by
Colombian military authorities and results of their surveillance
activities were provided to USCINGSO by the US Military Group
Commander in Colombia. The results of US air surveillance of
the expected route and landing area, undertaken by US Air Force
and Naval air elements were transmitted to the US Military Group
Commander in Colombia for passage to the Colombian military
authorities.
b. The motor vessel BLUE STAR, of Panamanian registry,
was apprehended by Ecuadorian authorities in November 1963 as
it was attempting the clandestine introduction of contraband articles

In connection with the Seventh Congress of the
International Union (UIA) held in Habana September 29
October 3, 1963 the Buenos Aires Station:
(1) encouraged the Argentine National Federation
of Architects to oppose Argentine attendance at the
Habane meeting, with the result that 25 of the 39
practicing architects who had planned to attend can-
celled their participation;
(2) arranged to prevent the attendance of any
officially authorized Argentine delegation at the Habana
meeting, but encouraged the attendance of an official
Argentine delegation of anti-Communist coloration at an
international architects meeting to be held in Mexico

(3) delivered a memorandum to the Minister of
Interior concerning Cuban charter flights to Brazil which
supported the Ambassador's request that the Argentine
government express concern over such flights.
b. Rio de Janeiro Station continued to furnish
the Embassy with data on Cubane Flights to Brazil used
in representations to the Brazilian Foreign Office.
Also induced Rio airport officials to impose stringent
passport control and baggage efforts. These efforts
contributed to the Brazilian Government's failing to
issue landing permits for Cabana flights on September
21, 24 and 25, 1963 forcing their cancellation. When
Cubana, because of harassment at Rio, began using the
landing facilities in Sao Paulo where controls were
Don existent, CIA initiated and obtained a local liaison
egrcement for similar harassment in the event of future
Cabana flights to Sao Paulo.
Mexico City station inspired a press campaiga
of hoof and mouth and smallpox epidemics in Cuba, prior
to the Architects Congress to discourage participation
in the flabana meeting. The resulting quarantines and

Instructed Embassy Rio to make a new approach to
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry to express our concern
at Cuba's continuing use of "charter" flights to Brazil
and the laxity of Brazilian officials in the control of
passengers. During the course of the month the Brazilian
Government began tightening controls against Cubana
flights. Specifically, all requests for landing permission
yere henceforth to be processed by the Foreign Office,
with appropriate delays. Also tighter passenger, crow
and cargo controls were to be instituted when a Cubana
flight is permitted to use Brazilien facilities.
Determined that the U.K. had specifically warned
Cubana that no aviation fuel was available in Barbados and
that II.M.G. would, in the future, respect Shell Company's
decision to deny fueling to Cubana planes.

VIII. Other Special Actions
United States Information Agency
The Agency's press service transmitted seven
articles relating to Cuban subversion on its wireless
file service to USIS offices throughout Latin America
for placement in the local newspapers. Developments
reported in these articles included demands by the Bolivian
Senate for the ouster of the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires,
terrorism and goverment counteraction in Venezuela,
the seizure in Ecuador of an arms and explosives cache
reportedly received from Cuba, several articles on the
International Union of Architects Congress in Habena
(emphasizing the intent of the Castro regime to use the
Congress as a forum for its propaganda claims), and
Assistant Secretary Martin's Los Angeles speech in which
The pointed out the regime's affinity for Chinese communist
doctrine and its continued emphasis on violent revolution
and subversion. In all, the press service transmitted
27 articles and commentaries during September on the
subject of Cuba, the other articles dealing for the most
part with economic and political conditions inside the
country as evidenced by the regime's own adalssions and
the reports of refugees..

guerrillas, or anything else that could be construed
as incriminating. The one who did admit knowledge
denied that he was involved in any way. The Government
of Quatemala wants to interrogate this person again at
a later date.
CIA Station in Montevideo arranged for an
interview between an Uruguayan military intelligence
officer and a recent defector from the Montevideo
Cuban Embassy during which extensive information regarding
Cuban subversive activities was revealed. The Uruguayan
officer prepared a report containing this data and
presented it to the National Council of Government which
has been slow to indicate concern over communist sub-
versive activity in Uruguay. As a result of this report,
the NCG has directed the Minister of Interior to appoint
a special commission to study the problem of Commimist
sabversion and to make recommendations as to what course
of action should be taken by the Uruguayan Government.

On September 27, the Agency issued a circular
instruction to alllits Latin American posts urging
greater attention to opportunities for publicizing Cuban-
stimulated subversion, suggesting the various types of
information activities to support this effort, and requesting
monthly reports of field actions taken to implement the
instruction. This was done as a follow-up to the original
instruction on Cuban subversion which was issued April 3,
2963.

Southern Command, met with Vice Admiral Ray G. Needham, USN,
Chief of Staff to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic and members of their
respective staffs during the period 11 to 15 December 1963. Discus-
sions encompassed methods of improving the existing surveillance/
intercept system throughout the Caribbean. Existing US plans were
reviewed, continuance of the ship visit program instituted in Novem-
ber 1963 was agreed upon, and combined exercises to test country
capabilities to intercept simulated intruding ships were planned for
early execution. Discussions by General O'Meara were continued
with the Secretary of the Army and with representatives of the State
Department, CIA and the Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
b. Commander Mine Division 44 with minesweepers USS
STURDY and USS SWERVE completed visits to Central American
ports in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Deficiencies in the
capabilities of all three countries to counter subversive infiltration
were reported. Additional visits, designed to assist in correcting
deficiencies, are planned. USCINOSO also plane, through Commanders
of US Military Groups, to assist in developing existing capabilities.
c. Based upon information from CAS Panama representative
on 8 November, USCINGS0 directed US operations to find a small
boat which reportedly left the Colon Free Zone with a cargo of arms
destined for the vicinity of the Colombian-Venezuelan border. Day-
light visual aerial surveillance flights were instituted immediately,
with radar-equipped aircraft taking over surveillance during hours
of darkness. Colombian and Venezuelan authorities were notified
through US diplomatic channels, but no direct communications
between US surveillance aircraft and Colombian forces in the
vicinity of the probable landing area were established before termi-
aation on 14 November. This effort, though not successful, has
evoked considerable effort by US State Department, Defense Depart-
ment and CIA activities to improve capabilities and procedures.

7. Difficulties Encountered in Filling Available Military
Quotas in the United States
The failure of Latin American countries to take full advantage
of military quotas offered has been a persistent problem. In 1962, for
example, 15 per cent of the quotas offered were unfilled. This unfavor
able situation derives from many causes. During-the current fiscal
year-18 per-sent of unfilled-Army-quotes-have-been due to inability to-
22100t-course-pro--requisites;-23 por cent because of lack of cuffcient
fundei-and-33 per-seat because of political upheavals. The armed forces
of the average Latin American country are small, and the availability of
qualified candidates who can be spared for extended periods of obligated
service and the lack of a professional non-commissioned officer corps
also tends to discourage the training of enlisted men in United States
schools, since large sume from limited budgets to train enlisted men
who will remain in service only a brief time. Another significant
deterrent is the per diem rates required by law to be paid by some
countries to service personnel seat outside their homeland. In
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay the legal rates for person-
nel serving abroad are too high to be supportable by defense budgets;
while in other countries, such as Bolivia and Paraguay, the standard
rates are too late to provide a reasonable living for students.

Outlined below is a summary of deliberations of subject sub-
committee during the meeting of October 10 at 1430 hours in Room
6273, New State. Agenda is at Tab A.
Agenda Item 1
The Final Subcommittee Report for the months of July and
August was circulated. The report has been circulated to points of
contact by separate correspondence.
Agenda Item 2
The Subcommittee discussed the SCCS letter which referred to
the recent trip of US students to Cuba. (Attached to enclosure 1) It was
apparent to all that criticism of the US could be implied from this letter.
The Chairman stated he would provide the SCCS with the substance of
State's telegram 647, which outlines actions undertaken by the US
Government against the students.
Agenda Item 3
a. CIA, in coordination with the Esso Corporation's Chief of
Industrial Security, will prepare guidance data for distribution to Latin
America which could be utilized by US commercial firms for the pro-
tection of their facilities against sabotage. The DOD representative
was requested to ascertain whether ARPA had available some commer
cial protection devices which might be applicable for use in Latin
America against sabotage attacks. The CIA representative stated he
believed ARPA had developed some devices for this purpose.

d. Action was commenced in the Colen area to provide means
to keep track of ships and boate entering or leaving the Golon Free
Zone in order to monitor the movements of those suspected of carrying
contraband. Assistance to USCINCSO was provided from the continental
United States in carrying out surveys as to equipment required on as
secretive a basis as possible, and special optical equipment to include
probable night television was approved by the Secretary of the Army
for expedited delivery to USCINCSO.
A joint survey and mobile training team from USCINCSO
continued assistance to Venezuelan authorities in improving indigenous
capabilities for surveillance and interception of intruders.
f. A US Southern Command Operations Plan 50-63 was developed
to provide for three levels of operational assistance to Venezuela in
surveillance and intercept operations. Representatives of the US Strike
Command and the Air Defense Command visited USCINCSO to assist in
developing detailed supporting plans.
g. Information was obtained by USCINCSO concerning in-country
communications capabilities of Colombia and Venezuela to receive and
disseminate surveillance information provided by US forces.
5. Strengthening of Counterinsurgency Capabilities.
CI
a. US Army training included the following: 13 students from 6
countries completed Cl operations course in the Canal Zone; & students

b. State will prepare a circular telegram to all Latin American
Ambassadors requesting that an immediate review of Country Team
Emergency and Evacuation Plans be conducted to insure that plans were
adequate to meet a stepped-up campaign of Castro-inspired sabotage.
Agenda Item 4
In lieu of a written report on the Honduran guerrilla problem,
the DOD representative proposed a firsthand report to the Subcommittee.
Colonel Walter Hutchins, who has recently returned from assignment as
US Military Attache to Honduras, presented a review of the subversion
situation in that country and then answered questions from the Subcom-
mittee. The general thrust of Colonel Hutchins' remarks confirmed that
there has been considerable Castro subversive activity in Honduras. The
most serious inroads are achieved through communist radio and press
and communist educators. Colonel Hutchins commented that recent
guerrilla activity along the Nicaraguan border was probably limited to
groups totaling between 100 and 200 men. He emphasized that Cuban-
trained Honduran guerrillas are successfully transiting by air through
Grand Cayman Island and British Honduras with some transiting Havana
to Jamaica via Belgrade. In response to a query from a State representa
tive, Colonel Hutchins pointed out that he believed that both Honduran
military and commercial interests were genuinely concerned with Castro
subversion and that some of their leaders were perfectly capable of
discerning the true nature of the communist threat to Honduras.
Agenda Item 5
The Chairman stated that the paper for training Latin Americans
in the United States (included in the "Krulak Report"*) was too broad in
scope for implementation by the Subcommittee and proposed that it be
rewritten under narrower parameters. In this regard, the Defense
representative was requested to review pages 4, 5 and 6 of the paper
on training contained in the report with the view toward bringing the
Defense portion up-to-date.
Miscellaneous
The Chairman stated that preparatory actions on the Isthmian
meeting at San Salvador tentatively scheduled for the second half of
November would be held in abeyance pending further developments in
the Honduran situation.

1. Control of Travel to and from Cuba
Central Intelligence Agency
a.
Developed highly useful information on frequency
of Cuban "chartered" flights to Brazil, names and nationali-
ties of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control
followed by Brazilian authorities. Transmitted this informa-
tion to station chiefs in the Latin American countries of the
non-Brazilians travelling on those flights.
b. Maintained close watch over travel to and from
Cuba. See Annex B for table of known travel of Latin
Americans during July and August.
C. As a result of information furnished to him by
the CIA Station in Buenos Aires and with the Station's urging,
the Argentine Minister of Interior indicated that he would
make every effort to prevent Argentine delegates from attend-
ing the International Union of Architects Congress in Havana.
"
d. At the urging of the CIA Station and the Embassy,
the Bolivian Minister of Interior issued in mid-July an
order prohibiting the granting of travel permits to Cuba or
other bloc countries to Bolivian nationals.
e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA
station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the
entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban-sponsored Second
Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to
take place in Santiago in August. This was one of the
factors which led to postponement of the Congress.
E.
After considerable prodding by the CIA Station
and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa
Rica presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican
Assembly which will require all persons intending to travel
to Communist countries to have their travel approved by a
newly created Costa Rican security agency.
8. CIA Station in Mexico City developed information
concerning the clandestine arrival of passengers in Vera Cruz

on Cuban merchant ships. Efforts are being made to obtain
more information and to encourage stricter controls by the
Mexican authorities.
Department of State
a. Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade
Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by
flights on Habana-Moscow route. These efforts achieved a
temporary withholding of permission for future regular flights
at least until such time as the Soviets develop their own
refueling facilities at Conakry.
b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian
authorities to express our deep concern at the growing
frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request
their cooperation in curbing them. Also instructed our
Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with CIA
station chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those
countries travelling on these flights to local authorities
and urging them: (1) to institute tighter controls on their
own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their
concern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil
as a way station for transporting subversives.
c.
As a result of representations made to the
British Government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands
carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed
an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the
use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit
points for passengers. The British intend to require transit
visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to
reject applications for such visas except in certain special
cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from
leaving their aircraft, or would be returned to their point
of origin.
d. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to
inform the Mexican airline CMA that the United States is
opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to

GOTT to control movements of aircraft within their territory,
citing examples of such controls instituted by Mexico, Canada
and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal that
the list of suggestions be made available to the aviation
officials concerned.
j. During a previous reporting period Embassy
Santiago urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to
Cuban delegated to a preparatory meeting for the II Latin
American Youth Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean
capital. Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean
visas for this meeting is one of the contributing factors to
the Cuban sponsors announcing during August that the meeting
had been postponed.
k. Sent general instructions to our missions in
countries which participate in the International Union of
Architects asking them to urge the cooparation of governmental
authorities in preventing or discouraging the attendance of
their nationals to the VII UIA Congress in Habana, September
29 - October 4, 1963. Followed this up with instructions to
individual posts to try where feasible to dissuade
architects from free world countries from serving on the jury
for the selection of a Bay of Pigs monument.
1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to
commence food parcel shipments to Cuba on a commercial basis
that would have required the establishment of scheduled
weekly charter flights by Canadian planes.
Control of Movement of Cuban Propaganda
Central Intelligence Agency
Responding to the urging of the CIA Station, police
of the State of Guanabara seized large quantities of
propaganda brought into Brazil by passengers on the special
Cubana flights. For example, some 50 pounds of printed
propaganda was taken from the various passengers who arrived
on the 16 August Cubana flight.

Instructed our missions in Curacao and the Hague
to investigate a report that KLM was planning to renew
scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US
opposition to resumption of air service to Cuba. KLM assured
Your Embassy that there is no plan to initiate service,
scheduled or non-scheduled, to Habana.
f. Instructed Embassy Ottawa to express our strong
objections to a proposal that a Cubana charter flight pick
up a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly them
to Cuba. The flight was not authorized.
g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigate
Cubana approaches to secure flight facilities. Mission
reported on August 1 that the Governor had no knowledge of
any talks between the B.G. Ministry of Communications and
the Cuban Government regarding landing rights for Cubana
planes. The Governor indicated his intention to inquire
further and to keep us advised. London reported that neither
the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the
issue of landing rights with H.M.G.
h. Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica
and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban Government
in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 58
American students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also
informed Pan American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban
request for a PAA charter flight to fly the students from
Habana to New York.
i. Instructed our missions at Port of Spain and
Barbados on several occasions to approach these governments
to express the concern of the U.S. at indications of Cuban
interest in the use of their aviation facilities.

3. Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arms
Department of Defense
a. Continued surveillance of the area surrounding
Cuba during the months of July and August at the same rate
and with the same emphasis as prior to 1 July 1963.
b. Continued to maintain U.S. Forces, primarily from
within the Atlantic Command, available to assist other
Caribbean governments in the interception of suspicious craft
in territorial waters, as might be requested. No such
requests were received from any other government during the
period covered by this report. However, U.S. Forces did keep
track of the location of the Soviet merchant freighter
MITCHURINSK, which was suspected of carrying subversives and
arms from Cuba to British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINSK
was under U.S. surveillance from its departure from Habana
until United Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this
ship under surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown,
British Guiana. Subsequently, British police search of
MITCHURINSK in British Guiana waters revealed nothing of a
suspicious nature.
Central Intelligence Agency
At the repeated urging of the CIA Station in Lima,
the Peruvian Government late in August published a new anti
terrorists law providing a penalty of no less than five
years imprisonment for persons who participate in guerrilla
activities or in the illegal manufacture of weapons or
explosives.

Department of State
Cooperated with the Foreign Assets Control Office
of the Treasury Department in developing blocking controls
with respect to Cuba which went into effect on July 9, 1963.
5.
Strengthening of Counter-Insurgency Capabilities
Department of Defense
a. Continued the installation of military communica-
tions facilities in Latin America. Operational dates for
the multi-channel radio stations to be installed in Managua,
Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa, Honduras have been delayed to 15.
October 1963 and 15 December 1963, respectively because of
new engineering and contractual requirements. Negotiations
are continuing with Colombia and Ecuador for installation
of U.S. military radio facilities. Completion of a new
commercial trans-isthmian cable in the Panama Canal Zone
within the coming month is expected to improve military
communications within the United States and the Commander
in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command.
b. Continued the surveillance of Cuba by U.S.
Forces, reporting as before to U.S. commanders, organiza-
tions and agencies. Reports of surveillance have been
disseminated to all who have a requirement to know.
C. Established a 24 hour per day, 7 day per week

d. Action previously initiated by the Commander,
U.S. Naval Forces, Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) to establish
a Small Craft Inspection and Training Team (SCIATT) as a
contribution to the Caribbean Surveillance System is progress-
ing satisfactorily. Permanent assignment of U.S. Coast Guard
personnel to SCIATT in the Canal Zone has been approved and
the U.S. Coast Guard has taken appropriate implementing
actions
;
e. During the period of this report, the SCIATT con-
ducted an on-the-job training course at Puntarenas, Costa
Rica. Training was given to 13 members of the Guardia Civil
of Costa Rica who were either newly assigned to the 40 foot
Coast Guard utility boats (CGUBs) or were to be assigned as

Exchange of Intelligence on Cuban Subversion
Central Intelligence Agency
CIA Stations throughout Latin America continued in
a great majority of countries to furnish to the local internal
security organizations with whom they are in liaison informa-
tion concerning travelers to and from Cuba, as well as such
information as came to CIA's attention concerning the movement
of funds, arms and propaganda material. In many instances,
the furnishing of information to the internal security
service by the CIA Station was paralleled by the furnishing of
similar information to the Foreign Office by the Ambassador
for his representative. The response to this information has
varied greatly. The Central American countries, in general,
began to pay greater attention to the information and act on
it. At the other extreme, the Brazilian Government during
the reporting period showed little inclination to follow up
on the information.
Department of State
a. Reiterated to the Foreign Minister of Peru our
interest in having the facts of the Puerto Maldonado incident
brought to the attention of the OAS, and urged that this
action be taken as soon as possible.
b. Urged the Government of Guatemala to submit
evidence of communist activity to the OAS.
Surveillance of Cuban Diplomatic, Commercial and Cultural
Missions
Department of State
Instructed Embassy La Paz to follow up closely on
charges of involvement by the Cuban mission in internal
policies of Bolivia, and, at the Embassy's discretion, to
point out to Bolivian officials the opportunity for a possible
break in relations with Cuba. Embassy La Paz was not able to

the Latin American press, all of which was used in the
Agency's radio and press output.
The main developments treated in the Agency's radio
and press coverage included Castro's July 26 speech urging
revolutions in Latin America, the discovery of terrorist
weapons factories in Guayaquil, the Ecuadorean Vice
President's accusation of Cuban responsibility for terrorism,
the Cuban use of Grand Cayman as a way station for subversive
elements from Cuba, the expulsion from the University of a
Bolivian youth leader for receiving funds from Cuba,
Castro-trained guerrillas in Honduras, and Bolivian protests
against meddling by the Cuban Embassy in the miner's strike.
A Voice of American roving reporter in Latin America
provided several reports on the subversion picture in coun-
tries he visited.
c. In support of the Agency's effort on Cuban-based
subversion, the publications center in Mexico began work on
three pamphlets during the period based on Castro's report
of his visit to the Soviet Union (showing that he contradicted
himself in some of his extravagant claims of Soviet progress),
the losses suffered by Cuban labor under Castro, and the
fate of political prisoners in Cuba. When completed, these
pamphlets will be reproduced and distributed in quantity
throughout the area.

2.
Ecuador
The CIA Station in Quito reports that the military
junta, which assumed power in Ecuador on 11 July, can
be expected to follow the guidance of the Embassy and
the Station in controlling travel to and from Cuba and
the Soviet bloc. The activities of Cuban subversives
in Ecuador, at least for the present, have been greatly
inhibited by the mass arrests of Communists and pro-
Cubans and by the outlawing of the Communist Party by
the junta.
Honduras
"
It is reported that the Honduran Communist Party
has issued.orders to its members not to attempt to
travel to Cuba at the present time. This action is
apparently the result of the increasing vigilance of
the Honduran government and the greater implementation
of stricter travel controls.
2. Movement of Cuban Propaganda
Guatemala
According to an unconfirmed report received in July,
a Bureau of Information of the Communist Party of
Guatemala is being formed in collaboration with Prensa
Latina and is to be managed clandestinely. It expects
to receive news by shortwave radio from Cuba and print
bulletins for distribution by radio stations. This may
indicate a pattern by which Prensa Latina will attempt
to distribute on a more clandestine basis in other areas
in Latin America.
Honduras
It was reliably reported that in mid-July 1963, a
small coastal freighter landed 14 large boxes of Communist
propaganda on the northern coast of Honduras, the boxes
having been transferred at sea from a larger vessel. The
report has not been confirmed.

3. Movement of Guerrillas and Arms
Argentina
Extremist members of the Peronist Party, apparently
'under the leadership of such figures as Hector Villalon
and John William Cooke, were reported to be receiving
encouragement and promises of large sums of money from
Cuba in support of their efforts to train and organize
subversive groups in Argentina. Villalon has stated.
that his plan calls for expanding and accellerating
subversive activities in Argentina culminating in a
complete take over within two years. There is no indica-
tion that Peron himself has agreed to this plan. It has
been reported that leaders of the Communist Party of
Argentina have been greatly annoyed by the tendency of
(the Castro regime to support the revolutionary Peronists
without having consulted the Communist Party of Argentina
.
It is reported that the so-called Army of National
Liberation (ANL) of Argentina, which is a relatively
small Castroist organization directed from Cuba by
John William Cooke, has in recent weeks been negotiating
for the purchase of arms and has been offered submachine
guns, bazookas and other weapons by two or three private
suppliers. It was reported, however, that the ANL was
having difficulty getting enough dollars from Cuba to
make significant purchases possible.
Bolivia
The Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Relations on 23
August protested formally to the Cuban Chargé d'Affaires
in La Paz against the Cuban Embassy support to the miners
during the recent crisis. Subsequently, however, Foreign
Minister Fellman informed the Cuban Chargé that he need
not fear that the Government of Bolivia would break
diplomatic relations with Cuba. There has, in fact, been
no hard information linking the Cuban Embassy with the
present mining crisis in spite of some unconfirmed.

Travel to and from Cuba
Brazil
ANNEX A
Chartered Cubana airlines flights between Cuba and
Brazil have become a major means of transporting non-Cuban
Latin Americans to and from Cuba. The five such flights
since late July have carried nearly 400 non-Cubans.
The first of the recent series on 25 July
brought 71 Latin American passengers to Havana for the
26 July celebrations. The other four flights on 15,
22, 28 and 29 August transported over 200 Latin
Americans to Brazil from Havana. Some of the aircraft
involved returned to Cuba with smaller numbers of passen
gers. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers had
been delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had
apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and some had
probably received training there. Of the passengers on
these four flights to Brazil, 75 were natives of
Caribbean area countries. Their circuitous travel through
Brazil was evidently designed to help conceal the fact
that they had been in Cuba
Costa Rica
Two Costa Ricans were among the passengers on a
chartered Cubana plane which was

One was Luz Marina
Hernandez Salazar, the only Costa Rican woman known to
have been sent to Cuba for training as a guerrilla
warfare instructor. She had been in Cuba since September
1962. The other Costa Rican passenger was Carlos Guillen,
former head of the Costa Rican Society of Friends of
the Cuban Revolution, who had been in Cuba since November
1962.

elements under the general direction of Juliao. Other
reports indicate that, although the Cuban Embassy is
providing guidance and possibly financial support to the
movement, it had not yet resolved the internal dissension
in the leagues.
Colombia
From Colombia reports have been received of incre-
asing Cuban assistance, primarily in the form of training
courses by instructors who have been trained in Cuba,
to the Worker-Student-Feasant Movement (MOEC). A small
guerrilla band encountered by the Colombian army in
July 1963 was broken up when five members of the band
were killed and two others captured. A small quantity
of arms and a considerable amount of books and pamphlets
on revolutionary warfare, photographs of Fidel Castro,
Camilo Cienfuegos and Mao Tse-tung, and bulletins of
the MOEC were found at the camp site. Recent reports
have indicated an increase in the terrorist efforts of
the MOEC and increased promises of assistance from Che
Guevara with regard to the training of additional MOEC
members.
Costa Rica
There have been a number of unconfirmed reports
alleging small-scale training of revolutionaries on
Costa Rican territory for guerrilla activity in
Nicaragua. For example, in mid-July an increased number
of guerrillas were reportedly being trained in Costa Rica
by Adolfo Garcia Barberena, well-known Nicaraguan
revolutionary leader and member of the FLN (National
Liberation Front -- a Communist-dominated, Cuban-supported,

anti-Nicaragua revolutionary group). In early August
Alberto Serrato, leader of the FLN in Costa Rica,
(reportedly left with a group of Nicaraguans for the
Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border. Another report indicated
that Hector Bogantes Zamora, Costa Rican agitator was
supposed to have left San Jose in mid-August for the
Nicaraguan border to supervise the passage of Nicaraguan
guerrillas from Costa Rica into Nicaragua. Bogantes,
(who recently returned from attending the May Day celebra
tions in Cuba, is said to have been assigned this
responsibility by the Costa Rican Communist Party..
1
So far as we know, the GON, which is normally well-
informed and highly sensitive to such activities on its
borders, has not made any complaints or otherwise signified
concern or awareness of these reported activities.
Honduras
The Honduran armed forces began to move against a
group of pro-Castro guerrillas operating against the
Nicaraguan Government and active in the vicinity of the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border. The Nicaraguan National Guard
has been conducting operations on its side of the border
against the insurgents since July. The dense jungle and
difficult terrain, however, will impede the efforts of
both forces to eliminate the guerrillas.
Information on the guerrilla force is scanty and
conflicting. It is apparently composed of members of the
National Liberation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated
and Cuban-supported revolutionary organization active
primarily in Honduras and Nicaragua since the fall of
1962. The strength of the force is not known.
Nicaragua
A captured guerrilla of the FLN (National Liberation
Front - a Communist-dominated, Cuban-supported, anti-
Nicaraguan group) confessed that he was a member of a
group of 46 who entered Nicaragua from Honduras on 22 July.

He said that their mission was to establish a base camp
in the Isabella mountains, Department of Jinotega, in
order to indoctrinate the peasants and to train them in
guerrilla tactics. He admitted that he had received six
months' guerrilla warfare training in Cuba and that other
FLN leaders had received similar training. He also said
that the FLN training camp in Honduras was near El Lagarto,
on the Patuca River.
4. Transfer of Funds
British Guiana
In British Guiana, Guiana Import-Export Corporation
(Gimpex) received a one million dollar advance payment
deposited by the Cuban Alimpex Corporation for goods to
be delivered to Cuba in the future. Gimpex has, in turn
loaned this money to the Government of British Guiana.
Cheddi Jagan's People's Progressive Party is the major
stockholder in Gimpex. Mohammed Kassim, Manager of Gimpex,
has indicated that Gimpex will be able to secure additional
loans from Cuba in amounts sufficient to tide the Jagan
government over any foreseeable crisis. It was also
reported that Gimpex plans to buy aircraft, spare parts
and other machinery in the United States for reshipment
to Cuba.
General
Reports continue to be received from many places
indicating that the suitcase full of currency is still one
of the most common methods used by the Cubans for trans-
mitting funds for use in supporting subversive activities
throughout the hemisphere. Instances where such funds
have been confiscated by the police have occurred recently
in El Salvador, Panama and Ecuador.

December 18, 1963
Office of the Secretary of Defense
Anti-Sabotage Operations in Latin America
OSA 353 CUBA
12-18-63
FW 1-30-63
The Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affairs (ICCOCA) has recently considered a CIA proposal to provide
guidance to US firms in Latin America confronted with Castro-
communist inspired sabotage of their facilities and assets. CIA has
contracted for the preparation of a report which will consolidate the
experiences of several US firms in Latin America in combatting
sabotage. After consideration by the ICCOCA this report will be
furnished through our country teams in Latin America to local US
firms to assist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage programs.
I would be most grateful if you would prepare a brief report
designed to supplement the CIA project which would include enumera-
tion of general guidelines which might be adopted by US firms in the
Latin American area in combatting sabotage. In particular, an
enumeration of known appropriate anti-sabotage devices available on
the commercial market together with the manufacturer's names would
be most helpful.
A member of my staff has discussed this project with Mr.
Phelps of your staff, who has indicated that DDR&E might be of assist-
ance in this matter based on a recent field trip to Venezuela where
problems peculiar to that area were studied at the request of the US
Ambassador. It is also possible that commercial devices developed
for South Vietnam would have applicability in Latin America. Because
this project is designed for distribution to several Latin American
countries, it is requested that where possible guidelines be developed
which might have general application throughout Latin America, but
with emphasis on key subversive target areas. Present plans antici-
pate finalization of this project by December 23, 1963.

MEMORANDUM FOR COLONEL WADE ROBERT
Office of the Secretary of Defense
(International Security Affairs)
SUBJECT: State Paper Entitled "Terrorism in the Latin
American Countries on the Critical Insurgency List"
Enclosed herewith is a paper prepared by a member of the
Cuban Coordinating Committee at the Department of State (Mr.
William Bowdler, 182-3736) for use by the Department of State
representative at the Special Group (Counterinsurgency) meeting on
December 19, 1963. The paper was provided to this office by State
on December 18 with the request that Department of Defense
comments, particularly on the basic memorandum, be obtained.
Although this office is very much concerned with the aspects of the
