10/8/63, Mrs. Anita Potocki, a CIA analyst who has been working
on intercepted Cuban communications intelligence traffic]
✓ advised
the Liaison Agent that her Agency has come to the tentative conclu-
sion that Pineiro as identical with : Petronio, ②who has been men-
is
tioned in messages made available to the Bureau and CIA. We have
noted that messages sent to the unidentified Cuban Agent in Panama
referred to as " Roberto"] have been signed by Petronio 7"(

Mrs. Potocki gave the following explanation which led to
CIA's deduction.
()(u)
Messages emanating from Havana indicated that one of the
recipients was probably located in a small town in Colombia near the
Venezuelan Border. CIA developed a suspect and instituted coverage.
Recently, this individual transmitted a letter to Havana which
communication was intercepted by CIA.. The person had apparently
violated instructions by including some sensitive data in the
communication. Havana then transmitted a radio message eastigating
the Cuban Agent in Colombia. An examination of the radio message
and the intercepted communication sent by the Agent has led CIA
to believe that Petronio") is identical with [Pineiro
