during the period from December 1961 to April 1962. The former had
been a contact of AMRUNG-1)81 and seems to have gone into hiding; in any
case, nothing more has been reported on him. The latter was an agent
of AMFAUNA-1 in Santiago de Cuba in January 1962 he was in hiding and
awaiting a chance to go into asylum.
46. AMFAUNA-11 remained active during this period, and AMFAUNA-9,
10, and 12 were added to the operation. For descriptions of these
agents, see paragraph 15 above.

48. JMWAVE records do not show the total number of AMFAUNA
reports disseminated since January 1961. The figure is at least fifty,
and is believed to be nearer one hundred, if the present frequency of
dissemination can be a criterion. In content they have leaned
heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movemants,
location of artillery, and aviation matters. There has been a more
recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is
being encouraged by JMWAVE. Evaluations of his production are lacking.
Security Analysis:
49. The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is consider-
ed remote. His successful LCFLUTTER, the fact (or what is believed to
be the fact that his close friend and fellow agent AMCUSP-1) was
executed, and AMFAUNA-1's own character and background, al10/argue
against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G-2.
However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER can be beaten. Also
that there is no proof, other than the fact that AMCUSP-1's wife is
in the JMWAVE area and behaving like a widow, that AMCUSP-1 was really
executed. There is documentary evidence plin the form of a letter
written by a fellow prisoner to AMCUSP-1's) widow, that he was held
in prison in March and April 1961. However, the person who identified
and buried the body was AMFAUNA-1's father, who was subsequently 06

Summary
4.. AMFAUNA-1 is à Cuban national who was recruited and trained in
the United States and returned legally to Cuba (in March 1961 to serve as 24
resident agent in Havana.) Since then he has built a net of over twenty 24
sub-agents and has sent back 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of
fifty intelligence disseminations have been made. He is highly
motivated for his work and under effective control by JMWAVE. The
quality of his production is, for the most part, very good and improving
although he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in
para-military operations. Operationally he is very skillful; however,
he has been known to take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to
think that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is likely'
in the future to be turned against us. There is, however, the real
risk that he may one day fall into a G-2 trap baited with the Escambray
guerrillas. If so, this will be due to the fact that contact with the
guerrilla was his first assignment and, although he has been re-
directed to intelligence collection, he sometimes seems to feel that
he has failed in his primary mission. This, plus the fact that he
evident believes that the end is now very close, is apt to make him.

50. Similarly, all that is known about AMFAUNA-l's background
comes from AMFAUNA-1's own statements embodied in his PRQ Part I. No.
confirmation of this information has ever been obtained. From this
point of view there is no guarantee that AMFAUNA-1 is what he claims
to be. For all the proof to the contrary available to JMWAVE, he
could as easily have been a Spanish) Communist as a member of the
Spanish Falange: >9
"
51. These points are listed for the sake of completeness, but
little pimportance is attached to them. The known fact that (QUANTUM-51
and (QUANTUM-52 consider AMFAUNA-1 reliable suggests that he at least
was not a (Spanish) Communist. And an unusually extensive independent
view has been obtained of AMFAUNA-1's operations through the reports
and debriefings of eight of his agents who have either escaped to or
are in communication with the United States. The defection of
☐ Identity-14, and the escape and debriefings of Identity-19, Identity-23,
Identity-26, and Identity-29, have all confirmed parts of AMFAUNA-1's
1) story. Finally, AMCOG-3 has reported by S/W that AMCOG-2 is in contact
with AMFAUNA-1, and AMFAUNA-2's telephone conversations with AMCUTLER-1
provide a continuing check on the safety and whereabouts of AMFAUNA-1.01
52.
For the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discounted
that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught and doubled by the G-2 since his arrival
in Cuba. Additional indications that all is still well are the fact
that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his
S/W, that his operational activities are consistent with his character
and background, and that the reporting of his agents is consistent with
their access to information.
53. Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and
whether the G-2 could double him if they do catch him, are two
questions remaining to be considered. Taking the second question first,
it is believed that the chances of the G-2 running a successful CI

sure, the G-2 has certain weapons that they could use against AMFAUNA-1.
His father is already (in prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence,) and
his mother and two children (are still in Cuba ac potential hostages.)or
It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-1's own interest
in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK,
by neglecting to support the insurgent leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was
responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference
to the fate of the Cuban people. This would all take time, however,
because AMFAUNA-1's reaction to arrest, at least initially, would
probably be an attempt to emulate his two heroes AMCUSP-1) and AMRUNG.
In the time that it would take the G-2 to break down(this resistance,
-
AMCUTLER-1) would almost certainly have learned, either through his
phone conversations with AMFAUNA-2 o by the interruption of the same,
that something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1.
().
54. The risks that AMFAUNA-1 is now running are believed to be
considerable. For one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees
of knowledge of his clandestine operations, have been held temporarily
or permanently by the G-2, which is believed to be increasing in
competence as a security force. For another, AMFAUNA-1 takes unnecessary
chances, as by interrogating a new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in
the personal automobile of his sister-in-law, or by personally trying
to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts
which can be dangerous to him.
55. AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good.
It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is aware that this is a potential-
ly serious security weakness, because he took the trouble to report it
(see paragraph 15a1 above). The AMCOG operation is itself a fairly
complex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch. The aspects
of it which bear on the AMFAUNA operation are that AMCOG-2 and (her 08
brother) AMCOG-3) are (close relatives of a very prominent anti-Communistoo
lon
Cuban politician) and that they are widely known, both in Cuba and in

56. It would seem, though, that an alert and competent security

fore a cause for speculation that, in February 1962, an important

AMFAUNA-1 was in touch with Identity-52, a (nephew of Oswaldo RAMIREZ,
through Identity-51, a resident of Cienfuegos) 10 Identity-52 was
arrested late in the year .24 AMFAUNA-1 then developed another contact
to the (Oswaldo RAMIREZ group through Identity-12, (RAMIREZ's Havana) 08
representative, whose cutout to AMFAUNA-1 was AMFAUNA-3, a woman from
(Sancti Spiritus) now resident in Havana. Identity-12 was arrested in
09 April, presumably as an aftermath of the 16 April battle in which
RAMIREZ was reportedly killed.

58. In late May or early June 1967, Identity-8, a person from
Sancti Spiritus known to AMFAUNA-3, called on her in the company of
a certain Ricardo *IZQUIERDO who claimed to have had a meeting on 28
May near Trinidad with one Comandante Fide *HERNANDEZ Perez) who gave
ob (IZQUIERDO) a letter for delivery to Identity 12. Unable to find
Identity-12 because of the laiter's arrest ZQUIERDO) approached
Identity-8 who introduced him to AMPAUNA-3 t whom he handed over
letter. The letter reads as follows;

"Dear Brother-in-Arms:
"I greet you and officially report to you, as our
representative to the Military Junta of the FND, the sad
news of the death of our commander-in-chief, Oswaldo
RAMIREZ, on 16 April last at 9 a.m. He fell in battle
together with other brothers. The certificate to this
effect, containing the testimony of Captain BORGE, chief
of the personal guard, and of other members of his escort,
is in my possession, and I will hand it over to you or to
anyone designated by the Military Junta of the FND.
"The disorganization caused by the above-mentioned
events prevented our reporting this news to you right away,
and only now have we been able to make contact with the
bearer, a man who has been working for some time as messenger
and enjoying the complete confidence of Oswaldo RAMIREZ and

61. As a first step toward speeding up communications, it is
planned to find another accommodation address in the JMWAVE area for
AMFAUNA-1's use which can be expected to function without the delays
that have been experienced recently. Because of the importance and
urgency of some of AMFAUNA-1's intelligence reports, consideration
is also being given to assigning a radio operator to him, probably
AMGLEN-9 who is awaiting only his signal plan to become active and
who will probably not be needed in the AMWPEN net as originally
planned.
62.
AMFAUNA-1 will be instructed to break off contact with
AMCOG-2, and to cease interesting himself in the affairs of the
Escambray. As for AMFAUNA-4, it is feared that AMFAUNA-1 is already
so deeply involved with him that, if he was not a bona fide defector,
the damage has already been done. Neverthless, AMFAUNA-1 will be
warned of the potentialities of this situation so that he can, be
prepared to go into hiding if it should develop badly. Specific
military requirements will be sent to AMFARNA-1 for AMFAUNA-4 to
help in establishing his value as a source. Also for the improvement
of the security of the operation, AMFAUNA-1 will be told to stop taking
personal and unnecessary risks such as his penetration of a restricted
beach.
63. For the continued improvement of production, political and
economic requirements will be sent to him. AMFAUNA-1 is very
responsive to requirements, and has already developed sources and
informants in the political and economic areas in response to
instructions from JMWAVE, It is believed that an increased output
of higher-priority intelligence can be expected from this operation.

security precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity

compartmented from her. This compartmentation is achieved by the use
cutouts: AMFAUNA-2, AMFAUNA-3, AMFAUNA-4, AMBOA-1, and
AMFAUNA-5, who maintain contact for AMFAUNA-1 with most if not all of
his sub-agents. Chart A, which shows AMFAUNA-1 in direct contact with

more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1's known modus operandi for him to have
cutouts between himself and these sub-agents, If there is a cutout or

unreported cutout between AMFAUNA-1 and AMFAUNA-4.
10. Except for AMFAUNA 4, all the above-mentioned cutouts are
women. Two of his support agents, including his mail drop, are also
women. AMFAUNA-1 has not been explicit on this point, but it is
believed that he shares his favors between them. If so, he has the
best of cover for his relations with them. It also clarifies the
otherwise puzzling picture of a legal resident of Cuba sleeping in a
different bed each night. This practice must certainly reduce the
possibility that the C-2 will pick him up for routine questioning.
Communications:
11. The bulk of AMFAUNA-1's communications come via S/W. His
méssages to JMWAVE are sent to accommodation addresses serviced by
AMPAN-2 and AMCUTLER-1. JMWAVE's messages to him are addressed to
AMFAUNA-14. AMFAUNA-1 can also use (diplomatic couriers) for sending
documents and other material unsuitable for S/W. He has a personal

AMFAUNA-3; AMFAUNA-1's first mention of her
is in his 5/W message No. 127 dated 4 May 1962. She has
provided information on (military hospital and has a
trusted contact (Identity 7) in the G-2)2, 4She also was
AMFAUNA-1's cutout to Identity-12, who was a(Havana 08
contact) of the (guerrilla leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ) 24 In
early June 1962 she was approached by Identity-8 who
claimed to be the new contact to the (RAMIREZ) organization.
(See also paragraph 58 below.) On 15 March 1962 AMFAUNA-3
was traced by ODIBEX who proposed to use her in their
Operation CASINO. A negative trace reply was given at that
time. Headquarters is requested to ascertain whether ODIBEX
has a valid prior claim on this agent.

AMFAUNA-4) He is a high-ranking Cuban Army officer
who has provided AMFAUNA-1 with documentary information which
ought to be of some value, although JMWAVE has not yet seen
it, it having gone to Headquarters via Madrid through the
channel described in paragraph 11 above 152 He also claims to
be receiving information from Identity-9 and Identity-10.
AMFAUNA-1 was introduced to AMFAUNA-4) by AMCOG-2 who in turn
was introduced to him by Identity-13.01 For a further
discussion of this matter, see paragraph 56 below.
d. AMBOA-1: The origin of AMFAUNA-l's contact with
this agent, who has also been recruited independently by
JMWAVE, is uncertain. He first mentioned her in October
c) 08
1961 as his cutout to Identity-14, (a Cubana Airlines pilot)
who had formerly been a contact of AMCUSP-1 and who subsequent-
ly defected. AMFAUNA-1's last mention of her was on 15
November when he reported that she had given him a map show-
ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villas,
It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her,
but since he has not reported having done so it is considered
more likely that she remains his cutout to (two Cubana Airlines
pilots who are known to be still reporting:
(1) AMFAUNA-18: He was recruited in March 1962
and has provided AMFAUNA-1 with passenger lists) 24
and the location of artillery emplacements) which
he has (spotted from his aircraft). 24t is not known
how AMFAUNA-1 first met AMFAUNA-18, and it is
possible that AMFAUNA-1 meets directly with him.
It is only surmised that AMBOA-1. is his cutout to
him.
(2) AMFAUNA-19: He was recruited at the same
time as AMFAUNA-18. Although AMFAUNA-1 did not
explicitly say so, it can be inferred that he and
AMFAUNA-18 are witting of each other's recruitment.

AMFAUNA-5: AMFAUNA-1 first reported her as an agent
in September 1961.66 She is the sister-in-law of AMEAUNA-23),
former (naval officer) who had been an agent of AMFAUNA-1 as
early as July 1961 but had been caught and imprisoned for try-
ing to leave Cuba illegally.24 She has been the source of
information on Cuban (airfields) and is the cutout to a group
of people employed at Rancho Boyeros Airport) 24It is believed
that the identities of all these people have not yet been
reported, but they seem to be effective. On 29 May 1962
AMFAUNA-1 reported the arrival of an undocumented Soviet plane
14 at Rancho Boyeros, and forwarded the passenger list which he
said one of his agents had obtained clandestinely. Following

children, all still in Cuba(as of March 1961. However, it is noted
that the two children have different matronymics, that neither of them
is his wife's last name, and that all three dependents have different
addresses. It is assumed that this is his third wife. Since AMFAUNA-1
has never mentioned her in any of his S/W correspondence, it is also
assumed that she has gone the way of her two predecessors.

This information is not considered definitive, because the last point
26 directly contradicted by AMFAUNA-1's PRQ Part I which he wrote him-
self, but it is included here for what it may be worth. AMCUTLER-1) 0/
added that his brother has no sexual relations with his sub-agents
except what is considered normal and acceptable by Cuban standards.
19.
The elements of AMFAUNA-1's motivation, then, include an
adventurous spirit and a taste for clandestine work. Although "anti-
Communism" may be an overworked expression, it would seem to apply in
the case of AMFAUNA-1,if his former membership in the Falange and the
(German Intelligence Service can be taken as indicators. Also included
should be the loss of a (freight forwarding business) which started out
promisingly in 1959 but folded up after a year of CASTRO's revolution-
ary government. Finally, although these factors did not yet exist
in January 1961 when he was recruited, AMFAUNA-1 is certainly affected
now by the death of AMC CUSP-1) and the imprisonment of his father)
Control
ol
08
20°
It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives
great personal satisfaction from his work against the CASTRO regime.
His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.
This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have been
many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 to do
something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is
believed to be effective.
Previous History of the Operation

not known, but it appears that the initiative was taken by AMBOA-1.
