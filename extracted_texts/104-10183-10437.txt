1. I had introduced AMBUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little
opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
on the above date, after business hours, and we were able
to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the "Cubans
like that kind of girl not too fancy", he thought that
her background particularly her previously working for the
(U.S. Ambassador in Bolivia) would make the operation very
risky. He said that if it were discovered that AMPUNNY-1 was
a penetration of the CCND SNAFU-19 office (by the Cubars), his
connection with ODYOKE would then be revealed, with the result
that all his "connections" with (UNSNAFU-19, and "Habana" would
be lost. AMWHIP-1 opined that he thought it likely that the
Cubans would check her out in ⒷColivia)

AMWHIP suggested the possibility of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (UNSNAFU-19 installation. lle
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary
to AMBUNNY-1.
3. Also, AMWHIP-1 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before mid-June, as he had some relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,
I subsequently informed AMWHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the
Both expressed relief. I told
15-4 (Paris) operation was off.
AMEUNNY-1 that she could most likely still be utilized in
12-2 (Rabat, and that we would discuss the possibilities at a
later date.
