During the reporting period, Mr. Broe has continued to
serve as Chief of the WH Division. In this period, he has had to cope
with the many crises and confrontations that typify his area, the Allende
victory in Chile to successive coups in Bolivia, and growing urban
terrorism in many countries. It is difficult to fault his performance
in the handling of these complex challer ges. He has earned the complete
respect of his subordinates and, as an acute and humane judge of
character, he knows the strengths and weaknesses of his station chiefs
and how to extract the best from them.
Under his leadership, high-level penetrations of Communist
parties throughout the hemisphere have been maintained and increased,
and he has planned ahead effectively to cope with the increasing Soviet
diplomatic presence,

Under his supervision, the budget, program and project
submissions of his Division have been effectively presented and
defended before reviewing authorities.
Innumerable crash requests for memoranda on a wide
range of topics from the White House have been met promptly and
satisfactorily.
On the substantive side, he has kept himself abreast of
the rapidly changing Latin American scene and on policy matters,
his judgment and advice are relied upon at the Assistant Secretary
level in the Department of State and the White House.
The high morale of his Division is a tribute to his ability
and, on the whole, his performance remains "Outstanding. "

new and well placed agent assets. He has supervised effectively Divisional
planning designed to exploit to the maximum the opportunities presented
by the increasing Soviet diplomatic presence in the area.
During the year, political shifts in Peru and Bolivia have served
to dramatize the danger of too extensive a reliance on liaison and Mr. Broe
has moved to reduce the profile of our declared presence.
The high morale in his Division comes from the widespread
knowledge that good performance is recognized and that career advance-
;
ment is based on ability rather than any form of favoritism.
On policy matters, his judgment and advice is sought, and relied
upon at the Assistant Secretary level in the Department of State and the
White House. He is a careful and frugal manager in the allocation of
increasingly scarce resources and on the whole his performance has been
"Outstanding. "

During the reporting period, Mr. Broe has continued to serve as
Chief of the WH Division. Under his leadership and due to his excellent
judgment in the selection of key personnel, the Division has improved its
pèrformance both in the collection of significant intelligence and in its
conduct of complex covert action operations. Due to high level penetration
of the Communist parties throughout the hemisphere, he has kept the Division
well ahead of the game in dealing with the diverse subversive movements
in the area,
This result is due in considerable measure to Mr. Broe's
managerial skills. Mr. Broe's judgment has been relied upon by both the
White House and the Assistant Secretary level in the State Department in
dealing with the policy aspects of successive crises. He has been consistently
cost conscious, and his performance on the whole has been outstanding.

2. In the last fitness report on Mr. Broe I commented that
"he is easy to work with, exercises the soundeat of judgements,
maintains excellent relations in the community and will without
question turn in a really fine performance as Chief, WH Division."
Nothing has happened in the course of the past year to require any
change in that comment and prediction. Although the Dominican
crisis has subsided since the last report, we are not entirely out of
the woods there, and there are several other situations in the Western
Hemisphere which have been simmering smartly and which have

while at the same time he has looked after the normal command and
administrative requirements of the Division effectively. He stays in
close touch with his key personnel, and keeps himself fully informed
of their operations. His community relationships are good and he is
held in high esteem by his collaborators in the Clandestine Services.
All in all, one must rate Mr. Broe's performance during the last

1. This is a letter fitness report on Mr. Broe as Chief of
the WH Division from July 1965 to date.
2. Mr. Broe's file is replete with the highest estimatɩa of
his capabilities and performance in the several positions of respon-
sibility he has held in the Clandestine Services. Until coming to the
WH Division, his entire career with the Clandestine Services, dating
back to 1948, had been in the Far East area. He served as Chief of
our Manila Station and later of our Tokyo Station in which latter
position he distinguished himself. He was brought in to take over
the WH Division when the Chief of that Division became the DD/P.
That in itself was an eloquent admission of the esteem in which his
capabilities are held. His performance in the WH Division has fully
lived up to this evaluation. He took over the Division just after the
Agency had become immersed in the Dominican Republic crisis. At
the same time, a dozen other problems of one kind or another required
the most serious attention. He has made several field trips to his
area of responsibility and has shown his usual skill in getting the most

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: BROE, William V. (1 April 1964 31 March 1965)
1. Mr. Broe's performance as Chief of Station, Tokyo during the
reporting period is best described as outstanding.
2. For over two years, Mr. Broe has struggled with the problems
in Japan of reducing the size of the Agency's mission and of developing
appropriate areas of clandestine concentration. During the past year, he
has effectively gotten the whole mechanism to work, with a marked increase
in foreign intelligence and an unprecedented emergence of the Station,
through contacts he and his associates have developed, as a channel for
political action. Through his skillful assistance to and cultivation of the
Ambassador, Mr. Broe has placed CIA in a position.in Japan where the Station
Chief and the Agency are accepted by the top levels of the Japanese Government
as a useful channel and as a dependable organization for collaboration. This
high level connection is of tremendous value in advancing political intelligence
objectives as well as an essential tool for indirect and unofficial manipulation
of situations of key interest to both the Japanese and the U.S. governments.
3. In the management of the Station, Mr. Broc continues to be his old
effective self. He is able to get a good deal of mileage out of the personnel
assigned to him and to increase their effectiveness through his own personal
leadership. In all this, he has displayed an excellent sense of cost consciousness
in the management of the Station.
4. In sum, Mr. Broe has brough Tokyo Station under his tenure to a
new role appropriate to the changing times. CIA along with the U.S. Government
is now in a better position to deal with an independent Japan which is now looking
at Asia through its own eyes.
This fitness report will be shown
to Mr. Broe when he returns to
Headquarters.

1. This memorandum in lieu of Fitness Report.
is submitted on Mr. William V. Broe, Chief of Station,-
Tokyo to cover the period 1 June 1961 to 11 February
1963.
2. Mr. Broe has directed one of the most compli-
cated and important stations in the Far East area with
his accustomed skill, intelligence and delicacy. He
has conducted a major reorganization of the Agency's .
activities in Japan and substantially reduced its total
commitment there. At the same time he has kept a firm
eye on the need for coverage of important targets and
has been particularly severe with non-essential or
marginal activities. In the Station itself he has
directed a complicated structure, with perhaps the
largest number of outside cover cases (with all the
difficulties they bring) in the area. He has maintained
the Station's relationship and contacts with tho
Ambassador and the ambassy in an excellent manner, and
it is now considered a full partner in Japanese affairs
by the Ambassador. He has maintained extensive and
important liaison contacts with Japanese agencies and
at the samo time kept a high degree of effort on the
unilateral targets in the area. He has been particularly
effective in managing our relationships with the U.S.
military intelligence Headquarters covering the Far East
which are concentrated in Japan. In all of these he has
been firm and intelligent in his approach.

1. Mr. Broe's performance as Chief of Station, Tokyo for the
period 12 February 1963 to 31 March 1964 can be characterized as
strong.
-
2. Mr. Broe has effectively directed the operations of a
station with many targets. He has concentrated the potential
represented by the personnel under his authority on the most important
targets and firmly discarded marginal activities. In his supervision
of the work of the sub-units of his station, such as the China section,
Soviet section and Korean section, he has been effective in encouraging
them to vigorous activity but has also asserted the necessary control
and guidance from his level. Mr. Broe has maintained excellent
relationships with other American services and his coordination
process is a model. He has at the same time maintained personal
contacts with leading Japanese, both official and unofficial, and
has used these both for intelligence and for action purposes. He
has wisely targetted the covert action potential of the station toward
critical targets and deliberately eliminated marginal efforts.
Mr. Broe has on his own initiative made certain recommendations
for the reduction of the personal and expenditures of his station
to help meet crises in other areas. In di of this activity.
has reaffirmed as qualites of kadership and supervisory capacity
and has demonstrated a full consciousness of the importance of cost.

Memorandum in lieu of Fitness Report
of Mr. William V. Broe, GS-16,
covering period from March 1959
through 25 July 1960.
Subject is Deputy Chief of the Far East Division and
has served in that capacity during the entire 23 months of my
tenure as Chief of the Division as well as for some months
under my predecessor. He also served as my deputy in 1054-
1955 at the China Base at Yokosuka, Japan. I have, therefore,
had ample opportunity to appraise subject's performance under
a great variety of circumstances, both in the field and at Head-
quarters.
Subject is an outstanding manager in the Clandestine
Services field. His operational judgment is wholly reliable, he
grasps and retains complex details and produces sound and
intelligent solutions to operational problems. He is very strong
in administration and is particularly adept at personnel manage-
ment. He has a deep and encyclopedic knowledge of the people
in the Par East Division; his approach is personal and sympa-
thetic but his hand in firm when firmnena is required. He has
been particularly successful in solving personnel assignment
problems by matching capabilities to requirements.
In his present job as Deputy Chief of an area division,
I do not believe that subject has an equal. This would entitle
him, in my opinion, to a rating of "7" in Section B of the Fitness

for determining
is
Subject is so well qualified to meet the requirements of deputy chief of a large
area division that there may well be a tendency to lose sight of his ability to run an
organization of his own. This capability was amply demonstrated when he was chief
of the China Branch of FE Division.
Subject is unusually strong as a supervisor. His flair for warm but impartial
relationships with subordinates hus enabled him to develop a first-hand understanding
of the capabilities, shortcomings and problems of a very large proportion of all FE
personnel. His direction of personnel does not lack firmness but is expressed in such
a way that feelings are considered and best results are achieved.
Subject's operational judgment is entirely reliable. He has an encyclopedic know-
ledge and understanding of the Division's operations and a full grasp of political
implications throughout the area.
I have noted no weaknesses in Subject, which would inhibit his successful
assumption of increasing responsibilities.

An ederer ratine of "Uientiafactory" requires that the employee be
dismissed er reassigned to other work in which to could be reasonably
sypetal to render satisfactory service,

Recommendation for Honor or Merit Award
William V. Broc, Distinguished Intelligence Medal
=
After an active and successful career as a Special
Agent in the FBI, Mr. Broe entered the Agency in June 1948
and was assigned as the Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the
Far East Division. His ability to make decisions, work
effectively with both supervisors and subordinates, plus
his dependability, initiative and attention to the broader
aspects of his work were soon noted and have continued to
characterize his long and productive career in the CIA.
In recognition of his long range potential, Mr. Broe
was assigned to Manila in 1951 as the Chief of Station.
In 1953 he was transferred to the important post of Deputy
Chief of the China Mission in Japan. Here his leadership
qualities were fully demonstrated. His skill in directing
an imaginative, aggressive, operational program, while at
the same time tempering his actions with mature judgment and
smooth management talent, marked him as an officer who could
assume even greater responsibilities. At this time his
outstanding strength of dealing with people became clearly
evident. Mr. Broc was assigned to the Chief of the China
Branch in FS Headquarters in 1955. Re successfully managed
the large, complex branch with a high degree of skill. His
enthusiasm for his work was an exable for his subordinates.
His superior performance of duty was recognized with
his being named the Deputy Chief of the FS Division in 1958.
The late Desmond FitzGerald in evaluating Mr. Broe's perform-
ance of duty in this position, made the following comments
which subsequent supervisors continued to agree with:
**Mr. Broe is an unusually strong supervisor.
His flair for warm but impartial relationships
with subordinates has enabled him to develop a
first hand understanding of the capabilities,
shortcomings and problems of a very large propor-
tion of all FE Division personnel. His direction
does not lack firmness but is expressed in such
a way that feelings are considered and best
results are achieved."

Mr. Bree then was assigned in successive and successful
tours of duty as Chief of Station, Tokyo, Chief of the
Western Hemisphere Division and finally as the Inspector
General of CIA.
In those diverse assignments, Mr. Broe proved to be
a valuable advisor and consultant to top policy makers of
the United States Government as well as colleague of foreign
governments, including Japanese, British and important Latin
American government leaders. His handling of one crisis
situation after another whether it was in the Far East,
Latin America or in Washington, won Mr. Broc the fullest
respect for his wise judgment and effective solutions which
resulted for the overall benefit of the US Government.
During this time, Mr. Broc continued to display his superior
understanding of human relations for those working for him,
resulting in a high morale for those associated with him
and his missions.
In January 1972, Mr. Broe was promoted to the position
of Inspector General, a post which recognized and made the
fullest use of his wise and enlightened knowledge of the
human side of this organization's affairs.
Based on his 26 years of a professional life which
has de singular contributions to the national security
he
and on his unique leadership, it is only hitting that upon
his retirement Mr. Broe be recognized with the award of
the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

sources at his disposal. In those instances where we
were contemplating a new approach to obtaining aerospace
data of priority national interest Mr. Broe provided for
briefings by his specialists in the denied areas under
consideration. His every approach was intended to intel-
ligently present the information available concerning the
difficulties to be encountered and rewards to be expected.
He always left the United States Air Force personnel con-
cerned secure in the knowledge that he fully supported
any promising attempt to acquire data of national interest
and that he did all in his power to expedite the acquisi-
tion of these data. This resulted in a most favorable
operating milieu.
3. In all of our dealings with Mr. Broe, we found him to
be friendly, highly objective, unswerving in his demands
for professionalism, and a person of honor and integrity.
We liked, trusted and respected him. Mr. Broe's demon-
strated professionalism and ability to advise, stimulate
and coordinate the efforts of the many diverse elements
engaged in collection of information reflected favorably
upon him and the Intelligence Community of the United
States.

The purpose of this memorandum is to call your attention to existing
policies which are particularly material to you while you are integrated
and to set forth certain rights and obligations which are incident to your
status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:
1.
As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and
salary of O8-16 $15.515 _ per annum, you will accept cover employ-
ment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred
to as "your cover facility") effective as of 27 April 1961.
You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this
organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies
of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional mamber of
that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being
effected at
and salary of $15,255
PSR-2
per annum.
You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retain-
ing emoluments paid by your cover facility.
2.
It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your
overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed
tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour
consists of a period of twenty four months from the date of your arrival
at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier
for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of
duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organi-
zation in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour
of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas
assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circum-
stances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control
or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organiza-
tion before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed
above from the date or arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will
not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your
dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request
termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience,
unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization-
to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the
regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year
of service from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty,
you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its expenses
for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from
the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to
the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consis-
tent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of
your cover facility. Buch travel will be accomplished in conformance
with applicable regulations of your cover facility except when you are
directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the
regulations of this organization.
1
4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above)
allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the
extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allevance
payments due on the basis of your grade level with this organization.
If such cover payments are less than the amount due, the difference will
be credited to your payroll account with this organization. If such cover
payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this
organization at designated intervals, presently
Computations hereunder will be made on the basis of the aggregate gröss
due and received provided, however, that in computing remittances for
overage Federal and, if applicable, District of Columbia income taxes
withheld by your cover facility against the overage may be deducted. To
assure timely accuracy in your payroll account with this organization you
are expected to immediately report cover facility payroll changes.
5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue
in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility
and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and amoluments
of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however,
to preserve the security of your cover position.
a.
Upon integration into your cover facility, you will continue
to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act,
as amended, and at your personal expense you will be subject to pay-
roll deductions for retirement purposes (now six and one-half por cent)
on the basis of your cover salary or your salary from this organization,
whichever is the greater.
b. If you receive table income from both your cover facility
and this organization, necessary adjustments for Federal, and if
applicable, District of Columbia income tax purposes will be made in
conformance with instructions received from this organiration.
Consistent with your cover activity, you will continue to be
responsible for compliance with the rules and regulations of this
organization.
d. You are not assured upon the completion of your period of
duty with your cover facility of any status with your cover based
on your services performed with that organization at the request of
this organization.

1. I wish to express my appreciation for your participation in
the recent running of the Personnel Officer Training Course. We

experience are constantly reflected in his work.

Mr. Broe started in the FBI in 1941 as a Special Agent, dealing
particularly with German and Russian matters. In 1944, he was prò-
moted to Resident Agent at Youngstown, Ohio, where he handled all
categories of Bureau work. Two years later he was selected to be a
supervisor. He continued in this capacity, dealing chiefly with
security matters, until he came to CIA in 1948. During his term as
resident agent he was outstanding in the important and difficult
task of winning local police cooperation.
Since he has been with CIA, Mr. Broe has shown exceptional
operational understanding and ability. He has a very keen sence of
responsibility and a fine devotion to detail as well as to the broad
phases of his duties. As a Branch Chief he has been completely
reliable and effective. It is planned that he will go to Manila
in the spring of 1951, or perhaps earlier, to take over the important
and delicate work of the Manila Research Unit.

3 June 1948
:
1.
After discussion with the Chief, FB2, the undersigned
talked with subject today and informed him of the following:
a. The position which we had to offer was at P-5. Pro-
motion above that classification would come only after experience
in the field, and no guarantee could be made of higher rating even
after such experience had been gained by subject.
D. The assignment which we offered him would be in Wash-
ington for eighteen months, or perhaps for as long as two years; then
probably assignment to a field station.
Due to his past employment with the FBI, we would
attempt to obtain approval for his entrance on duty on or about
June 14.
2. Subject stated that the above was acceptable to him and
that he accepted our offer of P-5 position. The undersigned informed
Chief, FBZ, of this fact. Processing is being initiated immediately.
