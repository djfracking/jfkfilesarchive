Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
negotiations to establish broad guidelines with the concurrence of the
Committee that could be used to effectively limit the scope and manner
of interviews currently being conducted by staff investigators. I also
told him that I thought it would put the Bureau in a most difficult
posture because the intelligence community could well feel that the FBI
had brought about the loss of the opportunity to have some effective
control over Committee access to sensitive information by negotiating
our own agreement with Gittenstein. I told him that certainly the Committee
would use us as an example to other intelligence agencies and use our
experience to their detriment in establishing limitations on the interviews.
Mr. Wilderotter said that he understood my position and he
would continue to work on the policy paper. He asked to be advised of the
time the meeting is to be held with Schwarz on May 8, 1975, and I indicated
I would so advise him on learning of it myself from Walter Lloyd of CIA
who is making the arrangements. I also suggested that it would be appropriate
for Roderick Hills, Associate Counsel to the President, to be present at the
meeting with Schwarz in order to have a greater chance of resolving these
issues promptly. Wilderotter said that he agreed and would attempt to
make arrangements for Mr. Hills to be present at the meeting.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That the Bureau provide a representative to be available
for consultation by Mr. Mohr as he may request on Friday, May 9, 1975,
at 10:00 a. m., in Room G-308, New Senate Office Building.
Bill Colgar

2. That until appropriate guidelines are established by agreement
between the Committee, the White House, and the intelligence community, the
Bureau not undertake to counsel or debrief Mr. Mohr or any other witnesses
concerning the subject matter of interview, pursuant to agreement with individual
staff interviewers.

Subject is a former leader of the white hate
National Socialist White Peoples Party in Buffalo, New York.
He presently heads an organization known as the National
Guard Party (NGP), a neo-Nazi white hate organization which
by its objectives would deny certain minority groups of their
civil rights. Referenced airtel enclosed copies of a letter
written by subject to Senator Frank Church (Democrat - Idaho)

Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities
in which he makes complaint concerning the Bureau's investiga-
tion of his organization, himself, and with regard to the
arrest of his coleader, William Edward Garrett, in connection
with a Federal firearms violation. Subject's letter, copies
of which were also directed to Senator John Tower (Republican
Texas) and to the Buffalo "Courier Express," a daily newspaper
published in Buffalo, charges the FBI in Buffalo tapped his
telephone as well as the telephones of NGP members and
supporters; threatened to "frame" subject; threatened to
"get" subject; attempted to bribe his personal friends; used
'"scare" tactics against friends, relatives, employees and
businessmen who do the NGP organization's printing3B threatened
to shoot subject's dogs during arrest of William Edward Garrett;
and lied to NGP supporters and businessmen by indicating the
NGP group was planning to blow up certain buildings. Subject's
letter alleges these activities are in direct violation of the

Church conduct investigation concerning same. Appropriate

This memorandum reports the results of an Executive
Committee Meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional
Review for the Intelligence Community on 4/11/75.
S
The Executive Committee, hereinafter referred to as
EXCOM, was chaired by Mr. W. E. Colby in his role as the Director
of Central Intelligence (DCI). Present at the meeting were
Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President; Mr. James Wilderotter
Associate Counsel to the President; Mr. Thomas K. Latimer, Special N
Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, as well as senior officials N
of State Department, National Security Agency (NSA), Office of
Management and Budget, and the National Security Council.
Mr. Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General, was scheduled
to represent the Department of Justice; however, due to a
scheduling foul up Scalia never made the meeting.
The following matters of interest were discussed at
this meeting:
SENATOR CHURCH'S STATEMENT

ED IN 6.2
firsd
"The Washington Post" edition of 4/10/75 contained the
*results of an interview with Senator Frank Church, Chairman of
the Senate Select Committee (SSC). According to this article,
Church stated the Committee reserves the right to make public
eventually any documents it receives and is accepting nothing
with "strings attached." Mr. Roderick Hills advised the EXCOM
that he and Mr. Wilderotter had a meeting with SSC Staff Director,
William Miller subsequent to the Church statement. Both Hills
and Wilderotter came away from this meeting believing the
newspaper report was an overstatement of Church's intent.
Considerable discussion followed Mr. Hills' comments. Mr. Colby
noted that by letter dated 3/11/75 to Senator Church he confirmed
a previous conversation with Senator Church wherein the Senator

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re:

recognized that certain aspects of intelligence activities
must receive special consideration and treatment (a copy of
Colby's letter is attached). By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator
Church confirmed the receipt of Colby's letter and again stated
that in the event the SSC inquiry touches on such sensitive
areas, Senator Church and Colby should discuss jointly what
procedures should be followed (copy of Senator Church's letter
is attached).
Following the meeting Mr. Wilderotter advised me that
the White House will prepare a letter to Senator Church recognizing
that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it
receives but strongly urging that such declassification action
not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without
the approval of the agency originating the information.
Wilderotter stated that the White House expected to speak for
the Executive Branch with a strong voice and that individual
agencies should take no action regarding the Church statement
until the White House has had the opportunity to clear the air
with Senator Church.
SECRECY AGREEMENT AND EMPLOYEE NOTICE
Attached is a copy of a CIA employee bulletin dated
3/12/75. This bulletin relieves CIA employees from the secrecy
agreement should they be interviewed or should they have to
testify before the SSC. At the EXCOM meeting Mr. Wilderotter
suggested all agencies of the intelligence community employing
a secrecy agreement prepare such an employee notice as well as
a letter to Senator Church advising him that the individual
agency was relieving their employees from the secrecy agreement.
Mr. Colby charged the Security Committee of the United States
Intelligence Board (USIB) with preparing a draft of such a
bulletin and letter for the guidance of member agencies and
departments.
It is the opinion of Assistant Director Mintz concurred in
by the Intelligence Division that a general letter to all
employees from the Director releasing them from their obligation
under the FBI employment agreement concerning secrecy for
purposes of possible interviews by representatives of the Senate

The rules concerning sensitive material limit access
to such material to employees on a need-to-know basis and to

the arrest of WILLIAM EDWARD GARRETT (Bureau file 157-
22471; Buffalo file 157-1388) by Bureau Agents at Buffalo,
New York on 10/23/74 at the residence of KARL HAND, 2213
South Bailey Avenue, Buffalo, New York. GARRETT was arrested
based on an authorized complaint and warrant at Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, charging GARRETT with violation of Title 18,
Appendix, Section 1202(a)(1), USC, "Possession of a Firearm
by a Convicted Felon". It should be noted that KARL HAND
was not present at this arrest and GARRETT was alone in the
house.
In that arrest Buffalo advised the Bureau in
referenced airtel, dated 10/31/74, of the items observed by
Bureau Agents at time of arrest, which were as follows:
The front windows and door of 2213 South Bailey
Avenue are completely covered with chicken wire. There were
two large German Shepherd dogs on the premises. Upon entering
the residence a five-gallon can was observed behind the stove.
with approximately six axe handles. In the upstairs bedroom
there was a fully-loaded Stevens Model 77B 20-gauge shotgun,
serial number unknown. In the downstairs bedroom there were
several boxes of .22. ammunition and numerous loose 20-gauge
shotgun shells.
It is noted that memoranda have been prepared by
the SAS who participated in this arrest of GARRETT on
10/23/74, including SA ROBERT N. SHAW, wherein all categorically
deny that any attempt was made to incite GARRETT into doing
anything against his best interests. In addition, all SAs
categorically deny any threat having been made to shoot dogs
found on the premises. It is pointed out that GARRETT was
alone in the house at the time of arrest and that at no time
was KARL HAND present,
It is also pointed out for the information of the
Bureau that on 11/7/74, U. S. Magistrate EDMUND F. MAXWELL,
Buffalo, New York, released GARRETT and dismissed charge of
violation of Title 18, Appendix, Section 1202(a)(1), USC.
However, on 11/8/74, the FGJ, Western District of Pennsylvania
(WDPA) at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, entered a true bill
charging GARRETT with violation of Title 18, Appendix,
2.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
Select Committee would be unwise. It cannot be predicted what
level of FBI employee will be contacted for interview or whether
any employee contacted would have sufficient factual knowledge
in order to provide a full responsive reply to Committee questions.
Moreover, an employee without a full understanding of the material
being inquired about may not be aware of the sensitive nature of
the answers that might be given.
As written, the employment agreement provides that
the burden is on the employee to determine prior to disclosure
whether information may be disclosed and that the Director of
the FBI is in a better position than the employee to make such
a determination. Therefore, it is the opinion of Mr. Mintz and
the Intelligence Division that if no general letter of release is
issued to all employees, any member contacted for interview may
rely upon the provisions of the employment agreement as guidelines
for his or her appropriate response. Specifically, such an
employee would be obligated to bring to the attention of the
Bureau any such request for an interview and in addition, he or
she would be obligated to describe the general nature of the
inquiry. At such time as request for interviews are made we will
be in a better position to determine whether the employee is
the appropriate person and to evaluate the sensitivity of the
material in question.
REVIEW OF WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS BY SENATORS CHURCH AND TOWER:
Mr. Hills advised that both Senators Church and Tower
have tentatively agreed to review sensitive White House documents
the SSC is interested in in White House space. They have tenta- ·
tively accepted the fact that should they believe such documents
are necessary for retention in SSC files, they will accept a
paraphrase of the original document. This arrangement has not
been completely agreed to by Senators Church and Tower but
Mr. Hills is hopeful such an arrangement can be worked out.
BRIEFING OF THE SSC BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY STAFF
Mr. Colby advised that during the week of 4/13/75 he
and Mr. John Clarke, Associate Deputy to the Director of Central
Intelligence for the Intelligence Community, will brief the Senate

KEY ISSUES
11
My memorandum of 4/7/75 reporting the results of the
last EXCOM meeting identified eleven key issues which the
White House was particularly interested in (copy of the key
issues attached). As reported in the 4/7/75 memorandum the FBI
has been designated to prepare the paper entitled "Intelligence
Files and Privacy. Mr. J. Dennis Miller, Legal Counsel Division,
will prepare this paper. He will work with Mr. John Brock,
Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as Mr. Bob McBrien
of Treasury. The White House is very interested in the preparation
of these key issue papers and has asked that the person responsible
for preparing each paper have ready a comprehensive outline as
to how the paper will be constructed on the occasion of the next
EXCOM meeting scheduled for Friday 4/18/75.
THIRD AGENCY RULE
Attached herewith is a paper entitled "Third Agency
Rule" prepared by CIA's General Counsel. It is designed to
acquaint the intelligence community with a background of the
third agency rule and to insure that all members of the community
adhere to the third agency rule when responding to requests from
the Select Committees of the Congress. It is to be noted
Mr. Wilderotter expressed the hope that all agencies in the
intelligence community will respond to a third agency request
within a 48 hour deadline. Both the military and CIA felt such
a short deadline was impossible but all indicated they would try
to provide responses within 48 hours when clearance to pass
information to the Select Committees of Congress under the
third agency rule is requested.

INTERAGENCY REGISTRY
Attached is a memorandum from Mr. Colby to all USIB
principals dated 4/10/75 describing the establishment of a
registry to insure that the community is kept informed as to
materials which will formally be provided to the Select Committee
by all elements of the intelligence community. The Colby
memorandum notes that in order to make the registry useful it
is essential that it include the following:
File copies of documents or other materials which each
intelligence community element provides to a Select Committee
wherein the originating agency considers the material to involve
aspects of community activities. (The Bureau would have very few
items of this nature other than agreements or understandings
the Bureau might have with other elements of the intelligence
community.)
The second requirement of the registry is that an
abstract of each response to a Select Committee be provided to
the registry for its retention. The Bureau has already established
a procedure for providing such abstracts to the registry.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.
In light of the Church statement in "The Washington
Post" and the subsequent conversations the White House has or
contemplates having with Senators Church and Towery. it is
recommended that we continue to disseminate all responses to
the SSC except in those sensitive matters that require close
administrative control. In those instances it is recommended
that we advise the Staff Director that such information responsive
to their request is available at Bureau Headquarters and may be
reviewed by himself or a senior staff member of the SSC.

This letter will confirm and reduce to writing some
of the matters agreed upon at our recent meeting.
At the outset, I should like to express my deep
personal appreciation for the candor and helpfulness of
you and Senator Tower in that meeting and for your
sensitivity to the respective responsibilities under our
Constitutional framework of the Select Committee and the
Central Intelligence Agency in the area of your review.
For my part, I should like to renew again, for myself and
the CIA, my promise of cooperation with respect to the
important work of the Select Committee. In my judgment,
a spirit of good faith and cooperative effort is not only
necessary to enable your Committee to discharge its
responsibilities fully and expeditiously, but is indeed in
the best interests of the intelligence community as well.
I am convinced that a responsible and thorough review of
U.S. intelligence activities will serve to vindicate the
CIA and enhance the public's understanding of the important
contribution that the intelligence efforts of this nation
can make toward the goal of preserving and strengthening
our democracy.

As we
I am particularly appreciative of your recognition
that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence
✓activities must receive special consideration and treatment
by the Select Committee in the course of your work.
discussed, such matters as the identities of our sensitive
sources, the material provided to us by cooperating foreign
intelligence services, the details of technical devices and
systems and of operational methods, the identities of certain
of our employees who could be targets of kidnapping or
assassination, the identities of American citizens and
organizations who have cooperated with U.S. intelligence, and
some additional materials the public disclosure of which would
create serious foreign policy or national security problems,
should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from
the risk of exposure. We should also work together to protect
certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,
might impair the privacy rights of individuals. Where these
kinds of considerations are present, I anticipate that appro-
priate understandings can be arrived at to avoid the risk of
exposing such matters and at the same time to satisfy the
Select Committee's need for a full understanding of our
activities.
As I stated to you, employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency will be available to the Select Committee for staff
interviews and for testimony. As we have discussed, this
might require, in some circumstances, special arrangements to
protect the identity of particular employees whose physical
safety or future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.
I anticipate that suitable safeguards can be established to
avoid such dangers. I assume the Committee will make its own
arrangements with respect to ex-employees as to whom I no
longer have the authority to direct their cooperation.
However,
I am available for whatever assistance I can provide in this
regard.
As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence
Agency are required to sign a secrecy agreement when they enter
on duty. This is a condition of employment, and it requires
that they keep forever secret all classified information gained
during the course of their employment. The secrecy agreement
further requires that they may not disclose classified informa-
tion, either orally or by publication, without prior authoriza-
tion from the Director of Central Intelligence. Under the
secrecy agreement, an employee's obligations with respect to
the protection of classified information continue after his
employment with the CIA has been terminated.

Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional
Committees Investigating Intelligence
1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,
Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will
keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to
progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House
Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular,
it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are
formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements
of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this
matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-
cations.
2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community
Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the
investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all
responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and
available to your designated representatives.
In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is
essential that it include:
30
a. File copies of documents or other materials which
each Intelligence Community element provides to one of the
Select Committees where the originating agency considers
the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,
and/or which may result in follow-on queries concerning.
the functioning of the Community. The availability of this
documentation will be of particular importance if it is
expected there will be subsequent inquiries relating to the
materials provided and involving elements of the Community
other than the originating element.

It is my desire that the secrecy agreements signed by
our employees shall not impair the necessary work of the
Select Committee. To accomplish this, and in recognition
of the security protection contemplated by the Select
Committee, I have determined that disclosure of otherwise
protected information to the Select Committee or its designated
staff members will constitute an authorized provision of infor-
mation within the meaning of the secrecy agreements. This
letter may be used to indicate such authorization for any
Agency employee or ex-employee to furnish information to
the Select Committee or appropriate staff members on matters
which would otherwise be covered by their secrecy agreement,
but which are not among the particularly sensitive matters
such as mentioned above. With respect to those particularly
sensitive matters, different procedures are obviously neces-
sary. Accordingly, where any matter included in these sensi-
tive categories would be involved in responding to the Com-
mittee, the employee should express his concern and, if
possible, propose a way of responding to the Committee without
exposing such sensitive details. If the Committee believes
that a disclosure of those aspects is nevertheless necessary,
the matter will be discussed between the Committee and the
Agency. I am prepared to consult with the Committee at any
time to avoid difficulties in this area and quickly determine
together the appropriate course of action to be taken.
With the good faith evident in our discussions on these
matters, I believe that these arrangements will enable me to
discharge my responsibilities to protect intelligence sources
and methods from unauthorized disclosure, while at the same
time to provide the Select Committee with all the information
it needs to accomplish its task.
As we have agreed, it is in the national interest as well
as that of the Select Committee and the U.S. intelligence
community to ensure that your review proceed as smoothly and
as expeditiously as possible. Toward that end, I have in-
structed all CIA personnel to respond in a spirit of coopera-
tion.
Sincerely,

The cooperative spirit of our relationship with the Committee
and its Staff must at the same time take account of the rights of
Agency employees. The Committee Staff has agreed to advise
employees of their Constitutional rights at the beginning of any
interview or other appearance.
When a current Agency employee is selected to be interviewed
by the Select Committee Staff, the Staff Director or Chief Counsel
will normally notify Mr. John M. Clarke, who is my principal
liaison with the Committee and its Staff. Mr. Clarke, in turn, will
notify the employee. The purpose of this is in no way to inhibit the
work of the Committee. It is intended to allow time for the employee
to gain general legal guidance if he wants it, and to obtain security
guidance from an appropriate senior officer.
My own belief is that after a careful review of all U.S. intelli-
gence activities, the Committee will address needed legislative
changes and will reaffirm their confidence in the importance and
contribution of U.S. intelligence programs.

BULLETIN
Senate Select Committee To Review
U.S. Intelligence Activities
12 March 1975
Senate Resolution 21 established a Select Committee of the
Senate to review U.S. intelligence activities. The Resolution calls
for a comprehensive review of the total U.S. intelligence effort
and is not restricted to the recent charges and allegations against
CIA alone. Consequently, it is likely to be far-ranging in its impact.
It is in all of our interests to see that the Select Committee
receives full understanding of our activities and their contribution
to the country as expeditiously as possible. I have every confidence
that the inquiry will be responsible, and constructive, and will pro-
duce new understanding of, and improvements in, the American
intelligence system.
It is with this conviction that I have pledged my personal coop-
eration and that of the CIA. I have advised Senators Church and Tower,
the Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman, that employees of the
CIA will be available to the Select Committee for Staff interviews and
for testimony. We are working with the Committee Staff to design
procedures to facilitate their work in examining topics of concern.
Attached to this bulletin is a letter which I have sent to Senator
Church. To facilitate the necessary work of the Committee and in
recognition of the security protection contemplated by the Committee,
I have determined that disclosure of otherwise protected information
to the Select Committee or its designated Staff members will constitute
authorized provision of information within the meaning of the Secrecy
Agreements signed by each CIA employee, subject to the special proce-
dures and limitations set forth in the letter regarding particularly
sensitive matters. Senator Church has agreed that reference to sensi-
tive data in any Committee report will be subject to consultation between
the Committee and the Agency.

DATE 1/19/01 BY SP2 AFM/16
On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental
Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities, I want to thank
your for your letter of March 11, and the copy of the Employee Bulletin
you have issued to all CIA employees. As we jointly recognize, in
order for the Committee to carry out a thorough inquiry, in accordance
with the mandate contained in S. Res. 21, the Agency's full cooperation
will be necessary. Your recognition that our mandate authorizes all,
past and present, agency employees to cooperate fully, and without
impediment due to secrecy agreements, will serve to facilitate our
expeditious collection of material relative to that mandate.
I particularly appreciate your statement recognizing our security
precautions. As you know, your staff was very helpful to the Committee's
staff in designing those precautions.
The Staff Director and the Chief Counsel will, under the direction
of the Committee, notify Mr. John Clarke of the members of the Committee
who have been designated to carry out studies, inquiries and investigations
required to meet the tasks specified in S. Res. 21.
It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee
and designated staff will have access to any and all information which
the Committee determines is necessary for its inquiry. We recognize,
however, that the Committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such
as the identity of CIA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations
whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the event
that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive areas, which matters
we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we should discuss
jointly, and as you suggest quickly, what procedures might be followed
should the Committee decide it requires more information in these specific
areas.

(d) If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations
with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation
in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has
received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-
tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would
not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence;
(e) If a State/DOD joint cable is disseminated to CIA, CIA
may not send the information to the FBI until CIA has received
the concurrence of both State and DOD.

•
The issue, most geologists and semic ex-
perts agree, is not whether another block-
buster quake will occur, but when. It could
happen any time.
Should that earthquake oceur "tomorrow,"
these experts believe, the following reall-
ties await Californians:
Tens of thousands of bills built in
the first half of the century, clearly haz
ardous under severe earthquake conditions,
in use in San Francico and Los Angeles,
could topple, endangering thou ands of lives
(an estimated 200,000 in Los An·les alone).
Other thousands of buildin, built on or
near faults face destruction from ground
shaking and land fill.
High-rise buildings, built to more modern
standards, may not sopple, but face serious
hazards of fire, disabled elevators and in-
adequate stairwell safety.
Earthquake disaster urgency plans are in
the nascent stages throu.hout the state,
hampered by apathy among public officials,
lack of funds and infrequent exercises.
The public is ill-prepared to cope with
earthquakes or their aftermaths. There is
virtually no publicity about what to do dur-
ing or after a major quake. Earthquake
drills are rarely, if ever, held in communi-
ties or in public buildings (schools are an
exception).
A recent federally sponsored study gives
these estimates of death and injury should
a temblor of more than 7 or 8 on the Rich-
ter scale occur in or near San Francisco or
Los Angeles:
San Francisco-as many as 10,000 persons
dead and 40,000 injured. (Should a major
dam break, tho death toll could rise to
60,000.) Another 56,000 could be leit home-
less (not including dan evacuees).
Los Angeles-as many as 20,000 deaths and
up to 600,000 injured. Additional deaths pos-
sible due to major dam failure-up to 14,000.
Homeless (not including dam evacuces), up
to 180,000.
At the very best, Californians are fatalistic
about earthquakes, accepting that they will
come, and hoping they will be out of the
affected area when it happens.
"You don't know when it is going to be or
how it's going to be," sald one West Los An-
geles resident. "I should put money into
making my house earthquake-proof when I
could be in some skyscraper swaying when it
happens? Who cares?"
In San Francisco, a college professor re-
cently asked 125 residents in a random
sampling what they would do if an earth-
quake comes. Sixty per cent said, in effect,
"Start praying. What else is there to do?”
What can be done? In fact, quite a lot-
and some of it is being accomplished in the
areas of building code upgrading, land-use
planning. emergency preparedness, earth-
quake prediction, and public education. But
the effort of a few agressive legislators,
state and local officials, and private citizens
is frustrated by the low level of priority
generally assigned to earthquake protection.
The "kill ratio" of past California earth-
quakes is extremely low compared to, say,
traffic accidents. About 900 persons have died
as the results of quakes since the turn of
the century compared to an average annual
highway toll of 4,800. Thus there are those
who argue against expenditures of time and
effort on something as mercurial and unpre-
dictable as an earthquaɛe.
California's new governor, Elmund G.
Brown, Jr., is said to be one of those. Accord-
ing to a recent news story, Brown suggested
that money being allocated for safe buildings
might be used to improve the quality of edu-
cation, to rehabilitate housing for the poor,
or to create construction jobs.

GRESSIONAL RÉCORD SENATE
-
After the San Frenando quake, there was
a flurry of studies, hearings, plans and legis-'
lation.
In Los Angeles, the building code require-
ments were toughened. Explained Bob Wil-
Hams, general manager of Los Angeles' De-
partment of Building and
and Safety: "We
doubled the loading strength requirements
and required standards twice as strong in re-
inforced concrete and reinforced masonry."
Los Angeles' building code is in some re-
spect tougher than the Uniform Building
Cede to which most jurisdictions in the
state adhere, One official, Long Beach build-
ing director Edward M. O'Connor, a leading
proponent of better preparedness, contends
that the Uniform Building Code falls short.
"It does not fulfill the purpose of the
code: to preserve life, limb, property and the
public welfare in the event of an earth-
quake," he said.
Changes in the uniform code come slowly.
They are modeled after recommendations
by the California Structural Engineers As-
sociation, composed of professional engineers
who help design buildings.
The recommendations usually represent
a balance of conservative and liberal strains
within the association, and, according to
some observers, are strongly influenced by
economic considerations.
The drafters of the uniform code are still
wrestling with one of the central lessons of
the San Fernando earthquake-the fact that
major buildings are being constructed with
little knowledge or consideration of soil and
geological conditions and how they might
respond to ground shocks.
Geologists and seismile experts admit they
know very little about what causes earth-
quakes or precisely how buildings are affected
by local or even distant shocks. Now, for the
first time, California is placing instruments
that measure motion
motion in key buildings
around the state. But they must await an-
other earthquake to produce usable data.
In the meantime, seismic considerations
are working their way slowly-some say too
slowly into building requirements.
New laws ban construction directly over
active faults, require satisfactory geologic
studies before new hospitals are built, re-
quiro that a "seismic safety element" be in-
cluded in local planning, and require the
correction of unsafe dam conditions.
This legislation added up to the most pro-
gressive package of earthquake measures in
40 years, but it was not accomplished without
resistance. The restriction on building on or
near faults, for example, inspired a storm of
protest from real estate developers and in-
dividual lot owners that eventually forced
a modification softening the restriction.
A hospital law passed in 1972 requires that
detalled geological and soil reports for pro-
posed hospital construction be reviewed by
state geologists.
James Flosson, director of the state De-
partment of Mines and Geology, promptly
ran into problems.
"The reports the first few months were a
disgrace to the profession," Flosson said. “We
Insisted that they be redone, and done again
until they were right. I've had my head
bloodied many times as a result. I've been
threatened, told my career would be ruined—
a few geologists tried to get me fired. But we
stood by our guns and now the quality of
the reports is excellent.”
Another area of controversy is highrise
safety. Berkeley architect Karl V. Steinbrugge
believes the modern steelframe construction
will withstand Intense shocks. But Henry J.
Degunkolb, a San Francisco structural en-
gli.cer and frequent critle of safety standards,
said:

April 29, 1975
rise collapse, there is a broad consensus that
most existing high rises are vulnerable to ex-
tensivo internal damage
damage from unbolted
equipment and, most significantly, from fire.
The dangers are serious enough to have
prompted major changes recently in fire reg-
ulations for all future buildings.
All future high rises (above 75 feet) will be
built with automatic governors that bring
elevators instantly to ground level, and, most
importantly, with sprinkler systems at every
level.
All but a minuscule number of the nearly
2,000 high rises presently in Los Angeles and
San Francisco lack sprinkler systems.
Requirements that they be installed were
written into a state law last year, but efforts
to draft regulations ran into fierce opposition
from builders, the Chambers of Commerce
and other businessmen.
The battle is still being fought.
San Francisco's disaster plan is advanced
over those of other municipalities, but it sui-
fers from lack of a central communications
network, insufficient coordination among de-
partments and inadequate practical exer-
cises, according to a city planning depart-
ment study.
"All it is is a paper organization," said
Alfred Goldberg, head of the city's building
'department.
Goldberg's concerns are echoed by James
Halgwood, state emergency services oflicer in
charge of helping to create state-level dis-
aster plan for Southern California.
Commented Haigwood: "I don't think most
elected and appointed officials understand
they have a real responsibility to have their
jurisdictions prepared. They are only doing a
barebones job."

National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403,
classified information or material originating in one Department
shall not be disseminated outside any other Department to which
it has been made available without the consent of the originating
Department.
E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.
Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING NOTICE
SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS INVOLVED"
shall not be disseminated in any manner outside authorized
channels without the permission of the originating Department
and an assessment by the senior intelligence official in the
disseminating Department as to the potential risk to the national
security and to the intelligence sources and methods involved.
F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The establish-
ment of special rules limiting access to, distribution and
protection of classified information and material under Section 9
of the Order requires the specific prior approval of the head of
a Department or his designee.
5. Examples of the application of the third agency rule are:
(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community, then
disseminated to members of the community under the authority
of the DCI. Recipients may not disseminate the estimate outside
the Intelligence Community without the approval of the DCI;
(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
Department may not be sent by the State Department to the
Department of Commerce without the permission of the CIA;
(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's
Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or to the
Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus, a request
from the Congress to the Commission for CIA information should
be referred to CIA for action so that the necessary protection of
the information can be insured;

The Third Agency Rule
10 April 1975
1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was included
in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked. Section 7(c)
prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense information originating
in another Department or agency" to an agency "outside the receiving
Department or agency without the consent of the originating Department
or agency. " The only exception to this rule is that dissemination may be
made under the authority of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This
section authorizes the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and
evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the
appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using,
where appropriate, existing agencies and facilities."
2. Historically, the responsibility of the Director of Central Intelli-
gence to disseminate intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence."
This product is the end result of contributions from members of the Intelli-
gence Community. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is a
homogenous product and therefore the approval for further dissemination
beyond the receiving agency must come from the Director of Central
Intelligence.
3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order 11652
which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not specifically
cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the following controls:
Sec. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The originating Department or
other appropriate authority may impose, in conformity with the provisions of
this order, special requirements with respect to access, distribution and
protection of classified information and material, including those which
presently relate to communications intelligence, intelligence sources and
methods and cryptography.
4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order 11652, , a
directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security Council
Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassification and
Safeguarding of National Security Information." This directive does not
contain the term "third agency rule" but does have four subsections which
relate to procedures which are similar to what historically had been called
the third agency rule. These sections are:
A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a
security clearance, a person must have a need for access to
the particular classified information or material sought in
connection with the performance of his official duties or
contractual obligations. The determination of that need shall
be made by officials having responsibility for the classified
information or material.

Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, and
he interposed no objection to our contacting former Agents who
participated in the special squad we had at Atlantic City in
8/64 and advising them they might be approached for interview
by the SSC. Assistant Director Mintz concurred in the Intelligence
Division recommendation that we, on approval, contact the former
Agents as indicated in this outgoing teletype. Deputy Associate
Director J. B. Adams advised of his agreement with this recommen-
dation and for instructions to go forward to the field.
Howard J. Wilson, one of the former Agents designated
to be contacted, resigned for family reasons after being censured,
suspended, placed on probation, and transferred for unsatisfactory
work performance detected during an inspection of the Newark Office.
However, there is no evidence in his personnel file suggesting
Wilson is hostile to the Bureau and the INTD believes he should be
included among those former Agents to becoontacted.

During various contacts with William Miller, Staff Director of
the Senate Select Committee, and Congressman Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.),
Chairman of the House Select Committee, the question has come up regarding
the need for a check of the private offices of individual Committee Members to
assure the absence of any electronic listening devices. The Committee
personnel have been told that we consider this absolutely essential and they
agreed.
In exploring this matter, it was determined that the Capitol
Police Department recently has established a special unit to handle all types
of security problems within the Capitol Hill complex, including checks for
electronic listening devices. Personnel of this unit have received extensive
training, some from CIA. The operations of the unit are controlled through
the Sergeants at Arms of the House and Senate, James Panels, Capital Police Dept.
Suloquent discussion with
Acceals this i

This matter has been discussed with Robert Hough, Deputy
Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, and with Kenneth Harding, Sergeant at Arms
of the House. Hough advised that the special unit already has conducted com-
plete security surveys of the new office space of the Senate Select Committee
and certainly will perform any other checks of this type needed by the Committee
or its individual Members. He said, in fact, that since they now have this
capability they would oppose any outside agency coming on to the Hill to perform
this function. Hough said he already has been in contact with Miller regarding
the necessary security checks and stated he will let us know when the offices of
the Senate Select Committee/have been checked. He said their rules require
specific requests from the individual Members in writing.

On 4/11/75 the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc
Coordinating Group on Congressional Review for the Intelligence
Community was apprised of the discussions with Mr. Robert Hough,
the Deputy Sergeant at Arms of the Senate and with Mr. Kenneth
Harding, Sergeant at Arms of the House. Although the Executive
Committee would have preferred the FBI to conduct audio sweeps,
they interposed no objection to the sweeps being handled by the
Capitol Police Department. Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the
President, requested, however, that both Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding
be requested to periodically advise the FBI as to the sweeps of
Committee space for electronic listening devices. Specifically,
Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding should be asked to furnish the FBI the
following: How frequently they will conduct a counteraudio sweep

the Capitol Police locate an electronic listening device?

the entries to the GTR have been reconstructed to make them
readable on this Xerox. The memorandum copy, which is being
retained in the Voucher Unit, is readable. The markings on
the reverse side of the Xerox have no bearing on the date of
travel but are merely entries relative to the payment to National
Airlines. It might be noted that the issue date of this GTR,
11/21/64, has been determined to be a Saturday, which is the
day of the week Whitson recalled making the trip to Miami.
According to Cox, the Bureau does not maintain copies
of the actual vouchers and there is only a bare possibility that
a voucher over 10 years old, such as the one involved in this
matter, would be maintained anywhere in the Government, such
as at the Federal Records Center.

Reference is made to my memorandum to you 4/24/75
reporting interview by Michael Epstein, Staff Member of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, of retired
SA Lish Whitson concerning a trip to Miami, Florida, by Whitson in
1964. The trip was for the purpose of mailing a package to the late
Martin Luther King, Jr., and indicated we were checking our records
for information regarding the expense voucher and Government
Transportation Request:: (GTR) issued by Whitson and would report
our findings.
Jay Deane Cox, Voucher Unit, Data Processing Section,
Computer Systems Division, supplied the following information as
to the records available concerning Whitson's travel and what the
procedures generally are for maintenance of travel and voucher
records. The Voucher Unit maintains a Travel Authority Card
(TAC) for all investigative and any other FBI employees who have
ever had GTRs issued to them. The TACS are retained indefinitely
-
as there is no provision for their destruction. For every voucher
processed, there is recorded the voucher period, amount of voucher,
date processed and record of any GTRS issued.
62-116395-115
The TAC for Whitson reveals entries to show that on
12/9/64 a voucher was processed for payment to Whitson in the sum
of $19.40 for travel during the period 11/1-30/64. With that
voucher was a memorandum copy of a GTR issued 11/21/64 to National
Airlines in the sum of $107.40 for air coach travel, Washington, D.C.,
to Miami and return. Attached to instant-memorandum-is a Xerox of
the memorandum copy of the GTR, which copy is being retained in the
Voucher Unit. Because of the illegibility resulting from Xeroxing,

ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION
ON VOTES
Mr.
STEVENS. Mr.
Mr. President, on
April 23, 1975, I submitted for the
RECORD a summary of my position on the
votes for H.R. 2166, the tax reduction
bill and H.R. 4296, the farm bill. For
the permanent RECORD, I would like to
correct an error made in this summary.
The correct notation for votes No. 92 and
93 should be as follows:
Vote No. 92; Modified Hart umum-
bered amendment-nay.
Vote No. 93: Motion to table motion to
reconsider the vote by which the modi-
fied Hart unnumbered amendment was
agreed to-nay.
THE IMPORTANCE OF
LATIN AMERICA
Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
wish to call to the attention of my
colleagues an editorial which appeared
in the Washington Post on April 26 en-
titled, "The Importance of Latin Amer-
ica." Frankly, it is a sorry thing we
have to be reminded.
For too long, we have neglected what
President Kennedy recognized as our
"sister republics"-and when we have
dealt with them, it has too often been
on the basis of paternalism rather than
equality. Yet the good neighbor policy
and the alliance for progress remind us
and the alliance for progress remind us
that our relations have been-and again
can be-warm and constructive. They
should occupy a central place in our
foreign polley, and they should be con-
ducted with the mutual respect they
deserve.
Unfortunately, we have been dis-
tracted in recent years by hotter spots,
such as Indochina and the Middle East,
such as Indochina and the Middle East,
not to mention our traditional absorp-
April 29, 1975
tion in superpower politics. To be sur
it is some measure of our indifferen
that we have withheld trade preferene»-
across-the-board, despite the fact th
countries like Venezuela and Ecuador d
not participate in the Arab oil embar
which provoked our action.
Beset by massive social and econon
problems, South America continues a
ferment. We should not wait to be co
fronted with revolution and crisis. Ratj
er, we should anticipate and encou
progress and peaceful change. We m
begin by supporting a new and fel
Panama Canal Treaty, by seriously r.
evaluating the present policy of sat:
tions on Cuba, and by forswearing int.
ference in internal affairs, which has h
such serious repercussions in Chile and
Honduras.
Clearly, the mere visit of Secreta
Kissinger cannot substitute for the sub-
stantive reassessment and improvement
of our attitudes and policies. Latin Amer-
ica is coming of age; so should Amerit.
Perhaps for our bicentennial we sh...
establish a new corollary to the Monne
Doctrine, that Latin America be pro-
tected not only from European excesse
but from our own as well.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the excellent Post editorial Le
printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the editorial
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:
THE IMPORTANCE OF LATIN AMERICA
It is regrettable but not disastrous that
the Indochina crisis should have forced Sec-
retary of State Kissinger to postpone vi
again his long-scheduled trip to Argentina
Brazil and Venezuela. The trip would surely
have enhanced the secretary's understar-
ing of a region of far more critical and cu
during importance to the United States tl. "
Indochina. And it would have given his ho°
the opportunity to get what Latins perel-
nially feel is a commodity in short supply-
the high level attention of the U.S. govern-
ment. Yet the visit of an American Secretary
of State, even one who is a celebrity, is not
something that would turn the heads o
thoughtful Latins. They will wish to see whil
else of a serious nature in Latin-U.S. reja-
tions is going on.
The chief political task of American pol-
icy in the hemisphere is, plainly, to move
beyond the arrogance and paranola that I
American officials to think it was not only
appropriate but necessary to "destabilizo” this
elected governments of Chile in 1970–7'.
Since some of the same key oficials, incluat-
ing Dr. Kissinger, are still in ports of respo
sibility, this is no small task. Optim!'
might hope that the newly heightened puo-
lic and congressional vigilance over the CIA.
and the agency's own announced reforms, "
enough to forestall another "Chile." Pe 1-
mists will remain skeptical, at least until the
test of the next Chile is met.
Meanwhile, the developing emphasis of U
policy on treating Latin countries individ-
ually, rather than as look-alike members of
a hemispheric collective, is a healthy stu
This new emphasis fits the reality that I'll 1
are different. It fits the current Latin 17-
clination to take a step away from the old
notion of a hemispheric "community." And
if deepened, it should free American polte, –
makers from the insidious idea that what
happens in one corner of Latin America wi
this idea that led Washington to fear that
also happen in other corners. It is prectoy
Cuba and Chile, in their respective times
would contaminate the rest of the region.

interview of Mr. Whitson by Michael Epstein, staff member of the
Senate Select Committee. The interview related to Whitson's
trip to Miami in 1964 at the instructions of former Assistant to
the Director William C. Sullivan to mail a package to Martin Luther
King.
1
-
Whitson telephoned my office twice this morning. At 10:35 a.m.
he advised that Epstein had asked him by telephone how Whitson had
made the trip to Miami, meaning how it was paid for. Whitson told
him he had issued a Government Transportation Request (GTR). Epstein
asked whether there was any prior written authorization for Whitson
to make this trip and Whitson told him there was none. Epstein
asked what kind of record would have been made covering the trip.
Whitson explained that the only record that he knew of would be
the expense voucher he submitted covering the expenses involved
and possibly the copy of the GTR which he had issued. He explained
to Epstein the voucher would merely show the GTR had been issued
for a round-trip to Miami and how much per diem had been claimed
in connection with the trip.
In advising of the foregoing, Whitson stated it was his
recollection he had made the Miami trip either in the late Summer
or early Fall of 1964 and that Martin Luther King was "away" at
the time.
In my absence from the office, Whitson called again at
11:05 a.m. to say that Mr. Epstein asked him as to whether he had
registered at the Airport Hotel in Miami and, if so, whether it was
under his own name. Whitson told Epstein that he had registered
under his own name at this hot EC-100

RE
On 4/30/75 Whitson telephoned my office to report that
he had been trying to establish in his mind the specific date when
he made a plane trip from Washington National Airport to Miami,
Florida. He had previously said he thought it was in the late
Summer of 1964. During a subsequent call he fixed the time as
the late Summer or early Fall of 1964. During his contact, 4/30/75,
Whitson stated that to the best of his recollection, this plane
trip took place in October, 1964. The Bureau's appreciation for
his call was expressed to Whitson/
Memorandum 4/25/75 in captioned matter has reported
the location of information from the files of the Voucher Unit,
Data Processing Section, showing that Whitson traveled by plane
to Miami utilizing a GTR issued 11/21/64. It has been determined
this date was on a Saturday, it being noted Whitson previously
stated he made the trip to Miami on Saturday and the return trip
the next day, a Sunday.

Reference Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memorandum of

4-14-75 showing that Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President, had
requested that the Sergeants at Arms of the Senate and House of
Representatives keep the Bureau advised regarding checks made for
electronic listening devices in the offices of captioned Select Committees.
This was discussed on 4-23-75 by Inspector Bowers with
Senate Sergeant at Arms William Wannall and his Deputy, Robert Hough.
They were amenable to notifying us concerning the checks they make of
Senate Select Committee space and the offices of the Members of this
Committee. Hough was designated by Wannall to handle this matter.
Hough advised that the special Capitol Police unit had made a check
of Room S146 in the Capitol on that date (4-23-75) prior to a meeting
of the Senate Select Committee in that room and found nothing. Hough
stated they have received no requests whatever to make any checks of
the offices of individual Committee Members. He said he had discussed
this matter with William Miller, Staff Director of the Select Committee,
and Miller indicated it would be taken up with the Committee but he has
heard nothing further from him.

Re my memorandum to you dated 2-14-75.
As indicated in referenced memorandum, the Bureau's
program concerning destruction of files and records has been suspended
until we can determine whether it involves any documents that might
be of interest to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
D
We contacted William G. Miller, Staff Director for the
Committee, and he asked that we withhold further destruction of files
until the Committee Counsel, who had not been appointed at that time,
had an opportunity to review the matter. Mr. F. A. O. Schwarz 3d,
a New York attorney, was recently named the Committee's Chief Counsel.
It is recommended that representatives of the Files and Communications
Division and the Legal Counsel Division meet with Mr. Schwarz and
Mr. Miller at the earliest opportunity to resolve this matter.
RECOMMENDATION:
That representatives of the Files and Communications
Division and the Legal Counsel Division meet with the Chief Counsel
and Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
to determine whether the Bureau's destruction program can be reinstituted.

On 4-24-75 at 2:30 p.m., former Section Chief Baumgardner
telephonically related that he had been requested to come to Washington for
the purpose of being interviewed by Michael Epstein, staff member of the
Senate Select Committee. Baumgardner advised Epstein that he would make
himself available for interview but at his office at 970 South 4th Street, Louisville,
Kentucky, telephone number 584-5183. Mr. Baumgardner expressed concern
regarding the interview pointing out that he was Section Chief in the Intelligence
Division for some 18 years and during the time was continually dealing with
very sensitive matters which he felt were not the proper subject matter of discus-
sion with people outside the FBI. Additionally, he pointed out he has been
out of the Bureau for some eight years and since he is not aware of current
Bureau operations he, therefore, requested the Bureau have a representative
present during the interview and that the Bureau representative so designated
be thoroughly familiar with Intelligence Division operations so that he might
be made aware of those areas which are sensitive and might compromise
current Bureau investigations. He suggested that the Bureau representative
should arrive sometime the day before the proposed interview which is
4-29-75 so that he may have a preliminary discussion with the Bureau repre-
sentative concerning those areas in which he has knowledge of and may be
sensitive.

This memorandum reports the results of an
Executive Committee meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group of Congressional Review for the Intelligence Community
on 4/21/75.
The Executive Committee, hereinafter referred to
as the EXCOM, was chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate
Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) for
the Intelligence Community, in the absence of Mr. William
Colby (DCI), who had been called to the Hill to testify
on the current situation in Vietnam. Present at the
meeting were Mr. Philip Buchen and Mr. Roderick Hills,
Counsels to the President; Mr. James Wilderotter, Associate
Counsel to the President; Mr. Thomas K. Latimer, Special
Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, as well as senior
officials of the State Department, National Security Agency
(NSA), Office of Management and Budget, and the Treasury
Department. Mr. Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General,
was scheduled to represent the Department of Justice but
failed to appear.
The following matters of interest were discussed
at the meeting:
KEY ISSUES
¬
The purpose of the key issue papers is to completely
familiarize the White House with all facets of certain key
issues which could arise from Senate Select Committee (SSC)
deliberations. It is hoped these key issue papers will
permit the President's Counsel to be a more articulate
advocate of the intelligence community should any of these
issues by raised.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Senstudy 75
Re:
Memorandum Cregar to Wannall dated 4/14/75 reported
that Mr. J. Dennis Miller of the Legal Counsel Division was
preparing the key issue paper entitled "Intelligence Files
and Privacy." A copy of the outline for this paper was
presented to the EXCOM with the commitment that a draft of
the paper would be ready for review in the next two to three
weeks.
Another key issue paper is one being prepared by
Mr. Warren D. Magnusson of CIA entitled "G. A. O. and the Audit
Authorities of U. S. Intelligence Agencies." Mr. Wilderotter
suggested Mr. Magnusson consult with the FBI inasmuch as
the Bureau was currently being audited by GAO. Mr. Robert
Finzel of the Intelligence Division maintains liaison with
GAO representatives auditing the Intelligence Division.
Mr. Finzel's name will be furnished Mr. Magnusson for
consultation purposes in line with the suggestion from
Mr. Wilderotter.
WHITE HOUSE RESPONSES TO SSC REQUESTS
Enclosed is a copy of a memorandum from James A.
Wilderotter to Mr. John Clarke dated 4/16/75. The memorandum
advises that the White House provided copies of the Colby
report (including annexes), as well as a list of documents
to the Senate Select Committee on 4/14/75. The Colby report
is the document prepared for the President following the
Seymour Hersch articles which appeared in "The New York Times"
alleging CIA was engaged in massive domestic surveillances.
GUIDELINES FOR PARAPHRASING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO
THE SELECT COMMITTEES
Memorandum Cregar to Wannall dated 4/7/75 attached a
copy of sanitization guidelines for documents provided to
Congressional Select Committees. Attached to this memorandum
are new guidelines entitled "Guidelines for Paraphrasing
Certain Documents Provided to the Select Committees." In
essence the attachment is almost identical to the sanitization
guidelines. The reason for the change is the White House
prefers the word "paraphrase" rather than "sanitization." Thus,
guidelines under the paraphrasing description were promulgated.

My memorandum to you 5/13/75 furnished highlights of
information relating to an interview by a Senate Select Committee
(SSC) Staff Member of retired SA Alan G. Sentinella, as obtained
by Supervisor Seymor Fred Phillips of the Bureau's Senstudy 75
Special Project.
-
At 11:20 a.m. 5/14/75 Sentinella telephonically contacted
Phillips from Atlanta, Georgia, and advised that he had been tele-
phonically contacted earlier on the morning of 5/14/75 by SSC
Staff Member Lester B. Seidel who had interviewed him 5/12/75.
Seidel told Sentinella that he is being subpoenaed to give sworn
testimony before an Executive Session of the SSC 9:30 a.m. Wednesday,
5/21/75. The testimony is to be given in Room G-308, New Senate
Office Building. In response to specific questions from Sentinella,
Seidel advised Sentinella that he will be reimbursed expenses, that
his presence will probably be needed for only one day, and that the
purpose is to essentially go over the material covered when Seidel
interviewed Sentinella 5/12/75. Seidel asked Sentinella who had
taken over the case concerning Levison (Stanley David Levison, former
consultant to Martin Luther King, Jr., who was under Bureau investi-
gation because of his communist background) in Atlanta when
Sentinella left. Sentinella furnished Seidel the name of SA
Richard Hamilton.
REC-100 62-116395748
Sentinella asked Phillips for assistance of the nature he
received when he was interviewed%3B that is, someone from the Bureau
to render guidance relative to any sensitive areas that might
it be
touched upon.
He furnished the following as his telephone numbers
in Atlanta, all area code 404.

6. Intelligence Estimates
Finished intelligence reports and estimates do not usually
contain source identifications and will not normally require para-
phrasing. However, departments and agencies should review such
publications to ensure deletion of sensitive source identities and
details of collection systems.
7. Administration
Information concerning the administration of intelligencė .
agencies may be required. This may include staffing charts with
occupants identified. Identities of personnel formerly not under
cover and now functioning in a cover assignment should be deleted
as well as those who may in the future be considered for a covert
.assignment.
8. General
The following categories of information or specific examples
may arise in any number of circumstances in documentation re-
quested by the Select Committees. In all cases, serious consideration
should be given by the department or agency concerned to the necessity
of deletion or paraphrasing of this type of information, prior to
providing the document.
(a) Agent or informant names or operational information
revealing them.
(b) Details which would reveal sensitive methods and
techniques (1) employed in human source collection, (2)
employed for the physical security protection of the
department's or agency's personnel or physical environment.
(c) The numbers, locations, times and other indications
of recruitment, attempted recruitment or emplacement of
personnel within targeted foreign organizations.

:
possible to determine specifically what material should be excised
from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in
certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases should meet
the test mentioned above.
5. Collection of Intelligence
(a) The Committees will probably address the matter of how
intelligence is collected. Documents supporting responses may be
paraphrased by removal of identities of sensitive agents and informants,
covert personnel, and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive
phrase may be substituted, i. e., a foreign journalist, a political
official in the opposition party. No paraphrasing should be used in
connection with names of individuals whose employment or former
employment by, or association with a department or agency, does not
remain secret or for individuals whose present or future activities on
behalf of the department or agency do not require that previous cover
arrangements remain secret.
(b) Some information may be required with respect to
technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communi-
cations activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of
such material is currently handled in compartmentation control
channels under various codewords or nicknames. No security threat
is perceived by use of these codenames or nicknames in classified
documents. Details of the technical systems which would reveal
critical operational capabilities and contractual and funding arrange-
ments which would identify individuals whose participation was
obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from
documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be
referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the
Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in
the Community's paraphrasing procedures. While documentary
samples of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used
in support of testimony, special consideration should be given with
regard to raw products which reveal critical operational capabilities.

In accordance with established procedure, Sentinella
was advised that he would be contacted by someone from the
Office of the Legal Counsel who will make arrangements for
à Bureau representative to be available for consultation
should Sentinella's testimony involve sensitive areas of

reviewed at an appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness
and accuracy. In the case of documents or materials of a community
nature, the release should be done in coordination with the depart-
ments or agencies and/or the Program Manager concerned an any
paraphrasing should be agreed upon during coordination.
This proposed use of paraphrasing as a special arrangement
to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select
Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not
practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.
It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt
to employ the same criteria for paraphrasing and coordinate as
required. This paper can serve only a's general guidelines.

9. Techniques of Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing of intelligence material may include the
physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing from
written communication with or without regard for the residual
content. Use of a substitute terms is an example of paraphrasing
which permits intelligent continuity of the material without revealing
the true identity. Paraphrasing does not extend to the use of false
or misleading substitute material..
The
The integrity of official records must be maintained.
following paraphrasing techniques apply only to copies of records.
(a) Names may be obliterated, masked or replaced
with substitute terms, the residual material xeroxed and
the copy submitted to Committees.
(b) The material can be retyped or reprinted with
substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which do not
reveal the sensitive material.
(c) Entire pages can be removed from some documents
and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference
information as to the location of the sensitive material
within the contributing department or agency.
(d) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable
to extract a complete document from requested material when
the request is broad and all-inclusive within its field. The
existence of such a document should be made known to the
Committees but retained by the agency or department for
review under escort of a representative of the department
or agency.
10. Management of Documents
The original record and a copy of the paraphrased version
provided should be readily available in all cases. Materials developed
within an agency or department in response to requests should be

·GUIDELINES FOR PARAPHRASING SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN
CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES
T
}
1
1. The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed
with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment
by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence
activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need:
It is anticipated that appropriate arrangements can be made so as to
avoid the risk of exposing such matters and at the same time satisfying
the Select Committees' need for a full understanding of the intelligence
community's activities. Included in such matters are the identities of
sensitive sources, the material provided to the United States by
cooperating foreign intelligence services, the details of technical
devices and systems and of operational methods, the identities of
certain employees whose safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the
identities of American citizens and organizations who have cooperated
with US intelligence and some additional materials the public disclosure
of which would create serious foreign policy or national security
problems. Such material should be protected not only from exposure
but indeed the risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given
to the need to protect certain other information which, if improperly.
disclosed, might impair the privacy rights of individuals.
2. Proper procedures should enable intelligence community
members to prevent risk of disclosure of sensitive sources and
· methods and at the same time present to the Select Committees the
necessary details to allow for their proper understanding of community
activities.
3. The procedures described herein are not to be used as
downgrading or declassification guides. All concerned should be
mindful that application of these procedures will not declassify,
downgrade or remove from compartmentation controls any documents
or information provided the Select Committees, unless individual
advice to that effect is provided as well.

RECEIVED
APR 14 1975
CRIMINAL DIVISION
A newspaper report in today's Washington Post
has raised serious questions as to how many rederal
agencies engage in electronic surveillance and the extent.
of such surveillance.
At a hearing on May 23, 1974, before the Subcommittee
on Administrative Practice and Procedure, Attorney General
Saxbe testified on this subject. I asked him: "Can you
tell us about any other organizations or government
departments that are involved in any wiretapping at all
today?" The Attorney General replied: "We do not believe
that there is anyone else and the penalties are rather
.. severe." (p. 495) I am enclosing a copy of the hearings
for your convenience.
The recent reports raise questions concerning the
completeness and clarity of Attorney General Saxbe's
earlier testimony. President Johnson's executive memorandum
of June 30, 1965, requires that federal agencies engage in
wiretapping only with the prior approval of the Attorney
General. In order to fully answer the questions that have
been raised, I request that you provide the Subcommittee on
Administrative Practice and Procedure with the following..
information by April 16:
BORD
012
1. A list of all federal departments, agencies, bureaus,
divisions, and other units that conduct, have conducted, or have
authority to conduct electronic surveillance of any type (including
wiretaps, bugs, and other uses of any device or apparatus which
can be used to intercept a wire or oral communication).

June 29, 1972 in each of the five statutory categories contained
in Section 2511(3) of Title 18, United States Code. Also, on
∙May.14, 1973, Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investi
gation William D. Ruckleshaus disclosed information concerning
some 17 wiretaps that had been placed on the telephones of
newsmen and government officials.
In order to keep this Subcommittee and the public fully
informed about this extremely significant aspect of your
practices and procedures, would you kindly provide the fol-
lowing information as soon as possible, sending us immediately
those items of information which are readily available, and the
remainder when obtained. As I indicated in my February 5, 1971.
1 letter, I recognize that some of the statistics will be based on
documents which are classified, but, as earlier, the requests have
been framed so as to admit of answers which should be able to be
unclassified. As previously indicated, if you nevertheless see
a need to classify any particular answer, please provide it
separately, and it will be handled on a classified basis.
As used in the following questions, the term "electronic
surveillance" includes interceptions of both wire and oral
communications. The questions refer only to warrantless elec-
tronic surveillances.
A. For each of the periods calendar year 1971, calendar year
1972, and January 1, 1973 to September 30, 1973, please provide:
1. The number of electronic surveillance installations
placed in operation or continuing in operation at any time
during the period, in terms of the number of "premises of
organizations or individuals without regard to the number of
instruments which may be involved in effectuating the sur-
veillances, " to use the description in Mr. Maroney's letter'
of August 2, 1972. I assume that this is the same method of
computation used by Mr. Mardian in his letter of March 1, 1971;
if it is not, please indicate the method of computation used
by him and provide comparable figures for the time periods
specified.
2. Of these, please provide:
t
a. The number of electronic surveillance installations
newly placed in operation during the period%3
b. The number of electronic surveillance installations
continuing in operation at any time during the period but placed
in operation during a prior period.
3. The number of each type of installation, i.e., telephone
surveillances, microphone surveillances, combination surveillances,
or other.

DEAR MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I am writing with reference to my letter to the
Attorney General of October 10, 1973, seeking certain information about war-
rantless electronic. surveillance. A copy of this letter is enclosed for your conven-
ience. The information requested would expand and update information supplied
to the Subcommittee over the past several years. After six months, none of the
Information has yet been provided.
In your letter of February 5th. you indicated that every effort was being made
to obtain the information I requested as expeditiously as possible. At a meeting
with Subcommittee staff last month following our meeting of February 27th.
however, the Department stated that it would be willing to provide only an up-
date of the information provided in 1971 and 1972, and to furnish this informa-
tion only to me personally on a confidential basis. This proposal would not meet
the Subcommittee's requirements. The Subcommittee requires all the informa-
tion requested, not just an update of that supplied two years ago. The informa-
tion provided on a nonclassified basis in previous years should be provided on rie
same basis at this time. To the extent that any information is supplied on a con-
fidential basis, Subcommittee members and staff must have access to it.
I am sure you realize that the Subcommittee's need for this information is
pressing. As you are aware, we have been conducting hearings ou warrantless
electronic surveillance with the. Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights and the
Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Surveillance. In order to effectively exercise
our oversight and legislative responsibilities in this area, we need the base of.
Information requested in the letter.
I am writing to request that the bulk of the information requested be pro-
vided to the Subcommittee no later than April 20 in order to enable the Sub-
committee to analyze the data prior to our next series of hearings beginning
Nay 7th. Please contact Kenneth Kaufman, Assistant Counsel. if you have any
questions regarding this request.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter. With best personal
regards.
Sincerely,
EDWARD M. KENNEDY,
Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:
As you know, the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice
and Procedure has played an active role in the area of
electronic surveillance over the past several years, including
its role in the development and processing of the legislation
which eventually became Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and its hearings on warrantless
wiretapping last year.
-On February 5, 1971, I wrote Attorney General John Mitchell
seeking certain information about electronic surveillance instal-
lations without court orders. The Department was good enough to
· provide me with most of the information I sought. The information
extended by the Department was extremely useful in enlightening
both the Committee and the public about the extent and signfi-
cance of such surveillance..
The information sought and supplied dealt only with the
period June 19, 1968 through calendar year 1970.
Since then,
of course, the United States Supreme Court has held that
domestic security surveillance without a court order is uncon-
stitutional, United States v. United States District Court,
407 U.S. 29/ (1972). Shortly after the Supreme Court decision,
our Subcommittee held hearings on warrantless wiretapping, during
which a detailed inquiry was made into the Justice Department's
practices and procedures in implementing the decision. At the
-hearings, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin Maroney
testified that in response to the Supreme Court ruling, a certain
number of installations "in cases involving domestic security,'
to use the description in Mr. Kleindienst's statement of
June 19, 1972, were terminated. In a letter dated August 2, 1972,
Mr. Maroney indicated the numbers of surveillances in place on

c. 12. On June 5, 19/3, the White House released figures on the
number of national security wiretaps installed since 1945, reported
at page H 4343 of the Congressional Record. These figures seem
Minconsistent with those supplied to me by the Department on
March 1, 19/1. In addition, the figures are unclear in certain key
respects. I would therefore appreciate your supplying the following
information with respect to the figures released by the White House:
a. "Do the years indicated refer to fiscal or to calendar
:
years?
b. Do the totals include interceptions other than by
telephone wiretaps--e.g., microphone surveillances, etc.?
C. Do the figures refer to the sum of all interceptions
in operation during the year, or only to those in operation as
of a certain date--e.g., December 31st?

The Honorable Frank Church, Chairman
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities
United States Senate

Dear Senator Church:
I have your request of 24 April for additional material, and we
are working to make it available to your staff as soon as possible. I
believe we will be able to meet your ten-day time requirement with the
exception of the materials outlined in paragraphs 4 and 8. While the
Agency's responses to paragraph 3 should satisfy part of your request
in paragraph 4, a full response will require a file search and review,
which cannot be accomplished in ten days. We do not have separated
the responses to Director Schlesinger's letter of 9 May 1973 as between
senior operating officials" and "all employees or ex-employees' re-
sponses. We can of course provide you what we have as a start.
The answers to moss of the nine parts of paragraph 8 will involve
a careful file search and a careful review for sensitive sources and
methods information. We will do our best, but a full answer to para-
graph 8 will require more than ten days..
We have for other parts of your request summarized material.
which we will provide so that your staff can discuss with us the best
way of proceeding against the more voluminous backup data. · For ex-
ample, in one instance the backup to the summary involves as many as
20,000 index cards, In another, the basic data involves a roomful of
miniaturized data. We need to be certain as to the precise concern of
the Committee in these matters in order to respond with the least dis-
ruption to the work of the Agency and to help the staff to understand
whether they have asked the right question.
The materials requested in paragraphs 5 and 10(a) are in the
Watergate reports. I would hope your staffs could acquire this data
from the published versions of those reports,

I realize that I am requesting a substantial amount of
information, but as you can well understand, this is a matter·
of great current public significance. It is not only
important that the Congress be kept fully informed, but also
that the public be reassured that the Attorney General has full
knowledge and control over the mechanisms of our government
that directly arrect the constitutional rights of our citizens.
Accordingly, I am transmitting this letter in the spirit of
cooperation between the Department and the Congress stressed
by Deputy Attorney General Ruckleshaus at his confirmation
hearings before the Judiciary Committee.
I very much appreciated the promptness of the Department's
response to my initial inquiry two years ago. I assume
that much of the information requested in this letter is readily
available. Insofar as some of the information may not be
immediately available; a prompt response with respect to such
“information as is readily available would be appreciated, with
the remaining information provided at a later date.
With best wishes.

As the inquiry progresses from a'documentation phase to inter-
view phaass, it will become even more important to adhere to the
general agreement we have with your staff to have preliminary consul-
tations and discussions prior to a formal request by the Committee. In
this way we can promote a better understanding of the work involved
and establish reasonable time frames as well.

the volume of the material you have requested is considerable.
At our meeting, I showed you a list of the materials that have
already been provided, and Mr. Miller has been kept advised
about the status of other materials.
In discussing some of the concerns of people in the
Intelligence Community about the procedures addressed above,
you agreed to raise with the Committee the question of ultimate
disposition of materials provided. I understand that this is in
train. In this connection, I was very much appreciative of your
reassurance that you and the Committee members will consult
with me prior to the release of any classified materials in
public statements or unclassified reports of the Committee.
Such consultation is consistent with the spirit of the inquiry.
I believe our staffs are working well together. There
have been the usual inherent problems that one can expect in
an investigation of this scope. Because the Select Committee
staff personnel engaged in the inquiry are relatively new to the
field of intelligence and to the seriousness of the inquiry,
expectations are ambitious. But there is something to be said
for both sides of the equation. For example, we await the
convenience of your investigators on selective follow-up matters
on which they had requested further data. Meanwhile, we have urged
and are providing the staff with detailed briefings by way of introduction
to the Agency's history and functions. I am personally convinced
that direct discussions about our work and about specific instances
of interest to the staff investigators will be far more direct and
productive to them (saving us much useless work) than engaging
in debates about massive document transfer requests.
To that end, I am very anxious to renew and by this letter
I would repeat my request to you that the Committee move
personally and directly into the inquiry at an early date. I am
delighted that you and the Committee are coming to visit our
headquarters for a discussion of the Intelligence Community
and the Agency and for an exchange on the precise interests which

Dear Senator Church:
29 APR 1975
I believe it would be useful if I placed on the record the
situation with respect to your 12 March request. I regret
that you considered it necessary to issue public criticism of
CIA's efforts to meet your needs. As of this writing, the major
portion of that request for CIA-originated material has been
met and, I believe, in a responsive manner.
, #
At our meeting of 22 April, we agreed that if your
investigators could review materials at the CIA Headquarters,
it would expedite the inquiry and lessen the amount of material
which otherwise would have to be paraphrased, a process which
takes a substantial amount of time. Special office space and access
badges have been provided for this purpose. I agreed that, should
specific documents or parts thereof be requested to be sent to
the Senate Select Committee offices, the Agency would prepare
these as expeditiously as possible without sacrifice to the
security considerations consistent with our earlier understanding
of the need to protect sources and methods from undue risk of
exposure. I also gave you my assurance that we would assist in
the clearance of multi-agency papers involving CIA, some of
which are on your earlier request.
A speed-up in the Agency's paraphrasing process is
being undertaken, although as you can appreciate, this involves
senior personnel with heavy demands for substantive work, and

particular Committee members have concerning the inquiry. We
need to understand the specific objectives the Committee seeks
and relate these to the priorities of the materials you will need.
I believe we can be helpful if we know these. Again, I am convinced
that the constructive long-term contributions that we both envisage
from the Select Committee's work will derive in a far more concrete
fashion by focusing on specific and major questions about intelligence
rather than consuming an inordinate amount of time reviewing the
details of all of our past history. In that way our main energies
and our judgment can be addressed to what kind of intelligence we
want in our free society of the future, rather than what we may
have had in the past..

Dear Director Colby:

19-01 SP 2 ALMl776
On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I enclose a
specification, furnished to John Clarke yesterday, which calls for
certain material referred to in your. December 24, 1974 report to
the President and provides further detail concerning certain CIA
material heretofore requested. Obviously it is not intended to
limit what we have already requested.
It is the Committee's expectation that all this material
should be produced in ten days.
✓ I was heartened by the spirit of cooperation demonstrated in
your personal reassurances in our meeting on April 22, 1975, and
I understand that substantial material was made available to us
today at the CIA. However, the fact remains that too much material
called for in our document request remains outstanding and the
system apparently being. employed to clear material for us builds
in excessive delays. A necessary prerequisite to our inquiry
proceeding expeditiously--as it should to restore public confidence
in our intelligence agencies and develop a new national consensus
on the proper functions of intelligence activity--is to eliminate
these delays.

a very cogent observation concerning the FBI's handling of
informants. The SSC Task Force he is on is studying informant
matters in various intelligence community agencies including
the FBI. He stated that they had found the FBI as so much far
superior to other agencies that they considered the FBI as the
standard for all law enforcement. He cited specifically the
finding that the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as very weak in informant
aspects.
It is believed that the visitors found the briefing
most productive, as they themselves stated that briefings
such as this one will be very helpful to the SSC in its work;
and promote friendly and businesslike relations between the
SSC and the Bureau.

designated the FBI as coordinator of all law enforcement in
the U. S. regarding espionage, abotage and neutrality matters;
the second Roosevelt directive reiterated the first. The Truman
directive was a reiteration of the prior Roosevelt directives.
The Eisenhower directive expanded upon the previous directives
to include Atomic Energy Act violations.

This memorandum reports the receipt of a legal
memorandum prepared by Mr. Edmund Cohen, Office of the General HOTIS
Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, entitled "Authority of
Congress to Release Classified Data." Copies of this legal
memorandum have been furnished to Mr. Anthonin Scalia, Assistant
Attorney General, and Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel
to the President.
Memorandum Cregar to W. R. Wannall dated 4/14/75 discussed
an article contained in the 4/10/75 edition of "The Washington Post"
wherein Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select
Committee, stated he reserved the right to make public any documents
the Committee received. This memorandum also noted that Mr. James
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, advised that
The White House was preparing a letter to Senator Church recognizing
that Congress can, at its discretion, declassify material it
receives, but strongly urging that such declassification action
not be taken unilaterally by the Senate Select Committee without
approval of the agency originating the information.
As an aid to the preparation of such a letter, the
Office of CIA's General Counsel has prepared a paper entitled
"Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data." Copy attached.
It was made available to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Committee for
information and any comments recipients desired to make.

Under cover of an LHM, there was forwarded to the
SSC an FBI "Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction,'
dated 2/13/75. The purpose of the paper is to set forth an
analysis of the investigative authority granted by Presidential
Directives, the National Security Council, and orders of the
Attorney General, as well as to list statutes from which the
FBI draws investigative jurisdiction in the security and
intelligence area of operation. The LHM noted that certain 7 1975
exhibits to the paper were extracted because of "Third Agency
Rule" requirements and that approvals were being sought-for
clearances to subsequently furnish the excluded exhibits.

We received this afternoon, 5/9/75, from Mrs. Susan-M
Hauser of the Deputy Attorney General's Office, the following
data: 1) informal note from Doug Marvin to the Deputy. Attorney
General re: Senator Hart's meeting with the Attorney General
5/6/75; 2) letter to Senator Hart by the Attorney General dated
5/7/75 advising that Hart's oral request for access to his FBI
file will be treated as coming under the FOIA; and 3) a memoran-
dum from for files dated 5/6/75 that appears to have been
dictated by the Attorney General in which he sets forth pertinent
information concerning his meeting with Senator Hart. The Attorney
General points out that he will treat Hart's oral request as
coming under the FOIA although he did not know whether the
Senator should in fact make this request in writing (actually,
the Code of Federal Regulations, of course, points out that FOIA
requests must be in writing).
According to the Attorney General's memorandum, Senator.
Hart indicated that he was not trying to make a particular
point and did not want to go to court, but rather felt it would
be helpful to members of the Senate Select Committee, who wanted
to do it, to see what an FBI file was like, and he felt that by
seeing his own file it would raise less problems than trying to
see someone else's file.
In view of the Attorney General's letter to Senator
Hart of 5/7/75 advising him that his oral request will be processed
under the FOIA, the FOIA Section will immediately institute the
processing of this request. However, unless advised to the
contrary, it is intended that Senator Hart's request will be put
in chronological order and will receive no special treatment.
should also be noted that Senator Hart is under the mistaken
belief that as a Senator, and particularly as a member of the
Senate Select Committee, he could receive an FBI file on a third

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
RECOMMENDATION:
This memorandum is for the immediate information
of Bureau officials. When the detailed statement of Sentinella
is received, we will prepare an LHM for the Attorney General
with a copy for possible forwarding to Mr. James Wilderotter,
Associate Counsel to the President. This is the procedure we
have been following when former Agents have volunteered to us
the results of interviews of them by the SSC.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
not intended to have any chilling effect on Seidel's interview
and that Phillips was there only upon Sentinella's request and
for the purposes indicated. Phillips then retired to an adjoining
room.
Sentinella consulted with Phillips on only one occasion.
At about 1:45 p.m. . he came to Phillips' adjoining office, and
said that Seidel's current questioning was concerning the make-up
of the squad Sentinella was assigned to around 1965. This squad
handled security, racial, and civil rights matters and Seidel was
apparently seeking information as to the parameters of these types
of investigations and what they entailed. At this point Phillips
joined Seidel and Sentinella and offered the following in possible
assistance to Seidel. Phillips explained that the various Sections
of the Bureau Manuals dealing with these types of investigations
had been made available to the SSC and insofar as the security
Sections were concerned, there was presently being processed at the
Bureau superseded Sections dating back to 1960 to be made available
to the SSC. At this point Seidel stated he was not so much interested
in what the Manuals said but actually wanted Sentinella, to the best
of his recollection, to furnish names of individuals and organizations
under investigation in Atlanta during the pertinent period.
Sentinella refused to name any, stating that he had no idea as to
what might be under current investigation or how his furnishing of
information now might affect current Bureau's interests. Sentinella
also told Seidel that he, Sentinella, was not so naive as to
believe that his information might not appear in the press. Seidel
immediately said that he would furnish no information to the press.
Sentinella then said that he was not intimating that Seidel would be
responsible, but that the information might still be publicized and
that once Sentinella gave the information it fell completely out of
his control. Seidel indicated that Sentinella might be required
through subpoena to testify before the SSC and be asked the same
question. Sentinella responded that his answer before the Committee
would be the same. Phillips indicated to Sentinella that if he
desired to consult with Phillips concerning the names of any
investigations Sentinella recalled, Phillips would assist him by
indicating, if he knew, whether they were of current FBI interest.
Sentinella desired no such help and insisted to Seidel that he did
not desire to name the subjects of prior investigations. This inter-
lude in the formal interview lasted about 10 minutes after which
Phillips returned to the adjoining room.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
--
At 2:20 p.m. the interview ended and Phillips was
taken by Sentinella back into the latter's office where Seidel
said he was leaving and wanted to say good-bye. Phillips alluded
to the interview having been completed to which Seidel responded,
and these are to the best of Phillips' recollection, Seidel's
exact words, "Yes, you're not letting him give us the good
information." Immediately upon hearing this statement from
Seidel, Phillips interjected a strong protest by stating to Seidel
that neither Phillips nor the FBI was keeping Sentinella from giving
any information%3B that the FBI has not injected itself in Sentinella's
decision to give or not give information. Seidel responded with a
statement to the effect that the result is the same Sentinella
is not giving the good information. Phillips again responded by
telling Seidel that irrespective of the latter's opinion, Phillips
wanted the record crystal clear that Sentinella has not been
counseled by Phillips or anyone else in the FBI as to what he
should or should not tell Seidel. Sentinella interrupted to
express his loyalty to the Bureau as well as his respect for
the confidentiality of his relationship with the Bureau and its
work. He told Seidel that he did not intend to be a talkative,
discontented former FBI employee as apparently are some of
the sources being consulted by the SSC, Sentinella pointed out
that he himself had been the subject of disciplinary action by the
Bureau but that it had made him a better Agent and that it in no
way would influence his loyalty and responsibility to the Bureau.
Seidel then left.
I
After Seidel's departure, Sentinella stated it was his
personal desire to dictate a lengthy question and answer type
statement of the entire interview while it was fresh in his mind
as he had not taken any notes. He said he preferred to handle this
with his own secretary whom he trusts implicitly and has pledged
to maintain this information confidential. Sentinella advised that
he would have the typing of the statement completed the following
day and would immediately make a copy available to Atlanta SAC
DeBruler for transmittal to Bureau Headquarters. At Sentinella's
invitation, Phillips sat in on the dictation of practically the
entire statement as a means for Sentinella briefing Phillips on
the details of the interview. Instant memorandum is not intended

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

IN
to summarize these details which will be forthcoming with
Sentinella's statement to be mailed to the Bureau. However,
one significant question asked of Sentinella should be noted.
During a discussion of electronic surveillances in the King
investigation, Seidel asked how other Agents felt about "illegal
use of taps. Sentinella's response was that the taps were not
illegal and were put on only after approval by the Attorney
General.
"
OBSERVATIONS:
It is Phillips' view that Sentinella represents a
high caliber former Agent who is completely loyal to the Bureau
and will apparently go to any extreme to maintain the confidentiality
of the work he did. He certainly could be described as a reluctant
witness if he is ever called to testify. He expressed personal'
concern that he might be called but hoped that his uncooperativeness
in some areas to Seidel's questions might discourage his being called.
Two incidents related above are very suggestive of a lack
of objectivity on the part of Seidel. The first concerns his
comment to Phillips about the FBI not letting Sentinella give him
"good information." To begin with, this was an unjustified allëga-
tion and Seidel was set straight immediately after his remark.
Secondly, the mere fact that Seidel is referring to "good" infor-
mation suggests itself that certain information fits their desires
and others does not. There appears to be a lack of regard for
merely securing the facts, regardless of what those facts might
indicate. The second indicator of lack of objectivity was Seidel's
inquiry about "illegal use of taps." This question fits the
classic question of, "When did you stop beating your wife?"
If the Committee is going to be asking questions like this one,
its objectivity is certainly subject to challenge.
As ex- or current employees volunteer to us results
of interviews conducted of them by the SSC, we will carefully
study them for, among other things, additional evidence of the
nature discussed above. If there is a continuation of this
line of questioning or other unjustified comments to Bureau
representatives, we will consider taking up with the Attorney
General the matter of possible protest to the SSC.

This informative memorandum to record highlights of recte Sec'y
information relating to an interview by Senate Select Committee (SSC)
Staff Member of retired SA Alan G. Sentinella, as obtained by
Supervisor Seymor Fred Phillips of the Bureau's Senstudy 75
Special Project.
Pursuant to Bureau instructions, Phillips went to Atlanta,
Georgia, to fulfill the request of Sentinella for the presence of
a Bureau Agent at the time Sentinella was to be interviewed on
5/12/75 by SSC Staff Member Lester B. Seidel. Sentinella is presently
Safety Director, Georgia State University, Atlanta. He has been
retired from the FBI for about four years and in the period around
1964-66 he did work on the investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and for a time, the King case as well as that of King's organization,
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was assigned to him.
Sentinella had been told in advance by Seidel that he was to be
interviewed concerning King and Levison (Stanley David Levison,
former consultant to King who was under Bureau investigation because
of his communist background).
$5/46
Phillips was in Sentinella's private office at 12:24 p.m.
when Seidel arrived. Sentinella explained to Seidel that after
Sentinella had agreed in a telephone conversation with Seidel 5/9/75
to being interviewed, he (Sentinella) contacted the Atlanta FBI
Office because Sentinella was concerned with the sensitivity of the
information he knew about King and Levison and wanted to protect
the confidentiality of his information and the Bureau's interests
especially as pertaining to current investigations, sources, etc..
Sentinella explained to Seidel that the FBI offered to have an Agent
present, not to monitor the interview, but for consultation purposes
should the interview reach into sensitive areas. Sentinella thus
accounted to Seidel for Phillips' presence. At this point Phillips
reiterated the reasons given by Sentinella for the presence of an
FBI Agent and Seidel was told that Phillips' presence was definitely

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: SENSTUDY 75
FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON
ASSIGNED INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
Miami Airport, or whether Whitson had discussed this with anyone.
Whitson advised Epstein that he had not gone to the Miami Office, that
no Agent had met him, and that he had discussed the matter only with
Sullivan. At this point, Whitson asked Epstein how he got the story.
Epstein merely laughed and did not reply to the question.
The foregoing represents the information furnished to
Epstein by Whitson. Whitson made the following additional comments
and observations.
When Sullivan told Whitson he wanted him to fly the package
to Miami, he stated that only he, Sullivan, Mr. Hoover, Mr. Tolson,
and Mr. Belmont knew of this situation. Sullivan never did explain
to Whitson anything more regarding this incident. Sullivan did during
Whitson's anniversary celebration in 1968 in Sullivan's office refer
to Whitson as "a real pro who knows how to carry out an assignment,
and further commented that someday he would tell Lish about the
assignment to which he had referred in his remarks.
Whitson said that when he arrived at the North Terminal
of National Airport, following Sullivan's telephonic instructions,
a young man who was unknown to Whitson but who addressed him as
"Mr. Whitson" turned a package over to him which was wrapped in brown
paper and sealed with sealing tape. It is Whitson's recollection
the package measured approximately 8 inches by 8 inches by 1 inch.
It is Whitson's recollection that at the time the foregoing
occurred, Martin Luther King was either just about to go abroad to
receive the Nobel Peace Prize or probably had already gone abroad.
It was Whitson's further recollection that sometime shortly after
the mailing of the package Sullivan commented to Whitson that the
package had not yet been received by Martin Luther King. Because of
this remark, Whitson is of the belief that the package was mailed
to Martin Luther King at the headquarters of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and not to Mr. King at the latter's home.
Further, it was Whitson's recollection that it was not long after he
had mailed the package that Martin Luther King had a personal meeting
with former Director Hoover in Mr. Hoover's office.
Whitson stated that during the interview Epstein asked
Whitson if he had ever written a memorandum regarding this matter, to
which Whitson replied in the negative. He was also asked by Epstein
if he had ever seen a memorandum on this and Whitson again replied
in the negative. Whitson observed that in his opinion the information
which was in the possession of Epstein prior to his interview with

By memorandum captioned as above submitted earlier today,
I advised you of a telephone call received 4/22/75 from former Special
Agent Whitson. He had called to advise that he had been requested
to appear for interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the
Senate Select Committee.
175
At 2:50 p.m. today (4/23/75) Mr. Whitson called at my office
and said that he had just been interviewed by Mr. Epstein and was
desirous of reporting the results.
Epstein first asked Whitson when he entered the Bureau, when
he first arrived for assignment at Headquarters, to what Headquarters
Division he had been assigned, and when he retired. Epstein then said
that he knew that Whitson had at one time mailed a package to
Mrs. Martin Luther King from Tampa, Florida, and asked Whitson to
relate the details concerning this matter. Whitson thereupon told
him that in the late Summer of 1964 former Assistant to the Director
William C. Sullivan had telephoned Whitson at his home one Saturday
and told him that former Director Hoover wanted Whitson to deliver
a package to Miami, Florida, by plane and on arrival at the Miami
Airport to telephone Sullivan for further instructions. Whitson did
as directed and upon calling Sullivan was instructed to address the
package to Mr. Martin Luther King. Accordingly, Whitson had the
package weighed, put stamps on it, and addressed it to Martin Luther
King (not Mrs. Martin Luther King as Epstein had indicated). The
following day, Sunday, Whitson flew back to Washington. The next day,
Monday, he informed Sullivan that his instructions had been carried
out and Sullivan commented "Someday I will tell you/about that.

62-116-355-145
Epstein asked him who had paid for the stamps to mail the
package and Whitson said that he had probably done so utilizing per
diem money.
Epstein asked whether he had put a return address on the
package and Whitson replied in the negative. Epstein asked if Whitson
had gone to the Miami Office, whether any Agent had met him at the

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: SENSTUDY 75
FORMER SUPERVISOR LISH WHITSON
ASSIGNED INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
Whitson must have originated with W. C. Sullivan. Whitson noted
that Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson are both deceased and that he has heard
nothing indicating Mr. Belmont has been contacted by members of the
staff of the Senate Select Committee. One other factor that causes
him to feel that Sullivan was the source of the information was a
question Epstein raised as to whether Whitson had put a return address
on the package when he addressed it to Martin Luther King. Whitson
said he recalls that when he was in Miami and received the telephonic
instructions from Sullivan, Sullivan told him that he should put a
return address on the package and Whitson pointed out that if he did
so and the name of the addressee became smeared the package would end
up at someone's return address rather than in the dead letter office.
Sullivan concurred that no return address should be used.
Thus,
Sullivan would probably have reason to have commented regarding the
use or nonuse of a return address.
Whitson stated that in the event he is called again to be
interviewed by anyone connected with the Senate Select Committee, he
intended to notify the Bureau beforehand and would appreciate it if
the Bureau would consider having someone present during the interview,
if this could be arranged, since he recognizes an obligation not to
reveal FBI information contrary to regulations issued by the Attorney
General. Appreciation was expressed to Mr. Whitson for his volun-
teering the foregoing information.
This is the first instance which has come to our attention
indicating staff members of the Senate Select Committee are proceeding
with interviews of former Agents. I have discussed this matter with
Mr. Mintz and he and I feel it would be appropriate to furnish an
abstract of the interview of Whitson by Epstein to the Ad Hoc
Coordinating Group of the Intelligence Community in order that
interested agencies will be aware of the procedures presently being
followed by the Select Committee and of the Committee's interest in
matters other than jurisdictional bases. All Committee requests to
us have thus far been confined to the latter.
ACTION:
If approved, an abstract will be provided for the records
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group.

At approximately 2:35 PM, Mr. Allen G.. Sentinella
telephonically advised that he retired from the Atlanta Office in
1971, and is currently employed at Georgia State University,
Atlanta, Georgia. Sentinella said he had just been contacted by
an individual who identified himself as Lester Seidel of the Senate
Select Committee. Seidel desires to interview Sentinella on Monday,
May 12th, concerning the Martin Luther King and Levinson cases.
Sentinella stated that while assigned to the Atlanta Office
he handled the dissemination of information received from informants
during our investigation concerning the communist infiltration of the
SCLC. Sentinella said he recalled very little concerning this
investigation and gave his assurances that he would not divulge any
confidential information.
Sentinella asked whether or not he should retain private
counsel and he was informed if he felt it necessary, he should do so.
He was further informed that his interview was entirely voluntarily
and he had no obligation to submit to interview. Mr. Sentinella gave
his office telephone number as Area Code 404-658-2167, 2168 or
and his home phone number as Area Code 404-475-5327.

to) reports, letters, correspondence, airtels, LHMS, inserts,
executive conference memoranda, 302s, Assistant Director memos,
notes, routing slips, etc." This letter, also on Page 3,
recognizes that the request is substantial but urges the
executive agencies to apply sufficient manpower and attention
to enable prompt responses. Prompt response is defined by the
Committee as having most of the material available within 10
days and all of it shortly thereafter. Mr. O'Connor advised
that he was aware that the imposition of such a condition upon
the responses created an impossible task. He advised that on
Monday, 5/19/75, he would contact SSC Chief Counsel F. A. O.
Schwarz calling attention to this time factor and also the often
broad and ambiguous manner of many of the requests appended
to the May, 14, letter. Mr. O'Connor hopes to negotiate these
requests as well as the conditions attached to the responses
by the SSC to the end that the requests are more narrowly
defined and that the deadline imposed by the Committee be
relaxed to a more realistic time frame.
Pending receipt of results of Mr. O'Connor's inter-
cession with SSC we are proceeding with an analysis of the SSC's
requests and attempting to separate components for specific
assignments to appropriate divisions within FBIHQ so that our
responses may be forthcoming in as coordinated and timely
a fashion as possible.

None. For information purposes.

Attached is a copy of a letter to the Attorney General
dated 5/14/75, from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, U. S. Senate
Select Committee (SSC) with appendices A thru D.
Appendix A, entitled "Documents Pertaining to the
Committee's Prior Requests," consists of 10 requests most of
which have been already responded to or, in the instances of
requests numbers 4, 7, 8 and 9, are the responsibility of the
Department of Justice. Item 6 has been previously referred
to the White House. Appendices B, C, and D, contain numerous
"new" requests which are extremely broad in their definition,
often ambiguous in meaning and contain many instances where
they seem to be parallel to and overlap previous requests.
On 5/16/75, a conference was held in the Intelligence
Division between representatives of the INTD SENSTUDY Staff and
Departmental representatives Messrs. Robert McDermott and
k. William O'Connor. Mr. McDermott is on the staff of the D
Deputy Attorney General and has been active in coordinating
SSC matters. He is being replaced in this capacity on 5/19/75"
by Mr. O'Connor, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil
Rights Division. Mr. O'Connor advised that the Deputy Attorney
General, Judge Tyler and White House representative James
Wilderotter were both greatly concerned about the requests
M
contained in the May, 14, letter. THE 10felt that the requests 42
were much too broad and placed much too great a burden on the
Department and the FBI to be forthcoming. Mr. O'Connor felt PANT
that the requests clearly indicated an intention of the SSC to
gain access to FBI "raw files" while not actually stipulating5
this point. In this regard you will note that Page 3 of the
May, 14, letter defines the SSC request for "memoranda
and other materials" as meaning 'all documents relating to the
subject matter requested and are to include (but are not limited

We recognize, of course, that this is a substantial request.
But the mandate given to the Committee by the Senate is itself very
'broad. We are seeking to perform our duties under that mandate
expeditiously. For us to do so, it is necessary for the Executive
Agencies to apply sufficient manpower and attention to our requests
to enable prompt responses. We hope that you will have a schedule
for response promptly, have most of the material available within
10 days, and all of it shortly thereafter.
The Committee also asks to be advised at once whether the
specific documents presently outstanding from the March 19 request
(see Appendix A, items 1, 2, 6 and 7) will be provided.

The purpose of this letter is to review with you the status
of the Select Committee's outstanding requests to your Department
and to set out several new areas in which the Committee is request-
ing either staff access to documents or copies of documents for its
own files.
In the matter of the outstanding requests the chronology is as
follows:
You will recall that I wrote to you on March 19, setting
out five areas pertaining to the FBI in which the Committee
was initially interested. Although we have had partial
compliance with the request, that process is not yet complete.
In addition, on April 21, Mr. Schwarz, Chief Counsel of
the Committee, met with the Deputy Attorney General about the
March 19 letter and about the establishment of liaison between
your Department and the Committee.
On April 23; Mr. Schwarz wrote to the Deputy Attorney
General a letter reflecting that meeting, clarifying the
March 19 request on the matter of intelligence techniques, and
making a further request pertaining to the Internal Security
Division.
Mr. Schwarz also wrote the Deputy Attorney General and
the FBI Director a memorandum on April 30 requesting that
Committee staff members be permitted access to certain documents
falling within the scope of the March 19 request.
On April 28, I wrote to you concerning the so-called
"Official and Confidential" files of the FBI.

The Committee has not yet received a formal response to those
letters. Appendix A sets out those documents which have not yet
been supplied to the Committee pursuant to the March 19 letter
and follow-up. correspondence.
On the second matter, that is, the request for copies of addi-
tional documents (and for staff access to others), the Committee's
interest falls into roughly three areas pertaining to the activities
of the FBI and the Department of Justice:
"
First, the Committee has been made aware of additional
documents that are analogous to the background requests made
in the First Document Request. These documents are set out
as Appendix B.
Second, the Committee is concerned about several programs
or studies pertaining to specific intelligence or counter-
intelligence activities of the FBI. S. Res. 21 specifically
requires the Committee to investigate "the conduct of domestic
counterintelligence operations against United States citizens"
by the FBI. Therefore, the Committee must conduct an exhaustive
investigation of the so-called "COINTELPRO" programs as well
as miscellaneous other incidents which have come to our attention.
S. Res. 21. also specifically requires the Committee to investi-
gate all aspects of the so-called "Huston Plan". Further
requests pertaining to these matters are set out as Appendix C.
Third, we are interested in allegations pertaining to
electronic surveillance generally, electronic surveillance of
the so-called "17 government officials and journalists" in
1969-71 by the FBI, electronic surveillance and other intelli-
gence activities directed at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and
electronic surveillance and other intelligence activities at
the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey,
in the summer of 1964. Requests pertaining to these subjects
are set out as Appendix D.
In setting out certain specific documents in the Appendices,
the Committee does not change its position that the original request
of March 19 was general in scope and designed to encourage the
Justice Department and the FBI to provide us with documents pertain-
ing to the legal authority and the policy and procedures of the FBI
which have not yet been brought to the attention of the Committee
and were therefore not specifically mentioned in any of its requests.
Furthermore, the Committee intends its requests to be generously
construed so that descriptive words used herein are meant in a general

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel
SUBJECT
DATE: 1-17-01
: Authority of Congress to Release Classified Data
1. I have found no express authority for Congress to publicly release
information classified by the executive branch pursuant to an Executive
order issued by the President. Moreover, on a number of occasions Congress
has mandated that matters pertaining to national defense or foreign policy
be kept secret.
15
--Congress has made it a crime for one lawfully having possession,
`access or control of documents relating to national defense or infor-
mation relating to the national defense which the possessor has
reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States
or to the advantage of any foreign nation to communicate, deliver,
or transmit same to any person not entitled to receive it. 18
US.CA 793(d),
--Congress has made it a crime to disclose to an unauthorized per-
son or publish any classified information obtained by the processes
of communications intelligence. 18 U.S.C.A. 798(a).
--Congress has made it a crime to photograph or sketch vital military
or naval installations or equipment requiring protection against gen-
eral dissemination of information. 18 U.S.C.A. 795. It is also a¨
crime to publish or disseminate photographs, maps, or drawings of
such defense installations without first obtaining permission of the
commanding officer or higher authority. 18 U.S.C.A. 797..
--Congress, in order to prevent public disclosure of certain activities,
has given various officials the power to keep confidential certain funds
expended for national security or foreign relations purposes. Such
authority is given, for example, to the President (22 U.S.C.A. 2364),
to the Secretary of State (31 U.S.C.A. 107), and to the Director of
Central Intelligence (50 U.S.C.A. 403j).

--Congress has provided that meetings of the Senate Committee on
the Budget may be closed to the public if it is determined by a record
vote of a majority of the members that the matter to be discussed
. will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the
interest of national defense or the confidential conduct of
the foreign relations of the United States. 2 U.S.C.A..
190a-3.
--Congress, after requiring that the Secretary of State transmit forth-
with to the Congress the text of any international agreement, other
than a treaty, to which the United States is a party, goes on to pro-
vide that
,any such agreement the immediate public disclosure
of which would, in the opinion of the President, be prej-
´udicial to the national security of the United States shall
not be so transmitted to the Congress but shall be trans-
mitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Rep-
resentatives under an appropriate injunction of secrecy to
be removed only upon due notice from the President.
1 U.S.C.A, 112b.
--Finally, Congress, in enacting the Freedom of Information Act,
expressly exempted from disclosurė matters which are

states in respect to Senators and Representatives that:

not be questioned in any other Place.

On 5/14/75 Mr. Ron L. Jackson, Assistant Chief
Inspector, Office of Security Investigations, USPS, advised
Liaison Officer L.A. Crescioli that Mr. Paul Wallach, staff
member of the SSC, has requested USPS to furnish the
identities of all FBI mail covers placed with the USPS since
1960.
According to Jackson, Chief Postal Inspector William J.
Cotter has informed Wallach that the FBI is the custodian
of such detailed information and that the SSC should there-
fore make this request directly to the Bureau. Mr. Jackson
requested that the FBI consider directing a communication
to Chief Cotter, pointing out that the Bureau does interpose
an objection to the USPS complying with above request and
that the SSC should proceed directly to the FBI in this
regard.
OBSERVATIONS:
1
The request for the identities of all FBI mail covers
since 1960 in effect provides the SSC with the identities
of the subjects of FBI investigations, which includes some
extremely sensitive cases. The intelligence community in
attempting to work out guidelines with the SSC as to
sensitive areas of inquiry have indicated that specific
targets of ongoing intelligence operations should be subject
to negotiation between the SSC staff and the appropriate
agency. The Intelligence Division believes that we should
take a strong stand in this instance and attempt to negotiate
an accommodation which would allow the SSC to carry out its
mission but yet not compromise ongoing FBI sensitive Invesų
tigations.

My memorandum of March 19, 1975, reported discussions
with the attorney for the estate of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who
also represents Mrs. Coretta King and her children. It was clearly
indicated that Mrs. King and her children were concerned about invasion
of personal privacy that might occur should there be disclosure of inquiries
concerning the FBI investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the
conclusion of our conference with the King representatives, Assistant
Attorney General Scalia asked me whether I would be willing to agree to
have Mr. Wachtel notified in the event a congressional committee requested
access to such material in Bureau files. I told him that I saw no difficulty
in the Department advising Mr. Wachtel in the event such a request is made
by a committee of the Congress. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities has initiated inquiries concerning the Bureau's investigation of
Dr. King and though they have not as yet requested material from our files
which may contain tapes of electronic surveillance of Dr. King, it is likely
that their inquiry will reach the stage where such demands will be made.
Therefore, in response to the requests made by Mr. Wachtel
representing Mrs. King and in response to inquiry by Assistant Attorney
General Scalia, it is my view that we should advise the Department of the
nature of the inquiry currently being made by the Senate Select Committee
and to suggest that they may wish to notify the representatives of the King
estate and Mrs. King for whatever action they may deem appropriate.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
by Miss Gandy amounted to one and one-half file drawers. Mohr
subsequently advised Mr. Gitenstein of this correction.
Additionally, Gitenstein desired to know whether an itemized
list of the official and confidential files was made and if so,
where the list was. Mohr told Gitenstein that he was sure a
list was made (subsequently confirmed by Miss Gandy) and that
the list accompanied the official and confidential files.
In addition to the above, Mohr advised that Gitenstein
asked about a requirement of all Bureau employees to turn over
any confidential files in their possession ordered by Mr. Hoover
following the revelation that former Assistant to the Director
Sullivan had turned over certain confidential files to former
Attorney General Mardian. Mohr advised Gitenstein that Mr. Hoover
had in fact levied such a requirement on Bureau employees and
that all confidential files were to be turned over to Mr. Felt
along with a memorandum explaining the nature of these files.
Gitenstein asked Mr. Mohr where these memoranda would be filed.
Mohr responded by saying he presumed they were confidential
memoranda and would have gone with the confidential files turned
over to Mr. Felt by any Bureau employee maintaining such files.

3. A long line of Supreme Court cases, beginning with Kilbourn v.
Thompson, 103 U.S. 168 (1991), has held that the privilege or immunity
relating to speech or debate should be given a broad and liberal construc-
tion. In Kilbourn the court stated:
It would be a narrow view of the Constitutional provision
to limit it to words spoken in debate. The reason of the
rule is as forcible in its application to written reports
presented in that body by its committees, to resolutions
offered, which, though in writing, must be reproduced
´in speech, and to the act of voting.... In short, to things
generally done in a session of the House by one of its
members in relation to the business before it. (At p. 204.)
4. The court, moreover, has resisted arguments that an unworthy
purpose should destroy the privilege. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S.
367 the court reaffirmed its earlier holding in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch
.87 (1810), stating:
...that it was not consonant with our scheme of govern-
ment for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators,
has remained unquestioned. (At.p. 377.)
The distance to which the court was willing to go to uphold this principle
was seen in United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169 (1966). In that case
a former Congressman was convicted for conspiracy to defraud the U.S.,
in part on evidence that, in pursuance of a conspiracy designed to give
assistance to certain savings and loan associations which had been indicted
on mail fraud charges, he was paid to give a speech on the floor of the House.
The Supreme Court granted a new trial holding that a prosecution which
draws in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress
or his motives for performing them "necessarily contravenes the Speech or
Debate Clause." (At p. 185.)
5. The court addressed the issue of classified information in Gravel v.
United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), a case which arose when Senator Gravel,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds of the Senate Public
Works Committee, convened a night meeting of the Subcommittee and there
read extensively from a copy of the Pentagon Papers which bore a Defense
security classification of Top Secret - Sensitive. He then placed the entire
47 volumes of the study in the public record. Senator Gravel claimed that
Article I, section 6 protected him from criminal or civil liability and from

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
The interview of Mr. Mohr began at approximately
10:20 and was concluded at 12:30 p.m. 5/9/75. Mr. Cregar,
who was available in an adjacent room, was not called and
following the interview, Mr. Mohr assured Mr. Cregar that
no sensitive areas were addressed by the Staff Members.
Mr. Mohr did indicate that the Staff Members were in possession
of FBI documents dealing with the Socialist Workers Party as
well as documents obtained by Mr. Carl Stern under the Freedom
of Information Act (these are our COINTELPRO documents which we
were obliged to provide Stern under the FOI). No substantive
questions were directed to Mr. Mohr regarding these documents
but apparently were used to permit Mr. Mohr to identify who
might be the final authority in approving these documents.
As an example, Mr. Mohr noted that in reviewing a sample of
these documents, he voiced the opinion Document A probably
would have been approved by an Assistant Director whereas
Document B might have received the approval of the Director.
Mr. Mohr was unable to identify precisely what documents he
was shown.
It was quite apparent from the interview that the
Staff of the SSC was trying to understand how the flow of
mail proceeded in the FBI under Mr. Hoover's directorship.
A classic example of the Staff Members' confusion was their
inability to distinguish between an SAC letter from a letter
to all SACs. Mr. Mohr attempted to clarify this confusion on
behalf of the Staff Members. With regard to SAC letters, the
Staff Members asked if there was a file on all SAC letters.
Mr. Mohr advised he was not quite sure whether there was a
single file containing all SAC letters.
Members of the Staff also asked Mr. Mohr about his
securing of Mr. Hoover's office after Mr. Hoover's death..
Mr. Mohr told the Committee that the articles which appeared
in "The Washington Star" by columnist Jeremiah O'Leary was an
accurate recording of his securing of Mr. Hoover's office.
Nevertheless the Staff Members desired that Mr. Mohr go over
in considerable detail exactly how he did secure Mr. Hoover's
office following his death.

This memorandum reports the telephonic contact
between former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr and
Mr. Jenkins at which time Mr. Mohr furnished additional information
regarding his meeting with representatives of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC) Staff on the morning of 5/9/75.
In reconstructing his interview on the morning of 5/9/75
by Staff Members Mark Gitenstein, Thomas Dawson and Lester B.
Seidel, Mr. Mohr recalled them asking if he knew who prepared the
'surreptitious letters" the Bureau sent in the Socialist Workers
Party case. Mr. Mohr advised the Staff Members that he did not
know but he presumed somebody in the Document Section of the
"
Laboratory probably prepared these letters. 62-116395-138
REC-100
As reported in my memorandum of 5/9/75, members of the
Staff Committee are hoping that Mr. Mohr will be able to arrange an
interview of Miss Gandy by members of the SSC providing Mr. Mohr
is present. In this regard, Mr. Mohr desired some guidance as to
what he could tell Miss Gandy if Staff Members asked her for the
names of individuals, appearing in the official and confidential
files of Mr. Hoover. Mr. Mohr was telephonically advised on the
afternoon of 5/12/75 by Cregar that the Bureau could not give him
any advice as to what he could tell Miss Gandy recognizing that
whatever he told Miss Gandy was strictly between the two of them
and not of concern or interest to the FBI. It was further pointed
out to Mr. Mohr that neither he nor Miss Gandy should feel under
any obligation to report to the Bureau what Miss Gandy decided in
this regard as well as what she might tell the Staff of the SSC
during her forthcoming interview by them on 5/15/75 MAY 23 1975
**
On the occasion of Cregar's call to Mr. Mohr on the
afternoon of 5/12/75 Mohr recalled that he had told Staff Members
of the SSC Miss Gandy had turned over to Mr. Felt the official and
confidential files amounting to one-half a file drawer. Mr. Mohr
in speaking with Miss Gandy subsequent to his interview on 5/9/75
learned the official and confidential files turned over to Mr. Felt

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
between former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr and repre-
sentatives of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the
morning of 5/9/75.
Memorandum Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams dated 5/5/75
recommended that a Bureau representative be available for consulta-
tion by Mr. Mohr during the time Mr. Mohr is being interviewed by
Staff Members of the SSC 5/9/75. REC-100
62-116395-137
Prior to Mr. Mohr's interview by the Staff of the SSC,
Section Chief William O. Cregar met with him. Mr. Mohr was advised
that should representatives of the Staff pose any questions to him
which could lead to the identification of sensitive sources,
sensitive methods of FBI operations or material derived from other
U. S. agencies or foreign governments, he could decline to answer
such questions until he had an opportunity to consult with a Bureau
representative. Mr. Mohr understood the purpose of Mr. Cregar's.
presence and assured him that should the inquiry by Staff Members
of the SSC get into these areas of inquiry, he would certainly
consult with Cregar prior to responding.
16 MAY
Following our arrival at the New Senate Office Building,
Mr. Mohr and Cregar were met by Staff Members Mark Gitenstein,
Thomas Dawson, and Lester B. Seide 1. As we proceeded to the
office where the interview was to be conducted, Mr. Gitenstein
referred to a previous conference he had with Assistant Director
Wannall at Quantico on 5/5/75 at which Mr. Cregar was present.
Gitenstein observed that this meeting had proved very, very
beneficial and that he believed that future personal contacts.
between members of the Senate Select Committee Staff and the FBI
could prove useful and allow the SSC Staff to better understand
how the FBI was administered at Headquarters.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: *SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
The question of Mr. Tolson's will did arise.
Mr. Mohr advised that Hillory Tolson had not decided whether
he was going to contest the will. According to Mr. Mohr, he
recently had lunch with Hillory Tolson at Mr. Tolson's request
at which time Hillory Tolson suggested he was not going to
contest the will. However, Mr. Mohr had not seen any documentary
evidence of Hillory's decision in this regard.
Finally, the Staff Members asked if Mr. Mohr knew
the whereabouts of Miss Gandy or at least her telephone number.
He told themhhe did know herewhereabouts and telephone number
but promised her he would not reveal them. Mr. Mohr was asked
whether Miss Gandy would be available for interview. Mr. Mohr
advised the Committee that he would attempt to persuade her
to be interviewed providing he, Mr. Mohr, was allowed to be
present during the entire interview. The Staff Members inter-
posed no objection to that arrangement and Mr. Mohr indicated
to Mr. Gitenstein that he would advise him of Miss Gandy's
'desires regarding an interview under the conditions stipulated
above.
Prior to the onset of the interview with Mr. Mohr,
Cregar asked Gitenstein whether a decision would be forthcoming
from the SSC regarding the interviews of former employees of the
intelligence community by Staff Members of the SSC. Gitenstein
stated the the Committee had no problem with the FBI and that if
The White House would not interfere he felt satisfactory arrange-
ments between the FBI and the Select Committee could be worked
out regarding future interviews of former FBI, employees. The
thrust of Mr. Gitenstein's comment as well as his general
demeanor during the meeting suggested the Staff felt they could
work closely with the FBI to the satisfaction of both parties.

When an allegation is received that a group
may fall within existing jurisdictional criteria, FBI
Headquarters is immediately notified and a "preliminary
investigation" along the lines already indicated is
undertaken. Again, approval from FBI Headquarters must
be obtained to continue this "preliminary investigation"
beyond 90 days to resolve whether jurisdictional standards
are met. If met, a full investigation is conducted
upon approval by FBI Headquarters.
Internal security investigations are also
conducted on the basis of specific instructions from
the Attorney General (pursuant to Presidential Directives)
to the Director of the TBI. Until the instruction is
complied with, these matters remain pending.
Every effort is made to maintain proper
administrative control over domestic security investigations
and to insure full compliance with the law. In this
regard, Bureau rules require Agents to limit investigations
to relevant matters. Supervisory personnel in the Field
and at FBI Headquarters review the progress and relevancy
of these investigations, and reports are forwarded to
the Department of Justice. Agents also receive legal
instruction on a continuing basis in order that they
may be fully able to recognize relevance and safeguard
individual rights.
These Bureau procedures have been devised
in an honest effort to carry out with maximum effectiveness
and propriety our vital domestic security responsibilities.
Over the years, the FBI has handled these responsibilities
and protected the domestic security of our Nation with
great dedication and, I believe, with great distinction.
We will continue to vigorously carry out these duties
with all due regard for individual rights and liberties.
I believe the procedures I have outlined are in full
accord with this purpose.

FBI authority to investigate domestic security

Presidential Directives and Executive Orders concerning
internal security and employee loyalty matters.
the Bureau opens, continues, and closes such cases on
the basis of these legal considerations.
Procedurally,
Upon receipt of a fact situation from any

More specifically, domestic security investigations

either as an individual or as a member of a group, acts
to unlawfully alter the Government in violation of the
Smith Act, the Rebellion or Insurrection Statute, the
Seditious Conspiracy Statute, or other related enactments.
Special emphasis is placed on those engaged in violent
furtherance of such illegal acts. A full investigation
continues so long as these indications of illegal activity
exist.
When allegations do not clearly indicate
that activities on the part of an individual fall within
this jurisdictional area, self-imposed regulations require
that a "preliminary investigation" be conducted. This
inquiry consists of obtaining information from established
sources (such as records maintained by police departments,
local governments, and private agencies); informants;
public source information; and FBI records. These investi-

effort is made to distinguish as soon as possible between
legitimate political activity and illegal acts. If
more than 90 days are required to resolve this question,
authority to exceed this period must be obtained from
FBI Headquarters. In seeking this extension, a full
statement must be made of the allegation, the jurisdictional
authority involved, and facts that appear to justify
the continuance.

The FBI opens, continues pending investigation, and closes
domestic security cases based on legal considerations. The Bureau is charged
with the investigation of violation of numerous criminal statutes, as well as
duties imposed by Presidential Directives and Executive Orders concerning
internal security and employee loyalty matters.
The procedure for handling such investigation is dictated by
the facts and circumstances of each case. Upon receipt of a fact situation from
any of a myriad of sources, the Agent must necessarily make a judgment to
determine whether these facts reasonably indicate an activity falling within
the scope of the FBI's jurisdiction.
Domestic security investigations are initiated regarding individuals
when allegations establish that he, individually or as an active group member,
acts to unlawfully alter the Government in violation of the Smith Act, the
Rebellion or Insurrection Statute, the Seditious Conspiracy Statute, or other
related enactments. Special emphasis is placed on those practicing action
or violence in furtherance of their goal. If the allegation shows facts clearly
within the scope of these statutes, a full investigation is conducted and continues
so long as facts exist to indicate a reasonable possibility that these ends could
be achieved.
In some instances, allegations regarding the individual do not
clearly fall within the scope of authority. Self-imposed restraining regulations
require that such inquiry be limited to a "preliminary investigation" consisting
of contacts for informational purposes only with established sources, such as
police bureaus, records departments of local governments, and private record
sources; informants; public source information; and Bureau records. These
investigations are limited to 90 days. An earnest effort is made to distinguish
as soon as possible between mere unorthodox political views or dissent on the
one hand and revolutionary and/or criminal activity on the other. If to exceed
90 days, a report is made to FBI Headquarters specifically stating the allegation,
the jurisdictional authority and such facts as would justify continuance of the
investigation. A concurrence of Headquarters is necessary for continuance.
When an allegation is received that a group may fall within the
jurisdictional criteria, Headquarters is immediately notified and investigation
is limited to the "preliminary investigation" as described above. Any investi-

questioning elsewhere than in the Senate, with respect to the events occur-
‘ring at the Subcommittee hearing at which the Pentagon Papers were intro-
duced into the public record. The court stated: ".../T/o us this claim is
incontrovertible." (At p. 615.)
6. The court further noted that:
The Speech or Debate Clause was designated to assure
a co-equal branch of the government wide freedom of
speech, debate, and deliberation without intimidation
or threats from the Executive Branch. It thus protects
Members against prosecutions that directly impinge
upon or threaten the legislative process. We have no
doubt that Senator Gravel may not be made to answer--
either in terms of questions or in terms of defending
himself from prosecution--for the events that occurred
at the subcommittee meeting. (At p. 616.)
7. From the above, together with the positive phrasing of Article 1,
§ 6 of the Constitution, it would appear that any Member may make any state-
ment he desires on the floor of the Congress or in one of its committees. Such
statement shall be absolutely privileged, notwithstanding that it was based
on information secured from classified Central Intelligence Agency material
either furnished the Member in confidence or containing any restrictive
notice as to use or dissemination. This privilege would operate if the Member
were to read the information verbatim into the record on the floor or into
the record of hearings before a congressional committee. It would still be
privileged when it appeared, verbatim, in the Congressional Record or in
the published hearings of a congressional committee. The only sanction,
apart from the individual conscience and sense of responsibility of the Member,
would have to come from Congress itself, which has the power to discipline
any Representative or Senator who improperly disclosed classified information.
8. One additional wrinkle might be noted. Although Congressmen
would be immune from liability for introducing classified information into
a committee report and immune from liability for ordering it printed and
disseminated to the public at large, the Public Printer and the Superintendent
of Documents may not be immune from suit for printing and disseminating
such reports to the public. The court examined this question in Doe v.
McMillan, 412 U.S. 306(1973), a case in which petitioners claimed that a
report issued by the House Committee on the District of Columbia, containing

internal security and employee loyalty matters.
The procedure for handling such investigation is dictated by

gation beyond that is made only upon approval by Headquarters. If such
continuance is approved, investigation continues to resolve whether juris-
dictional standards are met. If met, and Headquarters' approval obtained, a
full investigation is conducted.
Apart from these situations, specific instructions from the Attorney
General, pursuant to Presidential Directives, to the Director of the FBI concerning
matters of internal security are the basis for investigations. Until the instruction
is complied with, these matters remain pending.
Bureau rules require an Agent to limit investigations to relevant
matters. Field office and Headquarters supervisors review the progress and
relevancy of investigations and reports are forwarded to the Department of
Justice. The FBI is ever aware of and controlled by court decisions interpreting
the law. Agents receive continuing legal instruction in order to recognize relevance
and the rights of persons under the law.
These regulatory procedures are the means by which the FBI
implements the responsibilities imposed by the statutes, Presidential Directives,
and orders of the Attorney General. An examination of the domestic security problems
confronting this Nation would reveal that, as early as 1936, concern arose over
"Fifth Column" activities of Communists and Fascists and continued through WW II.
This concern has evolved to other threats, through the years, such as the
foreign-dominated Communist influence in America during the Cold War,
the Ku Klux Klan's interference with the rights of others, the turbulent
anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the urban ghetto riots, and the rise of the
racially-oriented organizations preaching revolution and their more violent
splinter groups practicing open guerrilla warfare. The FBI, charged by statute
and supplemented by Directives to investigate such matters in order to fulfill
the duty, promulgated the investigative procedure for a dual purpose. The
FBI recognizes not only the duty to investigate, to preserve the Constitution,
but the fact the Constitution delineates zones of privacy and individual liberties.
These regulatory procedures speak reasonably to both.

The following is to delineate individual responsibiliti
and assignments for securing the information requested by the SSC
Because the request covers areas of operations affecting all
Divisions of the Bureau except Office of Planning and Evaluation
(OPE), it will be necessary that the very closest coordination and
maximum of cooperation be effected in order to implement the SSC
request.

In handling this request which deals primarily with th
furnishing to the SSC of various Sections of the Manual of
Instructions and Manual of Rules and Regulations as well as info
mation concerning our filing system, and particularly copies of a
Bureau forms, we should bear in mind that there are available
three options for consideration. One, is to give the requested
information or documents. Two, is to not furnish the documents
but merely permit their review at FBIHQ. A third option availabl
is to set forth justifying data to support a denial of furnishing
the information or documents. Of course, in furnishing any docu-
ments, we should bear in mind the option of excising sensitive
information.

Inspector John B. Hotis and I met with Frederick Schwarz, General
Counsel to the Senate Select Committee, Committee staffers Burt Wides,
Pat Shea and Mike Madigan, and CIA representatives Marvin Smith and
Walter Lloyd.
I arranged to attend this conference in an effort to resolve with
the Committee staff the procedures that would be followed during interviews
of current and former FBI employees by staff representatives. Interviews
have been conducted in the recent past by representatives of the Committee,
and in the absence of any general understanding as to the procedures we
have been advising those persons coming to our attention as prospective
witnesses that they may request the presence of a Bureau representative
during the interview. Committee staff members have objected to the
presence of Bureau representatives and have insisted that the interviews
proceed in the absence of any agency representative.
EXT
REC-35
62-116375-137
At the outset of the meeting today, it became clear that Schwarz,
speaking for the members of the Senate Select Committee and for the staff,
was opposed to the presence of agency representatives during interviews
concerning matters which they described as "abuses." Schwarz explained
that the Committee has a responsibility to look into allegations of misconduct
or abuse in addition to a broader study of the jurisdiction and operations
of the intelligence community. He said that while there would be a willingness
on their part to have agency representatives present during interviews concern-
ing general inquiries regarding jurisdiction, they felt that it would be
improper and would interfere with the integrity of their investigation³ 11975
third parties were present during interviews concerning misconduct...

Memorandum to Mr Adams
Mi
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.
Schwarz offered as an alternative that the agencies would be
advised of the identity of persons to be interviewed and that prior to
the interview the agency would contact the witness to explain the authority,
the security arrangements made by the Committee for the protection of
information, to authorize the witness to answer questions where the
witness was bound by a secrecy agreement, and to caution the witness
concerning matters of a sensitive nature which should be deferred for
discussion with members of the Committee or with the Chairman of the
Committee.
I pointed out to Schwarz that unless the FBI was given notice
as to the specific subject matter of the interview to be conducted, we would
find it most difficult to intelligently assess the sensitivity of the information
that might be furnished by the witness. The CIA representatives expressed
great alarm that an interview could disclose information without some
prior assessment of the potential damage to intelligence collection techniques
and sources.
As to these points, Schwarz stated that he would discuss with the
members of the Committee a revision of their initial proposal that
would include notice to the agency of the identity of a person to be interviewed
plus a generic description of the subject matter of the interview followed by
a contact by the agency with the prospective witness to assess the sensitivity
of the information and to advise the witness of areas of inquiry that must be
deferred for special handling by designated members of the Committee or
of the Committee staff. Following that contact the Committee representative
would proceed to conduct the interview with the understanding that the agency
representative would be near-by and immediately available for consultation
should the witness have concern as to the degree of sensitivity of
information he was being asked to furnish. At the conclusion of the
interview, the Committee would make available to the agency a summary
of the notes taken during the interview but a transcription of the interview would
not be made available either to the agency or to the witness interviewed.
Schwarz stipulated that there may be occasions when the Committee
would reserve its right to interview an individual, whether a current employee
or a former employee, in secret in order to protect the interview or to insure
the completeness and accuracy of his information. I asked Burt Wides
whether they had any basis for that concern and he indicated that they
did have such a basis, but declined to specify the details.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee
Inspector Hotis asked whether the on-going interviews
would be delayed pending resolution of the differences concerning
procedures. Schwarz replied that the interviews will proceed due to
time factors. I then requested Schwarz to expedite his discussion
with the members of the Committee, to state their proposals in writing
in order that we could review them in specific detail, and to let me
know as somas their proposal as approved by the Committee was available
for discussion. He agreed to do so and said that probably this could
be accomplished by Thursday, May 8, 1975.
OPINION
It was my impression in dealing with Schwarz that he is making
an honest effort to conduct the Committee inquiry reasonably and that he
is concerned about the public acceptance of the Committee's final product.
His concerns about the integrity of the investigation are similar to those
that Ewould express about an FBI investigation. His insistence that
interviews of individuals concerning possible misconduct be done alone
with the witness appear to me to be reasonable to insure the integrity
of their investigation. The compromise we discussed (they would identify
the witnesses to us prior to interview and tell us the proposed subject
matter of the interview and allow us to consult with the witness prior to
interview) seems to be a practical solution to our mutual problem. This
solution is not as acceptable to CIA due to their greater need for
protection of their covert operations, sources and methods. The Committee
has available to it the subpoena power, the authority to conduct public
hearings, and a good deal of support by public opinion. Therefore, I
conclude that the Committee is likely to discover the full details of
events concerning which they inquire whether the FBI cooperates or
appears to be reluctant. As to those areas of legitimate concern because
of their sensitivity in terms of production of informants or sources and
methods of gathering national security intelligence, the Bureau can
properly expect an opportunity to provide protection for the information.
If the procedures suggested above are operated in good faith
on both sides, the Bureau would be given notice as to the subject matter
to be discussed prior to the interview and research could disclose the
areas of sensitivity and appropriate action taken to caution the witness
against disclosure of such information.

This morning the Director asked me to inquire into the status
of our understanding with the Senate Select Committee as to whether FBI
representatives would or would not be present at interviews of former
Bureau employees or current Bureau employees. The Director was
concerned that the presence of a Bureau representative could be criticized
as an attempt to interfere with the Committee's inquiries. I assured the
Director that the purpose of such representatives being present was to
assist the interviewer and the witness in determining areas of inquiry
of particular sensitivity or that might concern a current Bureau operation.
The Director agreed that such was an appropriate reason for the presence
of a Bureau representative and asked me to consider preparing a letter
addressed to Senator Church stating our desire to make available a Bureau
representative and the reasons for the presence of such a Bureau representative.
As a result of a conference with representatives of CIA,
Roderick Hills of the White House Counsel staff, and others, it was
determined that Walter Lloyd of the CIA Legal Staff would continue
negotiations with the Committee in behalf of the entire intelligence
community to develop procedures concerning the interview of witnesses
and the presence of agency representatives at such interviews. Mr. Lloyd
was scheduled to meet with Frederick Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee,
on Tuesday, May 6, 1975, to discuss such arrangements.

I scheduled an appointment with the Deputy Attorney General
and met with him at 5:00 p.m. on May 5, 1975, accompanied by
Inspector John B. Hotis. I told the Deputy of our concern that the
interviews by the Senate Committee are continuing even though no
understanding has been reached by the Committee and the intelligence
community. I told the Deputy that the Director would like to have some

documents relating to disciplinary problems of certain specifically named
students, violated statutory, constitutional and common-law rights to pri-
vacy. The Supreme Court refused to determine whether dissemination to
the public would serve the important legislative function of informing the
public concerning matters pending before Congress for the purpose of
holding Members of Congress liable. However, it remanded the case to
the Court of Appeals, in part to undertake just such a review in order to
· determine whether the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents.,
who were without blanket immunity, could be held liable..
9. The discussion thus far has dealt only with congressional immunity
for releasing classified information in Congress. No such immunity exists
in the case of disclosures made by congressmen outside of Congress. Thus,
in Long v. Ansel, 69 F.2d 386 (Ct. App., D.C. 1934), affd. 293 U.S. 76
(1934), and in McGovern v. Martz, 182 F. Supp. 343 (US Dist. Ct., D.C..
1960) it was held that if a Senator or Representative is alleged to have com-
mitted libel by republishing and disseminating remarks made in the Congress,
such republication and dissemination is not within the Speech or Debate
privilege even if such privilege would have been applicable to the original
publication of the remarks. Again, in Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606
(1972), and in Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306 (1973) the court noted that
the Speech or Debate Clause does not protect "à private republication of
documents introduced and made public at a committee hearing, although the
hearing was unquestionably part of the legislative process."
10. From the above it is apparent that a Member is not privileged to
circulate CIA documents to his constituents, to the press, or by reading to
a meeting or on radio or television. Such action could well make the member
liable for prosecution under the espionage laws, but in any event would
expose him to the same liability for these actions as any other citizen. As
a practical matter, however, the prosecution of a Member for unauthorized
disclosure of classified CIA material, or disciplinary action by Congress
itself, is very unlikely.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
formal understanding with Senator Church as to the Bureau's position
in regard to such interviews. I reminded the Deputy that our sole concern
was to make a representative available to assist in the interviews
in the event they touched upon sensitive areas and by no means was our
interest to be understood to be an effort to interfere with the Senate
Committee's inquiries.
The Deputy said he fully understood our position and agreed.
He asked me whether I would be willing to agree to hold off on formal
notification to Senator Church until the negotiations to be conducted by
Mr. Lloydc could be concluded. I told the Deputy I would agree to that
on the condition that I and also Inspector Hotis would participate in the
discussions by Lloyd with the Committee representatives. The Deputy
Attorney General said that he fully concurred in my condition and if there
developed any difficulty in making such arrangements, he would assist
in seeing that it was accomplished.
Inspector Hotis advised that Schwarz, the Committee counsel,
has arranged a meeting on Wednesday morning, May 7, 1975, with
Assistant Attorney General Scalia of the Office of Legal Counsel of the
Department. We will also be represented at that meeting.
The Deputy Attorney General told me that he had been advised
by Schwarz that a former Bureau Agent, Leo Clark, had objected to the
fact that a Bureau representative had contacted him and had indicated a
willingness to be present during Clark's interview by the Committee.
I again assured the Deputy that our sole purpose in contacting Clark was
to be available in the event a Bureau representative was needed to discuss
matters of a sensitive nature or matters concerning current Bureau operations.
The Deputy said he understood and Clark's complaint was likely the result
of a misunderstanding.

At 5:05 p.m. on May 6, 1975, I went to the White House
to meet with Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; Roderick Hills,
Associate Counsel; James Wilderotter, Assistant Counsel; Assistant
Attorney General Scalia, Office of Legal Counsel in the Department;
John Clark, Associate to the Director of CIA; Walter Lloyd and Marvin
Smith of CIA. The meeting was called by Mr. Buchen to discuss the
developments that day with regard to the proposal that agency representa-
tives would be present during interviews conducted by investigators of the
Senate Select Committee staff.
At a meeting held earlier that day, the General Counsel of the
Senate Select Committee had indicated that the Committee disapproved of the
presence of agency representatives at interviews concerning alleged
"abuses." I explained to Mr. Buchen the alternative proposal offered by
F.A. O. Schwarz to the effect that agencies would be furnished the identities
of proposed witnesses, the subject matter of the proposed interviews,
and permitted an opportunity to review the subject matter and consult with
the witness to advise him of sensitive areas that would require special
treatment. John Clark agreed that in regard to interviews concerning
abuses, it would seem to be necessary for the Committee to proceed with the
interview without an agency representative present. After general
discussion of the proposal by Schwarz, the meeting concluded with
instructions by Mr. Buchen to Wilderotter to draft a statement that might
be incorporated into a letter to be addressed to the Committee explaining
the Administration's position.
The elements of the proposal would be that as a general
rule, agency representatives would be present during interviews concerning
matters that were not categorized as abuses and in those exceptional cases

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
where abuses would be the subject of interviews, the agencies would be
given prior notice of the identities of the witnesses and of the subject
matter of the interview, plus an opportunity to consult with the witness
prior to the interview. Mr. Buchen also asked that the Committee be
requested to provide a letter in each instance identifying the alleged abuse
as the subject of the interview and indicating Committee approval of
that inquiry. The objective of such a requirement would be to clearly
identify those interviews characterized as "abuses" interviews which would
require the absence of an agency representative during the actual interview.
I was also asked to contact Schwarz to insure that he would not
present to the Committee his counterproposal during the regular committee
meeting on Wednesday, May 7, 1975. The purpose of such a request was
to avoid the Committee adopting a final proposal regarding interviews
prior to the Executive having an opportunity to express its position.
On the morning of May 7, 1975, we spoke with Schwarz, requested
him to refrain from offering his counterproposals to the Committee for
approval, and in response to his request explained to him that the reason
was that the proposals were under discussion and it was necessary for all
agencies in the intelligence community to be involved in the determination
whether the alternative procedures would be acceptable. Mr. Schwarz
agreed to refrain from offering his counterproposals to the Committee today.
At approximately 10:25 a.m. on May 7th, I called Wilderotter
and asked what the progress of his preparation of the proposed letter was.
He told me that there would be no letter addressed to the Committee because
the White House did not desire to escalate this matter and go over the head
of the Committee counsel. I told him that I was extremely concerned at
the inaction which has resulted thus far in FBI being in an indefensible
position in regard to interviews of former employees. I explained to
him that the Committee has not advised us of the interviews that have been
conducted and we have learned of them only by calls from the witnesses.
I told him that the interviews are still continuing because at the meeting
on May 6, 1975, we expressly requested the Committee counsel to dis-
continue the interviews temporarily until guidelines could be established
and the Committee/expressly refused to do so.

I told Wilderotter that this morning I received a call from

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
There was a general consensus of opinion at the meeting with the
other agencies of agreeing that they would await the development of the
position paper by Wilderotter. Walter Lloyd advised that another meeting
with Schwarz and the Committee staff would be scheduled for Thursday,
May 8, 1975.
Upon my return to my office, Wilderotter called me to report
that he had been unsuccessful in having the Mohr interview postponed and
further that Schwarz had advised him that he now feels that it would be
inappropriate for agency representatives to be present at any interviews
whether they concerned abuse or whether they concerned general matters,
and further that he felt that it would be inappropriate for the agency to be
advised of the subject matter prior to the interview.
At that point, Mark Gittenstein joined the conversation with Schwarz &
Wilderotter and advised Wilderotter that he intended to interview Mohr
concerning "procedures and how paper moved in the Hoover days,"
and this would constitute 90% of the interview. The remaining 10% of the
interview would concern Hoover's "O.C. Files." Further Gittenstein
mentioned that he was aware that John Mohr is the Executor of Mr. Tolson's
estate and he may inquire concerning that matter.
Wilderotter said that there would be no further contact with the
Committee concerning the Mohr interview and that we should assume the
Mohr interview will proceed as scheduled. He said that he would suggest
the Bureau contact Gittenstein to discuss any further details regarding the
subject matter of the interview of Mohr and that we consider discussing
with Mohr prior to the interview matters that he should not discuss with
Gittenstein. He also suggested that we debrief Mr. Mohr at the completion
of the interview.
I reminded Mr. Wilderotter that there are no guidelines by which
the White House or the intelligence community or the Senate Committee have
agreed that the FBI should make such arrangements with the witness. I
told him that I thought that the FBI would be used as a test case both by
the Committee and by the intelligence community if we undertook to
negotiate such matters directly with Gittenstein. I told him that I thought
that such direct negotiations would undermine the effectiveness of current

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
of FBI matters, in which Mohr told me that he has been called to be interviewed
at 10:00 a. m. on Friday, May 9, 1975, at Room G-308 in the New Senate
Office Building. Mark Gittenstein was identified as the interviewer.
I told Wilderotter this concerned me because we have no basis on which
to advise Mr. Mohr as to the appropriate guidelines that may be followed
during the course of such an interview and in the absence of knowledge of
the subject matter of the interview we have no way of counseling him as to
sensitive areas that should be deferred for discussion with members of
the Committee or with the Chairman of the Committee.
Wilderotter said he understood myy concern but he saw no way
in which the matter could be resolved in time for guidelines to be
established for the Mohr interview. He told me he would work on the
preparation of a position paper to be used by the White House and the
intelligence community to establish a policy that could be discussed with
the Committee.
Inspector Hotis and I then at approximately 11:10 a.m. went
to a conference already in session in the office of Assistant Attorney General
Scalia attended by representatives of the CIA, Department of Defense,
NSA, Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. The other
agencies were advised of the results of the meeting with the Senate Select
Committee staff on May 6, 1975, and a general discussion ensued as to
the willingness of the agencies to agree to interviews in the absence of
agency representatives. The representatives of the State Department,
Mr. Hitchcock and Mr. Jennings, indicated that State was adamant that
interviews would not be conducted in the absence of representatives.
I spoke privately with Assistant Attorney General Scalia and
advised him of my conversation with Wilderotter and of the fact that
John Mohr had been called for interview on Friday, May 9, 1975. I
told him of my great concern that Mohr's interview would be sensitive
because of his broad knowledge of the Bureau and told him that it was
essential that appropriate guidelines be developed concerning such inter-
views as soon as possible. Scalia told me that he had just finished
speaking with Wilderotter and he ashared my concern. He then
called Wilderotter and subsequently advised me that Wilderotter said
that he, Wilderotter, would immediately contact Schwarz to request at
postponement of the interview of John Mohr pending the establishment
of guidelines. In the event he would be unsuccessful, Roderick Hills and
Philip Buchen would discuss the matter with Senator Church and Senator Tower.
