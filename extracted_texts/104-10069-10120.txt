1. Enclosed are three names provided by George Hauer
of Cleveland, Ohio. These apparently are the leaders of the
Cuban group which you and I have discussed in some detail.
For the record, (Hauer got in touch with me because we had
some rather extensive debriefing sessions in 1959, and
apparently he prefers to continue that relationship for the

of a small group which is shuttling back and forth to Cuba

from our discussions, they are seeking help in the form of

without some measure of control by our Agency, and he
agreed to provide the names for Agency consideration.
third man on the list is in Cuba at the present time.

present position of recruiting executive personnel for
Ernst & Ernst he could be quite useful to the Agency.
