Yolanda Díaz on the telephone as a follow-up on her telegram to ask
Ramiro Abreu to expedite her request for the re-entry permit. L/4 told
Kowton that Yolanda explained that she had been unable to contact Abreu
at first but finally got to him on 8/3/68 and he promised to do what he
could sconest, although he commented that it would beimpossible to do
anything over the week-end.
5. LIRING/4 also reported to howton that she had talked briefly with srta
Esperón of L/2's office and was surprised to hear her complain of the "in-
supportable" conditions under which she had to work. Erta Esperón said
that she had been exployed in the LIRING offices for the past 38 years and
prior to the revolution had been relatively happy. Lately, however, every-
thing was full of mystery, all doors and cabinets locked up, and nobody
trusving anyone. Que conlloed in 1/4 that she had had enough ("harta") and
was afraid that she would have to leave, abandoning any hope the still had
of getting her pension after so many years.

by Rodolfo Reyes. L/3 then exclaimed: "Ch, you mean selor Harris." to
which 1/2 replied in the affirmative. L/3 then explained that he felt that
sr. Harris was a high-minded revolutionary with high level contacts through-
out the world developed through his cusiness ExAINCIg relationships who baa
helped him a great deal over the past two years both financially and morally
* then asked 1/2 at : : 1195 £ional business, to vich L/2
repiled that he knew practically nothing, 1/3 told nowten that he then
closed in with a schewhat elaborate explanation of how international busie
nessmen acquire valubable bits of intelligence with trying as a result of
the sensitive relacionship they detelop with political personalities in
various governments. L/3 stated to howton that he felt 1/2 was impressed
favorably with his explanation, since he finally stated that in reality
"they" (meaning himself, Sergio Martinez, Ismail Suarez de la Faz and
Cepeda), the Consejo Euperior de la Embajada" had nothing against sr. Harris
but simply that they did not know enough about him. L/2 then stated that :
L/3 must realize that the revolution was surrounded by provocateurs and
that when they have the least suspicions that they rust put on "the amber
light" of caution. L/3 then stated that his dealings with sr. Harris were
sensitive high-level business negotiations for the procurement of sulphur
and that he could produce documents to prove this. L/2 replied thatthis
was not at all necessary and that it was simply just a question of knowing
a little more about the sources available to L/3 and about the "Greek". L/3
conluded with a statement that 1/2 must in the last analysis weigh the en-
tire affair in terms of whether L/3 in fact had ever done anything against
the revolution. 1/2 replied without hesitation that everyone felt that I/3
had always acted in good faith and had the best of intentions. It was simpl;
that they felt that L/3 might have become a victim of a provocateur without
realizing it.
4. L/2 then stated that he had no objection to giving L/4 an entry permit
but he hoped that 1/3 was not just trying to solve a domestic problem by
sending her back to her mother. L/3 replied that there was in fact a serious
domestic problem and confessed that he had had an affair with another woman.
which L/4 had discovered but he felt this was a very personal problem about
which 1/2 should not be concerned. L/2 replied that he agreed with this and
was concerned simply about the child whe 88 he felt L/4 should be permitted
to take with her. L/3 told Rowton that he finally conceded to L/2 that per-
haps he was right and that he should be more considerate of L/4 and permit
her to take the child to lavana. L/3 told Rowton that the meeting with L/2
ended on a rather cordial note and that he had the impression that L/2 would
grant 1/4 the re-entry permit without further delay.

Miscellaneous Information Furnished by LIMING/4.
1
1. At his meeting with LI.ING/4,on the morning of 1 March, 1968, Rowton
asked L/4 for various miscellaneous information that might be of use to
the Station. L/4 recalled that when she worked in the Consulate office,
the combination of the safe was as follows:
4 times to right, stopping at 10,
3 times to left, stopping at 65,
2 times to right, stoppingat 75,
then turn to left until one can feel tumbler drop in place.
2. L/4 also furnished nowton with information for the attached sketch of
the consular office where she formerly worked, indicating the location of
the safe (in the corner concealed behind a wooden door locked by key). Like-
wise 1/4 gave details of the office Abelardo Curbelo which she stated he
sheared with his new secretary, Conchita the wife of the Olympic Attaché.
-
3. L/4 also told howton that she learned recently from Jorrín that all
confidential papers are now handled and processed by one person. 1/4 added
that she learned from conversation with MercededMartinez Moreno de Gonzalez.
that she is in fact the person handling the confidential documents. She
stated to L/4 that she has to process the confidential papers of all the
offices, specifically Curbelo, Cicard, Luna, as well as her husband's, (Cruz)
and Martinez'. L/4 explained to ãostonthat previously each office handled
its own confidential documents, and filed them in their respective safes.
4. L/4 also gave Rowton the form given her by the Consulate to be filled in
for the "Registro de Ciudadano. Cubanos". L/4 explained that she alleged
that she had lost the original form give n to her and thus obtained another
so that she could provide Rowton with a sample of the form attached here-
with).
5. L/4 also reported that, as Rowton had requested, she typed out a letter to
her father (given to the Station) at 1330 on 1 March, 1958, on the consulate
typewriter. She regretted not having been able to obtain the name of the
typewriter since it was not visible on the case. When she asked Adis E.
Lopez de Valdes the name the latter surprised her be saying that L/4 was
the second person to ask for such information that day. In view of that
comment, L/4 felt she could not press for the information desired.

!
1. At 0930 on 27/2/68 LIRING/3 reported to nowton that he had spoken
briefly to Echemendia (mail Suarez de la Paz) on 24/2/68 and to LIRING/2
at some length on 26/2/66 in the LIMING offices. L/3 explained to morton
that Echemendía had passed a message to him through 1/4 that he wanted to
talk to him and that he would telephone himto arrange a meeting. 1/3 con-
tinued that Schenendía finally con acted him by phone at about noon on
24/2/68 and asked him to come to the KING office that afternçon. L/3
told Rowton that when he finally saw Echenendía the latter was very vague
and general in his statements and that all he could gather from his state-
ments was that Echemendia was apologetic for the "isunderstanding" that
bad arisen as a result of L/4's request for a re-entry permit. Echemendia
stated that "we" are concerned that 1/3, whom they considered ponest and
above reproach in his dealings with PERUMEN might have fallen victen to
unscupluous elements who constantly surround the revolution. L/3 confessed
to Rowtn that this vague and almost inccherent line of Echemendia annoyed
him to such an extent that he felt it useless to continue his conversation
with him and as a result terminated it at the first opportunity.
2. LIKING/3 continued thathe net with LIRING/2 on 26/2/68 at the latter's
office with much more fuitful results. According to L/3, L/2 began by
stating that "they" appreciated the information L/3 had passed to them at
various times in the past, specifically the report of Julian Lopez' arrest,
the proposed publication of the airest in the Guatemalan press, the report
concerning the letter of Rico Galán and the Crozco afair, but they were
frankly perflexed with regard to the source of such sensitive information.
L/3 told Rowton that he explained to 1/2 that he had excellent Central Ame-
rican contacts, as well as Mexican sources in good positions, who could fur-
nish such information witout naming anyone. He told 1/2 that he had no in-
tention of jeopardising his business contacts by revealing their identity,
and as felt that what he had done was in the interest of 2 BAUMEN and the
revolution, and that L/2 and his friends should not lock a gift horse in the
mouth and see spies behind every blade of xxixx grass, just becasue they
themselves had no capability to check out his reports.
3. 1/3 then told howton that 1/2 asked directly aboot "el Griego" and his
relationship to L/3. 1/3 stated that he feigned surprise and asked that
Gréek”, adding that he knew several Greeks in Guatemala, Venezuela and Ne-
xico. 1/2 clarified by stating that he meant the Greek introduced to him

LIRING/4 Report of Conversation with LIRING/2.
1. LIKING/4 reported to Rowton at 1045 on 24 February, 1963,
that
she
had again spoken to HIRING/2 about her entry permit to return to Havana.
She appeared depressed and began the conversation stating that she was
"fed up" (cabta) with the LIKING office, explaining that she felt that
she had been treated very unfairly and shabbily, particularly by LIRING/2.
She stated that she had waited for several hours to see LIMING/2 on the
mroning of 23 February inside the premises of the LIKING offices but had
finally to leave after only a few words of conversation with him. She
related that LI.ING/2 and LIKING/O were occupied in conversation with
Eugenia Clguin (who had recently returned from a three-months stay in
havana with he sister Marcela) and she did not feel it proper to inter-
rupt to ask about her permit to return to Cuba. when she finally button-
holed LIRING/2, he said that he would rather talk to her the following
morning about 1000, since it was Saturɛday, explaining that be was very
busy with a number of difficult cases.
-
2. LIRING/4 continued that when she returned to his office about 1015 the
following morning ( 24 February) she again had to wait about 15 zinutes
before finding LIRING/2 alone. To her annoyance he again brushed her off,
stating that he still did not have a final answer since the matter had not
as yet been taken up by the "consejo superior" of the establishment. L/2
continued that he hoped to have some sort ɗf decision by Monday and asked
1/4 to see him again. 1/4 stated to Rowton that she could not contain her
feelings any longer and exploded in a burst of invective again the LIKING
office, accusing them among other things of giving visas to all sorts of
hippies and delinquents and making her wait on pins and needles 'when she
had a right to return. L/4 then stated that just as she was leaving, she
turned to 1/2 and said:"Ch, I forget to tell you, but I managed to see the
"Greek+'" 1/4 told Rowton that at this L/2 came suddenly back to life and
invited her into his office again, closing the door and ushering her to
a chair. She then stated that she had telephoned "the Greek" (Horton) on
the pretext that she wanted him to buy some jewelry for her on his next
trip to Switzerland and succeeded in having coffee with him at samborns.
She continued that in the course of conversation she learned that his tele-
phone is actually an answering se vice and hence operates 24 hours per day,
and that he is interested in buying sulphur in Mexico and that his principal
client is the Greek shipowner, Niarchos. She then showed 1/2 a matchbox on
which the Greek had written the name Niarchos in both Greek and English

1. IIBING/4 signed contract with Rowton (alias) effective 15 February
through 30 April, 1968, providing payment for information and services.
No obligations specified other than financial (total $750.00 for period
specified). LIRING/4 also signed acknowledgement of alias "María Barra-
gán" which was used in contract and receipts for funds.
2. L/4 departure which originally scheduled for 16 February 1968, will
be delayed until following Fridgy to permit intensive commo; and security
training, and strengthen backstop for objective of trip. On 12 February
LIRING/2 told 1/4 that he would issue permit to return and, in expression
apparently genuine sympathy, ursed her take trin and no

who met L/4 by chance inside iIRIng compound remarked he happy to learn
she going back home for a trip and then added "дc back and stay2. Eg them
invited her to lunch or dinner but 1/4 felt it wise to turn his down first
time. They had lunch inxiè« LIRING dining room. On Routon suggestion she
will, however, accept for outside lunch so sound him out further on his
reaction to her return.
3. Simultaneously in order build up conviction in minds LIZING officials

herself stated to Rowton that she hesitated to reveal to anyone), HIRING/3.
talked with LIRING/2 in his office 13 February (at moment L/4 elsewhere
in LIRING offices) and pretended to have just learned of 1/4's request for
permission to return. L/3 in angry tone alleged that he could not under-
stand why L/4 would want to return, that he had treated her as well as he
could, and that in any case he would not permit her to take their daughter.
LIRING/2 although obviously screwhat embarassed took 1/4's part and urged
L/3 to reconsider and give permission to L/4 to take daughter along since
she would be reluctant to leave as a "good mother". 1/2 went so far as
to state that if 1/3 insisted it would be tantamount to "blackmail” against.
LIRING/4. L/2 continued that he felt obliged as a LIRING official; to grant
LIRING/4 permission to return but he did not want to oblige her to depart
without her child. FIRING/3 told howton that he did not give in and left
LIRING/2 with the impression that his mind was made up regarding the
child.

script, since she pretended to be curicus about the spelling of the name.
According to 1/4, 1/2 snatched up the match-box with expressions of appre-
ciation, and continued to listen with interest. 1/4 continued that the
Greek explained to bor the difficulties and complexities of working with
the Mexicans in procuring sulphur and other critical products, but she
confessed to 1/2 that she knew nothing about such matters and felt very
confused. She commented, however, that the Greek appeared quite relaxed and
willing to answer her questions. She added that shen she turned the conver-
sation on Cuba, the Greek replied that he was interested naturally as a
good revolutionary, but frankly was very disappointed ("decepcionado") at
the treatment received by the LIRING officials he had met, including L/2.
L/4 continued that the Greek-bad-commented that he had many dealings with
foreign officials in his normal business operations but had never encountered
the discourtesy shown by nome, who did not oven ander his teie-
phone calls. L/4 conluded with a statement that she felt the Greek was no
longer interested in Cuba and assumed that he had obtained whatever infor-
nation he needed from other sources.
i
3. LIRING/4 then asked L/2 whether he needed any more information since she
might be seeing the Greek once more before he left for Europe again. L/2
replied that he appreciated what she had already obtained and added that he
felt it wise in these cases to get to know the person "more and more" before
making a judgement. 1/4 told howton that at this point she could not refrain
from the outburst:" But you have known me for several years, and you still
can't make up your mind. How mch time do you need to figure things out".
She told Rowton that 1/2 just smiled at this and again asked to be given
until Monday for the final answer re the permission to return.
i
4. LIRING/4 then told Hoxton that as she was leaving the premises, she stoppeċ
briefly to chat with Jorrín. The latter appeared genuinely surprised that
LINING/4 had not as yet been granted her permit. Then she commented that
probably L/2 had to wait for a reply from Havana, Jorrín exclaimed:" ko,
that's not probable, since he did not send any cable on you; otherwise I
would know“. He added as an afterthought that possibly he could have sent
a dispatch which he would not know about, but he doubted that in view of
the time element involved. Jorrin then commented that "everything "had changed
since L/4 had left her job, explaining that now all confidential papers,
not only from L/2's oofice but also from L/9, the Commerical Sectiog, and
from "Luna's office" were handled by one person rather than as previously
by each office, (L/4 commented to Rowton that she had never heard of a per-
son by the name of Luna) and that things in generals had been tightened up
froz a security standpoint.

Subject: Carzen Lozada Statments to LIRING/3 re trip.
1. LIKING/3 reported to acton at 2130 on 19/2/68 that Carzen Lozada
had telephoned him about 0930 that morning and that he had seen her
again at her request. On this occasion he found her relatively composed
and quite coherent as compared to their first meeting since her return.
2. L/3 reported that she stated that the situation in Havana was
"chaotic" -_econcically a disaster-with-no-rice-on-the-market, gascline
rationing ( 8 gallons per month for ordinary cars and 20 for larger)
strictly enforced and police control #brutal". She sta that the
Havana airport everything is searched even of Mexicans as herself and
what can be taken for personal reasons is removed on the pretext of
having it "checked".
3. Carmen Lozada stated specifically to L/3 that she had beard strong
rumors in Havana that Fidel Castro would be replaced by Dorticós mainly
because of the failure of Fidel's economic policies. It was also rumored
that sugar production would fall far below last year's figure, possibly
exceeding 4,000,000 tons by only a fraction. Bad fertilizer xxxXZAĻKÆ
TEXL is blamed but the general feeling is that it is rather bae management
and Fidel's advisors are taking the blame.
4. Carmen also reported that she had heard "confirmed" reports that César
Montes is no longer leader of the Guatemalan revolucion, although, she
could not say who had replaced him.

LIRING/4 Report of Conversation with Echenendía ( Ismail
Suarez de la Faz).
1. LIRING/4 reported to Royton at 1000 on 19/2/68 at the Juca d'Este
café that she had met with schementia for about one hour on 17 eb-
ruary at a small coffee shop off calle Fachuca in Colonia Condesa. She
explained that she had telephoned chemendía fromthe home of her friend
Blanca Peña de Anand and arranged to meet him about 1730 at a nearby corner.
2. LIRING/4 stated that Schemendia was cordial as usual and told her that

Havana and she informed histhat she hoped to leave on the 23 February
flight. Echemendía asked if she thought she right have difficulty re-
turning to Mexico, to which L/4 replied in the negative, commenting that
in the past neither the Hexicans nor the Cubans had gives her a trouble.

3. According to 1/4, Echenendía then queried har in some detail about how
LIRING/3 was doing, his business in Chiapas, where they were living, and
what his plans were. She replied in as matter-a-fact way as possible, al-
leging that 1/3 was selling his paintings and doing well in business.
4. Schemerdía then commented that the HIRING office locally had commented
re L/3 that although they appreciated the information he had passed to them
they did not have the sources and details and hence had to view them with
suspicion. Echezendía apologized to II/4 for having to say this
(me da mucha pena) but he felt obliged to pass it along to her. He added
that both Havana and LIRING are accustomed to get sources along with the
reports turned in to them and always are uneasy when these are lacking.
He agreed with 1/4 that 1/3 had acted in good faith, but also defended the
position of the MEING office which he said was surrounded by provactions
and infiltrations.
5. 1/4 tɔld Horton that she did not tell L/3 about this rendevous with
Echezendía ( whose a tentions to L/4 in the past have made 1/3 particularly
jealous and annoyed) since she did not want to disturb hia. LIRDG/3,
however, reported to howton at about 2100 the previous evening (15/2/68)
in an obviously irritated tone that by pure chance he had seen Echemendía
and LIRING/4 together at a coffee shop about 1800 on 17/2/68. When Howton
explained that he had known of and approved of the meeting beforehand,
Lails/3 calmed down and shrugged it off.

it later when informed by loston as being in her best interest, Ste
agreed that child could not be properly taken care of at other's
home in Cantiago becasue of short supply of essential food with neither
parent present, that her departure without child would permit frequent
correspondence with 1/3, and provide excellent pretext for return to
Mexico (to convince 1/3 to permit her move child to Havane with her once
she established.
i
5. For högtrs info, Rowton convinced that LIRING/3 wants permanent se-
paration from LIRING/4 feeling that situation has become "intolerable",
whereas IIAING/4 still hoping against hope that their dozestic difficulties
can be patched up and that when she returns they can resure xornal marital
relations. She insisted to Roston that she would remain loyal to him and
do nothing to increase bis antipathy for her. (Rowton feels this is tro-
bably best control that can be hoped for in her operational work)!
6. Following lengthy meetings with 1/4, Rowton has eveløved following
operational plan with her approval:
E
(a) LINING/4 on arrival will re-establish contact with and assess
the following contacts:
(1) Famiro Abreu
(2) Arnol and Ruby (wife) Rodriquez
(3) Caribel Guilfrido
(4) Capt Luis Carballo and wife
(5) Loló de la Corriente
1 Mercedes Mcrales Lereverent.
These persons will be referred to in / messages by number
only for security reasons. 1/4 knows that numbers three and five
have already expressed strong anti-revolutionary sentiments and
will attempt discreetly to determine present attitude and access.
(b) Discreet efforts will be made learn of efficiency and močus
operandi of DSE. ING/4 insisted on this for her own pro-
tection since kowton alleged that he could not provide her with
necessary briefing. She feels confident that she can get at
least some basic data from Ramiro Abreu. L/4 commented that she
almost certain the CSE de manipluated by a "foreign service
since she certain tha Cubans themselves incapble of efficient
and secure operations.
(c) when 1/4 feels she has reached point with any of above that she
can make some sort of "deal" (for instance assistance to them
from outside in exchange for help to her in finding "interesting
position" during her forced stay there) she will notify Borton
by 3/2 and proceed further or withdraw as per instructions.
(d) In event. L/4 meets other persons who might prove recruitable
she will mention their names xxx address and position in text
of open letter to IEG/3 adding that they send their regards
and need, something no available in Cuba. The persons thus zen-
tioned will be referred to in 5/1 by next consecutive number in
subsequent message. Howton has stressed that he interested only
in persons in excellent positions and conceivably recruitable.
the list should therefore not be exhaustive.

collusion, Rowton suggested that 1/4 see 1/2 again and ask for howton's
telephone number, which she could alleged she could not find at home and
which she preferred not to ask I/3 fer, in order not to arduse his sus-
picions. Once she obtained the number she could allege that she telephoned
Rowton on some pretext ( provided if possible by LIRING/2 himself) and
managed to see him at lunch a few days later. She could then report to
L/2 that Rowten had told her that his telephone was actually an answering
service and hence only messages were taken around the clock. He had no
need of an office since he traveled in and out so often and his business
did not require an office with the accompanying headaches. L/4 would con-
tinue that Rowton confided that he was working on sensitive deals to pur-
chase Mexican sulphur ( an expensive and difficult item to procure anywhere
in the world at this tine) and that his principal business connection was
with Stavros Niarcos, the wealthy shipowner. His interest in Cuba stemmed
from Niarcos' desire to study the shipping possibilities there in the event
the Northamerican embargo was lifeted.

6. Howton instructed 1/4 to commented to 1/2 that when she spoke of the
LIRING office, Kowton appeared very irritated and remarked that he was 1
"decepcionado" with the tre trent he had received from both L/2 and the
commerical office. If 1/2 appeared surprised and curious about this, 1/4
could continue that Rowton commented to her that he could not understand the
cavalier manner in which the LIRINGS did business. He cited the example of
at least three telephone calls he had made some weeks previously to both
1/2 and the commercial office, leavinf his name and telephone, and that,
no one had had the courtesy to reply. L/4 could then added that as a result
Rowton was auncyed andhad decided to go directly to Eavana to get the info-
mation he needed on prospective business on behalf of Miarcos.

(e) LIRING/4 will have two channels for 3/4. First to "Lic.
Antonio Force " with false return a dress and sent through
open mail, and second to LIES/3 sent by hand through Ramiro
Abreu to RING office and delivered by hand by Jorrin to
Dacubaya apartment, or given by 1/4 to some friend traveling
to Mexico. In first case all letters railed, except the frist,
will contain S/; ressage; in second case all letters with en-
velope bearing "Colonia Concesa" after address will be for How-
ton and have S/. 1/4 promises sent several letters to 1/3
without Dessages as soon as she arrives to test channel.
(f) Only channel for incoming messages for 1/4 will be letters from
LIRING/3 oxtaining words" Chiapas" and "arte" and either hand
carried, sent through pouch, or through open mail.
(C) The following signals have been agreed on for purpose specified:
(1) Danger signal will be absence of name Zinzuni in open
text to 1/3. In all the letters L/4 will mention name.
In event bostile control child will be referred to by
±lcanane, or endearing supression but no
(2) "All my 3-1 complex vitamins are gone" indicates need
for new carbon. "I bave no more cologne that everyone
liked so much" indicates ned for developer.
(3) New carbon sent to LIHING/3 will be recognized by simple
drawing Egzonix attributed to daughter and sent as
expression of sentiment by LIRING/3.
7. In reply her query re best course of action in event she has reports
DSE planning arrest, Rowton advised LIRING/4 destroy S/w supplies, and
take refuge in Mexican Embassy in hope that she would be able communicate
with LIRING/3 ( she did not ask nor did Rowton volunteer how she could
notify him since she assumes Rowton would remain in continuing contact
·LIRING/3).
8. LIRING/4 encouraged by attitude and sympathy shown by LIRING/2 and
Echemandía re her remaining in Cuba, but she made it clear to Roston that
she would not do anything jeopardize her residence permit in Mexico or
forfeit the time accumulated, unless "oston could arrange have Mexican
Ambassador în Havana renew her XXXXXX Visa and assure her. She added that
best approach would be return after time up to attempt bring child back
and at that time make new contract with Rowton providing for guarantees.
howton agreed stating that he not in position for many reasons, including
security, to make such commitments at this time. L/4 made it clear to
Howton also that she realizes that he probably operating in an alias and
is affiliated with some sort of service or organization (this came out
during discussion of contract and acknowledgement of pseudonym which she
did not want), but she stated bluntly that she did not want to know any
more about nowton than the little she already knew since "it would be
easier to face an interrogation without betraying him completely".

LIRING/4 Report of Questioning by LIRING/2 re Rowton
("The Greek").
1. at 1030 on 17 February, 1963, LINING/4 informed kowton that she had
dropped into the LIRING offices at about 1230 on 15 February and again
on the morning of the following day to check with LIRING/2 concerning
her entry permit for travel to Havana. On the first occasion LIRING/2
asked her casually whether she had seen anything of the "Greek friend"
lately. LIMING/4 told Rowton that she replied that she and LIRING/3 heard
from him from time to time, mainly by telephone, and that he had invited
her out cccasionally, but she,LIRING/4, had turned him down.
2. On the second onion, during the late morning of 18 Fehrilery 1062.
LIRING/2 saw L/4 again on the premises and asked to not to leave until
she had seen him, since he wanted to discuss something with her. When she
finally saw him in his office some 30 minutes later, he again asked whether
she had seen the "Greek", not mentioning Rowton by his alias (Harris).
Since L/2 had mentioned L/4's Greek friend whom he had met through Rodolfo
Reyes on a previously occasion, LIRING/4 felt she could not pretend not to
know about whom he was talking. She therefore replied again that occasional-
ly she heard from him when he was on a trip to Mexico. LIKING/2 asked
what 1/4 thought of him (the Greek), to which she replied that she found
him pleasant and very generous ( bondadoso). L/2 replied, "Yes, but what
does that generosity come from?" He then added that he had many question-
marks concerning that person. He gave as an example the fact that when be
telephoned his number on a holiday, 31 December or 1 January, his "secre-
tary" replied. It seemed very strange, continued L/2, that the Greek's
telephone was manned at all times, night and day, and even jon holidays.
He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and how
he earned his money, and why he was so interested in Cuba.
3. LIRING/4 stated to Rowton that she was st first quite taken aback by
this direct "interrogation", even though it was made in a friendly tone,
and replied as best she could by ear. She stated that she assumed the
Greek was carrying on lucrative business and lived in Europe although she
could not supply any specific answers. She was aware that he had brought
some of LIKING/3's paintings at an excellent price and took hisgenerosity
før granted since she enjoyed living from the good business LIRING/3 gained
through him. LIRING/4 then asked L/2 why he himself didn't do some checking
of his own, since she assumed the that LIRING office was capable of such

Briefiing in Communications and Security of LIKING/4.
1. During the past four days Kowton has had daily meetings with LIKING/4
to give her initial training in 5/% and discuss channel's of communication
that might be used securely and logically by LIKI G/4 and Rowton. A"con-
tract" to serve as a letter of understanding for both Rowton and LIRING/4
was drafted as a basis for present and future colaboration. No reference
to WCFACT was made or implied, but konton made it clear that he had "firends
and colleagues" who were interested in intelligence coverage of FERUMEN
and who would carry on his collaboration with IIRIG/4 in the event of
Rowton's death or unavailability.
2. The first item discussed was a simple open code to designate nomenne
of interest either as targets or possible hostile elements, so that L/4.
could mention these persons in the text of her 3/w correspondence without
compromising berself. A list of the persons concerned with the code names
is attached herewith. LINING/4 understands that these code names will not
be used in open letters to LIRING/3 under any circonstances.
3. As far as letter drops are concerned, Rowton instructed LIRING/4 to
send her 5/ Dessages with innocent text cover to the following address:
Lic. Antonio Ponce Cortés
Multifamiliar Miguel Alemán C-326
México 12, D.F.
using a notional return address that could not be easily traced, and drop-
ping the letter in a public mailbox in the center of town. Rowton dia not
give LIRING/4 an indicator for the cover text since it was understood that
all messa¿es, except the first, would contain an s/w message. LIKING/4 Fro-
mised to mail an innocent text letter as soon after arrival as possible so
that Ecwten would have a good idea of the lenth of time involved in his
receiving future letters.
4. LIRING/4 was advised that she would receive S/. messages from Rowton
on the paper backing of seriographic designs ( Aztec seals) being produced
by LIRING/3. The designs, prepared in the form of greeting cards, would
be addressed to a third party and contain a brief message of greeting in
the handwriting of LIRING/3 and would be sent as an attachment to a rou-
tine letter from LIKING/3 sent by hand or through the LIRING pouch. Both
LIãING/4 and doxton agreed that open mail, since it would have to bear her
true name and address, would be both too risky and too slow.
In the un-
likely event of discovery, L/4 would have some way out, alleging that she

activity when the occasion aalled for it. LIGING/2 replied that he had
too many other things to do, and anyway, when sciething smelled bad
("apesta") be keeps away from it. LIRING/4, continuing to take the of-
fensive, stated that on several occasions inthe past the Greek had invited
her out but she had not accepted, but that she easily could accept on the
next occasion and possibly even obtain a photo of some kind for LIKING/2.
L/2 replied that a photo would not be of any use, all he could do with
it being to send it to Havana. He added that he had many suspicions, parti-
cularly as a result of the telephone, but had nothing concrete "in his
hands", and that what he needed was "datos".
-
4. LIKING/2 then asked L/4 whether she knew when Rodolfo Reyes was return-
ing and where he would be living? She told nowton that she replied in the
negative, commenting simply that she had heard that he would be moving
to Chile to work in the national ballet there. 1/2 returning again to the
Greek wondered why he was so generous with gifts and entertainment. L/4"
stated that she never looked a gift horse in the mouth, to which LIKING/2
replied that she must be careful, if not for her own sake at least for the
sake of LIRING/3 who, he felt, was not treading on firm ground( "terreno
firme"). L/4 admitted that she was often worried about L/3's activities,
about which he told her almost nothing. 1/2 then commented "Invesitigate
the Greek and you'll feel better." (Averigua lo del Griego). He then added
that that supposed letter from Rico Galán was not considered authentic,
and also the case of Orozco definitely involved the police. LIRIA 3/4, since
she was aware that 1/3 had discussed both these cases with L/2, except
that L/3 had not to her knowledge mentioned the arrest of Crozco, stated
that she felt 1/3 had acted in completely good faith, even though he might
have been somewhat inpulsive ("precipitado").
+
5. LIRING/2, continuing the conversation, which according to L/4 lasted
over one hour, stated that both she and L/3 must be careful of their con-
tacts. He commented that he could not even go out on a date with a girl
without thinking of the consequences. He could go out once maybe, but
he felt it wiser to drop the contact for security reasonsL/4 told Howton
that she concluded the conversation with a promise to elicit as much data
from the Greek as possible as soon as she could get in touch with him.
6. Rowton then told L/4 that he felt relieved in fact that L/2 had brought
this whole matter up, since it was better to face such an interrogation
here in Mexico rather than in lavana without the benefit of Rowton's advice
and briefing. He then stated that he felt it essential that L/4 provide
1/2 with much-beeded answers to his questions. To avoid the impression of

had nothing to do with the message and placing the blame on
F/3.
5. At subsequent meetings,however, LIRING/4 accepted the probable long
delays in reseiring meusiges, both to and from her, involved in the
open mail and agreed that it would be necessary to take the risk in-
volded in sending at least some c the messages under cover of normal
correspondence to LIRING/3. She also agreed with Rowton that serding
S/w on the back of seriographic designs would constitute a pattern and
might attract unine attention.
6. It was therefore agreed that LIKING/4 would also write S/w in letters
to LIRING/3 that would be hand-carried to Mexico by a friend or sent in
the pouch and delivered by Jorrín to her Tacubaya address. Rowton structed
LIRING/4 to insert"Coloria Condesa" in the address on the envelope if
the letter contained 5/w, otherwise leave out this addition. Since Roston
would have a key to the Calzada Tacubaya apartment he could check regularly
for any letters that Jorrín might have slipped under the door during periods
when LIRING/3 might be absent from Mexico City.
7. At his meeting with LIRING/4 on 14/2/68 the following acditional signals
were agreed on:
(a) Danger Signal : Omision of name Zinzuni from open text. The
child would always be referred to in regular
correspondence with LIRING/3 by name. In event
of hostile control, LINING/4 would refer to
child as "hijita" or by some other endearing
name, but refrain from using her tirst name.
(b) New Carbon Reeded: to be indicated by the phrase "I need
more vitamin B-12" or "I have run out of my
B-12 complex vitamins".
(c) New Developer Needed: " I have run out of that nice cologne
I brought with me".
8. As far as incoming S/i was concerned, Rowton stated that if a cover
letter from LIRIG/3 contained the words "Chiapas" and "arte" it would in-
dicate that an / message was being forwarded in that letter.

LIA/3 Report of Meeting with Carmen Lozada.
-
1. At 2100 on 16/2/68 LII/3 reported to Roston that he had met with
Carmen iozada at about 1130 ca 17/2/63, at the square in Coyacán. He
explained that on 15/2/68 their mutual friend, Carren Molina, had con-
tacted Carmen Lozada by telephone and had learned that the latter planned
to return to Mexico the following day ( Friday, 16/2/6). Carmen Lozada
had told her on the phone to give her regards to her friend ( LIRING/3)
but to ask him not to meet her at the airport since she would be accoo-
panied by her daughter and would be met by her parents on arrival in te
xico. DIXING/3 therefore contacted her through Carmen Molina on the
morning of 17/2/68 and made the date to meet her near her parents home.
2. / continued v as soon as ue saw carmen Lozada he knew at once that
something unpleasant had happened during her visit to Havana. He told Howtar
that she had apparently lost five or six pounds, was dressed in a slovenly
manner and gave of appearance of a distraught person, almost on the verge
of insanity. Her mer and su.sequent conversation, often incoherent and
half hysterical, confirmed in I/3's mind that she was suffering from severe
strain and depression. L/3 told howton that he understood from her rezarks
that she had found the Havana airport, Havana, Cuba and the Cubans in
general "detestable". She exclaimed at one point: "Cdio a esa isle maldital'
She added that she was on the point of becoming an enemy of Cuba (volverse
gusana). In the next breath, however, she stated that she had to return
"en pocos días" as soon as treatment had been arranged for her daughter,
(suffering from asthma). L/3, pretending to think that she had patched
up things with her husband, Farique, asked whether she had been reconciled
and found that she really loved her husband after all. She eclaimei, accor-
ding to L/3, in a half hysterical voice that she hated her husband and
everything her represented.
:
3. L/3 continued that despite his repreased questions Carmen Lozada re-
fused to give hin details of what actually had happened to her. She re-
peatedly stated that she was under "intense, horrible pressure" that she
could not explain. Then L/3 commented that 1/4 was preparing to return to
Havana, Carmen Lozada burst out again with "qué horrible!" but again lið
not explain. In view of Carmen Lozada's obvious state of psychological
and physical disintegration,IIKING/3 told Howton that he felt it best to
terminate the meeting at the first opportunity (about 1630) and leave as
gracefully as he could. He added that when he left he looked back to see
her standing in a daze for a full five minutes before walking off.

LIRING/4 Report of letter from Maceiro, Vice Hinister
of Education.
1. At 1000 on 30 January, 1965, LIRING/4 reported to Horton that
she had seen Jorrín the previous afternoon and that he had told ter
that he had been to her apartment the previous evening but had failed
to find her or LIRING/3 in. He explained that Dr. Marizelo, who was
visiting Mexico City, had asked him to deliver to LIZING/4 as letter
from their mutual friend, Dr. Maceira. Jorrín then gave LIRING/4 the
letter.
2. LIBING/4 stated to Rowton that the letter was simply a request for
shoes for Maceira's child which could not be obtained in Cuba. LIRING/4
commented that this was only another of a series of such requests that
Maceira and Figueroa of the Ministry of Education had been making to
her since their last visit to Mexico. She had in the past ignored the
requests since she felt she had done enough and could see no useful
purpose in running around town as a purchasing agent, particularly when
there was no guarantee that they would reimburse her.
3. Horton suggested that on this occasion, however, it might prove worth-
while, in view of Marinelo's apparently important position in usvana and
LIRING/4's forthcoming trip. He suggested that LIRING purchase the shoes
(about 50 pesos) and attempt to deliver then personally to harinelo; She
could then invite him to lunch or dinner in the hope of assessing his
present feelings toward the regize. LIRING/4 recalled that Marinelo had
been Rector of the University of Havana and was a member of the old guard
communist party. She added that Jorrín had mentioned that Marinelo held
Ånbassadorial rank and was serving at the present time in some sort of
international delegation.
4. LIRING/4 also reported that she had run into an old Cuban friend,
Aralia Arizmendi, on the street, and that the latter had given her her
home phone as 23-79-95. LIRING/4 explained that Arizzendi had married
a Mexican psychiatrist and left Cuba some years back. As far as she knew
Arizmendi was sympathetic with the Castro regine and on more or less
friendly terms with LIKING. On this occasion Arizmendi joked with 1/4
✓ about the inefficiency of the LIRING offcials, saying that the only per-
son she felt was doing a decent job was Cepeda.

current transmitter would have to be removed because of its shallow
concealment. To continue the assessment of target personalities
however, we wanted to wait until almost the last minute. The week
of 15 April 1968 was selected as an appropriate time by Wallace B.
ROHTON, who is in contact with the targets.

LIRING/3 Report of Contact with Gustenalans in Mexico Čity.
1. At a brief meeting with Rowton at 1700 on 22/3/63 at the Diana Restaurant
LIRING/3 reported that he was working on the fabrication of identity docu-
ments for the two FAR representatives ( Higuel Angel Oliva Castañeda and
Rodolfo) through his seriographic process and that he hoped to have the
pictures of the persons concered the following day. He asked howton to
bring along his copying kit so that he could quickly copy the pictures
just before LIRING/3 put them on the identity cards. Howto prom sed to
bring the kit to the Atoyac apartment at 1500 on 23/3/68.
2. LIRING/3 also reported that he had learned from the Guatemalans that
a certain *Esquenasi or Eskenazi, a Guatemalan who has resided for many years
in Hexico and who owns or operates a factory called "Cronos de México", bas
been very helpful to the FAR menabers in Mexico. Likewise a doctor by the
name of Jorge Flesch has been of service when needed. i

3. In reply to howton's query LINING/3 stated that all the seven Guatemalans
he had recently met ( four of whom live at 54 Río verna) appeared to be FAR
adherents, except one, who he had learned in passing was a follower of can
Sosa. L/3 also stated that he had learned that the one who worked in the
photo shop on San Juan Latrán street was an accountant rather then a photo-
grapher.

with him to the FAR headquarters in the Merra Mina on his forthcoming
trip so that L/3 could get first-hand requirements from the PAR supply
responsible (whom Oliva referred to as a woman). Oliva also mentioned
that FAR was hoping to obtain a lathe to permit the manufacture of weapons
locally (in the moutains).
5. Cliva also stated that the principle purpose of the visit of his comrade
"Rodolfo" was to obtain funds and to return to Mexico. Cliva added that in
the event 2/3 could make the trip he could also return with Rodolfo to
Mexico. In reply to 1/3's query, Oliva stated that the funds Rodolfo would
be given in Guatemala were from various robberies carried out by Fär for
the purpose of raising its own funds. Oliva commented that they could not
count of the Cubans or the CPG for financial support when it was needed. He
added that the sale of the booklet "Terror in Guatemala" (of which 1/3 had
obtained a copy from Carlos Persival) had helped to supply some of the money
to be used for the trip. Oliva indicated that he himself planned to remain
in Guatemala with the FAR forces in the mountains.

Archi who worked for the radio station and had access to technical equip-
ment.

5. At the conclusion of the meeting Pe saval promised to telephone 1/3
again at 2200 the following night ( 16/3/68) in the hope of being able to
set up a meeting that night or the following. I/3, however, reported to
Rowton by telephine that as of 2300 on 16/3/68 no one had telephoned him
to set up the resting.

with kiguel Angel Oliva Castaleda, this time-at-about 1930 in front of the
Chapultepec novic and went with his to the Café Literario ch Calle Lieja.
L/3 told Ecston that Cliva confided to him that he had just learned from
four Guate an errades who lived to in an apartment on Calle Lerma
that their residence was bein. surveilled by what they felt was the Mano
Blanca. He ex lained that they had coted several fairly well-dressed men
hanging around the apartment house and had tried to follow one of them but
he had run off. This all indicated to them that the surveillance was not be.

stated that they knew that the deputy chief of the lano Blanca crialization
Oliverio Castañeda, was currently in Hexico City, and assumed that he had
organized the surveillance. Oliva then mentioned that one of the four living
at Calle Lerma was the well-known Guerrilla leader who had recently sought
sanctuary in the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala City and was granted asylum
to Mexico through the intervention and influence of Lazaro Cárdenas.

2. In order to determine the exact location of the lerma apartment, LIGING/
told Rowton that he offerred to help identify the surveillance by conducting
a countersurveillance himself the following evening. He also served the
of his Tacubaya studio, recommending that in any case the four should dis-
perse at least temorarily.
3. L/3 also reported to howton that he again met with Cliva at 1015 that same
morning and that the latter had taken him to a printing shop on Calzada Tlal
pan near Calle José T. Cuéllar, named "Regia",as L/3 recalled. (The Mexico
City telephone directory lists "Resca-Impresos y Rayados, Calle J.7. Cuélls
57, tel: 78-05-01). Oliva told L/3 that this shop produced varicus ID papers
for them in the past but unfortunately was not able to fabricate a good
Mexican ID card because of the unavailability of the special type used. L/3
said that he was confident that he could make the reproduction through hit
seriographic process. In the course of conversation (liva confided to 1/3

Subject: LIRI.G/3 Report of Meeting with Carlos Fersaval.
1. LIRING/3 reported to Howton at 1115 on 15/3/68 at the restaurant
Hiss on reforma and Calle Mississipi that unfortunately his meeting with
the two Guatemalans scheduled for the previous evening at 2230-2300 in
Danny's restaurant (Reforma at Diana Circle) did not come off. He stated
that he arrived at the restaurant at 2230 and waited until about 2315 with-
out seeing either Persaval or being approached by any Guatemalan. He con-
tinued that just as he was about to leave, he beard a tap on the window
behind big and turned and saw Teresa Lozada de Fersaval on the street. “e
wnet out and p
vô á car where Carlos Fersaval was waiting.
He was then driven to sanborn's Angel and remained there with Carlos and
Teresa for some thirty minutes.
2. According to LIRING/3, Carlos Fersaval explained that he had been stood
up by the Guatemalans and had been unable to get in touch with them to in-
troduce theз to L/3 as he had hoped. He added that one of the persons YAB
had been in Cuernavaca two or three days previously and perhaps had not
been able to return in time for the nesting. Fersaval, who appeared to 1/3
to be quite nervous in Sanborn's, suggested that they go elsewhere to con-
tinue their discussion and LIRING/3 invited him and Teresa to his “acubaya
studio.
3. They then proceeded there to continue the discussion. Teresa excused her-
self on arrival saying that she was very tired, and promptly fell asleep in
one of the bedrooms. Carlos Fersaval then continued talking with 1/3 until
about C300. He mentioned that one of the Guatemalans he hoped to intro-
duce to L/3 was well-known and important in FAR, while the other(who had
documents) was relatively unimportant and could probably set by the pclice
checks witsout as such risk. In reply to L/3's queries, Fersaval stated that.
both men wanted to travel to Guatemala City and that one (the important one)
would probably be returning to Rexico after a short stay. Persaval revealed
that as far as he knew the purpose of their trip was to còtain much-neeced
funds to continue their work in Mexico.
4. LIKING/3 told howton that he again promised to guide the Guatemalans ac-
ross the border south of San Cristóbal but insisted on meeting them in
Mexico City prior to escorting them over the border. Persaval then asked L/3

LIKING/3 Report of Contact with Memebers of FAR, Guatemala.
1. At 0945 on 19/3/68 at the hobbins Restaurant, Calle Leibnitz and Melchor
Ceampo, LIRING/3 reported to Howton that he had again ret the FÅR member
whose sketch he had given Howton the previous day and whom he had met thru
Carlos Fersaval on 17/3/63. He explained that Fersaval had finally con-
tacted him by phone late Sunday afternoon (-17/3/63) and introduced him to
one of the two Guatemalas who wasted to return clandestinely to their
Guatemalan
country. 1/3 described this man, who later showed bin/fentification papers
in the name of Miguel Angel Oliva, sped 33, as short, stocky, with black hair
trimmed short and rather thick prominent eyebroús. 1/3 estimated his age as
35 and said there was no doubt in his mind that he was a native-born Guate-
malan. Is ad
this person wore a thin Houstache. L/3 then drew hosta
a sketch of the person concerned which Rowton passed in to the Station the
same day.
2. LIMING/3 continued that he conversed with the Guatemalan, Oliva, in the
presence of Carlos Fersaval and his wife Teresa Lozada de Farsaval at the
Miss restaurant on Reforma for about 45 minutes, taking the line that he was
willing to help the cause as he had done in the past, but he wanted to be
certain of the exact affiliations and bona fides of the persons with hom he
was dealing. Shen this apparently surprised and somewhat shocked Carlos Fer-
saval and Teresa, L/3 explained that he had had some unpleasant experiences
with such persons as Crozco and was aware that many FAR desertors were cir-
culating around Hexico these days. The Guatezalan, Oliva, however reacted
favor bly saying that he understood 1/3's position and cid not blame him.He
added that he would furnish proof of his FÅR affiliations and indicated that
there were two other comrades, one much more important than himself, sho
also needed help in returning. L/3 told Roston that he stressed to all pree
sent the risks involved in providing false documentation and acting as a
guide for them to cross the border illegally and his original commitment to
help only two persons. In reply to L/3's query, the Guatemalan Oliva stated
that their destination would be Guatemala City itself and they hoped that
1/3 would be able to accompny then there since they were not familiar with
the countryside betweenthe border in the Comitan area and Guatemala City.
3. According to LIKING/3 the latter insisted that he meet the other, more is-
portant Guatemalan, and be given an opportunity to make carreful plans be-
fore attempting the journey to Chiapas and Guatemala City. Oliva then made
a date with Persaval and 1/3 for the next evening at 2300 at the corner of

Cliva waiting with neither of them. saw Herseval. Clive, after avait of a--
bout 45 minutes, suggested that they give up and go to a cafeteria, Copa de

Leche, on Jan Juán Latrán. L/3 stated to sorton that while they were waitin
they were joined by another Guatemalan, a young man of about 22 years of ag
· and rather stout, who accompanied them to the Cafeteria. The older Guatemal
then showed 1/3 a Guatemalan passport in the name of Riguel Angel Cliva Cas
teñada which he said was false but which enabled him to travel in Mexico.
The younger man sated that he had legal documents but did not volunteer his

ing been able to bring along the other Fid ccaride, to whom he referred as
"Rodolfo" and again promised to introduce him t: 1/3 the following evening.
He promised to telephone L/3 at 1400 the next day to confirm the meeting.
5. LIRING/3 then told Roston that the two Guatemalans then escorted him to
the Hotel del Valle co Calle Independencia ( horton recalls that Dr. Eusta-
mante resided there during his stay in Nexico City several months ago). 1/3
told norton that he met two other Guatemalans there in the lobby and comment :
that they talked r. ther freely in front of hin, discussing at one point even
the illegal acquisition of a revolver needed by one of them. In the course o
conversation 1/3 stated that he learned that César Hortes is now back in
Guatezala and that the FAR is planning an April offensive. All the Guateza'
lans expressed concern over the increase in the power of the "Fano Blanca“
and blamed it for the kidnapping of the Guatemalan Archbishop. They also con.
mented that the military in Guatemala were disenchanted, with the "puppet pre
sident",Montenegro, and could be expected to increase the terririam from
the right in order to place Montenegro in an impossible position and eventua
ly justify his removal.
·6. W/3 commented to Horton that he noted that at no time did any of the Guat:
malans mention Cuban aid or assitance. In fact one of them at one point s-id
that he had tried unsuccessfully to obtain a visa for travel to Cubasome
thirty days previously.

LIRING-3: From recent activity it appears
that the Guatemalan FAR may have removed its interest
in LIRING-3. In late January, an emissary of YAR
representatives in the PERUMEN capitai traveled to
Mexico and contacted the person who had carried to
FBRUMEN the letter sent by LIRING-3 in the summer
of 1967 denouncing Moises CROZCO Leal. The emissary
brought the word that the FAR had much appreciated
LIRING-3's letter OR OROZCO and warned that the FAR
organization in Mexico City was infiltrated by a
WOFIRM operator. Try as he might, however, LIRING-3
failed, at least by the end of this period, to:
meet with the FAR MEA.

HMMA-33579
2 October, 1967
Subject:
SGSWIRL Examination of LINING/3.
1. From about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September, 1967, LIRING/3 was
given an SGS/IRL examination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu-
baya) with the SGSWIRL operator at 0930 that morning and remained with
the operator until the examination was completed. He had not given LI-
RING/3 any previous notice of the nature or extent of the examination,
but simply asked him, on 27 September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septem-
ber free for a lengthy dicussion with Rowton. Howton introduced the SG-
SWIRL operator as señor Albertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent the first
hour or so reviewing his relationship with LIRING/3, ostensibly for the
beheilt of Albe
Newton then,introducing the subject of certain
doubts that he hab in the past concerning LIRING/3's reporting, stated
that Albertini had a means of checking scientifically the truthfulness
of LIRING/3's statements. Rowton explained that he was particularly con-
cerned about the possiblity of LIRING/3 having doubled back with LIRING
andmaintaining with them a secret agreement of some sort to report on
Rowton and his activities.
B
-
2. LIRING/3 whet into a state of visible shock at this and stated that
even the thought of betraying Rowton had never occurred to him at any time.
When the SGSWIRL operator explained the scientific means he was to use on
LIRING/3, the latter stated that he could not possibly accept this humili-
ating means of testing him since it was diamentrically opposed to his
principles. He pointed out that he had accepted nowton at his word and be
could not see or understand why Rowton could not do the same for him, adding
that the whole thing smacked of methods used by aCFACT and LIRING. He added
that if this meant that he would have to break with Rowton, then regret-
fully he would have to accept this alternative. He explained that submit-
ing to the SGSWIRL examination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and
profound relationship which he had previously felt he enjoyed with Rowton.
3. Rowton and the SGSWIRL operator spent the next two hours calming LIRING/3
down and finally convincing him that he would not be compromising with his
deeply-felt principles by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques-
tioned on his loyalty to Rowton and insisted that he be asked, "Do you be-
lieve in Rowton?"

4. After a brief break for lunch the examination was given inone of the bed-
rooms off the apartment while Rowton waited in the living room. LIAING/3

SGSWIRL Report on LIRING/3
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
1. Attached herewith is the SGSWIRL report (Idens u/s/c)
on LIRING/3.
2. Please note that the EGSWIEL interviewer has made the
point that the principal misfortune in this interview probably
was that LIRING/3 was not tested on the fabrication of contacts
with the IDEM D's, which was thought to be the most probable
area of deception.
i
3. In view of LIRING/3's threat to quit working for
ROWTON, we would be interested in hearing of any repurcussions
or change in attitude that may have resulted from LIRING/3's
having taken the test. We also are interested in the Station's
Comments and recommendations as to the continued use of LIRING-3,
bearing in mind ROWTON's recent report of LIKING suspicions that
L-3 may be working for #OFIRM.

appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although
he was obviously emotionally strained by the experience. Rowton made
a date to see him again that evening at 2100 to talk things over in
a clamer atmosphere.
:
5. At that meeting with LIRING/3 Rowton explained that he had felt it
necessary to ascertain as objectively as possibly the extent of LIRING/3's
loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRING/3
had not berayed him to the LIRING's. LIRING/3 stated that after it was
all over he felt better and admitted that he agreed with Rowton on the
necessity for such an examination, humiliating as it might at first have
oncomed to be. He confoceed that any annona" (Pahminations and ommigei and
that he had made in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce
for Rowton, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept money
from Rowton without being able to render commensurate services. He stress-
ed, however, that at no time had he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done
anything against Rowton's interest, as señor Albertini could prove with
the results of the SGSWIRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row-
ton's direction scrupulously and assured Rowton that he no longer felt.
under any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Rowton.
6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRL examination disappoin-
ting in its limited coverage, but it must be realized that LIRING/3's..
initial reaction was entirely negative and at one point he threatened to
break off completely with Rowton because of the insult to his "dignity”.
Although the SGSWIRL operator felt that from a professional standpoint it
would be better to administer the examination at another time when LIEXNG/3
was less emotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRING/3 to go thru
with it on the spot, feeling that psychologically it was essential to
make LIRING/3 sub-it, even for a limited test. Rowton also feels that the
test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over LIRING/3 in the future,
when a second one can be more painlessly administered, in a calmer atmos-
phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether
LIRING/3 had been an LIRING double agent or betrayed Rowton in any way.

ROLTON suggests that two or three identifications be provided of such genaral

himself as a wealthy Greek client of LIRING-3 who had called at
the latter's house to pay for a painting he had ordered but had
been invited by LIRING-4 to come to the party. As previously agreed
with the Station, RCWTON directed his main attention to REYES.
The latter has resided in Havana since 1960 when he founded the
Cuban Ballet Folklorico. Until recently REYES has received the
monthly salary of one thousand pesos from the Cuban government,
and, according to LIRING-3 is well acquainted with political and
government personalities in Cuba. As pointed out in Reference.
ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of
the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography
(he told ROWTON he would very much like to go to New York to see
some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively
low salary he is currently receiving from the Mexico City Belles
Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held
in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to ROWTON's offer

and have a drink. MIEING/3 told Howton he was certain that Carmen Kolina
would have no hesitation in inviting Rowton to stay once he got into the
apartment.
H.
3. Rowton and LIKING/4 arrived about 2130 and found the party in full
swing with LIRING/3 and Eduardo Canudas striglling to get the phonograph
operating ( they eventually borrowed another and played several Cubam
revolutionary records.). Rowton was introduced as Sr. Harris, a Greek
businessaan and long-standing client, and felt at the end he was able:'
to convince all present that he actually was not from WCLADY (although
most apparently had that impression at the outset). Howton/managed to toss
out a few phrases of Russian at the right time in the direction of Carmen
Kolina to impress her ( fortunately her Russian is weaker even than Esston')
Kowton spoke some English with as good an accent as he could manage. Carmen
Molina volunteered to him privately that she had a great many "progressive"
friends in the U.S. Rowton was able to insert several comments about the
current political situation in Greece that was forcing him into a virtually
clandestine exiestence in Mexico, as well as elsewhere. Everyone appeared
to sympathize with Rowten and ceased asking any personal questions.
4. Rodolfo Reyes Cortes, apparently the guest of honor, arrived at about
2300, apologizing for being late and explaining that he had to attend a
memorial service (un acto) for Che Guevara. He refusedall offers of liquor

insisting on a Coca Cola. He appeared genuinely happy to meet Rowton and
explained in quite serious tones that he was engaged in the training of
a Mexican ballet group under the auspices of Bellas Artes to present a
performance of the Folklorico Cubano in the near future. He added that
he had been the founder of the Folklorico Cubano in the early 60's in
Havana and had a wife ( ballerina) and young daughter in Havana whom te
was anxious to return to.
5. Since nonton felt that Rodolfo was at the moment the best target for
assessment he invited him to join him in visiting the Señorial night-club
to see the Greek dances put on by a group of Greek musicians. Rodolfo
accepted eagerly and they both left the party at about 0030. Rowton had
perviously obtained the office telephone of Carmen Holina ( 34–60-32,ext
38) at the office of the Olvatic Committee where she was working and
had promised to take her to lunch the following day. Howton had also gotten
in a few private comments ( i.e. compliments) to Carmen Lozada so that be
could follow up at a later date if this was considered desirable. He found
Carmen Lozada in excellent spirits and at times definitely provocative,
despite her current marital situation ( she had that same day notiféei
her husband, Enrique Ramirez, a civil engineer working in Havana, that she
had begun divorce prodeedings).

entrance into the main room since Rodolfo was not wearing a tie and jacket.
Fortunately however, the Greek musicians, in their native costumes, were
relaxing in a corner of the entrance lobby and Rowton was able to introduce
Rodolfo šeyes to them and speak enough Greek to convince, Reyes that he
knew them well and was himself a Grrek. The musicians, who probably a3-
sumed Rowton was a Greek-American, did not speak enough Spanish to talk
directly to Rodolfo. They invited Rowton and Rodolfo to return on 31 Cet
when they expected fewer people in the audience and when they could show
Rodolfo some of the most popular Greek dances.
i
7. Rowton then invited Rodolfo Reyes to the Kinneret Restaurant for a
late supper ( no food was served at the Carmen Molina party) and he was
able to continue his conversation with him there. Rodolfo revealed that
.. he plans to visit Chile in mid-December, 1967, to organize a Folklorico
Cubano group there, and then return to Havana. He said Rowton could con-
tact him daily at the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico from 1100 until about
1300 and gave the telephone as 21-04-18 or 21-16-09. He appeared from his
conversation to be an admirer of the Cuban revolution and Castro although

to be his patron (to "help him out financially") if this could be done
on a very discreet basis. He said he hoped to put on another Cuban
show in Chile, before returning to his family in Havana: LIFEAT
coverage of LIRING-3's apartment for 26 October showed, incident-
ally, that REYES maintains close enough relations with Silvia
DCRAN (of Lee Harvey OSWALD fame) to be invited by her to her
house for lunch.
2.
Carmen MOLINA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife of a
prominent local neurosurgeon, Juan CARPASCO with whom she spent
some years in Cuba. Both are Mexican citizens. According to what
she previously told LIRING-3, Carmen MOLINA helped gather some of
the information used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the
ROSENBERGS. With the help of Alicia ECHEVERRIA and the latter's
uncle (who is the current Nexican Minister of Interior) Carmen
obtained a prominent position on the Nexican Olympic Committee
in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen
LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAMIREZ, a
rabid pro-CASTRO Mexican chemical engineer who is still in Cuba.
Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican
physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa-
tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both he (Armenegildo)
and his second and present wife are hard core Marxists. This
Wile, pra malla victoilà ue la Cruz, a Cuban, sil
Cuban, si brding to
LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including
the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife maintain a close relation-
ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ-Armas.
Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Marxist.
Information dated 1961 from RNLABILE indicates that she was !
active in Communist organizational work at UNAM and participated
in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President
PRADO. Although she is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be
quite as red now. She told ROWTON, for example, that she felt
nothing but disgust for her fanatically pro-CASTRO husband and
had strong resentment toward her step-mother. Per LIENVOY, July
1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROENZA when the latter
was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.
+1
3. At a private lunch with Carmen HOLINA, 28 October,
ROWTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although not a KKE
nember) involved in lucrative international business. He said
that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult
for him to operate in Mexico as openly as he would like.
He
could thus use MOLINA's help in obtaining certain types of
information and making discreet contacts with Nexican government
and business circles. MOLINA agreed to do what she could. She
stated that she was not a member of any Mexican or any other
Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer. She
also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with
the Cuban Embassy. LIONION-1, to whom a photograph of MOLINA,
REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is forwarded attached) was shown
stated he had never seen these three persons enter the Cuban
Embassy.

Following the developments described above, Station
a. Continue to develop REYES to the point where,
per Reference, he may be recruited by ROWTON either under
false flag as a Greek leftist or in alias as a WOFIRM
member to become a reporting source in Havana. Primary
motivation in REYES' case would almost certainly be
financial.

at no time did he exress and strong anti-"CLADY sentiment's. He complained
at one point of the meagee compensation he received for his services at
the Folklorico in Mexico City and said that he had just about enough money
to live on end help support his parents ( he remarked that his family comes
from San Cristóbal in Chiapas). Howton, explaining that he had brought
a number of LIRING/3's paintings to help him with his living expenses as
well as because he liked the style, stated that he had once aspired to be
an artist but had drifted off into business and somewhat regretted this
abandonment of art, despite his lucrative dealings in international trade.
He took this opening to offer to help Rodolfo financially from time to time,
but on a very confidential basis. Rodolfo reacted spontaneously with great.
expressions of gratitude, assuring Rowton that no one would learn of How-
ton's interest in him and his family. Rowton made no commitment but indi-
cated that he would consider helming Rodolfo with his living expenses while
he was still in Hexico.
8. Rodolfo Reyes is obviously dedicated to his art and appeared to howton
to be a seriousminded KEY choreographer. He showed a certain effesinite
manner in his gestures and remarks ( speaking only in Spanish) character-
istic of many persons in his profession. He accepted an invitation to
meet again with Rowton at 2300 at the Kinneret Restaurant on 31 October,
1967, so that Rowton and he could revisit the Señorial night-club to see
the Greek musicians perform.

LIRING/3 promised howton to get in touch with meyes to determine moti-

1. LIRING/3 reported to "owton at 0900 on 30 October, 1967, that he
had finally manged to have a private talk with Rodolfo Reyes Cortes,
his Mexican chereographer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 October, 1967;
and that, in the course of conversation, Rodolfo Reyes had revealed
to LIRING/3 in confidence that the reason why the LIRINGS had assumed
a rather cocl attitude toward LIRING/3 over the past year. Rodolfo
Reyes explained that the last time he was in Havana he had heard rumors
among his friends in the Mexican colony, that LIRING/3 was working
"either for #CFIRM or the Cubans". Rodolfo went on to say that the
origin of this rumor, as far as he could ascertain, was the fact that
LIRING/3 had made two trips into Havana for no known specificreason and
at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that he himself did not
believe the rumors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or
not, commented to LIRING/3 that other members of LIRING/3's profession
were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were
always quick to draw their own conclusions.
2. LIRING/3 commented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken bi
and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly whất
the LIRINGs thought of them, since their own conscience was clear: II-
RING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop his
commercial activity in Chiapas ( especially since Acdolfo Reyes' home is
by coincidence located in San Cristóbal) so that word would gradually
filter back to the LIRINGS that he actually did have financial resources
outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the LIRINGS
did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all
contact with him as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIRINGS
had certain suspicions, they naturally warned all his friends and former
contacts (including, of course, Arnol Rodriquez) to avoid close contact
with him until their doubts could be resolved.
3. Tn reply to ĥowton's query LIRING/3 stated that Rodolfo Reyes and Carmen
Molina (separately) had commented to him that they were favorably impresseu
by Rowton and did not voice any suspicion of Rowton's bona fides (as a
Greek leftist businessman). Carmen Molina, in fact, had gone so far as to
show some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to Howton pre-
viously since she was anxious to develop some sort of lucrative business

dealing with him. Carmen Molina commented to LIRING/3 that she felt
sure she could help Rowton in his business and political problems and
at the same time make a little much-needed money for her own living
expenses.
-
4. LIRING/3 continued that he had been maintaining discreet personal
contact with Carmen Lozada over the week-end ( be commented that LIRING/4
has already shown some signs of jealousy and therefore he and to be careful
not to give her cause to distrust him). LIRING/3 stated that Carmen Lo-
zada had told him that her father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing
in Coyacań, had remarried tand that her step-mother was a Cuban sicentist
Mad lived many years: in Mexico. She added that both her father and
step-asther were on excellent social terms with Ambassador Hernández Armas.
She revealed that she had already notified her husband, Enrique Ramirez,
that she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest both
from him ( in Havana) and her father and step-mother, both of whom were
"puritanic" despite their "progressive" convictions. She added that she
expected Enrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received
her letter and to appeal to her father and step-mother to save his mar-
riage. She, however, insisted to LIRING/3 that she had made up her mind
that she would go through with the divorce. She added that for this reason
she did not wish to live with her father and had decided to stay with
her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divorce papers were through and 'the
storm had blown over. She added that she did not particularly like being
a house-guest in the small aprtment of Carmen Moling, but at the moment
she had no choice.

Headquarters notes that on 9 August 1967 LIRING-3 |
was in contact via LIFEAT with one Electa LNU.
Given
LIRING-3's artist background and the subject of
conversation the visit of Rodolfo Heisler, a Swiss
artist, to Cuba it is suggested that Electa INU
might be Electa ARENAL (201-173795), the mother-in-law
of David ALFALO Siquieros the well-known Mexican Communist

Reference:
1. Forwarded under separate cover are six reports dated 31 July, 5, 11,
14 and 17 (two reports) August 1967 concerning the LIRING-3 Operation prepared
by Wallace B. ROWTON.
2. The first three reports 31 July, 5 and 11 August deal with the recent
Moises CROZCO Leal "affair" (see reference) and it's aftermath. The 17 August
seport, which reage on also deals with
Laims,
this subject. LIRING-3's conversation with Mercedes *PEREIRA (report dated
14 August 1967) was reported in MEXICO CITY 2476.
3. ROWTON's report dated 17 August 1967 is of some interest,
A. The departure of the secretary LIRING™4 previously filled in
for reopens the possibility that LIRING-4 may, again, work at LIRING.
LIRING-4, in fact, recently received a necklace from this secretary
(a rather unespected gift at this juncture).
B. The report indicates that LIRING personnel have doubts about
some of LIRING-3's activities (this is not too surprising).

be rade. He added that the last time he talkeith 1/4 she appeared a
little reluctant to get involved again, explaining that she commzented
when discussing the shortate of funds (2-3,000 dollars) that she was glad
that she wasn't still working and hence not subject to any investigation.
1/3 promised to put pressure on T/A to cccept the job. He noted with sa-
tifaction that 1/4 had recently received a message from Araceli Capero
that she had a cift (neclace) for her. 1/3 afted that 1/4 has not rushed

1. At his mosting with Exton at 1100 on 14 August, 1007, LIRING/3
reported that he had learned from Presto Capuano that and Mercedes
Pereira, his Spanish relovationary friend, was living at Disgonal
San Antonio 4, in apartment 6. (decorting to 2/3, his interest in
Pereira was revived by a corment made to bin by Moisés Cronco Deal
on 31 July, 1967, to the effect that hercedes Iereira was in bexico)..

2. DIRING/3 continued that upon learning her address be called on sri.
Pereira unannounced at 1030 on 13 August with 1/4 and fortunately
found her in with her 17-rain-912 son, Immands. He found the aparinent
allost completely unfurnished, except for a table and several chairs
tu a mum of secroom furniture. According to I/3, Sra. Pereira
explained that she and her son had just returned to Mexico and were
organizing their household on their very limited resources. She siind
that her son had found work in a factory and that she hoped to locate
a job as soon as her Mexican immigrant papers came through.
3. She and her sch welcomed III/3 and after so many years,

ara. Fereira confessed later in the conversation that she was expecting
1/3 to visit her since she had already received word from Ernesto Capa-
aac. She then recounted to 1/3 and 1/2 the vicissitudes and turnell of
her life since she had last seen them in rana(in 1964). She stated
that her very confused citizenship status bad continued to plague ter

forced to leave in effect as a "gusanita”. The said that ber mother and
sister, Sofia, were still in Havers, and aided that her sister is still
working at the Czech Embassy. She also stated parenthetically that her
sister, Sofia, was hoping to be transferred to the Gzęch Imbassy in He-
xico City in the near future, where she had worked prior to going to Ha-
V208.
4. Sra. Pereira stated that she was greatly disillusioned with the Cubans
and felt that the Tricentinental had done more harm than good by truzze
ting its. intention of helping all Latin American revolutions. She com
mented that the situaton in Quatemala, which she had recently visited
as a tourist with Spanish uments, was very bad for the revolutionaries.

not operate as freely as he would like. The stressed to 1/3 that Capuano
was closely watched and could be a contact that right concsirably, compro-

was being extremely cautious because of her post history in Guatemala as "
well as Havana, and had even gone to the length of paying a considerable
sum to have her file remoted from Gobernación, so that there would not be
a trace of her travels to Cuba and Guatemala. She explained that after
leaving Havara, she and her sch went to Spain and sanaged to collect a
small inheritance ( about 7,000 pesos in value) and at the same time took
out Spanish papaers and was issued a Spanish passport, as a refugee. LI-
RING/3 explained to Rowton that sra. Fereire had been born in pain, but

IIDING/3 Report of Contact with Hoisés Crozco Leal.
At 1100 on 11 August, 1947, at hte safehouse Rowton leanted from
HIRING/3 that Moisés Orozco Leal telephoned hin the previous afternoon
to thank him for the letter and the interest be has shown in hin. /3
stated that he told Crozco that his main concern was what it anything
the Mexicans had asked hin about 2/3 and whether he had been forced to
reveal any of 1/2's business ( in Guatemala ). Recording to 1/3,Crosse
assured him that, altho the Merican police had asked hiz "hang and
repeated queations" about his travels, be reveled nothing about 1/3.
One of the questions asked repeatedly by the His was what be 'new
about the busband of a certain Aura Harina. Croco claimed that be thew
nothing of this person and so regiben an one begative th
rozco continued that be could not let 2/3 know there he was at the moment
but would get in touch with him in a short time, as soon as the best was
off, through his mother. Recording to I/2, Crocco's mother's home has been
searched several times since Crozco's release on 4 agust,1967.
2. HIRING/3 then explained that after he leamed of Crozco's arrest and
release ( through Ernesto Caroanc) be felt it it that he communicate
with Crozco to determine what Orozco had reveiled to the Mexican police
and how he was treated. He therefore sent a telegram to Crozco addressed
to Orozco's mother at her home address (Calle Tennis 408,00l.Counter Club
on 6 August, simply asking Crozco in double talk to get in touch with hin
When nothing happened, 1/3 continued, he sent amic/4 around to Crozco's
nother's home about 1030 on 9 August with a short note, the tent of which i
is as follows:

1. LIRING/3 reported to Low at 1700) on #/0/07 that he informed by
Sergio Valdez that morning that Alberts Dusings of Siempre was taking
plane to Havana that afternoon. 2/3 stated that he took this opportunity
write a hasty note to Arnol Rodriguez explaining recent developments in
Moisés Crozco Leal affair and asking Arnol to expedite new contact for
1/3 with PAR either in Havana or hatemala City. 1/3 explained to Ros-
ton that in order put beat on Arnal and FAR he wrote that if he not it-
vited to Havana within-sext the weeks he will definitely be in Guatemala
City staying at hotel Florida from 21-22 August and that new FAR liaison
should identify himself as José is. He added that Arpol should cable
him using code "Ia medicina esté en mal estado" in event' FAR wished his
keep out of Crozco affair.

2. L/3 stated that Certio Taldes personally asked Alberto Domingo de-
liver sealed envelope containing this letter to anal sodriguez. Valdez
feels that Domingo will not read latter, although it anxizixzZE mentions

contacted also?" According to 1/3, he asked Valdez Low it was possible
that he knew of any new contact that he had, and Taldez replied: "I'm in
this thing also." LINING/3 continued that this statement of Valdez zo
surprised and disturbed him and he decided to investigate to what extent
Valdez was involved in the whole affair of the Guatemalans. In the absence
of Rewton he had no resources other than his own ingenuity. He decided to
disappear so that he could investigate more securely and he informed L/4
that he had to make a trip to Chiapas. He then telephoned Valdez several
tines, disquising his voice, and pretending to be "Valentin" in the Espe
of eliciting some sign of recognition froz Valdez. I/} conţinued that this,
however, did not work and he failed to prove any connection between Taldez
and Crozco. 1/3 explained then that he did not want to reveal this to low-
ton, first because he was afraid that Rowten would consider him stupid or
umbotomood and scoonaly because on CD Right|1 2/4. Ic
added that he hoped Horton could understand the terrible pressure he was
living under from all sides, with people contacting him, surveilling his
movements, controling bin. In fact he felt trapped by unknown force. He
Ee
stated that for instance he was certain that he entrance of Sergio Valdez
and Raúl Moreno on the scene was not coincidental but was part of scze
larger picture that he could not understand. He added that this tize he
was determined to find out how Valdez was linked with Crozco.
4. Norton then asked I/3 what he knew about Crozco. 2/3 replied that he
knew only what Crozco himself had revealed to him, viz., that his nother
was living in Mexico City, that his father had ±к never been progressive
and had in fast been arrested by the government (presumablý Arbenz) tut
had not been harmed since he had been so honest" and his réputation was
above reproach. Orozco also informed 1/3 that he had been to Cuba several
times and recently was in touch with Montes in Guatemala and up to recent-
ly had been doing propagania work for the FAR.
I
5. Rowton then stated that he had been doing his best to collect as much
information on Crozco as possible and that he was far from happy with what
he had managed to uncover to date. He explained that he had verified the
address given to him by 1/3 ( Calle Tenis 22/5) but discovered that it was
the home of Crozco's mother and that Crozco was not actually residing
there. He added that he had also learned that Crosco's father was protab-
ly unstable mentally and that his brother worked in Folitica,ard this mig
night account for. Valdez' connection wtih him' (Valdez' working for Rafaga)

21 July,1067
Wallace B. Roston Heeting with IRING/3.
1. Howton hat with R/3 at 1700 on 31 J17,1967, at the safehouse.
1/3 reported at once that he had moved hid family into the safehouse
and that 1/4 and their child were out at the moment so that he and Roston
could talk privately. He explained that things were moving very rapidly
and that Miosés Crozco Leal was in fact staging at his apartment (Tacuba-
ya) in preparation for the trip they were to take to Tapachula. He stated
that be had zet with Crozco as planned at 2200 on 29 July and, after a
lengthy talk, Crozco had asked to be put up in 2/3's apartment for the
night, since it was late and it would be better in view of the trip that
they planned to take together. 1/3 commented that Crozes appeared quite
nrevous and was particularly concerned about answering the door in the
event scheone mocked while 1/3 was away. It was agreed that he would
answer the door caly in the event that there were three knocks, indicating
that the person was LIPING/3 himself. According to L/3 Crocco stated that
he had at all costs to get to Tapachula within the next two or three days
to meet FAR contacts that were expecting him there. Be expressed fear of
traveling by plane or even train and welcomed the suggestion of 1/3 that
the latter's friend Raúl Horeno drive hizand 1/3 to Tapachula in Horeno's
car. I/3 commented to Rowton that be was smazed at the knowledge Crozco
had concerning him and his activities, including the dates of his (I/3's)
trips to Guatemala and Cuba.
2. Howton then realizing that 1/3 had probably walked into a dangerous
trap, queried hin very carefully concerning the origin of his contact with
Crozco. Howton explained that he was certain that 2/3's story of the trip
to Tapachula and the meeting with the Guatemalan woman there wasuntrue and
that be assumed that L/3 had a good reason for distorting the truth. Row- ;
ton continued that he had come tothe conclusion that 1/3 had had a domestic
crisis again and had decided to disappear for a few days and had told his
wife that he had to go out of town on business for Roston. He was therefore
forced to lie to Howton also for fear that 20 ta might disclose the truth
to 1/4. Roxter stressed that it was essential that he know the true facts
sɛurrounding the first contact with Orozco, since, as 1/3 would see later,
it might be a matter of life and death, for bin.
3. LIRING/3 then confessed that he had not actually made the trip but not
for the reason Rowto supposed. The real reason he explained was that when
Orozco contacted him he saw Sergio Valdez shortly thereafter and the lat-
ter to his amazement commented:" I have been contacted. Have you been

to check out to the effect that Crozco had been in Guatemala in sy
1967 assigned to some guerrilla activity in the Coman area but bad un-
expectedly disappeared and returned to Mexico, probably bochuse he was
afraid of capture. L/3 exclianed in evident surprise: "Then he's a de-
serter!" Horton agreed that this might be the case and added that this
would explain why he wanted to hide out in 1/3's apartment. L/3 then j-
reed that this probably was the case and exclaimed again:" But then it's
very dangerous for hix me to be sheltering him!" Rowton agreed but urged
1/3 to keep calm end exploit the opportunity to learn from, Crozco the
true facts of his present relationship to ZAR and how he came to use 2/3
unwittingly as a refuge. E/3 asked Rowton how he could confront Crozce
with his suspicions and get him to reveal what Kowtin wanted to know. Row-
ton then suggested that 1/3 drop casually the name of Ernesto Cancere.
saying that se had to see this lawyer the next day on some business. Row-
ton explained that he thought this would force Crozco to talk since he
would naturally be fearful of 1/3's revealing his wherabo its to Capcano.
L/3 replied that he would millingly do this but unfortunately he did not
know Caposno. He suddenly thought, however, of a ruse that light work. He
could get in touch immediately with Jacobo Rodriguez Fadilla, who would
certainly know of Capoano, and get as much information on Caponano from
Jacobo before springing the name on Orozco. Rowton agreed and stressed that
it was essential that I/3 get as much of the true story from Crozco that
night as possible. He urged 1/3 to pose as a friend and offer to put ag
Orozco in some other safe place, explaining that his continued presence
would jeopardize his own position vis-a-vis the FAR.
6. During the meeting 1/3 positiviely identified the photograph (Fassport)
that Rowton showed him of Moisés Crozco Leal. 2/3 commented that Crozes
now was wearing glasses and a moustache and had shaved his head, giving
himself the sõpearnace of a person of at least 45 years of age (his trre
age is 37,according to his own statement). 1/3 recalled that Crozco in-
formed hin in passing that Leonardo Castillo of FÅR had been killed in
action recently.---
?. In view of the urgency of the developemtrs Rowton arranged another
meeting with 1/3 that same evening ( 31 July) at midnight at Sanborns
Reforma..

TO "CAUSE" (SENT ADDRESSERS IN AMMA 32- &ND 32807 AFTER SPEAKING
SECURITY - PROVOCATION BASED ON FOLLOWING POINTS:
A. JURADO TOO EAGER AND INSISTENT ON CONTACTING FAR
LEADERS..
B. JURADO, WHO-SUPPOSEDLY-IN-ARMS BUSINESS TO MAKE
MONEY, OFFERED OROZCO MONEY FOR FAR (322 DOLLARS). ACTUAL
ARYS SELLER WOULD MAKE NO SUCH OFFER.
C. JURADO WANTED TO MAKE FAR LEADERS AWARE OF CROZCO'S
TRAITOROUS ACT AND ARMS SELLERS USUALLY TAKE NO INTEREST IN
INTERNAL PROBLEMS OF GUERRILLA GROUPS THEY SELL TO.
D. CAPUANO DOES NOT BELIEVE "GREEK" EXISTS AND JURADO
USED THIS AS "COVER" TO PENETRATE FAR MOVEMENT.
2. CAPUANO ASKED LIREBEL-2 TO AID IN INVESTIGATION OF
JURADO. FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO INTERROGATE OROZCO ON HIS RELATION-
SHIP WITH JURADO TO DETERMINE HOW FAR JURADO HAS PETETRATED THE FAR.
CAPUANO SAID THERE IS NO PLAN TO DO JURADO BODILY HARM FOR THE

TO GUATEMALA WHERE HE ACTUALLY CONTACTED FAR NOR OF HIS MEETINGS

wife of a "ccrefero de trabaje" of Schos. Copy being pouched.
2. In letter Cohca states he understands 1/3's situation "since it is
necessary to move ahead with one's own resources and to prove with
deeis”. He addes that he hoped to send izzix "merete and complete-
news” but he still laboring under difficulties known to 1/3 e assures
1/3 that he has delivered 1/3's last letter to Azzkid the "coipañero*
(Arnol Rodriguez) but could not talk with him privately because of the
many visitors who had arrived that day. irmol's wife Ruby told him that
they had received L/3's letters and had answered the ( 1/3x told Row-
to that be has never received these replies from Arnol). Niby Rodriguez
also informed Cohoa that the organismos corres clientes" were going to
invite 1/3 to Havana. Ochoa promised 1/3 that he would do whatever he
could to expedite this trip ( hacer nuevas gestiones).
2. Ccica complains of the "realidades que te han tocado vivir aquí" xxx
but indicates that he has no intention "resign himself" to bureaucracy
commenting that it is necessary "provocar la rupture, lagrediendo a
rascarse con las propias uñas", taking the initiative and nou expecting
anything from anyone. He adds that he has finally out the "ties which
have bound’hiz to Cuba and although he feels that he can do a great deal
there, but it is"infinitiely small in comparison with what he must do ex
outside". He assures 1/3 that be is serious and that it concerns a
"planteamiento serio".

3. Cohos also cautions I/3 against losing sight of the ultimate objective.
in his commercial activity, inlicating that he has discussed this as-
pact of 1/3's plans with "a friend" who knows some of these questions
better that 1/3. He adds that L/3's "asuntos y activitades" interest
him intnsely, and that their situation is similar.

Estimado Carliche:
Hoy hace más de un mes que recibi tu carte, per les
conversaciones telefónicas sostenidas habrás podido comprender que
la donora en contestarte se debe, no precisamente a apetía do m² per-
nº
to, sino`falta de canalas esocuados para tal-fin.
==

Esta to la envió por la gentileza de un compañero
trabajo cuya eppesa va hata ése, dicho sea de pago yo no la conozco a
ésa,dicho nella
ella, por lo tante es realmente una casualidad que te pueda enviar ne-
1
ticles;pere oien no quería demorar més y he aquí estas lineas.
i
Creo que entiende perfectamente tu situación, pues'est
necesario abrirse paso con los propios medios, demostrar con hechos;es-
to puede que el principle to huela a conseje,pere realmente no le es
pues precisamente la idea is he tonado de ti y shore 14'scopte eczo
posición o actitud ante los hechos.Ēra ni desee pederte enviar neti-
cias concretes y amplias esta vez, pero justamente tengo les mimas di- .
ficultades que tu emuneras, a pesar de la cercanía fisica. Entregué tu
carta al compañere no no fue posible hablar con 61 sobre el particu-¨)
lar pues el día que fuf llegaron muchas visitas,antes de que él llega-
ra hablé algo con la señora, concretamente me dije que habían recibi-
dɔ tus noticias, que también; te habían contestado;que te iben a inviter
los organismos correspondientes pere que elles aún no teníen noticiss
concretss;despues como te dijo llegaron las visitas y no pude sscar
to
ninguna conclusión;estino que a estas alturas ya debes tener noticiss;
posteriormente no ho pedido ocuparne de elle principalmente per liss
de mi parte, fundamentalmente, por cuestiones de trabajo.
Ahora bien,
nite promete hacer nuevas gestiones pues
estos días tonge un respire,aunque las gentes per aquí en estos diss
están bastante ecuados con la cantidad de actividades y de aconteci-
zientos especialmente de este mes, pero ya verozos.

UNTIL SGSWIRL CAN BE GIVEN LIRING-3 BY SPANISH SPEAKING OPERATOR
AS REQUESTED BY STATION, FEEL IT WISE NOT PUSH LIRING-3 TO WITTING
LNHARP RECRUITMENT. THEREFORE BELIEVE LIRING-3 SHOULD BE HANDLED
BY SPANISH SPEAKER ABLE PASS NOTIONALLY AS EUROPEAN BUSINESS FRIEND
OF ROWION (I.E. WITHOUT GRINGO ACCENT). ALTHOUGH KNOWLEDGE EUROPEAN

Action Required: For your information.
DOC. MICRO, SER.
1. Forwarded under separate cover are twelve reports prepared by
Hallace D. on the activities of LIKING-3, Liam, and contacts of
the latter.
2. The main topic covered in ROWTON's reports is LIRING-4's efforts to
obtain help in getting LIRING-3 out of jail in Guaterala as soon as possible.
LIRING-4 is almost penniless (RCWTON has made only token payments to het
after 15 June) and has been moving from one apartment to a cheaper one living
on the sale of paintings left by LIRING-3 and small loans from leftist contacts.
In the hope that she may be able to do something for LIRING-3, LIRING-4 has.
resisted all of ROUTON's efforts to get her to undertake a clandestine mission
to PERUMEN, a mission, as Headquarters knows, was planned long ago. is a
foreigner, LIRING-4 cannot work in Mexico without taking the chance of being
deported, if caught. Although she has not tried it, she would probably be
refused a visa to go to Guatemala to visit LIRING-3. She might also face
difficulties in Guatemala including possible detention and interrogation if
she succeeded in obtaining an entry permit to that country.
3. By mid-September 1968 LIRING-4 had received very little help from
her Mexican leftist or outright Communist friends. In spite of promises to
try to bribe the Guatemalan judge scheduled to try LIRING-3 all LIRING-4's
"Friends" succeeded in doing was to print several articles in the local press
(some of them with LIRING-3's photo) claiming that LIRING-3 was unjustly
imprisoned, that he was about to be executed, etc. If anything, these

articles did little to prejudice the Guateralans in favor of LIRING-3.
As a matter of fact, the latter who succeeded in sending LIRING-4 a few
letters via the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City who comes to visit him in
jail, recently claimed that he was saved from a prison "transfer" by the
Guatemalan army by the arrival of the Mexican Consul. LIRING-3 viewed this
"transfer" purely and simply as an execution attempt.
4. LIRING-4 received even less help from LIRING who told her that
there was nothing it could do to help LIRING-3. LIRING-4, on the advice
contained in one of the notes sent from prison by LIRING-3, kept away from
LIRING and its employees until she met LIRING-10 by accident at the office
of one of the leftist papers on 27 July. LIRING-10 convinced her to resume
her visits to LIRING. That the local PIRUMENs still have doubts about
LIRING-3 despite his imprisonment in Guatemala is indicated by the statements
made by Rodolfo REYES (see ECATON's 17 July report) to the effect that the
latter would not be willing to help LIRING-3 until he found out on what
side of "el griego" (RONTON under false identity) he was. REVES added that
LIRING suspects the "griego" of WOR IBM connections, although it has no
definite proof of this.
5. Statements such as those made by YES confirm the station's belief
that LIRING, upon orders from home, is still attempting to investigate
FORTON. Such statements also re-enforce the decision of the Statior. not to
Such an
attempt, through liaison, to obtain the release of LIRING-3.
attempt, if it leaked, would not only expose LIRING-3 to PERUMEN and
Guatemalan FAR reprisals, it would probably also have adverse repercussions
on RONTON's security. LIRING-11 whom RONTON met briefly on 5 July (see
RCWTON's report dated 9 July) said nothing about LIRING-3's arrest when
ROWTON complained that mail which he said be sent to LIRING-3 remained
unanswered. It is also to be noted that REYES, who of course knows that
This
LIRING-4 is in Mexico, told RGTON that she was probably in PBRUMEN.
shows clearly the distrust with which LIRING views RONTON.
CCC: GOYM

6. LIRING-4 developed close relationship with Orlando SUAREZ of the
Ministry of Culture now in Mexico at the invitation of the Mexican Communist
mural painter David ALBARO Sisceiros. By mid-September, in fact, SUAREZ
was staying at LIRING-4's aparement although LIRING-4 claimed to ROWTON that
there was no romancing between the two and that SUAREZ used her apartment
because he was too broke to get one of his own. In view of LIRING~4's
assessment of SUAREZ as very leftist and pro-AMTHUG-1 no effort was made to
approach him.
}
7. Contacts between RCWTON and LIRING-4 have taken place with decreasing
frequenty because the usefulness of LIRING-4 to WOFIRM has sharply decreased
and because LIRING-4 is more and more convinced that RCATON cannot or will
not help her obtain the release of LIRING-3. In her frantic efforts to do
something for LIRING-3, LIRING-4 has in fact not had any contact with RONTON
since early September. Unless LIRING-3 is released by the Guatemalan
authorities or receives only a light sentence keeping him in jail only a short
time longer, it is doubtful that LIRING-4 will be of much use to ROWTON and
the Station.

BER
EDMA-34682
3. The product of LIZING-4's efforts to case the
LIRING consulate will be reviewed in a separate dispatch
which will also transmit floor plans and drawings of that
LIRING component. There is little question that the news
of LIBING-3's arrest in Guatemala gained LIRING-4 the syn-
pathy of various members of LIRING including LIRING-3, -9
and -16. They seem to understand LIRING-4's desire to postpone
her departure for PERUMEN after having received her long awaited
PBRUMEN visa. The problem now is to have LIBING-4 leave for
PBRÜMEŇ while LIRING-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala. As
mentioned in a recent cable, ROYTON has encouraged LIRING-4's
plans to try to visit LIRING-3 in jail in Guatemala City as
ROWTON feels that LIRING-3 will probably urge LIRING-4 to
spend in PBRUMEN at least some of the time he has to spend in
jail. As for the conduct of Sergio VALDEZ (see ROWTON's reports
dated 19 April and 6 May), it appears that the latter has delib-
erately been provocating LIRING-4. As this Station sees it,
VALDEZ's purpose was to try to "shake up" LIBING-4 in the absence
of LIRING-3 to test her reactions. It is doubtful that he acted
be did him
kn
indication that he may have been doing this for the PBRUMEN's
(although this is no doubt a possibility). The Station is look-
ing into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ
under surveillance. The claim that ROUTON in alias offered
Carmen LOZADA certain sum of money for intelligence information
in PERIMEN has no foundation.

17 April, 1962
LIAEG/4 Report on Visit to DIRING Offices.
1. Rc.tos e with IIRI G/4 at the Mississippi Restaurant from about 2035
until 2115 on 17/4/65 to rebrief her on her visit to the LIRING office earlier
that day. LI_ING/4 was obviously worried, and said so at one point, about
LINING/3 in view of the total absence of any nous or communication from him..
Howton pretended to be even more ignorant of 1/3's current whereabouts than
L/4 herself, and asked anxiously whether she had learned anything from Sando-
val or lengio Valdez. L/4 replied that Sergio had told her that Raúl Moreno_
while iriting 1/3 and lara to Chiapas had had an accident in the car that had
proved very costly to biz, although fortunately no injuries resulted to anyone.
Valdez continued that Raúl had to appeal to his father for money to cover the
expenses involved in getting the car running again. Veldez did not know what
had happened to its and pre after Raúl Moreno left them (apparently enroute
to Chiapas) and could not provide any further information.
2. As to Sandoval, 1/4 told herton that the latter had again telephoned her
to offer any help she might reed but did not have any neve fion Lera or I/3.
1/4 gave mouton the home address of Francisco Lara as care of Martha I. Lara
de Rodriguez, 16 Avenida 20-74, Zona 12, Cuatemala, Guetezala, tel: 46–17–17.
3. L/4 then reported that she had visited LIKING/Q's office as requested by
Rowton and managed to get another look at the bock-case cabinet in the corner
of the rccs. She ctamented that on entering the premises she was surprised
to find that the typewriter (German make) previously located in the middle
office (that used by kirabal) had been moved into the back office of L/9 and
that äesita, the sife of Luna, was struggling with two fingers to type out
something as she entered. L/4 said that L/9 was quite cordial to her and in-
vited her in for a coffee and presenting her with five tickets to the ballet
performance that evening. then L/4 asked him shther anything had cone in re
her re-entry permit, the latter immediately began opening the mail on his česk
with the comment that perhaps a reply had arrived that morning and he would
check at once. After looking through the mail he replied in the negative but
did not discourage 1/4 from hoping that the refly would be in soon.
4. L/4 then stated to äoston that she noticed that the cabinet in the corner
of the room was bigger thaк and lower than she had recalled from previous visits
and had lɛɛɛ about two inches high. She added that the cabinet which was di-
vided into two sections, the one to the left containing a shelf on which there
was nothing but cigars and cigarettes and the right/isting of a compart-
ment with a door covered with sack cloth (costal) and possibly locked by key.

She stated that the cabinet was placed catty-cornered and that in the rather
spaciousix triangle behind it she could see many rolls of paper, which she
assumed were discarded posters apparently placed there at random. L/4 then
made the attached sketch on a napkin stressing the difficulty she had in pro-
viding hoiton with exact measurements. She added that there were two windows
facing the street, one in the reception room and one in the middle room, but
the only window in the back roon faced on the inside patio and had a venetian
blind and a gauze curtain but no drape.
5. L/4 then told "owton that she had learned f on Jorrin that he would be re-
turning PCS very soon since his replacement had already arrived. He gave 1/4
his home address as Velasquez 94 Altos, e/Infanta y Cruz del Padre, Barrio
Villa Kueva. Hahona, T/ commented to Rumbo wat se would take advantage of
his return (possibly on 22/4/68) to send another letter to Abreu asking for
a definitive reply to her re-entry request. She added that she felt she could
count on Jorrín for this service, she her relations with him had always, been
very cordial.

6. L/4 also mentioned that she had seen and greeted Cepeda who had just re-
turned from Havana (apparently without his wife). 1/9 told L/4 that he himsels
had been in Havana the preceding seek on a regular courior run.

beard anything from I/3 and stated that she was be to worry since
10/3 beto
be had promised to let her kics of an aldress in Chiapas to which she could
write. Boston pretended not to know precisely where and for how long 1/3 -
tended to be away, connecting that he felt it unfortunate that he had been
out of town three days before I/3 had left and did not have the benefit of
a final discussion. hoston alleged that 1/3 had not told him very much in
the letter he had left with 1/4 for hi- inet
in fact,
kali not mentioned anything about Haúl Foreno oving his and Francisco Lara
to Chiapas in his car. In a further effort to
dissuade I/4 from
believing subsequently (when she finally learned of his arrest) that sosten
was respcḍsible for the tragic development, hoston alleged that he had urged
1/3 not to cross the border bat only to guide Lara to a safe crossing point
and return immediately to San Cristóbal.

2. L/4 stated that unfortunately the herself kne« very little of the final
arrangerents. She explained that 1/3 bed tild her that be bad persuaded hafi
horeno to drive him and Lara to Chiapas because of the self-inflicted leg w
wound that prevented Lara from walking any great distance. She added that 1/3 ›
in his last telephone conversation with her told her that Raúl Moreno bed
had
finally "chickened out" and returned to Mexico City. (1/4 made no mention of
Carlos Fersaval and icston ascines that after aúl horezo backed cut of his
previous commitzent, probably even before they left Nexico City, 1/3 turned
to Carlos Fersaval and persu-ded his to drive them to Chiapas in his car, azd
subsequently to accompany thes across the border). L/4 continued that she
was happy that horton had dissuaded 1/3 from crossing the borier becasue she
was well sware of the dangers involved if he fell into a trap or was picked
up by the Gastenalans. She added that she didnt particularly like Francisco
Lara anyway and felt that he was too well known to escape detection.
3. In reply to Hosten's query, L/4 stated that Sandoval of the "thirteenth"
(Yon Sosa Group) had telephoned her several times to ask if he could help ter
in any way, but did not apparently have any news. Nouton suggested that L/4
keep in touch with Sandoval just incase he might have learned spretning frea
FÅR or You Sosa contacts. 1/4 save Roston Sandoval's address as Lerma 54,apt

however,it became clear that Crozco was innocent they would look for some one
else who might have been the source.
5. LIRING/4 stated that this whole conversation had shaken her badly since
it was agais an indication that 1/3 was through no fault of his own accused
of betraying the revolution and she was well aware of the drastic action that
the Guatemalan revolutionaries as well as the Cubans were willing to take
again persons accused even on slin evilence of being traitors. She asked
Howton under no circumstances to reveal this 1 test report to LIAING/3 since
she knew such reports might drive him to do something drastic.

lara did not mention Sandoval's name, apparently for security reasons, but
he had previously told 1/3 that he was calling to determine the shereabouts
of Jandoval. 1/3 also reported that he heard Lara refer to a certain
"El Gato" and to *31 Gordo". 1/3 told Reaton that he could not identify
the former, but it appeared that "El Gordo" referred to the young friend

to the apartment, arriving at about 1700. Roston posed as a French businessman
and introduced L/4 to the over(and his sister) as his secretary.
2. LIRING/4 stated that she was glad to have some ti-e alone with kowton since
she had received a disturbing report from Sergio Valdez again revealing
that reports of LISTAG/210 alleged on with FACT were circulating
in leftist circles. She explained that Sergio Valdez had talked with her at
crday
her apartment (Atoyac) evening ( 15 April, 1958) far into the night
71 about two reports he had received about LIRING/3. Sergio Valdez explained"
that about three weeks previously his father (who works on the staff of
"Siempre" told him that he should be careful in his dealings with LIRING/3
since the latter was a OFACT agent. Sergio Valdez told L/4 that he bacame
indignant at this telling his father that he had known 1/3 for the past ten
years and considered L/3 as his mentor in revolutionary philosophy and had
absolutely no reasons to distrust hin in his current activities. Sergio Val-
des added that he threatened to break with his father unless the latter re-
vealed to him the source of his information. His father finally confessed
that he learned this from Alberto Coringuez, his boss in Siempre, but he could
not say from whom Dominguez had received the report.

told some time ago by General Heriberto Jara (ncs deceased) that he should
be careful in his dealings with LINING/3 since the latter was known to be
a "traitor to the revolution". Sergio Valdez added that Ceneral Joṛa did not
specify any reason for his allegation on cive details.
4. Sergio Valdez, according to L/4, stated in reference to these allegations
that he was quite naturally very disturbed and had hesitated to mention them
to LINING/3 before his departure in order not to upset him. He stated that he
had given the matter a great deal of thought and had come to the conclusion
that Crozco was the person passing out this scurrilous report and that he
intended to get to the bottom of the whole business himself without involving
LIKING/3. He explained that he was planning to organize a group of four or
five armed men to kidnap Orozco and interrogate him until he confessed every-

4. II≤ING/4 also reported that Manuel Marcué Pardiñas had asked her
not to call him at his home again to ask for news, or as a matter of
fact discuss in any way the case by telephone. He stated that he felt the
phone of LIKI_G/4 as well as his own phones were tapped and that possibly
LIKING/4's apartment was being watched. He did not specify by whom or
for what purpose, but LIRING/4 told Howton that she assumed it would be.
either by the Mexican Government or the Hano Blanca of Guatemala or both.
Rowton again encouraged LIRING/4 to move out of the Atoyed apartment end
back into the less conspicuous calzada Tacubaya place, commenting that
this would not only prevent future security risks but also convince the
LIKINGs that she was suffering financially because of LIRING/3's plight
(she stated that she has already intimated this inconversations with the
wife and secretary of the LIKING Chief, as well as with IIRING/2). LIRING/4
agreed nut expressed regret that the Tacubaya apartment did not have a
phone and that she might miss important mail addressed to the Atoyac apart-
ment and arriving after her departure. Rowton suggested one last letter
to the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City simply advising him of the change
of address.
5. LIRING/4 also showed onion the return address typed on the envelope
in which the note from LIKING/3 to her had been forwarded. The actress,
which Howton supposes is notional, placed on the envelope by Ctavio Ser-
estion of
ra ano for security reasons, is as follows:
Carlos Rodriguez
35 Avenida 20-57, Zona 5
Guatemala C.A.

6. Rowton concluded with the comment that he felt LIRING/4 need not take
Marcué's instruction not to visit the LIKING offices too seriously, since
it was a well known and easily ascertainable fact that LIMING/4 had a lo-
gical reason for going there occasionally. Rowton did not wish LIRING/4
to break off relations at this critical time, expecially since LI⠀LG/2 had
commented to her on her last visit that she should feel free to come in at
any time she needed help or consolation during the crisis.

on Melchor Ocampo on 29/4/68. She had to bring her child along since the
16-year-old son of LINING/3 was not at her apartment at the time.

2. HIRING/4 reported that Candeal of the 13th of November Group of Ton
Sosa had again visited her and sho-n great concern for her welfare. He
again offerred her some money, such as he had, but LIRING/4 refused in
vies of his simultaneous complaints of the financial crisis he himself
was undergoing. He explained that since Francisco Lara left he had been
supporting Lara's entire family consisting of Ismate el motor, 18
their two young children. DIRING/4 said Sandoval resched a point in emotio-
nal frustration during the conversation that he exclaimed that he would
have to resort to robbery or a hold-up in order to get the necessary money
not only to support Lara's family but to send screone to Guatemala City
to see LIRING/3 and procure a good lawyer for him. LIAING/4 told “osten
that this upset her so that she spent the rest of the evening pleading
with Sandoval not to commit any criminal act. Sandoval then revealed that
he and his friends had held up a policeman during the Humphrey visit and
taken his gun, since they were short one weapon.
3. LIRING/4, commenting that Sandoval's only income was from selling lan-
guage records for the Cortina Instituto linguistico, told Howtor that she.
promised to contact all her friends in an attempt to help him sell the re-
cords and thus raise some money legally. L/4 explained to howton that San-
doval's commission is about 350 pesos per set of records, which is actually
the down payment made by the customer (the remainder being paid in weekly

ing customers among his business contacts to help Sandoval.
4. LIRING/4 also reported that Manuel Marcué Pardiñas had visited her at
her apartment late the previous evening. He told her that Carlos Fersabal's
wife, Teresa Lozada, would be accompanying her mother-in-law to Gustemala
City. He also stated that he was optimistic since Carrillo Flores had in-
structed the Mexican Consul to appeal to the Guatemalan Minister of Foreign
Affairs. Harcué commented that unfortunately the Mexican Consul could not
reach this official hisself since he was currently in New York. He hoped
however that the Consul would see the Minister's secretary to arrange direct·
intervention. L/4 commented to howton that Marcus seemed very curious about

LIRING/4 Report of Meeting with Manuel Marcué Pardiñas.
1. Rowton zet with 1IRING/4 for lunch at the Funto Blanco restaurant
on Melchor Ccampo at 1300 on 27/4/68. Roston had given up the safe-
room in the Eotel Suites Harne earlier that morning since he felt it
was not longer necessary.

2. LIZING/4 reported that Manuel Marcu Fadiñas, the uncle of Carlos
Fersabal Marcué, had telephoned her the previous evening "frcutie street"
and arranged to see her privately at the Koala Restaurant, (Horta Tashalo
notel) later in the evening. According to LIRING/4, harcué told her that
through his appeal to Carrillo Flores the case of LIRING/3 and his nephew
was now in diplomatic channels and he hoped that both prischers sould be
simply deported after a summary trial. He could not, however, guarantee any-
thing, especially the length of time involved, and asked: LIKING/4 to re-
frain from any activity that might prejudice the case. Specifically he
instructed LIRE/4 to break off all contact with the Guatemalan revolu-
tionaries in Mexico, the LIKING establishment, and all communication with
the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City. He GEIZEME stressed that any false
move on LIHING/4's part might cause Carrillo Flores to withdraw his inter-
vention. Harcué promised to keep in touch with LIRING/4 so that she would
not feel completely helpless. He added that the mother of Carlos Fersabal
Marcué ( supposedly Manuel Marcué Fardiñas' sister) would be traveling to
Guatemala City in the next few days so that she could visit her son and
follow the case at first hand.
3.AIRING/4 also reported to Rowton that Rodolfo Sandoval of the Im Sosa
group had promised to visit her at her apartment the previous evening at
2200 in the company of Sergio Valdez to discuss matters further. H ad in-
formed her on the phone in making the date that "El Gordo" had returned
from Guatemala City - implying that the latter, had news concerning the
fate of Francisco Lara ( whose arrest was not reported in the press, nor
by Ctavio Serrano, the Mexican Consul, to LIAING/4). LIRING/4 surmised
that Francisco lara had escaped arrest and his involvement with 1ING/3
was not known. She therefore agreed with Marcus that she should not see
Sandoval and the other Guatemalans in public, and especially not at her
apartment.

the LIMING office, but she fended off bio questions by alleging that
questions by alleging that
she had little or no contact with it. I/4 also consented that Sergio
Valdez, who was being particularly helpful to her at this time, varned
her sternly against accepting air money from Marcué in light of his re-
putation as an unscupulous Lothario. 1/4 added that Earcué promised to
see her again the following evening to keep her informed!
5. -hen sowton again suggested that LIMING/4 nove from the Atoyac apart-
ment back to the Tacubaya place despite its dreariness and lack of tele-
phone, she presented no objection, commenting that with all the traffic
in and out of her Atoyac apartment at all hours of the night her reputa-
tion is probably in jeopardy, especially with her iszediate neighbors and
the cleaning women and maids. She promised Horton to move out the following
úby since 14 was the end of the month and a logical time. She also promised
when revisiting the LIBIG office the next morning to make this known, stres-
sing her financial plight.
6. IIXING/4 then appealed to morton to help her establish some sort of
contact with LIHING/), if for nothing else than to find out how be was and
whether he needed anything. L/4 felt that mouton might send some business
contact of his to visit I/3 on Hoxton's behalf, giving some recognition
signal to LIBING/3. When Routen pointed out the danger in this of possibly
naking things worse for L/3, LIRING/4 commented that Sandoval had told her
that visitors were not required to sign a register or give lengthy explana-
tions. L/4 added that she might find someone, including Sergio Valdez cr
Haúl Moreno or one of their friends who might make a short trip to Guatesa-
la City to see LIRING/3. In reply to Roston's query,1/4 commented that she
did not expect anything from the wife or mother of Carlos Fersabal since
they had not even bothered to telephone her since the arrest became known.
7. Koston promised to give the matter some thought and discuss it further
with LIBING/4 the following afternoon.

of 34,000.00 for information on the situation in PBRUMEN. LIGING/4
told howton that she was badly shaken by these comments but attempted
to assume as non-chalant an air as possible and did not question Sergio
Valdez to determine the exact source. She noted that Sergio Valdez had
mentioned Howton several times to her, always apparently in passing, with
the obvious hope that LIRING/4 would reveal his presence in Mexico and
arrange an introduction to him for sergio Valdez. HIRING/4 agreed with
howton that Valdez was probably provoking her since at all times be ap-
peared to be well disposed toward Sr. Harris from what he knew of his from
LIAING/3. Howton commented to L/4 that the last report concerning Carmen
Lozada appeared to have been fabricated either by Sergio Valdez or one of
his friends, simply on the basis of the fact that Sr. Harris had been in
touch with Iscada while she was in mexico.
4. LIRING/4 then stated that she felt she had to continue to impress Sergio
Valdez with her desperate need for money and accordingly telephoned-the
LIRING gatekeeper in his presence and asked for a loan. Then the gatekeeper
responded favorably, she left Sergio Vallez waiting in the apartment and
went to the LIKING Offices at once to collect the ican. The gatekeeper gave
her 100 pesos on the spot, fortunately in the presence of LIRING/13. 1/4
told Roston that she promised to return the money in the next week, as soon
as she received money promised to her by her father.
:
5. LIKING/4 added that as she was leaving the AING office she ran into
the leftist writer, Jaine Labastida, who expressed his sorrow at the arrest:
of LIEING/3. Labastida commented that someone had told him recently that
a cartoon of some kind had appeared in a Tapachula Lewspaper "against II-
RING/3". When L/4 pressed him he gave a description of the "someone" that
definitely identified him as Sergi: Valisz. L/4 continued that when she
confronted Sergio Valdex with this upon her return to the ppartment, be
hotly denied it, much to 1/4's mystification.
6. LIKING/4 also commented that Manuel Marqué Fardiñas continued to tele-
phone her at very late hours of the right in the hope (she assumed) that
she would invite him up. She called him a "viejo verde" and added that she
had no intention of seeing him alone at her hore at night.

LIRING/4 Report of Contacts with LIKING Office.
1. On 3 May, 1956, LIKI.G/4 reported to Hoston that she had revisited
the LIRING offices the preceding day and noticed that the black tele-
phone was replaced in the riddle office ( where she herself used to
work). She stated that she could not be certain that it was the same
instrument and that it was replaced by one of the LIRIG employees, but
it appeared that way since she had not seen the instrument there on
her visit on the previous Friday (26/4/66) and I-ING/9 had commented
that the telephone would be replaced in thn
2. .ith regard to LIRING/3's current situation, LINING/4 reported that
she had again talked to the Mexican Consul in Guatemala City by tele-
phone on 2 May, 1968, and was reassured that IIMING/3 was in good health.
The Consul informed her that he could visit L/3 on Thursdays and Sundays,
and would be glad to pass any letters that L/4 mig t send to hiu for L/3.
The Consul also commented that the Hexican Releciones Exteriores had in-
structed hiz to take up L/3's case with the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. He added that he hoped with this pressure to persuade the Guate-
zalan government to deport 1/3 within the next ten days.
3. 11HING/4 tten reported what she described as a very disturbing con-
versation on 3 a7,1968, with Sergio Valdez. She related that Valdez had
coze to see her in the morning to apologize for not having any money to
lend her to help her meet expenses. He explained that he had not been paid
by the Revista¿Forque? and was very short of funds himself. L/4 continued
that she would have to appeal to all her friends and those of 1/3 for some
money to tide her over until L/3 returned. She then regretted that she
had not been able to locate "Sr. Harris* but if and when he came to Mexico
again she would have to "renew diplomatic relations"xith him. Sergio Val-
dez the according to LINING/4, laughed and said that this reminded him of
another nasty razor that he had beard. Hs then revealed that Raúl Moreno
hed recently told him that a certain Gonzalez of the Spartaco Club had told
hiz (Moreno) that lIRING/4 had been fired from the HIRING offices because
she had been providing information to the PB/RINE Embassy and that he had
learned this from the LIRING "service" officer. Sergio Valdez also men-
tioed that a "girl who worked in the zona rosa" who „nows Teresa or Carmen
Lozada had mentioned that Sr. Harris had offerred Carmen Lozada the sum

0100 that same day that he had just learned that IG/3 and his nepzew
Lad been sentencal to prison, with a minimum term of six months. Haché

home of Gilberto and Blanca Amant (Blanca Peña de Arant), whith whom she was
staying, rather late and found Hanuel Marcus waiting for her. After apc-
logizing profusingly for his previous rude conduct with L/4, he reported
the latest news concerning L/3 to her.

8. LIBING/4 agreed with oston that although the prison sentence was pro-
bably definite, she should check it out with the Mexican Contul personally.
She stated that fortunately she remembered a certain Josefina Rodriquez who
worked in the larga distancia service of Telefonos de México whom she had
originally met as a friend of LIKING/2. L/4 commented that Srta Rodriguez
whom she described as "ruy fea" was enamored of LIRING/2: some years ago but i
stopped seeing him (to her knowledge) when she found out that he was married.
L/4 continued that Orta nodriguez bad already promised to put through lang
distance calls to Guatemala for L/4 without charging the calls, if they could
be arranged during her shift at the switchboard.
3. LIRING/4 also resorted that she had again visited the LIRING offices at
1345 on 7/5/63 and again about 1130 that same morning. It, Rowton's request
she again checked the phone in the third office. On the first visit the of
fice had already been closed but she ran into LIRING/13 at the gate and ac-
cepted a ride home ( she felt this fortunate since he dropped her at the
Tacubaya apartment at her request). On this occision during a brief excbang,
of comments with the gatekeeper and L/13, LINING/4 learned that LINING/2
will return from : BRUMEN on 10/5/68. CS CIPX

the instrument. She also rcted the word "Gall" but could not tell whether
it was part of the manufacturer's Doze or a Mexican or U.. subsidiary.
She also noted that below the receiver were four switches (like the ordinary
push light switches) unmarked or unnumbered. When she exclaimed to acsita:
"How do you dial on this phone", Rosita replied: "But it's not a phone.it's
an intercom". LINING/4 told mouton that she then commented: "But how come,
the intercom is in the first office." Rosita the, according to 1/4, stated:
"Eut that's a special intercon." (1/4 explained that she was referring to the
phone she had in her hand).

noted that the phone which had been replaced in that of hoon
manufacture and was the same instrument previously there when she worked in
that office. She asssums that the LIRINGS replaced the phone themselves.
6. LIRING/4 also told foster that she had located an excellent apartzënt
in the Edifico Condesa ( Matzatlán and Veracruz) through her friend Blanca
Peña who lives in the same development. LIRING/4 added that she had given
the administrator 300 pesos to hold the apartment for her until she could
arrange a fiador. She also stated that she could obtain a telephone eventuall

LIAING/4 reassured nowton that she was telling everyone, particularly “the
LIRINGs, that she was living at the facubaya apartment and temporarily stay-
ing as a house guest at the home of Blanca Peña de Azant. She also reassured t
Rowton that she had informed the LINING gatekeeper when she returned the 100
peso lean that she had received money from her father in New York. LIHING/4

According to reports submitted to Wallace B. RONTON by
LIRING-3, the latter set Carlos Manuel Persaval Marcue originally
through the latter's sister-in-law, Carmen Lozada de Ramirez.
who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair with LIRING-3
since early November 1967. On the evening of 3 March 1968,
Persaval approached LIRING-3 in connection with the difficulties
that a young Guatemalan woman living in Mexico City was having
in obtaining false documentation to enable her to travel to
Guatemala to recontact her husband, whom Persaval described as
'an important guerrilla leader”. Persaval revealed to LIRING-3
that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in Mexico
for some time and gave LIRING-3 several copies of a pamphlet
entitled "Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been
published on one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at the
nominal price of three Mexican pesos to help raise money for the
FAR.
1
3. When LIRING-3. under RONTON's direction, responded
favorably to this initial approach, Persaval pursued the matter
and finally, on 8 April, reveal that he was in touch with two
"impont:
icalics"
..> who needed help in returning
clandestinely to Guatemala. Persaval asked LIRING-3 to arrange
to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of
Chiapas, an area LIRING-3 had previously told Persaval he was very
familiar with from his previous residence in San Cristobal.
Persaval made no further reference to the "young Guatemalan wife
of the FAR leader”. LIRING-3 surmised to ROWTON that this person
might actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but
that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip
by Lara himself.
4. At ROWTON's urging, LIRING-3 insisted on meeting the two
Guatemalans involved and in talking to then before undertaking
such a mission. Persaval finally introduced LIRING-3 to Francisco
Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRING-3
to a certain "Rodolfo", who LIRING-3 ascertained subsequently was
a member of the 13th of November group headed by Yon Sosa by the
name of Sandoval. Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING-3
that he had in his possession a false Guatemalan passport in the
name of Jose Maria Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal
residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts
of ex-Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas. He also named a certain
Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons who assisted Guatemalan exiles
in Mexico. Station believes Eskenazi may be identical with
Luis David Eskenassy Cruz, a former agent of the Guatemala City
Station.
5. With the approval of ROWTON, LIRING-3 agreed to help
the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/Guatemalan border
and to accompany them to Guatemala City. This latter extension of
the original trip was made by Lara at the suggestion of LIRING-3
so that the latter could meet with the FAR woman responsible for
logistics. LIRING-3 reported to ROWTON subwequently that just
before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING-3
to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to meet directly
with FAR and 13th of November leaders to discuss further support
that LIRING-3 might be able to provide through his commercial
contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.
6. LIRING-3 fabricated a false Mexican identity document
(Secretaria de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the
name of Jacinto Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so
that the latter could move about more unobtrusively on the Mexican
side of the border just prior to crossing. On 3 April 1958,
just prior to their scheduled departure date, Francisco Lara

During the 14-15 April week-end, Guatemalan
authorities arrested three individuals near the Mexican
border. They were brought to Guatemala City where they are
being held for interrogation.
The persons arrested are:
a.
FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS (Guatemalan)
CARLOS JURADO DEL MAR (Mexican)
b.
CARLOS MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE (Mexican)
c.
When arrested LARA admitted that he is a Communist, and that
he is returning to Guatemala to renounce his affiliation.

7. The G-2 of the Guatemalan military was not success-
ful in its interrogation of the Suhion Tinion attempted
it but was compelled to conduct its interrogation in the
presence of G-2 officials who continually interrupted.
Liaison was attempting additional interrogation under more
favorable circumstances. Meanwhile G-2 is considering turning
over the Subjects to the "Army Special Unit" for further
interrogation.

informed LIRING-3 that their mutual friend Rodolfo Sandoval.
would not be accompanying them since he was too well known and
his mission was not important enough to justify the risk and the
expense involved.
7. LIRING-S did not depart as he had hoped on 5 April 1968,
because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle
on the morning of that day while cleaning his gun and had to be
given medical attention before he could make the trip. LIRING-4
told ROWTON that LIRING-3, Francisco Lara and Raul Moreno, a
friend of LIRING-3, finally left Mexico City in the personal
car of Raul Moreno on 10 April 1958. but that Moreno had returned
to Mexico City two days later as a result of an accident that
disabled the car somewhere in Chiapas. LIRING-4 did not report
anything concerning the subsequent involvement of Carlos Persaval
Marcue, stating that she had not received any communication from
LIRING-3 after his telegram of 12 April, in which he reported
the return of Raul Moreno. ROWTON surmises that when Raul
Moreno had to return to Mexico City. LIRING-3 and Lara asked
Carlos Persaval Marcue to join them and drive them to the border
in his mm cor and that Persaval continued on with them toward
Guatemala City.
8.
t
Guatemala City Station advised on 22 April 1968, that
the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING-3 had reached
the local press and that they would be turned over to the appro-
priate courts for trial. This indicates that LIRING-3 may
eventually be released and bence be available to ROWTON for
complete debriefing.
-
9. The only significant name that had surfaced as a result
of LIRING-3's involvement with the Guatemalan rebels in Mexico
City is that of Rolando/Wendez Aguilar, whom Francisco Lara
Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from
the home telephone of LIRING-3. (This number corresponds to the
"Publicaciones e Impresiones Mexicanas. S.A. Diario Ovaciones,
Calle Lago Sirahuen 297, Mexico City). From the LIFEAT coverage
on LIRING-3 it is apparent that Mendez is a close contact of
both Lara and Sandoval and may be providing or have provided
employment for them in Mexico. The Station is attempting to
determine the home address of Mendez in the hope that further
details of his possible collaboration may be uncovered.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: LIRING-3 Visit To Guatemala With Guerrillas
FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARRA BARRIOS and CARLOS
MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE
J
'
I
;
1.
On 5 March 1968, LIRING-3 had dinner with CARLOS
PERSAVAL MARCUE, nephew of MANUEL MARCUE PARDINES, director
of the now defunct magazine "POLITICA", a Communist bi-
monthly publication. During the dinner PERSAVAL queried
LIRING-3 if he could obtain a false passport for the wife
of an important Guatemalan guerilla leader so that she:
could tramite to urate.ia. LIKING-3 replied
that he would do his utmost to assist.
2.
On 8 March 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two(2)
Guatemalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala
by mid-March. LIRING-3 commented that there was limited
possibility of obtaining false documents, but that he could.
brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitate their illegal
crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,
he would guide them.
11
3. On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter
with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed
·legal travel documents. Since the other person has no such
legal documents, they should enter Guatemala illegally.
✓ MEXI-47907
.
4.
4
LIRING-3 reported on 27 March 1968, that one of the
traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS.
The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to
Guatemala in order to meet an unidentified woman, described
as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from
Mexico.
☐ MEXI-50007
5.
Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-
inflicted gun shot wound while cleaning a weapon. On 10 April
LIRING-3, LARA, and another person--described as a member of
the YON SOSA Faction--departed en route to Guatemala.
LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON SOSA group
are now working together, but that a certain amount of
compartmentation exists.

case of LIRING-3/LIRING-4 the situation is further complicated
by the fact that PBRUMEN nationals at home and in LIRING (the
main target against whom the two have been directed) have ·
long suspected their motives for maintaining contact and
wanting to cooperate with them. The ups and downs of the
LIRING-3/LIRING-4 marital relations have from time to time
further complicated the conduct of operations involving them.
The Station can understand that Headquarters has some reser-
vations on the conduct of these operations. They have been
complicated, time consuming, and have blown hot and cold
depending on the state of mind of the PBRUMENers at the time
and the difficulties between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. Because
of incomplete control, an almost inescapable feature of this
type of operation, a considerable effort was made to check
the reliability of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. This involved

surveillance by the LIEMBRACES. The results, at least in the
PBRUMEN phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so
far. The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 has been
a) as access agents to LIRING, (although this has been
largely reduced to the LIRING Consulate), and b) to introduce
Wallace B. ROWTON to visiting PBRUMEN officials and members
of the local leftist community with access to PBRUMEN and
LIRING. A major effort was started recently to take this
operation up one more notch and, taking advantage of a recent
crisis in the relations between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4, send
the latter to PBRUMEN on a mission to assess and hopefully :
recruit new sources of information. The exploitation of
LIRING-3's contacts with representatives of the Guatemalan
FAR rebel movement was the object of separate correspondence.
LIRING-3's renewed contacts with these representatives do
not at this time involve PBRUMEN, although the latter clearly
supports at least some of their activities.
2. Forwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports
prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON on the activities of LIRING-3,
LTRING=4, and some of their contacts from late January to
31 March 1968. The Station has noted Headquarters' desire
for more frequent progress reports per reference A. It felt,
however, that in this case partial reporting of LIRING-4's
difficulties in obtaining a PBRUMEN visa (by far the most
important aspect of this operation during the period under
review) could have been misleading, as the situation changed
several times and LIRING-4 did not really know what to expect
from LIRING from one meeting with its representatives to the
Next, not to again mention the ups and downs of the LIRING-3/
LIRING-4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.
The Station would like to point out in passing that, in
addition to cable reporting and dispatches transmitting
ROWTON's contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3
and LIRING-4 are involved in are reviewed in some detail in
the over-all monthly report submitted by the PBRUMEN Section
of this Station.
3.
i
The last time LIRING-4 accompanied LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN,
she obtained an entry visa in a few days. LIRING-4 thus felt
that as an ex-employee of LIRING with good connections in
PBRUMEN and LIRING she would obtain a new PBRUMEN entry visa
fairly easily. Entry visas are now quite a bit more difficult
to obtain, however, for PRRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad.
It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know
what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN
for an extended period of time, as this was obviously based
'on a domestic quarrel. LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other
quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last
one would subside and that LIRING-4 would postpone or cancel
her plans for going to PBRUMEN. It was to convince the LIRING
staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious that.
LIRING-3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further
convince the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING-2 and
LIRING-9, that LIRING-4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as
a result of domestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3
openly question LIRING-4's right to take their child with
her. It must be remembered that, in Mexico, a wife cannot
leave the country, and especially take a child with her,
without the express and official consent of the husband.
little scenario appears to have been well played. On the
other hand, it did not help LIRING-4 obtain a visa any faster.
LIRING-2 appeared to be waiting, among other things, for
LIRING-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child accept-

take the child at his 26 February meeting at LIRING.

"consejo superior" of LIRING, of which he said he was a member,
had not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed
by LIRING-16, who told LIRING-4 the same day that nothing
about her visa case had yet been sent to PBRUVEN as he would
otherwise knot it, since he handled all vis correspondence.
4.
There is naturally the possibility that LIRING-4's
visa request was handled by LIRING via classified correspondence
not seen by LIRING-16. This channel may have been used because
LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of
LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRÜMENers. Although
LIRING-2, LIRING-9, and Identity appeared sympathetic toward
LIKING-4 and her projected visit to PBRUMEN (to the point
where they advised her on more than one occasion not to come
back to Mexico), they, at the same time, sought to clarify
two things. They first made another attempt to throw some
light on the sources through which LIRING-3 had obtained
information of particular interest to LIRING. Secondly they
brought up the question of "the Greek" (ROWTON) and tried to
obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRING, as mentioned
by both LikING-Z and luentity, is not used to being
w being given
sensitive information without at the same time obtaining good
source description. Specifically,
Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of
the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case
in 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the
press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the
report on Rico GALAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could
he have learned of certain of the activities of Moises OROZCO
Leal? To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that
he had good sources in Nexico and Central America and that he

was not about to divulge them to the PBRUMENers.
and Identity in their conversations with LIRING-3 and LIRING-4
took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings
with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach." They wanted to
be sure, however, that he "had not fallen victim to unscrupulous
elements constantly surrounding the revolution." To quote the
old cliche, LIRING-3 "got their message.
"
5.
ROWTON's introduction to LIRING-2 and other LIRING
members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings
with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter somewhat curious
about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of
"the revolution" who seems to travel extensively and appears
to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts
of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON's
criticism of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTON's report dated
1 January sent as an attachment to reference B) since he
finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described
in ROWTON's 1 January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made
the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed,
and the operator of ROWTON's answering service answered
"Mr. ROWTON's (in alias) office." This apparently made
LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting
at LIRING on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRING-4 about her
relationship with "the Greek." LIRING-2 wanted to know where
and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report of
17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIRING-2:
appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources
of the information passed LIRING by LIRING-3 and warned
LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek, if not for her sake, at
least for LIRING-3, who "has not always treaded on firm ground."
LIRING-4 provided some "information" on her Greek acquaintance
on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in detail on what

him at least partially on his contacts in PBRUMEN. The only
concrete result of REYES' trip to PBRUMEN so far is the contact
which he made with Sukendah *HANAFI, the ex-Ambassador of
Indonesia in Havana. According to REYES, HANAFI expressed
interest in meeting ROSTON to "work something out" to the
mutual advantage of both the Greek and Indonesian revolutions.
After a couple of phone calls, it turned out, however, that
HANAFI would probably be unable to obtain a Mexican entry visa.
The Station believes, anyway, that little would be gained by
a meeting. From the information at hand, HANAFI is a convinced
leftist who does not lack for money and seems to have an!
enjoyable life in PBRUMEN. The Station is finally not
interested in the Indonesian "revolution" or in what HANAFI
could do to help the Greek leftists.

to further exploit the antagonism LIRING-4 has developed for
the personnel of LIRING in the course of her attempts to.
obtain a PBRUMEN visa to obtain additional operational
information on LIRING and its employees.
employees. LIRING-4 has been
so humiliated and angered that she is willing to do literally
anything against HIRING. She told ROWTON what sus suuiu put
a time bomb in the building if he asked her to do so. LIRING-4
has already been used unwittingly for MHCREDO purposes. It
may be possible if she stays in Nexico City to use her in
connection with an audio operation against the "safe room" of
the LIRING Consulate.

SGSWIRL Examination of LIRING/4.
31 March, 1968
AUT SOFTABLE FOR HIDR
1. LIRING/4 was given an SGSWIRL examination from about 1030 until
1300 c:: 31/3/68 at room 602 of the Hotel del Bosque on Calie Melchor
Ocampo. Howton rented the suite in the naze Nicolas Spyropoulos and no
security problems were encounted in using this site.
-
2. Howton first proposed the examination to LIKING/4, after discussing,
it briefly with LIRING/3, at 1600 on 30/3/68 in the coffee shop of the
Hotel bosque in the presence of the examiner. L/4's initial reaction was
almont identical to that of HIRING/3 one of shock, indignation, and out-
right refusal on the ground that it was "servil" and beneath her dignity
at any price. She made it clear that she felt she had been and was taking
all the risks and consiered it completely unfair that she should have to
enbiect herself to such a "p" gavion wuen
Interrogation when she had done nothing
wrong and in fact knew nothing about Roston. At one point she commented
that this whole thing made her think that Rowton was an agent of WOFACT.
She did not dwell on this point, however, or return to it subsequently.
3. In view of this unfavorably turn at the initial session -owton agreed
with the examiner that the latter should gracefully bow out and give Howton
a chance to soften 1/4 up by a more thorough explanation, expecially since
L/4 refused flatly to accompany Rowton and the examiner to the safehouse
room upstairs. Rowton then spent the next two hours explaining the test
emphasing that it would not include any indiscriminate frivolous questions
and that 1/4 would know beforehand what the precise questions were. Howton
made it clear that he was interested mainly in determining whether L/4 had
betrayed him to her 11HING contacts and had any sort of secret agreement
with PERUMEN to work against him. 1/4 finally agreed to take the examination
the following morning since as she stated her conscience was clear.
4. The responses appeared favorably on pertinent questions and the control
question on any theft of money (suggested by nowton on the basis of the
report given to him in confidence by liring/3 that 1/4 had taken 2,000
pesos from the LIKING safe which she almost immediately replaced on his.
insistence) proved to be excellent. L/4 did not reveal the specific theft
but she was evidently thoroughly convinced after the test that the SGS.IAL
is reliable and cannot be beaten Rowton and the examiner felt it unwiše to
break her on this control question since it would prove counterproductive
and would probably expose L/3 as the source. The test will proably serve
as an excellent deterrent and additi nal control for future assessment of
1/4 and evaluation of her reporting.

LIRING/4 Report of Status of Request for ke-entry Permit.
1. Howton met with LIRING/4 at her request at 1630 on 23/3/66 at the
Denny's Restaurant (Reforma Diana) to discuss the status of her visa
(re-entry) request. She stated that she had just received a letter from
her friend Doctor Yolanda Díaz, transmitted through Jorrin and given to her
by the latter that same morning. The translation of the text of the letter
is as follows:
"Año del Guerrillero Heróico"
La Habana. Febrero 9/68
Sra.
México, D.F.
Dear
I
i
te I omplained to you last night when we spoke
(on the telephone) the processing of your entry is being held up
because of a number of things that have to be done which in t
view of the priorities you known exist result in its not being done
as rapidly as one would wish.
I don't think you should be discouraged and rest assured that as
soon as it comes through, we'll advise you, especially since Abreu
is going to follow it through. Hisses to your child and regards
to Carlos.
/s/ Yolanda
:
2. The letter, a copy of which was made by Howton, also contains a P.S. from
Abreu, a translation of which follows:
I'm taking an interest in your matter. As Yolanda explains
red tape takes time. I received your cable and letter.
Fondly,
/s/ Abreu
:
3. LINING/4 called to Rowton's attention the length of time ( almost six
weeks) for the letter to reach her dispite the fact that Abreu himself most
probably forwarded it through the pouch. 1/4 commented that when she re-
marked this to her friend Catalina Cepero, the latter stated that she had
received a ltter in the pouch the same day but it was dated in December, 1967,
and another from Yolanda dated February 9,1963.
4. LIKING/4 also reported that she had finally managed to talk with her
father on the telephone, and, although he appeared uneasy and somewhat abrupt
(seco), she was reassured that he was in reasonably good health. She finally
assured Howton that she no longer suspected him of any foul play and agreed
that her father was apparently acting on the advice of his lawyer in con-
nection with the visa reugest of her brother (to emigrate to the U.S.) that
was being processed in New York.

she should tell LIRING-2, felt, after listening to LIRING-4's
report, that the latter had at least partly succeeded in
lessening LIRING-2's suspicions. These suspicions may have
been further reduced after LIRING-3's discussion with LIRING-2
on 26 February. ROWTON did expect LIRING-2's questions and
felt in the end that he had "passed the test."
6.
The Station does not know at this point whether
LIRING-4 will get a PBRUMEN entry visa but is still optimistic
that she will. The PBRUMENers appear convinced that there is
serious trouble between her and LIRING-3, and LIRING-1, to
whom LIRING-4 wrote for help recently, asked her to be patient,
pointing out that red tape in PBRUMEN takes time. The
possibility that the PBRUMENers may allow LIRING-4 in their
country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband
and some of her friends has occurred to ROWTON and the Station.
Such a possibility is, however, most unlikely as the object
of the PBRUMEN suspicions is LIKING-3 and not LIRING-4, who
has several times told them that she knows little of what
LIRING-3 does. The most important consideration, however, is
that LIRING-4 is married to a Mexican citizin, and as
suspicious as they may be of the latter's doings, the
DDDINIM'Ors have, to the host of our Imowledge, no proof that
this Mexican has done anything against their regime. On the
contrary, LIRING-3 has time and again warned them of impending
difficulties or problems. The fact that LIRING-4 is married
to a Mexican and that she enjoys the status of immigrant in
Nexico is also the best assurance that she would be allowed
to return to Mexico, as the PERUMENers want no trouble with
the Mexicans. The SGSWIRL examination recently given LIRING-4
has cleared the air at least on two points. First, that
LIRING-4 is not an enemy penetration, and, second, that she
has not revealed the nature and extent of her contacts with
ROWTON to anyone else than LIRING-3. The Station agrees with
ROWTON that LIRING-4 would, if given a chance, prove herself
to be a good asset. As for the question of being left with
continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING-3 and
LIRING-4 know that there is little ROWTON could do beyond
providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING-4 back to Mexico
if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to return to her husband,
an unlikely possibility as mentioned above in view of current
Mexican/PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understanding signed
by LIRING-4 specifies the extent of ROWTON's commitment and
leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations. The
Station hopes that LIRING-4's relationship with LIRING-3 will
not improve with time to the point where she will lose the
proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN
for which she has been trained and briefed.
.
7. The attempt made to exploit Carmen LOZADA's trip to
PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information
on a number of persons she knows who have operational potential
turned out to be a complete failure. LOZADA ran into such
difficult family problems in PBRUMEN that she had no time (or,
as it turned out, desire) to obtain the information requested
of her. The strain of her personal problems was such that
she nearly had a nervous breakdown after returning to Nexico
City on 16 February. Not even LIRING-3 could get anything out
of her. The victim of a type of family blackmail by her pro-
AMTHUG husband, LOZADA returned to PBRUMEN on 15 March.
ROWTON did not fare much better with Rodolfo REYES Cortes,
who returned to Mexico City in early March. REYES, who is
preparing to go to Chile to put on a ballet performance, has.
been extremely busy since his return with private and
professional matters. ROWTON nevertheless managed to debrief

LIMILE/4 Report of News Concerning her Father in New York.
3
1. At 1600 on 22/3/63 Roston visited LIRING/4 at her residence to discuss
with her a report she had received from a mutual friend concerning her fa-
ther. Earlier in the day LIRING/3 had informed nowton that LIRING/4 had re-
ceived a disturbing piece of news to the effect that someone had approached
her father in New York City and told him to break off all contact with LI-
HING/4 in order to avoid jeopardising his residence in the U.S. According
to LIRING/3, LINING/4 was convinced as a result of this report that Roston,
and possibly with the knowledge of LIRING/3 himself, had arranged this ap-
proach to preclude any xxxcontact L/4 night have had with her father that
sight jeopardise her mission to Havana. Rowton assured 1IRING/3 that he had
take no such action and good to talk to RETENC/4 to reassure her also since
according to LIRING/3 she was very upset and her confidence in both Rowton
and LiING/3 himself shaken.
2. Rowton reassured LIRING/4 when he saw her but, of course, could not" fur-
nish proof of any kind that he had not intervened. He asked several tins the
identity of the source, but LIRING/4 seatfastly refused to divulge it, say-
ing only that a layer friend of her father had written to her stating that
the reason her father had not communicated with her over ** the past three
months and had not answered her letters and telephone calls was that "they"
had tolà hám not to maintain any contact with his daughter at the risk of
losing his residence in the C.S. Rowton asked whether the lawyer's name was
·Portuondo (a lead furnished by LIRING/3) but 1/4 would not confirm or deny
this, syaing simply that she would look into the matter herself. She said
that she suspected corton since he was the only person to whom she had given
her father's` address in New York and she could not imagine why any other
person would have a rotire to contact her father in that way. She added that
if her father had just given her some sort of explanation she could under-
stand, but acting the way he did indicated that someone had terrorized bia
into complete silence. Rowton again insisted that he did not in any way
contact her father, and would never have done so without first consulting
ber. He survised that possibly her father's lawyer had counseled him to
break off contact in connection with the application her father was making fr
for a visa for LIRILG/4's brother on the ground that the American authorities
might deny the visa if they knew of LIRING/4's previous employment in the
HIRING offices.

}
1. At 0930 on 9/3/68 L_NG/4 reported to howton that she had again on 2/3
visited the LIRIG establishment to check on the status of her re-entry
permit. She stated that LIKING/2 was cordial but politiely passed the
buck on her re-entry permit to LIRIG/9, stating that it was a matter for
L/9's office and that in any case he himself was so busy looking for a
house for the Chief that he could not do anything else at the moment. He
said in passing that he had to go to icapulco that evening and would te
there until Sunday night (10/3/63). He jokingly invited L/4 along for
the ride. He also commented that he himself would be back in Havana about

he hoped to see her there.

was nothing he could do to speed things up from this end. L/4 replied that
this was after all little consolation for her, although she felt very sorry
for the Swiss mother-in-law.
3. LIRING/4 continued to Rowton that she then spoke briefly with LIRING/9
who greeted her cordially and asked ter to take a coffee with him in his
private office. On entering this office L/4 noted that the plaster had falle:
from the ceiling just above the desk and L/9 commented that expl it had
just happened the day before and that he hoped to have it repaired soon. He
added that he would also be getting better furniture and some pictures to
decorate the bare walls. L/4 noted that the phone was still attached to the
wall and no lamp of any kind was in the room.
4. According to L/4, LIRING/9 is still waiting for a reply from Havana re
her re-entry permit, and hoped to have some reply by 11/3/68. His secre-
tary privately assured L/4 that she would let her know at once if anything
came in. LIRING/4 also reported to Rowton that she talked to her fitend
