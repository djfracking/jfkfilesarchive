On 25 April 1966 the National Liberation Movement (MLN¸·
Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) held a meeting in its
offices at Republica do El Salvador No. 30-301 in observance
of the Week of Solidarity with the Dominican Republic. Only
about 35 persons attended the meets which was chaired by
Luis Cordova Ortiz and Guillermo Chateron Ita, in the absence
of leftist Journalist Victor Rico Gallan who could not attend
because of illness.
Cordova devoted his specia
denunciation of the United
States' "armed invasion" of the Dominican Republic, calling
it an act which has aroused the indignation of the entire
world. On behalf of the MLN he demanded the withdrawal of
U.S. troops from that country.
Guillermo Calderon spoke briefly about the U.S. presence in
the Dominican Republic, but devoted the better part of his
speech to a criticism of the visit to Mexico of President
Johnson on 14 April 1966. He accused the Mexican and United
States governments of having kept secret until the very last
minute the fact of an official visit which was falsely described
as a courtesy visit. The visit was made on the pretext
of unveiling the Lincoln statue, he said, but the fact that
President Johnson brought with him all the members of his
cabinet and his principal advisors, notwithstanding their

June 1943 trip was to interview Pical Castro after his return from the
Coriet Union. Subject claimed that he had spent eight days with Pidel

preoccupation with problems in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic
and elsewhere, proved that Johnson had come to deal with
matters of great importance to him and to Mexican President
Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. Or, he added, was it that Johnson had
come to give instructions, or orders, to continuo his policy
of oppression of the people, in this instance, Noxico.
Calderon criticized sharply the Mexican Government for its
methods in organizing the olaborate reception for Presidont
Johnson. The system of hording together the populace is
accomplished, among other means, through threats made by
union leaders to workers that they will lose a day's pay or
suffer other losses if they do not participate in welcoming
ceremonies. Calderon denounced officials of the Ministry
of Foreign Relations for having remained silent in the face
of a proposal by Secretary of State Dean Rusk for the creation
of an international police force "the type of security
force that has in the past protected countries from North
from
American aggression".

Again on 28 April the MLN hold a meeting in observance of
Dominican Week, this one attended by approximately twenty-
five persons.
It was announced at the last moment that the
journalist Alberto Domingo, who was to have attended the
meeting, would not be present because of a more pressing
engagement. In his absence Armando Castillejos Ortiz
and the poetess Norma Carrasco improvised a program.
expressed regret, that the MLN does not possess adoqunto
publishing facilities to keep the Mexican public informed
of the existing situation in the Dominican Republic. Ho
recommended that those present take advantage of every oppor-
tunity, in their places of work and at gatherings elsewhere,
to disseminate by word of mouth the facts of North American
domination over the wonker nations of the world. He noted
that ninety percent of the citizens of the United States
are not in accord with U.S. foreign policy.
Norma Carrasco's contribution to the meeting consisted of
the reading of pootry which she had composed depicting the
United States' invasion of the Dominican Republic.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION, SOURCE GRADINGS ARR DEFINITIVE, APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
SOURCE, Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla group in
Guatemala who is living in exile in Mexico. He is believed to have
good access to the Guatemalan exile community.
Victor Rico Galan, leftist journalist who writes for both Siempre and
Politica, in planning to visit Guatemala clandestinely to investigate
the disappearance of Victor Manuel Gutierre Corbin, Guatemalan Communist
'Party (ICT) leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico, who
* returned to Guatemala in late February.
Field Comment: TDCS-314/03186-66 reported that Gutierrez Garbin and three
other Guatemalan leftists were arrested and executed by the Guatemalan
authorities on 6 March 1966.
Source Comment: Rico Galan could only enter Guatemala illegally since
he was declared persona non grata by the Guatemalan Government in 1963
ofter he visited the country to Interview President Peralta. While
there, he also managed to talk with Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, guerrilla
leader. Upon his return to Mexico, Rico Galan wrote articles favorable
to the rebels and most unflattering to the Peralta government.
Celan's interview with Yon Sosa was arranged through Adolfo Mijangos
Lopez who is now living in exile in Mexico.

and counsel against letting doctrine replace action. The tape clearly
reveals RICO to be at once a very intellectual loftist who also has his
feet planted quite firmly on the ground. His approach is pragmatic, not
theoretical. The text of the tape indicates that it was made sometime
after February and before mid-October 1764.
There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Galan.
His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. ie apparently is known
personally by LICOOKY-1 and LITAMIL-9 in Mexico City, and these two
sources should be queriod.

VO. BUR.
1. On 13 January 1966 a Mexico City newspaper, El Heraldo, published an article
which cited a taped speech by Victor Rice Galan to Yon-Bosa's guerrillas
as evidence of Rico Calan's efforts to undermine the January 1966 visit of
Mexican President Diaz Ordaz to Guatemala, A copy of this article is
attached. The taped speech mentioned in the article is obviously that which
Guatemalan authorities captured from Yon Soza's guerrillas in October 1964
following a guerrilla attack on a Guatemalan military garrison, This tape
was subsequently made available to KUBARK and was passed via the Quatemala
Station to Mexico City Station for possible exploitation in Mexico. The
content of the taped speech was later passed to President Diaz Ordaz by
COS, Mexico City, with a view to stimulating pressure toward Rico Galan's
expulsion from Mexico as an undesirable alien. How El Heraldo obtained
or got word of the taped speech is not known. Since the El Heraldo article
was pegged to the current trip to Quatemala of President Diaz Ordaz, it is
very probable that the expone was stimulated directly by the Presidency, in
line with a GOM campaign to neutralize all existing and potential opposition

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL OF CONTENT 19 TENTATIVE,
SOURCE, Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla group in
Guatemala who is living in exile in Mexico. He is believed to have
good access to the Guatemalan exile community.
Victor Rico Calan, leftist journalist who writes for both siempre and
Politica, reportedly is planning to visit Guatemala clandestinely to investi-
gate the disappearance of Victor Manuel Gutierrez Carvin, Guatemalan Communist
Party (PCT) leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico who returned
to Guatemala in late February.
Field Comment: HGG-4148 reported that Gutierrez Carbin and three other
Guatemalan leftists were arrested and exécuted by the Guatemalan authorities
on 8 March 1966.
Source Comment: Rico Galan could only enter Guatemale illegally since
he was declared persona non grata by the Guatemalan Government in 1963
after he visited the country to interview President Peralta. While in
Guatemala at that time he also managed to talk with Marco Antonio Yon
Sosa, guerrilla leader. Upon his return to Mexico, Rico alan wrote articles
favorable to the rebels and most unflattering to the Peralta government.
Rico Galan's interview with Yon Sosa was arranged through Adolfo Mijangos
Lopez who is now living in exile in Mexico.

and insists (quits correctly) that the speech he taped for delivery to
Yon Sosa's guerrillas in October 1964 could not possibly have had anything

POR VICTOR RICO GALAN
VICTOR
Sr José Pagés Liergo,
Director de SIEMPRE
Admirado y
Tengo hop
me a un asunto
que me concierne personalmente, y uso
por ello el estilo epistolar. Como el asun-
to involucra cosas que le importan al país.
confía en que esta cart cen de interés
público, aunque para seguir un orden ló-
gico me vea obligado a empezar por el
aspecto personal que hay en él.
Como usted sabe, El Heraldo de Méxi-
co publicó el pasado dia 13 un cintillo que
decía "Fracasó la conjura comunista".
bajo, el cual se afirmaba que los guerri-
lleros guatemaltecos, en connivencia con
malos mexicanos, preparaban una alga-
rada o atentado esto no se especifica
ba- contra el Presidente Díaz Ordaz, con motivo de su viaje a Guate-
mala. Según la nota “informativa”, que llevaba las misteriosas siglas
SNG (¿Servicio de Noticias de Guatemala?), el principal agente en esa
conjura sería yo, y como prueba se ofrecía la supuesta versión taqui-
gráfica de una cinta magnetofónica grabada por mi. Como existió, en
efecto, una cinta que yo grabé, y como en el "pastiche" publicado por
El Heraldo se utilizam frases que pronuncié realmente, creo necesario
explicar la historia de todo ello.
Visité por primera vez Guatemala en octubre de 1963. En el número
de SIEMPRE! del 30 de ese mes y año, apareció publicada una entrevis-
ta mía con el coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, que se iniciaba con esta
descripción de su persona: " coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, "hom-
bre fuerte" de Guatemala, no da de ninguna manera la impresión de ser
fuerte. Por el contrario, es oscuro, de hablar premioso, con una cons-
tante actitud timida y sin brillantez alguna. No tiene ese tono decidido
de los militares guatemaltecos que, digan cosas inteligentes o tentas, lo
hacen con un énfasis de cuestión sancionada. En los pocos minutos de
conversación con él, me expliqué muy bien por qué pese a mi insis..
tencia en contrario aceptó sólo contestar mis preguntas por escrito.
La transacción final consistió en que, unc vez satisfecho el cuestionario
en esa forma, hablaríamos brevemente en su despacho, sobre todo con
el objeto de obtener una fotografia".
Esa discreta sugerencia de su tartannudez mental enfureció al coro-
nel. Y más aun, cuanto que en el mismo número de SIEMPRE apareció
otra entrevista, también mia, con el entonces lider del movimiento gue-
rrillero guatemalteco. El coronel Peralta Azurdia lo dijo a un colega
chileno que lo entrevisto dios después que yo, que se vengoria do mi
donde quiera que me encontrase. ¡Y me imagino, no sin humer, el co-
raje que debe haber hecho cuando el colega chileno publicó su propio
reportaje... y coincidió conmigo en lo de la tartamucier mental del se-
ñor coronel!
Lo cierto es que el hombre intentó en reiteradas ocasiones cumplir
su promesa. Con motivo de su informe de gobierno, transmitido por ra-
dio y televisión a toda Guatemala, me acusó de haber ido a ese país a
organizar "grupos de choque", y la AP y la UPI se encargaron de difun
dir la noticia, que la patriota, nacionalista y solidaria prensa mexicana
publicó profusamente. El coronel "se vengaba", y yo callé por no dar
importancia a la irritación de un personaje tan menor, irritación que,
por otra parte, me explicaba perfectamente.
Regresó a Guatemala un año después, precisamente en octubre
de 1964. Y. ofectivemerte, grabé un mensaje en cinta magnetofónica,
destinados a varios guerrilleros a los que no pude ver Neda tenia de
misterioso ese mensaje. Contenia un saludo, algunas apreciaciones so-
bre el movimiento guerrillero hechas sobre el terreno por el observador.
por el periodista, y noticias pora los que tenian familiares en México Ni
una sola palabra que luera necesario ocultar, ni una sola idea que no
haya publicado, no una, sino mil veces. ¿Acaso es un misterio mi sol..
daridcal abierta y pública con quienes luchan por la libered de su pa
Inta? Mucho menos que misterio es delito, y yo me enorgullezco de es
solidaridad
Lo cierto es, sin embargo, que est cinta no llegó a sus destinata-
rios, porque fue capturado por el exercito guatemalteco Yol coronel
Peralta Azunden encontró en ella la foracula perfecta para una serie do
maniobras que por un lad, stalovan u tere al o honn my por
va, pero no às única, ni mucho menos. Antes hubo rumores, <KUSIK
✓ chintajes contro muchas personas, a las que se acumba de s
cionadas en la cinta y de colaborar conmigo en mis tenebrosas corapi
raciones En mayo de 1965, el diario guatemalteco Pronca Libre el de
mayor circulación en su pils-- hizo publica una de esas "versiones“.
¿De dónde la habla obtenido? De un boletin emto por la oficina de
prensa del coronel Peralta Azurdia. Y esa 'version' tenia por cheto
justificar la expulsión - entonces reciente - del distinguido intelectual
y politico guatemalteco Francisco Villagrán Kramer, mencionado en la
cinta, lo cual era "prueba" de que conspiraba conmigo
-
¿Y por que sólo Prensa Libre publicó la versión? Pues por la razón
simple de que provenía de un boletin oficial, y los otros periodicos de
Guatemala to negaron a aceptarlo si no se les permitia oir la famosa
cinta. Y claro que no se les permitió Bajo una dictadura militar, los r
riódicos guatemaltecos tuvieron más ética profesional que Σ Hervido
en un régimen de libertad de prensa. Pero así son las cosas. Y algo que
es también importante hacer notar: Pronsa Libre, km oficialista que aco-
-gió la suma calumnia, es el periódico que ha hecho la campaña má
grosera y negativa contra la visita del Presidente Díaz Ordaz a Guate-
mala.
La “versión” de El Heraldo tiene por objeto acusarme, a mi y a
otras personas, de conspirar para echar a perder la visita del Presidente
Díaz Ordaz a Guatemala Yo fui a ese país por última vez —repito-
en octubre de 1964, cuando el licenciado Díaz Ordaz era Presidente
Electo ¿Cómo iba a saber que se proponía visitar Guatemala? ¿Cómo
iba a hablar de los asaltantes del cuartel de Ciudad Modera, en Chihua
hua, si eso sucedió a fines de 1965, y en octubre de 1964 nada sucedia
en Chihuahua? Eso, para mencionar sólo dos de las más abultadas tal-
ɛedades de la "versión" Se utilizan unas cuantas frases auténticas, y se
edcba una supuesta grabación para cada caso.. Sencillo y sin problemas.
Pero, además, el coronel Peralta Azurdia se propone otra cosa can
la "version" de El Heraldo. Se propone justificar las extremadas pre-
ccuciones policicons que tomó para preservar su vida no la del Fre
sidente Díaz Ordaz- y la mala impresión que eso, y la falta de asisten
cia popular a la recepción, tuvo que causar al huésped y a su comitivaz
Pese a que la tartamudez mental del coronel Percita Azurdia y la de sus
cclaboradores mexicanos on el sucio adobo de la cinta no les permitió
siquiera lacionar Sela con el viaje prendenal, noticia terraina di-
ciendo: "Por todo esto (¿por qué?), el gobierno de Guatemala creyó per
tinente tomar todas las medidas necesarias que garantizaron la segu.
ridad del mandatario mexicano y de los miembros de su comitiva, dua-
rante su visita a nuestra nación”.
Pero la verdad es que tales precauciones se tomaron para garanti-
zar la seguridad del coronel Peralta Azurdia -esa si muy amenazada--.
y no la del Presidente Dluz Ordaz, contra el cual no tenía nada el pueblo
de Guatemala, y al que sólo los periódicos reaccionarios -en particular
Prensa Libre- ctacaron Tan es así, que si bien en la capital el Presi
dente mexicano fue encerrado en un automóvil blindado para prote-
ger c Peralta Azurdia-, y si bien en la capital acudió poco público
-para no aplaudir a Peralta Azurdia-, en La Antigua, a donde el licen-
ciado Dlaz Ordaz fue solo, s hubo recepción popular entusiasta y sc-
braron las precauciones policíacas. Claro, no estaba Peralta Azurdial
-
Y, en relación con esto, hay algo que el público mexicano deba
saber. La Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala la considero seria
mente la idea de otorgarle al Presidente Diaz Ordaz el grado de doctor
honoris causa. El asunto se debatió extrcoficialmente en el Consejo Uni-
versitario, y varios maestros propusieron la idea, porque significaba el
reconocimiento a un mandatario civil y universitano, e indirectamente
una boletaria a los gorlas de uniforme que gobiernan Guatemala. Y los
consejeros alumnos estuvieron de acuerdo en que la tendencia era bue-
na, pero objeturon el propósito por una sola razón: porque, por motivos
de protocolo, la Universidad so veria obligada a invitar y recibir en au
recinto al coronel Peraita Azurdia En tal caso -dijeron- los estudian
tea no acudirian. Y. ante este peligro, que desvirtuaba el verdadero
objetivo politico del proyecto, In Universiad no clorgé el grado. Esta
ckro que no lo otorgó por una sola razón por no recibir a Peralta Azur
dia, no obstante las buenas intenciones para of Presidente Dian Orde
Aat son los heches, wat es la verdad Y si el coronel Peralta Anuntia

in MEXI-3822 for a phased denigration campaign targeted on Subject.
This study has been passed to the contact cited in paragraph 3 of

unpublished portions as a basis for a projected article on Subject.
2. The "last-ditch" effort by LILISP-E to place an exposé of Rico Galan
in a Merida newspaper (as noted in reference) has not yet borne fruit.
The special article by the LILISP-E news service has been prepared but
last-minute rewriting problems have held up distribution. Copies of
the article will be forwarded as soon as they become available.

of Fidel Castro. In an article written for Siempre while he was in Cuba
(Siempre 31 Oct 62) he extols the great Cuban revolution and the advantages
Castroism has brought to the lower classes. In a later article (Siempre
14 Nov 62) he attacks the Soviet Union and Khrushchev for their weakness during
the Cuban missile crisis. He refers to Fidel Castro as being the vanguard of
the revolution against Colonialism.
From late May to mid June 1968 VRG was again in Cuba, this time to
interview Fidel Castro following the latter's return from the Soviet Union.
VRG reportedly spent 8 days with Fidel Castro, five of them aboard the Cuban
leader's yacht, and also interviewed other Cuban leaders, including Blas Roca,
Secretary-General of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP - Cuban Communist
Party); Ernesto "Cha" Guevara Serna, Minister of Industries; Oswaldo
Dorticos Torrado, Cuban President; and Raul Roa Garcia, Minister of Foreign
Relations,
It was during this May-June 1963 contact with Fidel Castro and other Cuban
leaders that VRG received a major operational assignment. He was given the
mission of traveling through Central and South America to contact local
Communist and guerrilla leaders. His job was to persuade these groups to begin
campaigns of violence and terror immediately in order to take the pressure off
the FALN in Venesuela, whose program of terror, heavily subsidized by Castro,
was beginning to run into lacreased resistance from the Venezuelan government
forces. On this trip VRG also had the mission of bringing about greater unity
among the various Communist and terroristic groups.
In late 1963 VRG undertook his assigned mission. He traveled to Panama,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Venesuela, Nicaragua and Brasil and contacted key
Communists in each of theea countries.
Among the Communist leaders which VRG contacted on this trip were
Hugo Victor, President of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP - People's Party,
a Communist group) and David Turner, a leader of the Yangyard of National
Action (VAN - a pro-Cuban, radical revolutionary organisation) in Panama;
Gomez Ayay, a guarrilla leader in Ciuatemala; and Francisco Juliao, the
revolutionary peasant leader, in Brazil.
În Nicaragua VRC met several times with Alvaro Ramires Consales,
Secretary-General of the Movilizacion Republicana (MR - Comununist Political
Front) who was also a member of the Central Committes of tho Partido Socialism
in Nicaragua (PSN), the Nicaraguan Communist Party, VRC's visit with

Agent
MIC
AUG 11 155
Victor Rico Galan was born 6 February 1928 in El Ferrol, Spain. He is
Spanish by birth, became a Mexican citizen by naturalization in March 1949.
He is married to Ingeborg Diener de Rico Galan, born 11 May 1929 in Mex co
City. He resides at Ernestina Larrainsar 19-B, Col. del Valle in Mexico City.
He writes for both Stompre, Mexico City leftist news-weekly, and Politica,
pro-Communist bi-weekly newsmagazine.
VRG reportedly talked to Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961 regarding
the formation of the Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLM) in Mexico,
With their approval ho became one of the founding members of the MLN and
Later headed the MLN Press and Propaganda Committee. In a speech to the
MLN in April 1962 he stated, "The government must be made to understand that
only the people have the right to violence." (This was in reference to the
Mexican government repression of the Communist Party and ite arrest of
David Alvaro Siquioros.)
In an article in Siempre in March 1963 VRG advocated the formation of a
new political party reflecting the ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas, former
President of Mexico. .VRG said this new political party was needed to truly
represent the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. VRC conceived this new
party as the political arm of the recently-formed MLN, which could thus develop
into a broad national pro-Communist movement like the FRAP in Chile.
VRG has always bean very close and sympathotic to the Castro-Cuban
revolution. In 1961 he was a member of the Periodistas Mexicanos Amigos da
Cube. Also in 1961 he was reported to be a member of the Commitine for
Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, In March 1962 ha was reportedly a
member of a group of four pro-Castroites who made an abortive physical attack
on Emilio Uranga, writer for Siempre who has written anti-Castro fiems. As
the group converged on Uranga other members of the Stompre staff intervened
and the matter was settled without violence.
for
From October to December 1962 VRG was in Cuba, as a correspondent
Siempre and also reportedly to gather material for a political biography

press referred to "secret meetings" in VRG's hotel room between Ramires
and VRG. Ramires answered by writing letters to the newspapers, saying he
met VRG quite openly in his office and that VRG had called on him because he
(VRG) was a legitimate journalist who was seeking interviews with various
political figures. On 24 October Ramirez was interviewed on radio and
finally reluctantly admitted that he had gone to VRG's hotel room. He said
his purpose in going there was to take VRG to his (Ramirez's) office.
În Panama VRG stayed at the Hotel International. While in Panama he
visited US installations and was seen taking many pictures. His talks with
Hugo Victor and David Turner were aimed at getting the VAN and the PDF to
resolve their differences and to unite. Turner briefed VRG on VAN's preparations
to establish an armed movement in Panama, Victor, on the other hand,
spurned VRG's to unify the two groups,
Following this trip in late 1963, VRG returned to Cuba (in January 1964)
and visited Fidel Castro again and to report on the results of his contacts with
Central and Latin American Communist leaders.
In late March 1965 VRG (with his wife) again traveled to Cuba to report
to Cuban leaders. He returned to Mexico in early April 1965,
In May 1964 VRG was invited to visit Red China, ostensibly as a guest of
the All-China Journalists Association, which indicated it would be willing to
pay all costs, including transportation. Because of other pressing work in
connection with hid assignments on behalf of Castro, VRG did not accept this
invitation.
Over the years 1961 to 1965 VRG's contacts with the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City have increased steadily. He meets frequently and regularly with
various officials of the Cuban Embassy, usually at his home, at the Siempra
offices or at the homes of the Cuban officials in Mexico City.
His most frequent contact is with Manuel Eugenio Vega Peres, Third
Secretary of the Cuban Embassy and chief representative of the Dirrecion General
de Inteligencia (DCI - Cuban Intelligence Service) in Mexico. Obese and outwardly
jolly, Yoga Peres was the driver of a beer truck in Havana prior to the Cuban
Resolution which launched him on his intelligence cargar.

In mid-May 1965 a gaffe by Mojia's and VRG's Cuban superiors exposed the
Mojia-VRG-Cuba channel publicly. In an article carried by Porto Alegre
(Brazil) newspaper Correio do Povo on 20 May, datelined New York 19 May
by Louis Wisaniaer, a Radio Havana broadcast of 18 May was reported to have
mentioned a declaration by Juan Mojia sent from Santo Domingo to VRG in Mexico,
who then sent the declaration to Radio Havana. After citing this channel by
which it received the Mejia statement, Radio Mavana proceeded to broadcast
the following excerpts from the declaration: "Numerous leaders of the 14 June
Party have disappeared but I (Majia) know that they are now in the mountains
leading guerrillas. The 14 Juno Party has control of the situation in Santo
Domingo." The Correio do Povo noted editorially that the Radio Havana broadcast
seems to negate the Castro effort to deny that the 14th June Movement in the
Dominican Republic is tied to him. The article concludes by noting that Mejia
was one of the 58 Communists listed by the Americans, and that this confession
by Havana puts new light on the question of American intervention in the
Dominican Republic. Not noted in the article is the fact that VRG's role as
an intermediary between Majla and Castro is clearly exposed by the Radio
Havana broadcast. A copy of the Correio do Povo article is attached.
When the Dominican rebellion erupted VRG began to agitate with the Siampre
staff for outright and total support to the pro-Castro forces in the rabol camp.
These offorts began to bear fruit when VRG was allowed to personally brief and
dispatch a Siempre correspondant photographer team to the Dominican Republic
in early May 1965 to report on the crisis. The correspondent was Luis Suarez
Lopoz; the photographer was Luis Rodrigo Moya Morano. The resulting articles
in Siempre produced by this VRG-Suarez-Moya team ware violently anti-US and
pro-Castro Communist in their interpretation of the crisis -- so much so that
they apparently touched off a bitter dispute between VRG and Jose Pages Llergo,
Siempre director, who prefers to such to the traditional Siempre role of a
pseudo-independent outlet for a variety of leftist causes, VRG's efforts to
reorient Siempre along more militant pro-Communist lines has long been
` known in journalistic circles in Mexico and the Stares-Moya Incident appeara
to have precipitated an open fight between the two. VRC is apparently aiming
for a showdown with Pages Llergo over this issue, since several Siempre
writers are known to la ve been individually approached by VRG over the past
weeks to enlist their support against the present Siempre editorial policy,
which VRG regards as too "opportunistic.

garrison. Included in these tapes was one made by VRG for delivery to the
guerrillas during his early October visit with them. A copy of this tape is
attached. The tape consists mainly of an exhortation by VRG for unity (between
the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT) and the 13 November Group)
and a plea not to permit ideological arguments to replace action. In this speech
VRG reveals himself to be a hard-headed revolutionary activist, not merely an
intellectual løftist. His approach to revolution is completely practical, not the -
oretical.
To cover his mission as a Castro political action agent to Yon Sosa, VRG
later published an "interview" with the latter (in Siempre No. 593, 4 November
1964).
VRG's involvement in the recent Dominican crisis is the latest example of
his work on behalf of Castro. In early January 1964 VRG travelled to Santo
Domingo, returning a week later to Mexico. Ostensibly this trip was to report
on Dominican Republic affairs for Siempre, Actually this was merely a covar
for a Communist propaganda assigurnent. Shortly after VRG left Santo Domingo,
thousands of copies of a pro-Castro brochure, entitled "Glempre visita la
Dominicana" and signed VRG, were distributed among Communists and
Communist sympathizers in the Dominican Republic. A copy of this brochure
is attached,.
During his January 1964 trip VRG contacted both the Moviraiento Popular
Dominicano (MPD), a terroristic revolutionary Marxist-Leninist and strong
pro-Chicom group, and the 14th of June Movement, the Agrupacion Folitica
Catorce de Junio (APCJ), a militant, revolutionary pro-Castro group. His
contact with the MPD resulted in his furnishing material to the subversive
MPD publication, Libertad, But his principal contact, one that developed
rapidly into a very active relationship in the period preceding the Dominican
crisis, was with Juan B. Majla, leader of the APC]. These two have maintained
close and frequent contact over the past year. During the Dominican crisis VRG
served as à relay point for material and instructions from Cuba to the APCJ
and also acted as a reporting channel from Mejia to the DGI and the APCJ's
Castro-Cuban laadership in Cuba.
1
As in previous operations of this kind, VRG cloaked his relationship
with Mejia under a journalistic cover. An "interview" he conducted with Mejia
appeared in the 2 May 1965 issue of the Cuban newspaper Hoy, A copy of
the text of that article is attached.

Another VRG Cuban intelligence contact is Ramon Sinobas Casado, Counselor
of the Cuban Embassy. Sinobas is Voga's assistant in'handling" VRG. It is
apparent that these contacts are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG's
reports and instructions to and from Cuba. In the course of his work as an
agent for Castro and the DGI, VRG is known to have acted as a courier, carrying
material and large sums of money to pro-Cuban groups in Central and Latin
American countries.
In October 1964 VRG received another important assignment from his
Cuban mastera. VRG was requested to travel to Guatemala to make a personal
survey of the strength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Sosa's guerrilla
forces and to lay the basis for a more energetic implementation in Guatemala
of the tactical principles for guerrilla warfare laid down by "Che" Guevara,
This was, in effect, a follow-up to his earlier vicit to Yon Sosa during his
swing through Central American countries in late 1963. At that time, VRG
attempted to persuado Yon Sosa to align himself more closely with Castro's
objectives in Latin America. The results of this visit to Guatemala were
written up by VRG in a special report to Castro, VRG's conclusions at that
time were not completely favorable to Castro.
Yon Sosa is known to be a forceful and independent guerrilla leader who
prides himself on his ability to maintain himself and his followers independently
of ideological guidance from either Havana, Paking or Moscow, although he is
quite willing to accept arms and financial support from any of these Communist
capitals. In the past Castro's efforts to bring Yon Sosa to heel have bean
thwarted mainly by the influence the Chinese Communists have been able to
exert over the Guaterialan guerrilla leader. In addition to the direct aid
provided by Peking to Yon Soaa and his guerrillas in Northeastern Guatemala,
there is the fact of Yon Sosa's Chinese background (Yon Sosa's father was
Chinese) which has served to tie him emotionally to the Red Chinese.
It was the continuing recalcitrant attitude of Yon Sona which apparently
prompted VRG's second mission to Guatemala in October of 1964. VRG was
instructed not only to talk to Yon Sosa but also to try to influence Yon Sosa's
guerrilla forces directly in line with Castro's objectives. In addition to prepared
material which VRG used for lecturing the guerrillas he brought with him special
propaganda filma for indoctrination purposes.
In late October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape
recordings from Yon Sosa's guerrillas following a guerrilla attack on a government

RESPETO A MEXICO
- La conducta del señor Victor Galán participando
en el último alboroto de agitadores extremistas,
plantea ante la opinión pública la necesidad de co-
nocer a fondo cual es y cual debe ser la actitud de
las autoridades con Individuos que, si blen poseen la
calidad de mexicanos por haberseles concedido la
naturalización, su misma situación les impone obser
var clertas normas de respeto y consideración hacia
- su nuevo país y sus instituciones.
Las leyes mexicanas, por su esencia democrá-
tica, son de Igual aplicación para todos los habitan..
tes del pals, y únicamente ciertas esferas de acción
se consideran reservadas para los mexicanos. Espe-
clalmente en el terreno de la acción política, nués-
tras leyes señalan discriminaciones en favor de los
mexicanos que reúnan ciertos requisitos respecto a
su nacimiento y a su ascendencia. No nos correspon-
de analizar la justificación de estas normas, o des-
aprobarlas, porque evidentemente responden a nece-
sidades de nuestro desenvolvimiento histórico, acep
tadas y puestas en práctica por la nación y sus go-
biernos.
3
El señor Rico Galán y todos los que como El
poseen la calidad de mexicanos por naturalización,
gozan de todas las prerrogativas y derechos concedi-
dos por las leyes del pais, y también poscen todas las
obligaciones y deberes por ellas señalados. En cam-
bio a un extranjero como el norteamericanos Barry
Bernard Primus, quien tomó parte en el escándalo
del domingo último, inmediatamente se le expulsó del
pals, porque a ningún extranjero se le permite in-1
miscuirse en nuestros asuntos politicos y no por su:
parentesco con una respetable familia mexicana
mo es la del pintor Alfaro Siqueiros.
Pero las garantías y las prerrogativas de que es;
titulár el señor Victor Rico Galán, a pesar de su!
calidad de auténtico pandiliero de la pluma, no quie
ren significar que las autoridades policíacas y ml-,
gratonas investiguen a fondo cuáles son sus activi-:
dades y cuál su verdadera situación migratoria. No
nos refiramos al término gratitud, que debía ser su-
ficiente para quienes como Rico Galán han sido acep-
tados por México como sus hijos, porque esa palabra
es desconocida en el léxico de individuos afectos a
considerarse como la máxima expresión de le sabl
duría y a ostentarse en el extranjero como "la pluma

1. ESLIME-1 mot Galán in the latter part of August 1964 in Guatésala.
He was assigned to help bring Galán to Yon Sosa. He met Galán on Kilometer 17'
of the "Highway to the Atlantic", at the village of fixing El Chato,
and drove him to Kilometer 189, where others were waiting to guide him
from there.
i
2, Galán told E-1 that he was a reporter xand was coming to interview
Yon Sosa. He said that he had come before and that he crossed the border
clandestinely. Someone from the group that met them at Kilometer 189
told E-1 that this was the fifth time that Galán had come to see Yon Sosa
and that he carried messages and money to Yon Sosa.
3. After E-1 arrived in Mexico City, “alán asked the party for permission
to interview him for an article for Siempre. He wanted to interview E-1
about his arrest, torture, by the police, and expulsion from Saatezal„.
Vider Manuel
Gutierrez told E-1 to grant the interview and to give Galán all the detaila
he needed. E-l talked to Galán, in the offices of Siempre, on three
occasiones, twice in March and once in April. However, he did not give
bim the interview as at that time he had not yet obtained papers permitting
him to remain in Mexico and did not want to jeopardize his

chances of obtaining them. He promised to send Galán a card when his papers
were obtained and give him the interview them.
!
of 2-1 does not like the idea of giving this interview to Galán and has
H
not contacted him oven though he now has his papers. He plans to do nothing
Qualesa Galán contacts him again. Then he will have to give the interview
since Gutierrez told him to and he has no reasonable excuse for refusing.

5. E-1 said Galán has also made propaganda films which were shown to the
· guerrillas in Guatemala. They were simple films which could be made in
the home, generally just consisting of someone giving a talk or lecture.
They were made both in Spanish and in the local Indian language. E-l said
that the last film Galán made was confiscated by the police. He didn't know
the Guatemalan or the Fexican police.

D. Rico to Dr. Emilio Cordero, Dominican exile in Mexico City:
Rico complains to Cordero that he was supposed to call and that the other
【Nikolay) has already called twice. Cordero says that he called yes-
terday but there was no one in, they told him they had gone out together.
Is the friend there? Victor says no, that he said he would be busy
between 1630 and 1700 hours and Victor will be busy until 1900 hours.
Cordero aska to let it go until tomorrow, as he himself is very búny.
He suggests coming to Victor's at 1600 hours. Victor prefers to call
before that at 1530 hours. Cordero congratulates him on his article in
Siempre. A foolish thing, Victor says. Cordero asks him if he has
Been Luis Suarez' article and what did he think of it? Rico says it is
written in first person, very superficial, very much a personal adventure.
Very journalistic, Cordero commenta. Yes, but journalistic like Serer's
(Station comment: Probably Julio Sherer Carcia, writer for daily
Excelsior) and to Victor it appears to be more...Cordero says that the
situation there grows worse. Victor asks if he saw Mayobre's thing.
Cordero says yes, very good. Well, comments Victor, that of Mayobre was
not expected but it is that the thing is so obvious. Cordero will call
tomorrow at 1500 hours.
E. Saul (Inu) to Rico: Saul tella Rico that a friend arrived from
· New York yesterday. Would he like to talk with him? Rico says of
course. They decide on Monday at Rico's home. When Rico says he does
not speak English Saul says that since he doesn't either they will have.
to have another person.
3. May 21: 0615 to 2400 hours:
A. Leonov to Rico: Leonov greets Rico in a very friendly way.
Rico says that yesterday he talked with The Man, he had a lot of work
and preferred to leave it for today, He asks Leonov to call again at
1600 hours. Leonov will call.
B. Luis Suarea and Rico Gulan: Suarez sent a very strong article
against the United States on the Dominican situation which was published
yesterday. He did not want to lose the chance no matter what they
thought and they said that he had abandoned the work, never having had
a contact with "them". Suarez and Rico discuss the articles on the
Dominican situation published by both Suarez and Shorer Carcia of
Excelsior. Rico says that Shereris article was the first to give the
Latin American point of view on the Dominican aituation.
Suarez agrees
but says, "the interview with Caamano, no." Victor commments that Sherer
did a good job. Suarez does not known what happened with Sherer. ila
published one thing that he showed him in Santo Domingo, after he published
the thing about the OAS the following day, and no more, he dried up,
they have not published him anymore. Suarez comments that the President
received him. Why? It seems unbelieveable that they have made this effort
in order to publish only two days. Rico terminates the conversation with
congratulations to Suarez.
C.
Cordero to Rico: Victor is waiting for a call from The Man
(Leonov?) at 1600 hours to make a date at 1700 hours at home. Emilio
accepts and will be there at 1700 hours.

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT: Mooting with WUINDICO, 18 May 1965
19 May 1965
i
1.
KUTHERFORD met W/1 at the latter's apartment on 18 May 1965.
2. The following information was obtained:
a. Dominican Republic. During the briefing by the H representative
on 14 May, it was agreed that N/1 would attempt to have the Havana broadcast
of 2 May replayed through his friend. Mauro LUGENTINI of ANSA, New York. It
was felt that this approach would be more desirable than using W/l directly,
in view of his offorts to appear as a liberal journalist. During the
meeting W/1 attempted to contact Lucentini, but ascertained that he had gone
off on a holiday for the weekend. Upon learning that Lucentini would return
to New York City during the evening of 16 Hay, it was agreed that 4/1 would
contact him at that time in an effort to have the story transmitted on 17
May. In addition to the major capitala in Latin America, F/1. also thought
that the story would be sent to Rome.
b. Following a 'phone call from the WH Doak, RUTHERFORD subsequently
briofei N/1 on the fact that the samo story had been carried in the 2 May
clition of Hoy in Havana. (COAGENT] RUTHERFORD pointed out to the Head-
quarters rep that, in his opinion, it might not be advisable to inform
Lucentini of the for article as it might raise an objection in his mind con-
cerning the current valus of the nam.)
0.
Briefed on both the radio broadcast and the joy article, W/1
was disinclined to mention the Hoy article to Lucentin for the same
objection noted above. He was instructed to use his own discretion.
d. On the evening of 16 May 1/1 contacted Lucential and outlined his
roquest. He explained to Lucantini that this was a good opportunity for
a scoop on a hot item. W/1, in order to offset any objections on the part
of Lucentini, told him that the radio broadcast. had occurred on 13 May.
He did not mention the by article. According to W/1, Lucentini was less
than enthusiastic about trainitting the story through his facilities,
pointing out that it was no longer news. After some persuasion, according
to 1/1, Lucentini finally agreed to send the following ablareviated story
to Buenos Aires either the evening of 16 May or early 17 May:
;
'On Friday, May 13, Radio-Havana cited Juan D. Hojia leader of
Dominican '14 of June' party who had given an interview to Naxican
journalist Victor Nico Galan in which he declared over the telephone that
Jeany leaders of the June 14, movement have disappeared, but at the same
time matarous contingents of insurgents are reported in the mountains of
the region' and that 'the 14 of June movesient has much control of the
situation.'

Hotel Ambassador. There is protest by U.S. Ked Cross stating that there.
are at least 400 dead and about 1,200 wounded. The Americans are distri-
buting milk, etc. Both heard this over Voice of U.S. VRG comments
(ironically) that "they are very nice people" (buenas gengtes). There is
also a declaration of Dept. of Defense that since marines are there, this
does not mean U.S. supports one or another side.
VRG asks if Micic bas called...No, not yet. Not there yet.
It is nearly 1900. Yes, but he goes to work at 1800.
◉
"These young people" brought their bulletin and a copy for Misic.
It is long but does not state anything saying that it is not true that
they are Communists. that this a country fighting against oppression.
VKC says this is habitual rhetoric of Latin Americans. Keep it for
Miric.
'
Call VAG if Miric finds out anything about Mexico's position
or statements in this.
23.2
In. Maaks VKG, who answers, if they took the declarations
by (of exiles). How was the conference? It took place during a terrible
rain...keporters from "Excelsior," "Novedades," and "B1 Dia." Had
declarations all written out for President, Cardenas and PxI. Not really
a conference, just a few commentaries. Mogave the men the addresses of
press agencies which did not appear. They were going to deliver this
declaration. VKG says these people are worthwhile. Declarations were
good, according to Mo,
VAG asks if MO know that marines have started to kill people.
Read in "Ultimas Noticias" that first exchange of fire took place
with 70 marines at the U.S. Embassy. Mojust got me home. Mexico also
protested in O.I.A. meeting. Yea, and a lot of countries. Yes, but
they wanted to make it a united effort. VLG has not heard the terms
in whichxse Mexico censured this action of U.S.
Has VRC written this yet? Hu la prepasing material. Wants to
write it for tomog8OW. VKG says it would be best to give this to
"Siempre" on Monday. VRG will phone Pojes tomorrow early. Pajea will
arrive on the train around 0900 or 1000. Should be at offi e around
1100, Would like to hand in his article on Monday.

About Sac Isidro being attacked...There is no foreign corses-
pondent in 1 Santo Domingo. All information is coming from San Juan.
The ones sending out Information are Dominican reporters and this is
probably being censured. They found out about the marine disembarking
through Washingten. Nogent a cable in detail when he got home found
a cable from Adrede (7) in Berlin that he wanted info on disembarâation.
NO sent info to Berlin.

the fight. Continue to attack in mass San Isidro. Is this from Informex?
Yes.
.
There is an official deddaration (of Mexico) essentially disap-
proving the marines. President is still very worried about situation in
sister kepublic and that the govt. thinks it is amefutxt very sad that
U.S. took this action. It is only 20 or 30 lines. Doesn't it mention the
O.B.A.7 No. but the sense is the same, with an accent of a little more
There is nows that the Mexican Embassy has also been attacked in
Dominican Republic. Have attacked Salvadoran, Peruvian, Mexican,
Ecuadoran and U.S. Embassies. VRG doubts this. Thinks these may have
been provacateurs. Why would they attacks the Embassies? The Mexican
Amb. is in almost constant communication with Mexico informing what is
going on. And it is not sure yet that there are any victims among the
U.S. citizens. But there has been further disembarkation. VAG thinka
they will occupy the territory. This will be a repetition of 1916.
Midic says it won't be the same exactly. No, it was then to form the
empite and it is now to defend.'

As to the O.B.A., things are not going well. There was a 3

They are back in meeting.

Amb. has given refuge and asylum to Mexicans and Dosenicana. Situation

especially with respect to American problems. They can state that they
deplore the blood being shed, as stated in the O..A.. and sufferings
of Dominican Republic and sorry that U.S. govt. has had to act in such
a manner which reminds them of such sad memories of several countries in
the hemisphere and hope that marine force occupation will be the shortest
time as possible...that Dominican xepublic can resolve their problems
without any direct or indirect exterior influence. VKG thinks that it
is quite good within what can be expected,

the marines and VRG even helped them organize this conference. VKG
is not going to conference.
Lula saw ViG's article. Yes, but they did not put on the signa –
ture, It is best that way, With a signature it would have been Luia
article. Without signature, it appears more editorial. Luia prefers it
this way politically. This was just an error, since VKG talked to
Alberto about this. It was an error in the shop. Luis is happier about
this. When Luis aends this to Puerto Rico is carries more weight this
way, Luis asks if he charges for this. VAG thinks so, but will ask.

Out to 46-60-15. VKG Max with Jardon, who anawera.
Greetings. What is new in Santo Domingo? Quite a bit. Just a moment.
The last message they received came from Sen Juan, Puerto hico.
They have obtained complete control of City of Santo Domingo. In the
morning, they had heard that the insurgents had obtained control of all
radio systems (stationg) of the capital and started attack on base of
San Isidro. Prance Presse told VKG about the attack of San Isidro.
The inst heerd is that they ate in control of Santo Domingo city. They
have taken 4 tanko, destroyed another 2 in capital. They will see if
they can take over San Isidon. That is the air base. And the (U.S.)
marines? VIG heard a radio bulletin that they disembarked another 100
marines. They had said yesterday that, in cose it wore necessary, they
would disembark 1,000 not 100 zines. And reactions? Hasn't anyone
protested? No, besidee Cuba and USSK, no one. What did USSR say?
Doesn't gay. NO goes on that the total amount of men fighting for
Bosch is 15,000 - civil and military men. The major part is civil
because, apart from Camagne (ph) and Montes/ who refused to accept
trengaction, the rest of the officers hacked out (of revolution)...
There is a quite well founded suvor that A it is not
remote that the crines, "ere made to fall the need, to protect liberty
and democracy, to intervene categorically and to find proofs of the
Castro-Comunist intervention. There is also speculation that there will
be a change of 180° in the Latin American situation and that the 0.8.A.
meeting may not result es planned (to protest against intervention
in Santo Domingo)." Jardon says this is possible. Did VG notice yes-
terday in Johnson's message, at the end." "the disembarkation of marines
will not only take place in Santo Domingo, but this (group) will bé
lent to citizens of other countries, some of which have already asked
for "our" (U.S.) help," VKG says that he is referring to citisens of
other countries living in Santo Domingo. Jasdon disagrees, then says,
yea, it can be interpreted in the a two waya. VRG aske Jacdon to send
a cable with this rumor. It can be true or false. Jardon will do ao.
He will include it in the message he sends out at 1800.
VRG asks Jardon to call him if anything important comes up. Yes.

In. Sra. Kich with VKG, who answers. Greetings.VKG has been
very busy with the Dominican affair. Some Dominican friends were at his
house this morning and phoned a lot. Sra. K. says Boach won't get in.
She read it. The last news is that they (insurgents) have taken
the whole capital, Santo Domingo, and the Americans were disembarked.

Ia. Edmundo (Jardon) with VG, who answers. There is some
news. The Cha Peruvian Chancellor criticized the disembarkation of
U.S. marines, stating that this was grave blow to inter-American
relations... Washington states that Mexico zritis criticized the
disembarkation of U.S., troops, in the secret session celebrated today
in 0.8.A. Colombia, Chile, Venezuela and Costa Rica protested that
this unilateral action, and requested legal measures so this action
would be a combined action. VKG asks for the form in which Mexico
criticized this action. Nothing specific in this message. Should have
it later. The bombarding of San Isidro has started an hour ago.
Informex should have text of Mexico by now. It would be good to ask for
it. Call him if there is anything new, VKC is writing up this for

but there is great insistence that these areCommunists, trained in
Cuba and Czech. On the other hand, the 6th flost of Caribbean is

pointed out that these x forces were armed by the Army (7) and trained in
the U.S. and not by the Communists. He assured that Ú.S. gnvt. and people
that the forces were not being directed by "turbas" (Communists?). Bosch
stated that it would be impossible to establish in the Dominican Republic
a regime similar to the one in Cuba. He pointed out that had the Cubang
done what the Dominicans are doing now, Fidel Castro would never have
been converted into ...fm feudal lord (?) of the Cuban revolution...
(MO comments that this is terrible.), VKG asks what did NO expect from
Boach. Nothing from Bosch. He fell for some reason, NO says. VкG comments
that least important thing is his stupidity, the worst part is his reaction

six armed civilians are patrolling the streets. There is no eacking.
They are still distributing arms, that they have absolute control o8

there was complete calm and there was no doubt of control, that they
were still distrimbing distributing arms. MMR saw that Bosch was sorg
interested in talking than 3 days ago when Moli talked to him. Bosch
said that of the 30 tanks, there are only 9 left. They (Bosch people)
9
have 11 and 10 are out of combat. No one has published this, at least
MMX has not seen this. Bosch said that yesterday morning they conquered
Portales Iss where there were several hundreds of dead, but they
bad taken it, and there is a cable stating that everyone there was shot.
They are atill picking up political leaders in city. The National Polic
has not come over to Beach yet. The U.S. troops are now entering into
action. Of course, if they disembarked in San Isidro, it was to enter
into action. Boach said that things are being arranged (between them

They change phones. They asked Bosch what his opinion was of
the O.B.A. Commission. VKG did not talk, but a Dominican friend talked
to Bosch. However, theyrecorded the conversation. Bosch said some
important things. This friend asked Bosch what he thought of OEA Coa-
mision. Bosch said that O.E.A. and nothéng are the same thing. Who
talked to Bosch. Marcio Mejia Ricart. They then asked Bosch if they
the U.S. marines had occupied the city. He said they had and they
had gotten as far as Avenida Mella, near downtown area, but that the
armed civilians forced them back until Avenida Maximo Gomez, about
3-1/2 kilometers back. Ave. Maximo Gomez is what one might call¨¨
their combat line since it is the zone where the U.S. Embassy in.
So, they made them return to their original pa positions. This took
place yesterday afternoon. But the most important thing - they asked
Bosch what political solution Bosch saw. lle answered "textually
'It appears that in Washington they are thinking of converting Santo
Domingo ina Fideicomiso.' Then he commented ironically, so "we get
out of colonialism into independence." VKG says that this is of course
very grave. As F. knows there are 2 or 3 left in the world of
Fideicomisog in Southern Africa. This would be unprecedented case
that they convert an independent country into a country under Fidei-
comiso (Protectorates). When Mejia Ricart asked if they (U.S.) want
to convert "us into a colony." Bogch replied. that Yes, into a colony
but with 23,000 armed sen. Civilians, of course. Bosch further aaid
that "what the people had done was something extraoddinary and that he
had complete faither in the people." H. did not want to say anything
to provoke the uprising of the people because he (Boach) is out of the
country "and from outside, this is a comfortable role. If I were inside
I would take up the responsibilites.

VKG had to pay the call since Pundors did not call him. VKG

F. asks what the situation in inside Dominican Republic. There
is nothing now. They are expecting a call from Dominican Republic to-
day. VAG may have something in 2 hours. In this case, VKG will call.
F. will then call VKG back at 2300, Hábana time, or 2200, Nexico time.

Ia. Cordero with VRG, who answers. C. tells VKG to put his
recorder on to take note of what was said. VKG was doing that.
C. says: At 0915 Juan B. Mejia, members of Provisional
Executive Central Committee of the Political Group 14 de Julio called
Cordero from Santo Domingo and informed the following:
MO
The Yankees are bombing and machine gunning the city. (VRG
asks if they are bombing with airplanes. He did not tell C.) Could
be artillery, perhape naval. They have launched their tank and
marins against the people. A revolutionary order reigns in the entire
city. Yesterday, 1 May, the Yankees opened some stores in the downtown
and called the people to sack them. The people refused to do so.
They then looked for prostitutes and filmed them sacking the stores.
The interest is to show to international public opinion that chaos
reigns in the country to be able to justify their open-faced sad
unjustified military intervention. That is, the people refused to
enter into this propagands because they had the cameras ready. They
only got prostitutes and trash like that. They will publish this in
the newspapers. The armed people are willing to resist the Yankee
invasion and to conserve their sovereignty and independence. The
støsgge between the US. forces and constitutionalists has ceased.
All the forces of people are concentrating in fighting the Yankee
invader. There is a need to awaken the Mexican public opinion.
wanta VKG to help him in this. Of course. So, they (Mexicans) cen
send cables, etc. to United Nations for their tomorrow meeting on
the Dominican Republic. They want pressure so that the United Nations
and not the O.H.A. which combats the intervention. The combat with
the Yankees is violent in different sectors of the city. The trans-
mission sent out yesterday and today from kadio Habana mention hia
(Majia) ou ember of the group did him a lot of damage. The reaction
in Santo Domingo has been taken to polat up and to be used as a
Communist faceos of their fight GG a Kmoult of the broadcast of
Radio Habana. Mejia told C. that he was going to call VKG to clarify
this with VAG because this is very delicate. VKG will communicate this
right now to sadio Habana. Mejia further said: They should stop making
such indications, like, Juan B. Mejia of 14 de julio says...The Radio
Habana said that this was an interview (of Mejia) with VKG. Another
point - Sheuld deny that they have a hideout in the mountains as
informed by Radio Habana. This does a lot of damage. NO told Nejia

its conclusions and recommendations which it considers appropriate,
at the latest of 10 May of 1965 and decides to celebrate a session
of the meeting (?) the 11th (of May)." was this the plan of resolution?
In the plan that Sinovas read there is no date mentioned.
V&G Days
Mexico's proposal is dated, but on the other hand, an AP cable from
Washington stated that the O.B.A. suspended its sessions inde-
finitely tonight. What Y&G wants to know is whether Nexico's proposal
was approved? No, it was not approved. It was stated that it would
be taken into account and their next session would be scheduled
after the Commission submits its geport. But if the time limite set
by Mexico is not approved, the Commission can extend this and give its
report in a year. Yes, in 5 years, if they want. VKG was not clear
on this. Everything was left open. There is no time period or any
limit on the decision. The decision was to send this Commission, wich
Micic comments is very strangely made of (the members are strange)..

There should be no great change. Micic thinks there may be a big change.

U says that Santo Domingo has isolated. Miami refuses to
put through catis from Santo Dominicans. They would not give VKG
a call through either - that only U.S. press had preference. A Domini-
can wanted to call there yesterday and they told him they were sorry,
he heard Nisei conv that they could not put through any calls to
Santo Domingo from Unminicana. This would be a good thing to inform
Radio Nadana...that they are not putting through calls.
->
Cells are coming than through from Dominican Republic to
Mexico. Amb.'s call also went through. NO thinks they can't call out
unless they are known.
NO went by "Prensa Latina" to get press bulletins. Got the
speech of ..(Castro). It is very good.
Dominican Amb. had said he would resign, but has not done so.
Due to some "declarations published in 'la Extra'" is against U.S...
perhaps if he does not resign, theymight spread around that – in view

of these declarations that this person is non-grata. It would be
difficult, It can be done, but has to be handled correctly. When
does 40 think this can be done? When VRG wants. With his declaration.

A. RICO GALAN HAS BEEN EXPOSED AS ONE OF CASTRO'S MOST
IMPORTANT AGENTS AND CHANNELS FOR FORMENTING REVOLUTION AGAINST
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA. HIS PAST ACTIVITIES
INDICATE HE REGARDED MEXICO ONLY AS A BASE OF OPS, A SPRINGBOARD,
FOR LARGER HEMISPHERE OPERATIONS ON BEHALF CASTRO.
B. ALTHOUGH RICO GALAN AND HIS GROUP HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED
VARIOUSLY AS CASTROITE, TROT SKYITE AND PRO-CHICOM, HIS CLOSE AND
INTIMATE CONTACTS WITH LOCAL CUBAN EMBASSY AND INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS INDICATE HIS CONTINUING LOYALTY AND ADHERANCE TO CASTRO IN
THIS CONNECTION A CURRENT MEXICAN NEWSPAPER ITEM DISCLOSED THAT
RICO GALAN WAS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH CASTRO AS FAR BACK AS 1956,
WHEN CASTRO AND HIS FOLLOWERS WERE HIDING OUT IN MEXICO AND
UNDERGOING TRAINING IN GUERRILLA TACTICS AT A RANCH NEAR AYOTZINGO
IN MEXICO. THIS AYOTZ INGO GROUP LATER FORMED THE EXPEDITION THAT
SAILED ON THE "GRANMA" FROM TAMPICO, MEXICO, AND ULTIMATELY OVER-
THREW THE BATISTA GOVERNMENT.

2. STATION REASONABLY CERTAIN GUAT GOVT WOULD BE HAPPY.
ACCEPT AND PROSECUTE RICO GALAN BUT WE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS

PRISONER IS USUALLY DROPPED IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AFTER SHORT

OCCUPATION: Writer for Siempre and Politica magazines in Mexico City; both are
effective Communist-lining magazines and have large circulationg.
October 1963
A PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subject's 201 file (date of photograph apprend
:
POLITICAL AFFELIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS: As of 1962 Subject was the head of the
National Press and Propaganda Committed of the National Liberation Movement
(MLN) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U/S. and Pro-Castro organization. Subject
is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is considered as a Cuban
"agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Asamicasbestbuddy
Subject was a founding nember of the LN. In an article in Siempre in March
1963 he advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the
ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas)/former President of Mexico', This would
have provided, in his belief, the Nexicm left a political organization truly
responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary
because the Mill, whose membership covers the spectrum of Rexican Communist Party
open
to MI, could not take/political stands without antagonizing some of the
membership. The new party would have represented a "third position", socialism
in internal affairs and independence of any bloc in international affairs.
^
leftist
jction
With a party such as this as its political action am, the MLN would have
developed naturally into a broad national movement such the FRAP in Chile.
(Some specious reasoning here).

recordings from the guerrillas in operations subsequent to a guerrilla attack

on a garrison in Panzos, Alta Verapaz. Included in those tapes was one
made by RICO Galan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists mainly of
an exhortation for unity (among the POT and the 13 November group) and
counsel
against letting doctrine replace action. The tape clearly.

reveals RICO to be at once a very
leftist who also has his feet
planted quite firmly on the ground. His approach is pragmatic, not theoretical,

Mexican passport number 56341 (or 53641).
✓ ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cuba was ostensibly to
gather material for a political biography of Fidel Castro. The May/June 1963
trip was to interview Fidal Castro after his return from the Soviet Union.
Subject clad mod that he had spent eight days with Fidel during that visit,
five of those aboard ship.

On 24 October 1963 HYSAGE-1/reported that Subject had received an operational
A
assignment from Castro (during the May/June 1963 visit to Habana) on which to
travel through Central and South America. His mission was to persuado
leftist parties to immediately begin acts of sabotage and violence, and to try
to maintain these in order to take pressure off Venezuela. Subject was also
instructed to bring about better unity among competing leftist factions to
onsure greator impact for their work, Subject did, in fact, contact mary
Communist Party and leftist leaders during his Central and South America travel
during the period October 1963 - January 15641.
From this (farge niday) te forting on subject on October 1965 throu
January 1964 it appears that he lid fiscuss the question of lighustunity.

WE ARE STILL MOST DESIROUS OF EXPLOITING RICO GALAN TAPE.
DESPITE MEXI PESWING OBJECTIONS TO SURFACING IN MEXICO, WE BELIEVE THAT
THIS IS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO START BURNING RICO AND THEREFORE URGE
GUAT STATION TO MAKE STRONG APPROACH TO GUAT GOVT TO SURFACE LOCALLY.
PERHAPS ESPILL ONE OR EVEN PERALTA IF NECESSARY WOULD BE BETTER CHANNEL
FOR THIS THAN MINCOY SERRANO. SINCE GUATS RAISED SUBJECT OF TAPE
DURING RECENT MINISTERS MEETINGS, THEY PRESUMABLY WOULD BE AMENABLE
NOW TO LOCAL SURFACING,
ONCE
2. ONCE SURFACING ACCOMPLISHED GUAT, WE WILL BE IN POSITION TO
EFFECTIVELY EXPLOIT NOT ONLY TAPE ITSELF BUT ALSO OTHER KNOWN INFO ON
RICO GALAN ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT HEMISPHERE ON BEHALF CASTRO REGIME.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director, for Plans
SUBJECT
:
Briefing of Reader's Digest Reporter
:
1
1. The Mexico City Station has been requested by the
Press Office of the Embassy to assist in briefing Mr. Robert
Struthers, a roving reporter of the Reader's Digest, who is
preparing an article on Cuban/Communist supversion in Latin
America and who has expressed displeasure that the Embassy
has been unable to provide any briefing on Communist activi-
tics in Mexico and Central America.
2. Mexico City Station and WH Division feel that par-
ticularly since the Spanish edition of the Reader's Digest
has a circulation of over two and one-half million copies
this is an excellent avenue for the otherwise planned sur-
facing of abundant information (including the existence of
a tape recorded speech to Guatemalan guerrillas, recently
captured) on Victor RICO Galan, an active Cuban agent and
a regular contributor of the weekly leftist magazine,
SIEMPRE.
3. A briefing on the activities of Victor RICO Galan
and a replay of the tape has already been given officially
in Guatemala during the January meeting of the Security
Ministers of Central America. No press play has yet been
made.
4. CA/Propaganda defers to you for a policy decision.
There are no RI traces on Mr. Robert Struthers. Struthers is
favorably known to Mr. Paul Chretien's office which has per-
sonality and professional data on him.

This is UNEVALUATED INFORMATION, SOURCE” GRADINGS ARE_DEFINITIVE APPRAISAL, OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Calan,
with whom he disagrees politically. Source has reported infrequentl
on-Rico Golan's activities. The reported information was obtained
both from Mrs. Rico Galan and from Francisco Martinez de la Vega
1. Francisco Martinez de la Vega, writer for Siempre, Mexican leftist
magazine, said that Colonel Eduardo Estrada Ojeda, in the police
headquarters where Victor Rico Golan and others were being held after
their arrest on charges of subversion, had been instructed to permit
Rico Galan to receive packages from his wife.
3.
Elena Garro, writer, told Mrs. Rico Galan that she was going
to speak to Minister of Interior Luis Echeverria to persuade
him to ensure that Rico Galan would not be manhandled by the
polico during the interrogation.
3. She, also, expressed☐ scepticism about the whole affairį,
saying that it was a farco and that she believed that many of
those arrested with Victor had been paid to make the statements
attributed to them.
Field Comment: An unsigned article titled "New Conspiracy?" appeared on
page 8 of Siempre. It presented briefly an account of the arrest of and
charges against Rico Calan; belittled what it termed the periodic
paroxysms of patriotism which seize the Mexican police and lead to such
arrests; then went on to suggest that Rico Galan, a political journalist
accustomed to expressing his ideas in signed articles, could hardly be
thought of as a conspirator. The article concluded with a plea for respect
both for Rico Galan's constitutional rights and for the rights of a free
journalism.
Headquarters Comment: This article appeared in issue no. 687, dated
24 August 1900, of Siempre.

(212/195151) 271-334474
According
Rolando Collado Ardon, leader of the Guatemalan exile community
in Mexico and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT ·
Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo) said that the arrest of
Victor Rico Galan on charges of subversion was a good thing
for the PGT. Collado was referring to Rico Galan's influence
on Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa.
to Collado, Rico Galan prevented the PGT from persuading Yon
Bosa to join the Party in 1983 because of Rico's Trotskyist
interference and the aid he gave to You Boga at the time.l

Medical doctors Miguel Cruz Ruiz and Rolf Beiner Huebner,

of those arrested with Rico Calan, have been associated with Dector
Rico since early 1965. Both were very much involved in the
medical doctors' strikes of late 1964 which continued into 1965.
When the strikes were finally settled both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner
· Houbner were dismissed from their jobs at the Social Security
Hospital at Cuauhtemoc 330. They went directly to Rico Calan
who put them to work, mainly writing medical articles for the

Victor Rico Galan and his associates can expect neither syn-
pathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido
Popular Socialists). Although no official decision has yet
been made by the Party, PPS leaders who have commented un-
officially on the matter have said that for the moment the
Party will no doubt stay completely outside the whole sffair,
thus proving its total lack of interest in this type of revo-
lutionary activity It is of course possible that PPS Secretary
General Vicente Lombardo Toledano will seize the opportunity to
issue a statement condemning the entire affair as Trotskyist,
criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decide to use this oppor-
tunity to strike back at the National Liberation Movement
(MLN - Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) and others who have
attacked him.
-
3. Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers
and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM Union General de Obreros. y.
Campesinos de Mexico), there is a certain skepticism about the
truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press.
It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing
explosives were confiscated. It is probably true that indoc-
trination sessions on political and revolutionary matters
probably were held in the houses where the arrests were made.
And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action.
But, it is simply not true that there was the slightest danger
of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his
friends.
4.

"
B.
This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan
is no guerrilla leader. He is an aggressive intellectual, a
radical, but he is not in jail for what he has done but for
his ideas. As for Raul Ugalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan
as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of
being fuzzy-minded, a leftist adventurer and certainly neither
brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Calan is well aware
of this, popular support is essential to the success of rebellion.
None exists. The peasants are divided. The workers are controlled
by the Government, and the middle-class is content with the way
things are. Also, there is the formidable precedent of Govern-
ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,
and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected.
The Government has always moved with energy, speed, and effi-
ciency to combat such threats as, for example, during the
Railway Workers Strike of 1959. Several leaders of that striko
are still in jail and likely to remain there. Another example
is the September 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Madera,
Chihuahua. While the Government did not feel that his incident
posed any real threat to it, it did not want the bad interna-
tional publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of
would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with
money, others with promises and the matter was promptly and
efficiently controlled.
but
There no doubt is a degree of truth to police charges,
the melodramatic, almost childish character given to the Rico
Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection between the
movement and leftist/Communist organizations, Rico Culan's
open and woll-known connections with Guatemalan guerrilla
leaders and his public support of the Cuban revolution, make
it very hard to discount the suspicion that this is simply a
Government maneuver. Also, while the police no doubt did
confiscate arms and other materials, the suspicion exists that
the police have inflated their role in order to make themselves
look good both to the President and to public opinion.

There is even a rumor that because of Rico Galan's harsh attacks
on the new Guatemalan administration, the Guatemalan Government
asked the Mexican Government to deal with Rico Galan. This
rumor however la regarded as rather ridiculous since the
Mexican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion
of Guatemalan officials.

THIS IS UNE VALUATED INFORMATION SOURCE GOED NIT VI APPRAISAL OF CONTEST INSTATATILE
Veteran and trusted member of the Popular Socialist Party who
has close personal connections with ranking members of the
Party. He has been a prolific reporter of reliable information.
The reported information was obtained directly from leaders of
both the PPS and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of
Mexico. The substance of these persons' comments are believed
to be accurately reported; their validity however cannot be
assessed.
1. (Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the
arrest of Victor Rico Galan and others on charges of conspiring
against the Government remain unsympathetic and the Party
intends to stay outside the entire matter although PPS Sec-
retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the oppor-
tunity to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a
statement condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan.
Within the Party there is considerable skepticism about the
truth of the published charges. While several Party leaders
do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges they aro
quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent rebellion
and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Rico
Galan and his friends. Given the energy and efficiency with
which the Mexican Government has dealt with loss melodramatic
threats in the past, one cannot but suspect that it is merely
a tried and true Government maneuver. Also, it is believed in
the PP3 that police accounts of their role in the matter have
been exaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both
with the President and with the public. The rumor that the
Guatemalan Government may have asked the Mexican Government
to silence Rico Galan because of his violent attacks against
the now Guatemalan administration is generally discounted
since the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly
of no concern to Mexico.)

ONLY FIVE PERSONS FLEW TO CUBA IN THE DC-4 AND NO MEXICANS WERE
AMONG THEM. (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR CUBANA TO
CARRY ONLY FIVE PASSENGERS ON ITS MEXICO-TO-HAVANA RUN.) WHEN
: ASKED WHY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ
REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO. (SOURCE COMMENT:
LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT
THE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND AP-
PEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE WHO HAD
NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.)
ON 12 AUGUST FERNANDO RICO GALAN, VICTOR'S BROTHER, WAS
OBSERVED IN THE CUBANA OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE
FOR A FLIGHT TO HAVANA. THE FLIGHT DID NOT COME TO MEXICO CITY
THAT DAY AND FERNANDO WAS LATER ARRESTED IN THE ROUNDUP. ALSO
ON 12 AUGUST ONE; NOEL BARRA ZENIL WAS OBSERVED ATTEMPTING TO AR-
RANGE PASSAGE TO CUBA. (SOURCE COMMENT: BARRA IS A RABID COM-
MUNIST REVOLUTIONARY WHO IS CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND UNTIL RECENTLY
WAS A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF HAVANA.) (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: A

USUALLY RELIABLE SOURCE REPORTED THAT IN MAY 1956 ALVAR NOEL BARRA
ZENIL WAS LISTED AMONG PERSONS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST ACTIVE

Attached for both addressses are copies of a brief biographie sketch
on Vistor R100 Galan. As can be seen from the sketch, Headquartero knows
something of his activities, but next to nothing about the man himself.
During the discussion of the problem of RICO Galan at the recent CP Oper
ations Seminar in Moxico City it was mentioned that both LICOOKI-1 and
LITAMIL-9 ware personally acquainted with him; perhaps these two sources
could provide some impressions of RICO Oalan that would flesh out this
skeleton sketch.

SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THE 14 AUGUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN THE
PEMEX REFINERY AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, HAVE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE
TO INDICATE WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPLOSION.
INVESTIGATION IS HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT SECURITY PRE-
CAUTIONS AT THE REFINERY ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. AT THE
TIME OF THE EXPLOSION ONLY ONE GATE GUARD AND TWO SOLDIERS
WERE ON DUTY IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

LINE WAS RUPTURED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION SINCE THE EDGES OF
THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF RUPTURE WERE TURNED INWARD.
3. THE EXPLOSION OCCURED AT A TIME WHEN MAXIMUM PROPERTY
DAMAGE AND MINIMUM LOSS OF LIFE WERE ASSURED. (SOURCE COMMENT:
HAD THE BLAST AND FIRE OCCURED DURING THE WORK WEEK IT IS PROBABLE
THAT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.)
4. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE LINE AND
THE TIMING OF THE EXPLOSION STRONGLY SUGGEST SABOTAGE. ALSO,
THE DAMAGE IS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE PRESS HAS INDICATED
AND IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE MUCH LONGER TO GET THE REFINERY BACK
IN OPERATION THAN HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. RESERVES ARE BEING USED
NOW TO PREVENT A GASOLINE SHORTAGE.)

became a Mexican citizen by naturalization on 15 March 1949.
2. CIVIL STATUS: Subject is married to Ingeborg DIENER do Rico.
3. ADDRES3, Providencia 930, Mexico City, D. F. Telephone number as of

6.
OCCUPATION: Writer for Siempre and Politica magazines in Mexico City;
Both are effective Communist Tining magazines and have large cireulation.
PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subjoet's 201 file (date of photograph October
1963).
POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS. As of 1962 Subject was the head
of the National Press and Propaganda Committee of the National Liberation
Movement (MLM) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U.S. and pro-Castro organi-
sation. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is ecnsidered
ou a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Bubject was a
founding member of the MIN. In an article in Siempre in March 1963 be
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the ldsology
of General Lazaro Cardenas, leftist former President of Maxies. This
would have provided, in his belief, the Mexican left a political organi-
zation truly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revelation.
This was nsesusary because the MIN, whose membership covers the spee trua
of Hexican Communist Party to FRI, could not take open political standa
without antagonising some of the membership. The new party would have
represented a "third position", secialisa in internal affairs and inde-
pandeces of any bloo 1 international affairs. With a party such as this
an its political action arm, the MLN would have developed naturally into
a broad national movement such as the PRAP in Chile. (Som perious
reasoning here.)

Ingeborg Diener de RICO Oalan, Subject's wife, traveled from Mexico to
Cuba in November 1962. Subject was at that time in Cuba.
PASSPORT: Subject formerly carried Mexican passport number 57115, with
Cuban courtesy visss. On 9 September 1963 Subject was issued Moxican
· passport muaber 56341 (or 53641).
3. ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cuba was ostensibly
to gather material for a political biography of Fidel Castro. The May/
Juna 1963 trip was to interview Fidel Castro after his return from the
Soviet Union. Subject claimed that he had spent eight days with Fidel
during that visit, five of those aboard ship.
10.
On 24 October 1963 HYSAGE-1 in Panama City reported that Subject had
received an operational assigiment from Castro (during the May/June 1963
visit to Habana) on which to travel through Central and South America.
His mission was to persuade loftist parties to immediately begin acts of
sabotage and violence, and to try to maintain these in order to take
pressure off Venezuela. Subject way alan instructed to bring about better
unity among competing leftist factions to ensure greater impact for their
work. Subject did, in fact, contact many Communist Party and leftist
leaders during his Central and South America travel during the period
October 1963 - January 1964. Proz the (fragmentary) reporting on Subject
from October 1963 through January 1964 it appears that he did discuss the
question of leftiat unity.
In October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape
recordings from the guerrillas in operations subsequent to a guerrilla
attack on a garrison in Panzos, Alta Verapas. Included in those tapos
was one made by RICO Qalan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists
mainly of an exhortation for unity (among the POT and the 13 November Group)

and counsel against letting doctrine replace action. The tape clearly
reveals RICO to be at once a very intellectual leftist who also has his
fest planted quite firaly on the ground. His approach is pragmatic, not
theoretical. The text of the tape indicates that it was made sometime
after February and before mid-October 196li.
11. There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Galan.
His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. He apparently is known
personally by LICOOXY-1 and LITAMIL-9 in Mexico City, and these two
sources should be queried.

According to Francisco Martinez de la Vega of the magazine.
Siempre, Colonel Eduardo Estrada Ojeda at Police Headquarters
where Victor Rico Galan and others wore being held after their
arrest on charges of subversion' had been instructed to permit
packages from Mrs. Rico Galan to be delivered to her husband,
Elena Garro, writer, told Mrs. Rico Galan that she was going
to speak to Minister of Interior Luis Echeverria to try to get
him to ensure that Rico Galan would not be manhandled by the
police during the interrogation.
Mias Garro expreased a scepticism about the whole affair,
saying that it was à farco and that she believed that sany of
those arrested with Victor had been paid to make the statements
that they had.

zation. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is considered
as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Subject was a
founding member of the LN. In an article in Siempre in harch 1953 he
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the ideology
of General Lararo Cardenas, loftist former President of Nexico.
would have provided, in his belief, the Mexican left a political organi-
zation truly responsive to the radical tendencias of the 1910 revolution.
This was necessary benau i the hill, whose membership covers the spectrum
of Mexican Communist Party to RI, could not take open political stands
without antagonizing come of the membership. The new party would have
reprosented a "third position", socialion in internal affairs and inde-
pondence of any bloc in international affairs. with a party such as this
as its political action arm, the MIN would have dareloped naturally Dito
a broad national movement such as the l in Onile. (Set specious
reasoning here.)

City from Tampico. He was immediately deported to Venezuela.
The basic reason for Mascaro's deportation was his close

2. On 26 May 1966 Professor Juan Mascaro Neves, a Spanish
national who had acquired "Inmigrado" status in Mexico and
who had been active in connection with affairs of the Cuban
· Consulate in Tampico, was picked up by three unidentified
men who requested that he show them his identification
documents. There was no information available through official'
Mexican Government services in Tampico on the detention of
Mascaro: Since it seemed possible that the detention was
not the work of Mexican officials, the Cuban Embassy protested
'to the Mexican Foreign Office orally. The Embassy was later
informed that Mascaro had been deported to Venezuela for
violations of the Mexican immigration law
Mascaro was a key contact of Victor/ico Galan, Spanish-born
Mexican Marxist journalist, during the latter's visit to
Tampico and Ciudad Mante from 4-6 April 1966. Mascaro's
wife, Carmen Garcia de Mascaro, has also been a close
contact of the Cubans in Tampico.
