sense, I don't fully understand the relationships among all
the aspects of the complex
but were all
the investment
decisions, the Eurodollars and the small amount of stock and
the like made by outside counsel or were there some invest-
ment initiatives which originated within the Agency?
Mr. Houston. For a while almost all of them were made
by this outside counsel. It was not too happy a relationship,
not because of his fault. I think he was doing his honest
best. But we took too long processing his recommendations and
often lost a market by taking too long through our own in-
ternal controls.
So, finally, we decided that while we had gone to him
for a good reason, that is, so we could show that we had
relied on outside counsel of known stature, that it was
not fair either to him or to us to be in circumstances where
we were really secondguessing him through our own internal
proçedures and our own invetment sort of Board of Directors
So we left, I hope, on friendly terms.

Mr Houston. Kenney. He must have been one of the cen-

Mr. Wides. He was not prominently involved in establish-

Mr. Houston. He might have worked in some of the central
cover situations but I don't recall him being involved in any
of the proprietaries I worked on.
Mr. Wides. With regard to MH MUTUAL, as you can read-

or two questions with regard to concerns that have been raised
by the committee.
Do you recall at any time questions arising about the
conflict of interest or any questionable aspects of the invest-
ment decisions of the MH MUTUAL program or any part of it?
And by that I do not mean an individual who obtained intelligence
information and was trading on his own, or an investment club
within the agency, or that kind of thing, but questions in-
volving either the Agency using insider information, if you
will, obtained through its intelligence activities of

To go back to the start
it may have
already been told
back in the last fifties we found in
the OGC office that the hardest thing to cope with were bene-
fits for death or disability insured under covert circumstan-
ces, particularly when, as so often happened, n prior planning

So, we came to the conclusion that we needed our own in-
surance business, and we started by buying two very small
off-shore insurance companies, and started writing death and
health policies. NOW,
the business grew quite rapidly to
cover all sorts of covert operations. And we went to two
large outside insurance companies and asked if they would
cooperate and take some of the policies either on a fully pro-
tected basis from us, or if they saw fit, for their own account.
And both of them did both. They would take some risks for
their own account, and the only thing we would ask is that
they protect the investigation in case it got into sensitive

Mr. Houston. There were about two or maybe three recom-

Excuse me. Was the Investment Counsel the
person you were referring to?
Mr. Houston.
No, this was an outside investment
counsel we retained for advice for a period of time.
Mr. Wides. Was it a firm or an individual?
Mr. Houston. It is a well-known firm. And they made at
least two or three recommendations to invest in stock of

ships, or whether they were known in advance and it was weighed
and the decision was made to go ahead with the investment?
Mr. Houston. No. The only ones I recall were turned

no need to get in a position of possible implication of

Mr Wides. Up until then as far as you know there
was no investment of Agency funds that were made as a result
of any decisions or implications within the CIA which might
then have been run by him for his independent advice but might
have originated or prompted within the Agency?
Mr. Houston.
There may have been those You see,
on our Board of Directors to which we referred all basic in-
vestment decisions we had three of our top economists, and
at least one of them was a member of a couple of college
investment boards, so that they had the benefit of the advice

and the banks and the insurance companies, the CIA?

GEtting back to the question I alluded
to while we were off the record, did any questions arise about
whether the people on the board, the investment board, or manag-
ing board of Mutual who were from within the Agency, would

have access to economic intelligence or political intelli-
gence relevant to their own thinking on investments, and
where there was any question of a proprietary involved?
Mr. Houston. The members of the board were always free
to bring up their ideas for investments, particularly in the
stock field, until more recent years. But mainly we were
consulting the economic experts for their general economic knowl-
edge on trends and any input they could give on basic invest-
ment policies.
Mr. Wides. That would include, I assume, economic in-
telligence regarding for example, the trend of whether there

Mr. Wides Do you recall any policy papers or reviews
generally as to the use of Agency knowledge in the broadest

decisions as distinct from decisions that were generated wholly

by outside?

Mr.Houston.
The initial source of funds was usually
reprogrammed at the year's end available for operational use.
And this was regarded as an operational use necessary to
support operations because of the need for the basic insurance
function.
In other words, all these companies that we had in
this insurance complex appeared to have the substance an
insraance company would be expected to have.
Actually, the
whole fund for all of them was managed as a central fund under
this one project officer. On the design and organizational

No. If you reorgnized a proprietary or

Mr. Wides. What about prior to dissolution, just the
annual operating profit, were any not left in the proprietary
but taken out in part and put into the fund?

they were left in the companies until they were dissolved.
And toward the end of Air America I believe we let off some
of the profits before the final dissolution and then took the
rest of them over, and they eventually turned them into the
Treasury.
Mr. Wides. With regard to the investment, in the case
of certificates of deposit abroad I take it that is what you
are referring to as the weighted average, when you weighted
Eurodollars, Eurobonds and certificates of deposit. Whatever

And at the time Mr. Joost and the other fellows
were CIA employees of the station at Thailand in 1951 they were
alleged to have been involved in disposing of Mr. Kilham's
body, and there was a serious question as to whether one or
both of them had been involved in his death And then I believe
in 1955 this was brought to the attention of the Agency through
the efforts, among others, of Mr. O'Donnell, who was then the
station chief, Justin O'Donnell, who came back and raised it
with Mr. Wiesner, and then I believe it was raised with
Mr. Kirkpatrick and with yourself.

of giving information to the Thai authorities so that they
could decide whether to exert jurisdication?
Mr. Houston. My recollection is that the indications
were that the Thai authorities had as much information as we
did.
I don't remember to the contrary, but a lot of the
information we got came from the Thais.
Mr. Wides. Did Mr. Kirkpatrick go over to Thailand
to talk to some of the people there to find out what they

kind of cases which CIA had with Justice, and the referrals,

to go through the other two.

The second one was quite an interesting one. If I give

Mr. Houston. The staff officer in Italy all of a
sudden disappeared from his post, and there was indication
that he had with him a considerable sum of money, something
in the nature of $30,000, I can't remember the exact amount.
This was promptly reported, and he disappeared into the blue.
The station started looking into it. And I believe we
sent people over to try and look into it, and found that
there had been a serious family problem between himself and his
wife.
Finally, through some sort of source in Mexico we got

word that this fellow was near Mexico City, and he passed word
to the station through a lawyer that he had written all the
operational details of what he had been engaged in in Italy,
which again were very sensitive, sealed them, and put them
in a vault which only thelawyers could get at, with instruc-
tions to his lawyers that if anything happened to him, no

The SEC, as a result has raised some questions with Justice
between our justice and our statutory problems. This is
before Justice now.
Mr. Wides. Is there a file in the OGC office generally
regarding, not necessarily every one, but many of your
which would contain many or most of OGC contacts with
Administrative agencies over the years?
Mr.Houston. No, because they weren't
there probably
is a substantial file on relations with Internal Revenue.

tax equations on our own personnel with cover problems which

I don't know if it refreshes your recol-

who had some knowledge of it.
Mr. Houston. To the best of my recollection I put
this together and talked to Allen Dulles who was much concerned
about it. He said, I think we ought to report that to
Justice.
And I said, there is no particular problem, because
there is nothing we can do about it because there is no crime

against the U.S. that I can find in this situation, it is a
13
crime against the Thai sovereignty.

And Allen said, that well may be. But I still think
15
that I want to report this to Justice.

And he asked me to prepare a detailed report on a

Mr. Houston. I can't do that.
Mr. Wides. How would we refer to him in terms of his
position if we were trying to ascertain his identity, or
if we were negotiating with the Agency, as it were? What
was his title vis-a-vis the mutual management?
