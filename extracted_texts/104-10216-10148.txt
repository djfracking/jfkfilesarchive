OBJECTIVES

RYBAT
BLOENDMIZED
A. To re-establish personal contact with AMTRUNK-10 and to
secure his full cooperation in spotting dissidents within
the higher levels of the military for the purpose of or-
ganizing a conspiracy against Fidel Castro.
B. To obtain from AMTRUNK-10 operational information on
other MHAPRON recruitment targets.
C.
To attempt the recruitment of FAR Captain and Cubana
pilot Jose Alberto SEMIDEY Isalgue, a frequent personal
pilot for Fidel and Raul Castro and an influential figure
in civilian and military aviation.
D. Through the AMTRUNK ratline, to transport to Havana and
cache a clandestine radio set for the future use of an
infiltrated AMTRUNK radio operator. At the same time, to
explore with ANTRUNK-10 and other internal contacts the
possibility of safehousing and supporting a radio operator
in Havana.
TASKS
A. The AMTRUNK Intermediate Craft will be towed by the KUBARK
mother craft to the DRP at coordinates 221668, AMS Sheet
4085 IV (23° 14' 00" N and 80° 47' 00" W, H. O. 2624).
B.
c.
.D.
The AMTRUNK IC will then proceed to the vicinity of coor-
dinates 133511, AMS 4085 III. At this point, AMICE-14 and/or
AMTRUNK-7 will make contact with either Oscar DIAZ Jabiela-
Garcia or his son Antonio DIAZ Torres in Casualidad
(17654795, AMS 4085 III). These two individuals are knowl-
edgable of the fact that the AMTRUNKS may return to the in-
filtration area although they do not know even the approxi-
mate date. Oscar DIAZ and his son Antonio are prepared to
activate the ratline consisting of three different taxis, to
AMTRUNK-7
move AMICE-14 and AMTRUNK-13 into the Havana area.
and -16, the team guides, and AMAGREE-1, the radio operator,
will remain with the IC in the mangroves in the vicinity of
the infiltration area until the return of AMICE-14 and
AMTRUNK-13.
.
Once in Havana, AMICE-14 and AMTRUNK-13 intend to split up
and seek refuge in different safehouses. They will maintain
contact with each other, however.
AMICE-14's primary task vis-a-vis AMTRUNK-10 is to cement'
the recruitment of AMTRUNK-10 and to obtain his full coopera-
tion to work toward MHAPRON objectives. In addition, AMICE-14
will teach AMTRUNK-10 an OWVL system and leave a receiver with
AMTRUNK-10. AMICE-14 also intends to give AMTRUNK-10 a review

DEDENSIFIZED
AMTRUNK-16 is a 41-year-old single Cuban citizen who, as
a commercial fisherman, lived and worked in the infil/
exfil area all of his life. He participated in Operation
AMTRUNK VI in December 1963 and his up-to-date knowledge
of the infil/exfil areafrom which he fled in late October
1963, proved invaluable on this mission. While he was
still in Cuba, AMTRUNK-16 was a trusted contact for the
AMTRUNKS on both Operation III/IV and V.

with an alternate on 18 February. If exfiltration is not
successful on either of these dates, the radio operator will
be in contact with the base and contingent plans for exfil-
tration can be set up through this medium.

AMTRUNK-13
AMTRUNK-13 is a 42-year-old Cuban citizen who has been a
commercial airline pilot for most of his life. He is a
high school graduate. In early 1959, AMTRUNK-13 was
named Interventor of "Aerovias Q", one of the major Cuban
airlines. He defected in December 1960 while still in
that post. He is a native of Havana who was active in the
26th of July underground in that city from early 1957.
While later in exile in the United States, AMTRUNK-13 made
two clandestine flights into the Sierra Maestras during
the war against Batista, the last bringing Provisional
President Manuel URRUTIA Lleo from Venezuela for his first
meeting with Fidel Castro in December 1958.
AMAGREE-1, Radio Operator
AMAGREE-1 is a 33-year-old Cuban citizen who has two college
degrees, in education and in journalism. He is native to
the province in which the infil/exfil area is located.
Until his departure from Cuba in August 1961, AMAGREE-1 was
& municipal official in Matanzas Province and was active in
the propaganda section of the 30th of November Movement.
AMAGREE-1 began his association with KUBARK in April 1963
as a radio operator trainee. As in the case of ANTRUNK–13,
this is his first operational mission.

BACKGROUND
Operation AMTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was
successful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE-27
and AMICE-14, were able to contact and to recruit two princi-
pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground-
work for the MHAPRON objectives of the AMTRUNK operation.
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUNK-9, was exfiltrated with the
One
four-man ANTRUNK infiltration team for training and operational
discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, AMTRUNK-9
was re-infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation AMTRUNK V, the
same operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS -1, -3, -13 and -34.
In late October AMICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AMTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two
internal P/A's toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re-
cruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission was
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code
from AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished
to be exfiltrated. The twin objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
then became: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-9 and, this accom-
plished, for AMICE-14 to proceed to Havana for his task of re-
channelling AMTRUNK-10's responsibilities. The exfiltration of
AMTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of
wife, brother-in-law, and three small children, was accomplished
on 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of AMTRUNK-9's
family, coupled with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
tration area, forced AMICE-14 to exfiltrate the same night with-
out attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.

E. Secondary tasks to be accomplished with AMTRUNK-10 are:
(1) To debrief him on his activities since AMICE-14
recruited him in August 1963.
F.
(2) To collect operational information on other possi-
ble recruitment targets
(3) To explore the possibilities of accommodating and
supporting an infiltrated radio operator.
AMTRUNK-13 will attempt the recruitment of Jose Alberto
SEMIDEY Isalgue, a close friend of AMTRUNK-13's for 18
years and a first cousin of AMICE-14. The following is
short biographical sketch of SEMIDEY:
$
toget
sheat
age 37-38 years old. Born in Matanzas, the son of
of the
Brig. Gen. Jose SEMIDEY, ex-Comptroller of the National
Army and veteran of the Spanish-American War. SEMIDEY
studied for one year at Purdue University, Indiana.
He and AMTRUNK-13 graduated from the second class of
ANACRA Pilot Training School in 1942. SEMIDEY flew for
Expreso Aereo Inter-Americano and Cuba Aeropostal for
about 11 years before he became Interventor or Adminis-
trator for the latter company after the Revolution. After
Cuba Aeropostal was absorbed into Cubana, SEMIDEY held
various positions of importance in Cubana. He also holds
the rank of Captain in the Rebel Air Force and reportedly
has made reconnaissance flights and black flights carrying
arms and/or agents to and from other Latin American
countries. SEMIDEY has a close friendship with Victor
PINA Cardoso, the Director of Civil Aviation, and is re-
portedly close to Raul CASTRO for whom he is a frequent
personal pilot. Because of the close former friendship
between AMTRUNK-13 and SEMIDEY and because of reports
from AMICE-14's family which indicate that SEMIDEY has
become disenchanted with the Castro regime, both AMTRUNK–13
and AMICE-14 consider SEMIDEY a prime candidate for re-
cruitment.
G. If SEKIDEY should be out of the country on a flying trip
at the time of infiltration, AMTRUNK-13 will attempt to
set up contact with Commandante Rene de los SANTOS Ponce,
who is reportedly stationed in Las Villas Province with
a unit of "Lucha Contra Bandidos", an anti-counterrevolu-
tionary force. AMTRUNK-13 and de los SANTOS are friends
from boyhood and, for a period of 6 or 7 years, de los
SANTOS worked as an apprentice plumber for AMTRUNK-13's
