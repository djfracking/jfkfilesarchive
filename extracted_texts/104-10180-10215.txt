recruited in Havana a WT operator candidate, whose name he
cannot recall at this time. This candidate was spotted and
first contacted by AMPANIC-1, who passed the lead over to
AMIPE 1. APPANIC-1 first contacted the candidate on the porch
of the old percedes Benz Arency at kalecon and Principe Streets,
and AMIRE 1 then contacted subject in the latter's apartment in
the fourth floor of a building located in the middle of the 8
block on the East side of Nenocal Avenue (Infanta)) Between (Valle
and San Jose Streets. This building had a store in the first
floor, was painted a pinkish beige, and the apartments were
