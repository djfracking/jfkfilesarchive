Ha stated he was waiting instructions from Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Division before attempting to have them imported. He states most of the
firearms were taken to Vietnam by him, however, some are weapons that he
acquired there. (See attached list).
Mr. WerBell stated on his return to the United States ha made an inventory
of the firearma received from Eglin Air Force Base and found that he had
made several errors when copying the serial numbers from the firearms,
and thus some of the firearms had been registered on Form 4467's with
wrong serial numbers. (See attached list). Mr. WerBell stated the error
ware made by him, and they were made because of the condition of the
numbers and the difficulty in reading them. Mr. WerBell said he had not
notified the National Office of the errors, however, he would not ify
them now and ask instructions,

10 16 06 62/ Mr. WILLIAM A. BANGENT, Assistant Director for Support.
Nouagment. Office of the Secretary of Defonce/Advance Research Projects
Agency (OSD/ARPA) was interviewed by SA GERALD A, TRIMBLE and the writer
at Bangkok, Thailand. BANGERT elected to execute a signed, sworn statement.
the body of which is quoted verbatim as follows:
"This statement is made in response to inquiry by Special Agent Mr. Richard H.
QUAM, Office of the Special Investigations, The Inspector General, USAF.
concerning the person of one Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, and specifically, the
shipient of two (2) boxes containing assorted firearms from Bangkok, Thailand
oglin Air Force Base, Florida. Only information based on first-hand
kifowledge and available records is contained in this statement.
"Statement:
}
1. Mr. Mitchell Werfell
"During the month of January 1969 (exact date unknown) I was introduced to
Mr. Mitohall L. Werbell by Col. John V. Patterson, the former Deputy Director,
RING-T in the latter's office. Col. Patterson stated that Mr. Werbell was
roprosenting the SIONICS Corporation and the purpose of his visit was to show
to the Thai and U.S. staff of the Military Research and Development Center
(1200) an assortment of special weapons. I attended one of several so-called
indoor demonstrations given by Mr. WarBoll when I noticed approximately 3 - A
custommade, sult-case type containers in which these weapons were transported.
Nhon I casually questioned Mr. Worbell how he got these weapons into Thailand
ho answered that they were flown in from Vietnom by a Thai Royal Air Force
rosport plane at the request of Air Chief Marshal Dawes, Supreme Command
Arged Forces. Concurrently Mr. Werbell produced a set of official U.S.
Government Travel Orders approved by the American Embassy in Saigon and
authorized by the Counselor for Administration, U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, As
I recall, these orders specified travel by U.S. Military Aircraft authorizea
between Bangkok and Saigon and small arms and automatic weapons to accompany
passenger.
2. Shipment of Box No. 1
Also during the month of January 1969 I received information from the
Battelle Memorial Institute Laboratory Support Manager (EMI/LSM), Mr. Rose B.
Young, that a box containing special weapons had been received in the MRDO
warehbaco. The box in question had been shipped via Military Aircraft by the
U.S. Babassy in Saigon to RDC-T Bangkok, Attn: Mr. Worboll, SIOMICS, The
transportation and Movement Document DD Form 1304 listed the contents of tha
box as "official equipment".
"On 20 January 1969, I notified Mr. Rose B. Young (IMI/LSM) in
writing that RDC-T had no contractual connections with the SIGNICS Corporation,
did not desire to store the equipmont, shipped by the U.S. Bibassy in Saigon,
and therefore, to return the shipment to the vendor via the Transportation
Officer, Dobbins Air Force Base, Marietta, Georgia.

On 12 November 1969, KARL D. ACKERMAN (former Counselor for Administration,
United States Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand), 99 Victoria Drive, Atherton, California,
was interviewed by SA ROBERT J. NOVACK and the writer, and related substantially as
follows:
ACKERMAN had several conversations with Colonel WALTER ADAMS concerning the
practical problems of getting weapons, belonging to a MITCHELL L. WERBELL, into
Thailand from the Republic of Vietnam in order that WERBELL could put on a fire power
demonstration for the King of Thailand's birthday. At all times during these conversa-
tions, ACKERMAN assumed the weapons were WERBELL's wares, and that he had
brought them from the United States with him. With this in mind; ACKERMAN stated
that he instructed Mr. GERALD T. CARTA to annotate WERBELL's travel orders with a
Bangkok United States Embassy Funding Citation number. ACKERMAN said the citation
numbers were in a block of numbers belonging to the Embassy, and because he did not
feel he had the authority to issue WERBELL any other type of number, he issued him an
Embassy number. When ACKERMAN was asked if he knew PAUL ARNOLD MARRIOTT, he
said the name was vaguely familiar but could not recall anything further. When
ACKERMAN was asked if he knew EARLENE DOBBS, he stated that he did not, to the best
of his knowledge. ACKERMAN stated that his knowledge of WERBELL came solely from
ADAMS and other stories he heard around the Embassy of the fire power demonstration
to be given for the King. ACKERMAN stated he had no personal knowledge of WERBELL.

Information re: WERBELL, as contained in files of OSI District 50, obtained
and set forth. CARTA advised WERBELL, during Jan 69, requested his assistance
in shipping various captured enemy automatic weapons and official equipment
from Saigon to Bangkok. WERBELL was traveling on a U. S. Invitational Travel
Order, without funding citation, authorizing space available travel only from
Bangkok to Saigon and return. CARTA stated WERBELL told him he had collected
the weapons while in northern sectors of RVN, with U. S. Army Airborne and
Special Forces units. Packaging and preparation of Transportation Control and
Movement Documents (TCMD) were prepared by U.S. Embassy, Saigon. CARTA did
not know why one TCMD reflected antique arms when contents were known to be
automatic weapons. CARTA received authorization and funding citation number
for WERBELL's shipment from the Counselor for Administration, U.S. Embassy,
Bangkok. This was only shipment processed by CARTA for WERBELL. CARTA did
not know of or process any shipments for SUBJECT and/or SIONICS, INC.

SYNOPSIS
Permission to interview WERBELL granted by IRS. Review of air and surface
shipment records, Eglin AFB, FL, failed to disclose any information pertinent
to this investigation. WERBELL interviewed by IRS. During interview WERBELL
advised that firearms shipped to him by SUBJECT in April 1969 were obtained
by him (WERBELL) in Vietnam and registered during amnesty period; however,
no authorization was obtained to import these firearms. WERBELL stated that
majority of firearms currently being held at Eglin AFB were sent at WERBELL's
request by ARPA and authorized by PATTERSON, who thought firearms were for
AF museum purposes. WERBELL asserted seized firearms were sent by him to
Vietnam after receiving State Department approval and were to be returned to
SIONICS by Air Force. No authorization for this action was obtained by WERBELL.
WERBELL advised that firearms which were not sent by him to Vietnam, and which
were seized at Eglin AFB, were sent to SUBJECT for use in Air Force museums and
that, to WERBELL's knowledge, Forms 6 were not filed on any of the seized fire-
arms.

On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of case file 50D24G-133, of
which WERBELL is the SUBJECT, revealed the following information:
WERBELL was in the RVN in an unofficial status, with the concurrence of ASD,
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, to demonstrate a noise and flash suppressor assembly for
the M-16 rifle, as well as other firearms equipment. He possessed no security
clearance. He was to demonstrate his equipment only in the RVN and was then to
return to the U.S. Upon his arrival in the RVN, he was given a Military Assistance
Command Vietnam (MACV) Identification and Privilege Card (MACV Form 6) for use
while in country. The application for this card was filled out by Col WILLIAM M.
FAGAN, Commander, Det 6, ASD, TSNAB, RVN. The card, to expire Mar 69, was only to
reflect WERBELL was to have BX privileges, and no grade or rank was reflected
intentionally. The card that was finally issued reflected equivalent rank of GS-16
and gave WERBELL postal, BX, commissary and check privileges for a period of one
year, to Sep 69. The application form was adjusted to show this and someone other
than FAGAN placed FAGAN's initials in the appropriate blocks to obtain these privi-
leges.
-
SUBJECT was the individual who met WERBELL upon his arrival in country, and
who took care of getting his weapons registered in accordance with MACV directives.
SUBJECT also set up the demonstrations WERBELL was to give.
At the conclusion of the demonstrations, rather than return to the U.S.,
WERBELL traveled to Bangkok and Korea, utilizing his MACV ID card and dropping
names of alleged acquaintances of high reputation in order to show his equipment
in those countries. FAGAN obtained the MACV ID card from WERBELL in Bangkok on
8 May 69.
3. On 24 September 1969, a review by SA CUNDIFF of 50D24G-0/86 revealed the fol-
lowing information concerning WERBELL:
FAGAN advised that in Jan 69, WERBELL stated he had captured weapons he
wanted to ship back. FAGAN told him he would help through legitimate channels if
the weapons were for a government agency; otherwise, he would ship back only the
equipment WERBELL brought over. FAGAN heard no more from WERBELL until early
Feb 69, when WERBELL stated he was ready to leave and would bring the items to be
shipped. He was told by FAGAN to bring the items in an open box, which would be
sealed at the aerial port.
FAGAN was unable to locate WERBELL after that meeting until 8 May 69, when he
located WERBELL in Bangkok to retrieve the MACV ID card. WERBELL requested FAGAN
to ship some gear from Saudi, Arabia, to the U.S. FAGAN again replied he would
ship back only the original equipment from TSNAB.
The files contained no further information pertinent to the present investiga-
tion.

DETAILS
1. On 20 September 1969, Mr. GERALD T. CARTA, Staff Operations Officer, U.S.
Embassy, Saigon, Republic of Vietnam (RVN), was interviewed with the assistance of
SA RONALD A. CUNDIFF and provided the following information:
During early January 1969, a Mr. MITCHELL WERBELL, a senior officer in an
American firm (NFI), came to his office requesting assistance in shipping one or
two cartons of captured automatic weapons to Bangkok, Thailand. WERBELL stated
that he was a weapons expert and was in the RVN on invitation from the U.S. Govern-
ment to demonstrate some of his new weapon accessory inventions to the military
services of the RVN and Thailand. WERBELL indicated that he had just spent the
last 2-4 weeks in various northern sectors of the RVN, with U.S. Army Airborne and
Special Forces units. During this period WERBELL had collected various captured
enemy automatic weapons. He advised that he needed these weapons for examination,
in that he was in the process of designing a new automatic weapon that would far
surpass the capabilities of the best foreign made automatic weapon. WERBELL pro-
duced an Invitational Travel Order, issued by the USAF Air Attache, Bangkok,
Thailand. This travel order was approved by the Counselor for Administration (CFA),
U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand. This travel order authorized WERBELL to travel,
on a space available basis, from Thailand to the RVN and return. The travel order
did not reflect a funding citation, which is necessary to ship any large items
aboard a military aircraft. WERBELL stated that he had attempted to ship these
weapons aboard military aircraft stationed at Tan Son Nhut AB (TSNAB), RVN, how-
ever, because his orders did not reflect the necessary funding citation, he was
sent to the U.S. Embassy. WERBELL indicated he was going to use these captured
weapons in a fire power demonstration, to be held for the King of Thailand on his
birthday, which was on the following Saturday. WERBELL stated he was a personal
friend of the King and Queen of Thailand and numbered among his friends many high
ranking military and civilian officials of the Thai government. CARTA placed a
long distance call to the CFA, U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand. The CFA advised
that WERBELL was expected in Thailand by the King for a weapon demonstration, to
be held on the King's birthday. The CFA was informed that WERBELL wanted to ship
one or two heavy cartons to Thailand. The CFA then gave CARTA the Bangkok U.S.
Embassy funding citation, with instructions to have same added to WERBELL's
travel orders. He then asked the CFA: "Do you know what he wants to ship?" and
the CFA replied: "Yes, it's okay". After this conversation the weapons were
packed, along with some items of official equipment, as identified by WERBELL.
Transportation Control and Movement Documents were executed and signed by CARTA.
The U.S. Embassy, Bangkok, Thailand, funding citation was reflected on these
documents. At no time did CARTA examine the contents of the boxes. CARTA iden-
tified the Transportation Control and Movement Documents reflected as attachments
1 and 3, ROI, D07, 2 Sep 69, as the ones executed and signed by him. CARTA could
provide no explanation as to why one of the Transportation Control and Movement
Documents (Atch 1) reflected the contents as antique arms. CARTA stated that he
knew of no other shipments of firearms that had been processed by WERBELL. He
concluded that he does not know SUBJECT, nor has he ever processed any shipments
under SUBJECT's name or for SIONICS, INC.

APATL has no contract with SIGNICS nor does he know of any plans to
enter into a contract with SIGNICS, due to the fact that the Air
Force has no need at this time for noise supressors. DAVIS added
that in his opinion AFATL would need not more than one of each type of
foreign weapon for evaluation by AFATL and he knew of no requirement
to send any weapons to SIQNICS.

DETAILS
1. On 28 July 1969, SUBJECT Voluntarily appeared at OSI Detachment 710.
Eglin AFB, FL and released a previously prepared signed, notarized,
undated statement pertinent portions of which are set forth as follows:
My assignment is Assistant to the Commander of the Air Force Arma-
ment Laboratory. I am responsible for many staff duties, the following
of which bear directly upon my official actions which were taken in
connection with the matter being investigated. (These, of course, are
known by Colonel Martin). Although SIOMICS never has made a sale
to the Air Force Armament Laboratory, or been awarded a contract by
the lab, they are working on developments related to laboratory require-
ments and continue to try to come up with attractive proposals. They
are welcome to keep working to meet our requirements as are other con-
tractors who naturally try to make sales.
Ás APSC munitions specialist in SEA for the second tour, during
1969, I was directed officially to work with SIGNICS in the combat
theater. The AFSO Liaison detachment was requested by its chain-of-
command supervisor, Colonel Louis Schaffer, APSC Assistant for Limited
War, Hq ASD (ASJ), WPAPB, to afford the SIONICS representative every
assistance to include assisting him to get materials in and out of the
country (Vietnam), to introduce him to units in the theater to whom he
could demonstrate SIONICS items developed to use in combat, to advise
and assist him in obtaining quarters and transportation, and in short,
to assist him in every way to perform his mission. The recipient of
this direction was Colonel William Pagan, Commander of the AFSC
Liaison Detachment and my boss in SBA.
The facts in this paragraph are set down only because of the nature
of the questione raised by the CSI. First, why did we telephone SIONICS? No have
We have already mentioned the base defense proposal SIONICS wishes to
submit and for which they made advance queries. In addition to this
subject, SIONICS called frequently to find out if we had received
evaluations through the SEA liaison office of the items placed through-
out the combat theater as previously explained. Many of these were
still outstanding when I left Vietnam. We checked to see if any bad
been received after each call and called back. Sometimes tre were out
when called and were requested to call back. Also, of course, there
were calls about the shipments. Second, what are our personal relations
with SIONICS? AFSC liaison office in SEA and for the Armament Lab as
•herein explained. My actions have been directed and authorized or
no special or unusual favors have been done for SIQNICS. I have had
only one social contact with Mr. Brown. A few weeks ago, the Browns

(or SIQNICS) took us to an Atlanta Braves-Los Angeles Dodgers base-
ball game and the next evening we invited them to dinner as our guest
at the Marriott Hotel. We spent more on them than they had on us. We
have many contractor friends and acquaintances and are very careful to
go "Dutch" in social affairs. This is the standard and the require-
ment for military people who have dealings with contractors. Regula-
tions prohibit us from accepting any form of gratuity so we make certain
we go more than half way in meeting social obligations. We have no
especial relations or connections with SIONICS or any other contractor,
nor has SIGNICS over suggested or hinted we have any. Further SIONICS
has never demonstrated or hinted at any tendency to evade laws, licenses
or other requirements.
The original of the above statement is being retained in the files
of CSI District 7 and will be available to proper authority upon request.
A reproduced copy of the statement is appended to this report as an
attachment.
On 5 August 1969, Mr. ROBERT CORBIS, Investigator, Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Control Division, Internal Revenue Service, Pensacola, FL,
telephonically advised that his agency had initiated an investigation
concerning the involvement of SIONICS, Inc in this matter but that
results of their inquiry were not yet available. CORBIN advised that
his agency would furnish the results of their investigation upon com
pletion.
3. On 20 August 1969, William GOODMAN, Special Investigator, Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Control Division, Internal Revenue Services,
Pensacola, Florida advised Special Agent Grover C. Ayere, Jr. that
investigation being conducted by his service is continuing; however, he
has not received any additional information from the Atlanta, Ca Office.
He advised that upon receipt of additional information it would immediately
be made available to 081.
4. On 22 August 1969, ABNER B. MARTIN, Colonel, SSAN: 251-30-1478FR,
Commander, Air Force Armament Laboratory (AFATL), Eglin AFB, FL was
interviewed at his duty station and advised substantially as follows:
AFATL developes all types of weapons for the USAP, but very few small
arms are required, therefore there is little activity in the small
ares are&. At the present AFATL is developing a survival weapon which
is in the small arms area. SUBJECT, as a representative of AFATL while
on TDY in SEA could send captured enemy weapons of any type or quantity
to AFATL for test purposes, based on his judgment, if he followed
established procedures which would include notifying AFATI that such
weapons were being sent back. Colonel MARTIN stated that to the best
of his knowledge AFATL received no indication or notification that any
such weapons were being sent to AFATL. Colonel MARTIN further stated
that the onery weapons in this case could conceivably be used either

This report relates to an investigation conducted at the request of
Chief Special Investigator, Jacksonville, Florida. The Office of
Special Investigations, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in conjunction
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division, Pensacola, Florida, is
currently conducting an investigation, regarding the alleged illegal
importation of certain Title II firearms by Lt. Col. Paul A. Marriott.
On September 16, 1969, Special Investigator in Charge Arbie R. Odom, Jr.
and I interviewed Mitchell L. WerBall III, at his residence in Powder
Springs, Georgia. In answer to questions asked by Florida, we obtained'
the following information: (1) The shipment of firearms shipped by
Lt. Col. Marriott on or about April 11, 1969, to Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia,
contained 11 Title II firearms. These weapons were obtained by Mr.
VerBell in Vietnam and registered during the amnesty period. Sionics
did not apply for or receive authorization to import these firearms.
(2) The additional boxes of Title II firearms received at Eglin Air
Force Base during June 1969, were sent at the request of Mr. WerBell
by ARPA, and Col. Patterson authorized the shipments after Mr. WerBall
told him they were for Air Force museum purposes. Mr. WerBell was
shown a list of firearms contained in the two boxes currently being
held by the OSI at Eglin Air Force Bace and asked to identify any
belonging to sionics. Ha stated all the sound suppressors except the
one marked HELE 4A, and the Winchester Model 52, caliber .22 rifle,
serial number 69494B, were property of Sionics and were taken or sent
to Vietnam by him. He stated these were taken over on approval of the
State Department, and that the Air Force had agreed to send them to
Vietnam and return them to Sionics; however, he has no written author-
ization. He stated the remainder of the firearms were given to him by
authorized persons, and were to be given to the Air Force to put in
museums.
Before Lt. Col, Marriott left Vietnam, Mr. Werbell told him he would
attempt to obtain captured enemy weapons which he would sand to Lt. Col.
Marriott for the purpose of museum displays”

Lt. Col. Marriott told Mr. Werbell he thought the museum would be grateful
for them. Mr. Werball stated he did not file any Formn 6 on any of the
firearms and had no knowledge of anyone else filing them.
Sionics is in the business of developing and mufacturing silencers for
sale to United States Military Unite and United States Allies. Although
there are apparent violations of Title II of The Gun Control Act of 1968,
it appenra from talking to Mr. WarBell that on the part of Sionics, they
were unintentional. Mr. WarBell stated that prior to the passing of the
Gun Control Act of 1968, the procedure used in exporting and importing
the firearms was the acceptable mathod with the State Department.

Sionics. Mr. WarBell further stated he left many firearms and suppressors
in Thailand, which are in the custody of Major Stevens, 46th Group, Special
