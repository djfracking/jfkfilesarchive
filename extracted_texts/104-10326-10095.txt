ISSUED DAGGERS A BOX CONTAINING AN UNASSEMBLED
3. PAID D/2 THE AUG 93 SALARIES FOR KDHUSTLE/18
(H/18) AND KDHUSTLE/31 (H/31).
4. D/2 ADVISED HE HAD QUESTIONED H/18. AND H31
REGARDING THE CISN'S DECISION TO NO LONGER PROVIDE KDPEEK WITH
THE NEGATIVES TAKEN FROM THE OP. D/2 STATED THE HUSTLES HAD
INFORMED HIM OF THIS ACTION BY THE CISN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.
THE HUSTLES, AT D/2'S DIRECTION, MADE SUBTLE INQUIRIES AT CISN
HQS REGARDING THE REASON FOR CISN'S ACTION, BUT WERE UNABLE TO
LEARN THE REASON, ONLY THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECISION MADE BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF VIDEO AND PHOTOGRAPHY AT CISN HQS. THE HUSTLES,
HOWEVER, IDENTIFIED THEIR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR AS LICENCIADA
ANGELICA CARBAJAL, THE AREA DIRECTOR AS WILFREDO ROBLEDO AND
ROBLEDO'S ASSISTANT AS INGENIERO (FNU) FIGUEROA. THE HUSTLES
DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE INFORMED OF THE
DECISION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VIDEO AND PHOTOGRAPHY.
5. C/O ADVISED DAGGERS TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR
POSSIBLE PRETEXT KNOCKS AT KDPEEK'S DOOR, THIS DUE TO THE
*RECENTLY RELEASED REPORT ON THE JFK ASSASSINATION, >WHICH
INCLUDED INFORMATION ON PHOTOS TAKEN OF AN INDIVIDUAL AT THE
RUSSIAN EMBASSY. DAGGERS AGREED THAT IF SUCH PRETEXT CALLS AT
THE KDPEEK DOOR OCCUR, D/11 WILL, IF NECESSARY, ANSWER THE
DOOR, APPEARING AS A HOUSEWIFE.
6.
C/O WILL BE OUT OF TOWN 8 AUG THROUGH 10 AUG 93.
ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO HAVE NEXT SCHEDULED MEETING ON 16 SEP
93, SINCE IT IS A MEXICAN HOLIDAY, AND A DAY OFF FOR BOTH C/o.
AND THE DAGGERS, AND SINCE TRAFFIC (BOTH HUMAN AND VEHICULAR)
WILL BE DOWN CONSIDERABLY.
F.
PLANS: C/O WILL MAKE APPROPRIATE INQUIRIES OF
LIAISON BRANCH REGARDING WHAT MAY HAVE CAUSED CISN HQS TO
DECIDE TO NO LONGER PROVIDE STATION WITH KDPEEK PHOTO
NEGATIVES, SINCE THE WHOLE AFFAIR MAY STEM FROM A
MISUNDERSTANDING, RATHER THAN FROM A DELIBERATE DECISION BY
SOMEONE AT CISN HQS TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE AGREEMENT
` BETWEEN STATION AND CISN HQS.
