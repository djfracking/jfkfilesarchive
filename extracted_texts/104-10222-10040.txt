JUN 16 11 15 AM '65
During the past year, this officer has continued to demonstrate his
dedication and highly developed professional skills
Subject has been called upon to meet a variety or requirements.
The spectrum of his activity has been so broad that it has run from
the exploitation of his manual dexterity (In installing technical
devices) to the most sophisticated and demanding agent handling.
Throughout the year, Subject has demonstrated his awareness of the
value of KUBARK funds, which he spends as needed but always conscien
tlously. His reporting on his activities has been especially
commendable, and his mastery of tradecraft has been continually in
-evidence.
Subject has now become Chief of PBRUMEN operations for Station
Mexico. This slot was formerly held by a GS-15 officer. It is
requested that Subject be promoted to the grade of GS-15, not only
because of his present assignment, but in recognition of his fine past
performance.

I concur génerally with the assessment made of Mr. Shaw and agree
that Shaw has turned in a highly commendable job and is an excellent
operations officer. From here and not having the advantage of
on-scene observation I would have rated Shaw with straight S' and
overall rating of 'Strong as compared to Outstanding. Nevertheless,
I strong endorse the COS' recommendation for promotion for Shaw.

If my request for reassignment to current Station (first preference) is approved,
I would expect to continue to operate primarily against the PERUMEN target in view
of the priority assigned to that effort in the current RMD for Mexico. I would
like to have an opportunity to do some work in other lines, however, expecially
in host government penetration and possibly in Soviet/Satellite penetration. If
I am to be assigned elsewhere, I would prefer not to work on PERUMEN operations
to the exclusion of other operations. I would prefer to retain ODACID cover which
I have been using since 1948.
If transferred elsewhere, would prefer assignment as Chief of a field installation
have twice been COB in WHD.
I do not wish a HQS assignment at this time. I have already had three HQS tours.
B. INDICATE WHAT TRAINING YOU BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR VALUE TO THE ORGANIZATION (refer
to catalog of course, if available),
In 1963 I completed a four-year stint as an instructer at ISOLATION - do not
