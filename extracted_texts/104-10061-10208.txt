Per our telecon yesterday, I am r
turning the list of names you pro
vided me for checking. I am only
concerned about the protection of
Howard Hao-Sheng Chao. He is a
current asset of the FR Base New
York. I would appreciate it if in
the course of sanitizing any of
the other names listed on the at
tached routing slip, you would
delete Howard's as well. Many
thanks.
