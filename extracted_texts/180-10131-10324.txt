It depends. If he was corporal, private,
is no big interest. If he was officer, maybe they would be
interested.
Mr. Klein. The fact that he worked with the equipment
wouldn't be enough; they would want to know what his rank was?

Mr. Klein. And in 1959 would the Soviet Union have been
interested in someone who served as a radar operator on an air
base where U-2s took off and landed?
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir; it would be very interested.
Mr. Klein. It is your testimony that Lee Harvey Oswald,

but we didn't know that he had any connection with U-2at
flights. That is one thing.
And if you, Mr. Klein, are basing on what was written by
Mr. Epstein in the book, it is a little bit from the air

I asked, anything about my family?

Mr. Nosenko. Mr. Bruce Solie, CIA officer who was in

In judging by the question

Mr. Nosenko.
Father died, I said. Father died in 1956.
After father's death she received a pension.
Mr. Sawyer. I understand. You went through that before.
I noticed here though, when he slashed his wrist, the
psychiatric examination report here by the doctor says the
patient apparently understands the questions asked in Russian,
so he must have spoken Russian, you know, to whatever degree,
when he went there. I thought you said you were always
interested in someone who can speak Russian or has studied
anything Russian.
Mr. Nosenko. Who specializes in any field of Russia,
who will be working for the United States government.
Mr. Sawyer. But here is a guy at that time, when he first
came there, within a matter of days after, the doctor says the
patient apparently understands the questions asked in Russian.
Mr. Nosenko. Sir

Mr. Sawyer.
That would have keyed interest right there,

And yet

that was one of your criteria.

Something else I am a little curious about.

Apparently, coming here, wanting to defect, wanting to leave

9 United States at the behest of KGB in areas of the country that
Russian diplomats and so forth, KGB people weren't allowed to go

you didn't have to threaten, he volunteers. And it seems strange
you wouldn't talk to him or be interested in him just from that
point of view.
And how and another thing that greatly bothers me,
how did you know that he, being in the Marines, you knew that,
but how did you know he wasn't a cryptographer or how did
you know he wasn't stationed in the Office of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff as a guard or as a messenger or a clerk, or that he
worked with U-2s, which apparently he did. Why would the KGB
not at least find these things out, with a guy that wants to
go to Russia, wants to be a Russian?

will be yes and no kinds of questions.
Did you conduct in the KGB a program to compromise and
recruit journalists?
Mr. Nosenko. I was working, when I started to work in the
KGB in 1953, the first year I was working against American
correspondents.
Mr. Edgar. But the KGB, not you personally, but the KGB
did have a policy of going against journalists and trying to
compromise them, yes or no??
10
Mr. Nosenko.
Trying to recruit or compromise them.
11
Mr. Edgar. Did they censor all the journalists' notes
12
that they could gather from the journalists?
Did they censor
13
the notes before they allowed the story to go out?
14
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

.17
Mr. Edgar. Priscilla Johnson interviewed Oswald on the
15th of November, 1959. Would the KGB have looked at her
notes from that interview?
Mr. Nosenko.

Sir, they are censored not by the KGB, but
19
there is special

it is government organization was censoring
this. Some materials are coming to the KGB, some are not
coming.
Mr. Edgar. Well, she reveals in her article that he was a
Marxist, that Oswald was a Marxist and a Marine Corps radar
24
man.
25
It would seem to me the KGB would have discovered that
in November of 1959.

who was a correspondent.
Mr. Edgar. In the earlier questioning of Congresswoman
Burke, you were not confusing Marlene Mosby with the treatment
of Priscilla Johnson?

they were talking returning back to every case.
Mr. Edgar. One final question.
Mr. Nosenko. And also besides Mr. Solie, were people coming
from FBI with cases in which were interested for them.
Mr. Edgar. One final question. You stopped our hearing

Were the notes and the recordsings of those corrections

for a period from the end of '67, the whole '68, 1968, 169, every
conversation he was recording. But he never has come and showed
his notes, transcriptions or anything. He was returning to
every case, to every aspect by 20, 25, 30 times.

Instead they elected to allow him to stay
indefinitely in the Soviet Union and they have to worry about
him every single day, what an unstable American would do, is
that correct?
Mr. Nosenko. They didn't allow, KGB didn't allow. Soviet
government allowed.
Mr. Klein. The facts as you have testified to them are
that the KGB allowed this mentally unstable person to stay
in Russia, and they sent him to Minsk to live and work in a
radio factory. Then the KGB allowed this mentally unstable
11 individual to marry a Soviet woman, and then this mentally
unstable individual was allowed to join a hunting club where

of mentally unstable, excluding one code clerk, American, was

it. I never have worked with him, I never have seen him.

Mr. Klein. After they examined him, the decision was
made to let him stay; is that correct?
Mr. Nosenko. It is not because of the examination
he was allowed to stay, Mr. Klein. You are a little bit mixing
things. He was allowed to stay because KGB and Soviet Govern-
ment had come to the conclusion if this person will kill
himself it will bereaction in newspapers, which can in any way
hurt the starting, the warming of Soviet-American relations.

in the fact that, on the one hand, you
put all these resources into following Oswald around, trying to

you don't even have a person go and talk to him and ask him,
"Tell us your background; tell us about yourself."

Soviet citizens with foreign. A foreigner can marry a Soviet
citizen, by the law.
There is not a thing that KGB can in any
way try not to give, not to make it possible, but this is in
cases when the person who is marrying a foreigner worked in
some sensitive place, let's say, in missiles, rocket
industry production, was in process of any place of his work-
ing seeing classified material. In these cases, KGB will try
to put different type of fences. But it is unlawful. In
accordance with Soviet law, marriage is allowed; he doesn't
need to ask permission of Soviet Government or anyone. And his
12
13
wife, Marina, wasn't working in any place which was sensitive
from the point of view of Soviet security.
Mentally unstable it doesn't mean that he is raving
14
15
16
mad; it is mentally unstable.
Mr. Klein.

not telling them about the physical surveillance, was that the

Mr. Nosenko. Well, I told them that there was done the
work against Oswald; it was ordered, passive type of work,
it's called passive.
Whenever it's ordered not to make an
approachment, not to make a contact, not to make a recruit-
ment, this is passive.
Anything when enters besides whatever is done, contact,
approachments, recruitment, attempt to recruit, it is
immediately called active.

of her, but, let's say, invitation for conversation, something
of this kind, it's some kind of here misunderstanding on both

Marina Prusakova, They were not married.

They didn't know
they didn't apply for marriage. What kind of first will be

Let's say, if she was ever on trial by militia, under arrest.

But more, farther investigation, the true investigation

when they see something, let's say, suspicious in behavior of

not right becuase we didn't know that he was normal or not
normal. Up until the moment of he cut his wrist we started to
suspect.
Mr. Klein. Did you ever say that he was considered not
normal?
Mr. Nosenko. Sir, I do not remember.
Mr. Klein. Well, if you would have said it, would it have
been correct?
Mr. Nosenko. No, it would not be correct, because he cannot
be considered abnormal. We didn't know anything up till he
cut the wrist.
Mr. Klein. You testified to this Committee that you were
present at a meeting with the Chief of the Seventh Department
Chief of your section, Major Rastrusin, at that meeting, it was

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, I do not know, it was somewhere around
Washington, close to Washington, where I was '64 and beginning

newspaper, I do not know, didn't know anything what happen in
the world for many years.
I know that it was by car from Virginia where I was
staying from 12 of February '64, I was taken by car for visit
to doctor, and it was 30, 40 minute drive, it was in this area,
but then in approximately after a year and maybe 13 months, a
year and one month, roughly, I was transferred in very
peculiar conditions, was put under shackles and handcuffs,
blindfolded, put in the car, and don't know where I was going,

82
Thank you.
Mr. Preyer. Mr. Nosenko, one thing that comes through very
5
strongly in your testimony is that it is a hard life to be a
6
defector. I think to the average mentality we think it would
7
be good for a country to welcome a defector, but to the
8
9
intelligence mentality apparently a defector is immediately sus
pect, and you have recounted your treatment here, and apparently
10
Lee Harvey Oswald, from your testimony, was greeted somewhat
11
like this in the U.S.S.R. His treatment was much different
from yours.

14
15
16
One thing he was not an intelligence agent, of course.
But you have indicated that he was kept at arms' length by the
KGB. The impression I get was the mere fact of being a defector
caused the KGB to be less interested in him than if it was
.17°
someone they had recruited?
Mr. Nosenko. Right.

Mr. Preyer.
Although he was kept at arms length by the

KGB, in the sense that he was not contacted, it does appear
that he lived very well there, relatively speaking. He cer-
tainly lived much better than you lived in your early years.
That he was given a job in Minsk, he was given a pension,
which is something that seems extraordinary in this country,
from the
Red Cross, and apparently pretty good housing conditions

be taken drastic measures against the family, but after the
death of Stalin, from middle 1950s, quite a little changes took
place in the Soviet Union, and the family will not suffer.
Another thing, oh sure, will be certain things which they
cannot achieve. Let's say my brother who studied later in
the same Institute what I finish, Institute of International
Relations, he will never have possibility to go abroad, but
he will never be put in jail, can never be exiled from Moscow,
the same, nothing happened with family.

defection cause some irritation among those in power over there?

Oswald received his visa in two days to come to the Soviet

So he would be automatically suspect, and he would be
automatically what you would call an interesting person.
Mr. Nosenko. No, no, no. In this case, you see, Oswald
even didn't receive a visa in United States; he received it
passing through Europe.
Mrs. Burke.
Mr. Nosenko.

Right, in Finland, where it's process was
easier than it will be in the United States. He simply bought
a tour and he received, managed to receive visa.
Mrs. Burke. Let me just ask one other thing.
Did you tell them any of your, aside from the ideological,
why you wanted to defect? For instance, did you tell them
anything about this promotion you thought you had when you went
15 to, was it, Gorki?

'62 -'64, I tried to get as much as possible information, not
only to come what I knew where I participated in the depart-
ment where I worked but to find out as much as possible what can

The reason was that they didn't want him to

Mrs. Burke. I know that. In fact, I remember you
saying something about a person would only be interesting under
certain circumstances, one of which would be if they came in as
a tourist and they applied a very short time before they arrived¿.

now.

experienced to some degree, and I don't know to what degree,
but apparently the Russians don't know to what degree either,
because nobody asked him, in a highly secret air base in Japan,
but they didn't ask him even about that, and it is very rare
to have one come.
I have listened to Radio Free Cuba, where they air all
kinds of propaganda, and this guỷ would have been certainly
good for propaganda when he loved Russia and hated the United
States. And I just, with those circumstances, I very frankly
find it almost impossible to believe that they did not

Obviously the USSR would need this for

obvious reasons. They would badly need this for all sorts of
international reasons.
And finally, the fourth option is that you were dispatched
here by the Soviet Government and the KGB because there was an
actual connection between the KGB and the assassination of
President Kennedy.
These are the items which I have picked up in the last

last of the four, or at least the third to the last of the four
either that the KGB dispatched you here because they needed it
for political reasons, though they were not involved, or they
dispatched you here because in fact they did collaborate with
Oswald.
First, Oswald goes to Russia. You say he is rejected, but
they grant him a pension, however small.
Second, they grant him the pleasures of a hunting club,
even though you said earlier he was mentally unbalanced, and
you are allowing him to use a gun.

story makes no sense.
The rejection of Oswald's offer to defect makes absolutely
no sense to me.
Mr. Sawyer has just pursued that momentarily. I think that
can be rejected by us, by reasonable people prima facie.
I see
no reason to accept that part of your story whatsoever.

10
11
The exposition, taking you off to worry about the exposi-
tion, and so forth, was demonstrated a fraud.
$
No reprisals against your family Nobody was working
against Oswald, you said, yet later on you said you had seven
12
to eight large files, you only read the first portion of one
'file. You said no KGB ever talked to Oswald regarding
13
14
letting him defect. The reason you gave us for that was that he
slashed his wrists and you concluded he was unstable. Yet prior
15
16
17
13
to that discovery of his instability, you granted him a visa
in two days and he asked to be permitted to defect prior to
slashing his wrists, and therefore you had to make the decision
prior to slashing his writs, prior to knowing that he slashed
19
his wrist, that you were going to reject him. That doesn't
20
21
22
hold water either.
Finally, you said in your testimony American defection was
very rare.
All the more reason, if it only happens once every
year or a couple of times a year, or three times between 156
13
24
and '59, it is totally incredible to me that he would not have.

You said he was not interesting, you were not interested

Now, all of these things, Mr. Nosenko, leads me to be
6 very, very disturbed by your story because it simply just
7
on the
face of what you told us last night and tonight, can't possibly
be true.

Is that not correct?
Mr. Nosenko. Yes, because I considered the whole arrest
was unlawful, without due process of law, illegal arrest,
what was the finding as unlawful by Rockefeller Commission.
Mr. Edgar. Thank you.
You were held under those spartan conditions and you
indicated that those statements would have to be unreliable.
Now, I have three specific questions, then, to ask you.
Have you ever told the CIA that these statements could
not be considered reliable?
Mr. Nosenko.
Sure, when we started, they change the
situation, they moved me from spartan conditions, started to
talk with me as a human being, to treat me as a human being.
Mr. Edgar. Did you go on a point by point correction of
any of those statements you previously made?
Mr. Nosenko. It wasn't in the form of simply returning
to document, it was case by case, whatever concerns me, my
biography, my work, whatever cases I knew, whatever cases I

was involved, all questions were raised by 20, 30 times each

Mr. Preyer. Mr. Nosenko, your testimony has been considered
a major piece of evidence, and was so considered by the Warren
Commission as rebutting any Russian connection with the assassi-
nation of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I think the key part of your
5 testimony that we are concerned with, not so much the question
6
about any inconsistencies in it, but are you right on the big
7
question, namely, was Lee Harvey Oswald a KGB agent?
I want to mention, I have been a little surprised by your
8
9 testimony, bythe gaps in your knowledge of Oswald, and really
10
how little you knew about him. For example, when he went to
11 Minsk, he was tranferred out of your oversight, I take it, and
12
as I understood you, you did not know he was married until
13
later on, and did not know he had gone back to the United
15
14
States.
Mr. Nosenko. Mr.
Congressman, if I was staying and
15
working '60 and '61 period in the same Seventh Department which
17
sent file on Oswald in Minsk, I would know, but I was working
18
19
in First American Department.
20 that.
21
Mr. Preyer. Right. Now, I am not questioning you about.
The question I wonder, that that brings to my mind is,
if Oswald had been a KGB agent, are you certain you would have
22 known it? In other words, if you didn't even know he was
23 married, didn't even know he had gone to the United States,
24 couldn't he have been a KGB agent in that period without your
25 knowledge, or are you certain

the Russian language, Russian history, Russian economy.
Mr. Klein. And would they have any interest in an
American who had strong anti-American views and who was a
professed Marxist? Would they have any interest in that
kind of person?
Mr. Nosenko. Here were are coming to a very interesting
and sensitive question. From mid-1950, by the order of
Central Committee Communist Party, Soviet Union, KGB was
prohibited to make any approachment and recruitment of
members of the Communist Party of the West.
Mr. Klein. I am not asking about a member of the
Communist Party.
Mr. Nosenko.
Your question is, and if he is some type
of Marxist here, the question maybe he is possibly a member
of Communist Party, and to check it for KGB very difficult
if he is a member of Communist Party or not of his country.
Mr. Klein. Would they ask him if he is a member of
the Communist Party?
20
Would they check it?
!
21
Mr. Nosenko.
No, they would not ask him.

Mr. Klein.
They wouldn't ask him?

Mr. Preyer. If I have got one more moment, Mr. Chairman,
to change the subject, one of the things that struck me is
that when you defected, as Mrs. Burke mentioned, in Geneva,

the impression that the CIA or American forces to whom you
defected, did not have much to say about the assassination or

Mr. Dodd. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to just pick up on that line of questioning,
if I could, with you, Mr. Nosenko.
Correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it, Oswald,
you were aware of Oswald's desire to defect. There was a
14
decision, and in fact he was informed through his Intourist
guide that his request had been rejected.
15
Is that correctssoffar?
16
Mr. Nosenko. Is in general, but it wasn't in this ways
.17
told to him.
It was in so-called, you know, soft manner.

question. He must go through this, this, this procedures.
Mr. Dodd. Okay.
Now, you, at the time of this, of Oswald's request, you
were working in the Seventh Department of the Second Directorate
which was involved with tourism?

Mr. Nosenko. Right.

Mr. Dodd. Okay. Could you tell me what would be the
normal operating procedures within the Soviet Union if a
4 tourist were involved, say, in a car accident with an Intourist
5
guide. Say a Frenchman was involved in a car accident.
Assuming
it was not his fault, someone hit him, what happens? Do

they notify immediately the French Embassy, what steps do they
take in order to deal with that individual?
Mr. Nosenko. I would assume, sir, that he will be,
sure, he immediately will be taken in polyclinic, will be informed
his embassy.

Right.

15
16
If you had made a decision that Oswald should
not be accepted in the Soviet Union, and if you find him in
his room with his wrist slit, why don't you then contact the
American Embassy and notify them that you have an American on
.17
18 your hands who just tried to kill himself?
Mr. Nosenko.
19
Sir, he wasn't an employee of American
20
embassy.
21
Mr. Dodd. He was a tourist, though.
Mr. Nosenko. A tourist.
22
Mr. Dodd.
13
And I just asked you about a Frenchman who might
24 be a tourist and get in a car accident, and you said you would
25
take him to the hospital, you would notify the embassy.

I think why it was.
Mr. Dodd. You understand my problem here. You have got
someone who you don't want to accept him. You have already
made a decision that he shouldn't be allowed to defect. You
walk into his room and find him with his wrist slit, it would
seem to me that this guy has already indicated just by that act
alone that he is not playing with a full deck of cards, and
you decide then that you are going to accept him because you

are worried that it might cause some embarrassment after Camp
David.
Mr. Nosenko. No. But the question to inform the Embassy,
it must be passing through such stage. Intourist itself cannot

contact the American Embassy.
