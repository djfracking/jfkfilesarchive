Mr. MAKSYMIEC's many skills include outstanding technical
ability in every phase of operations in a photographie laboratory.
I have been informed that while working in Washington, at the
Pentagon, Mr. MAKSYMIEC has conlineed to serve the interests of the
United States. He has been a lecturer at the Military Assistance In-
stitute, and in that capacity has been officially commended by Brigadier
General Henry C. Newien, Director of the Institute.
White 1 was attending the U. S. Anay War College at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania in 1938-1959, Mr. MAKSYMIEC was of considerable as-
sistance to me in the detailed preparation of my thesis: "The Greater
Somaliland Movement, a study in the strategic significance to the United
States".
}
Based on my personal observation and knowledge, I feel that
Mr. MAKSYMIEC is eminently qualified for specialized work in the field
of intelligence. He would be particul.By valuable in all phases of photo-
graphy, and in collection, evaluation, or dissemination of Intelligence.
His investigative ability, particularly in the fields of map reading, geography,
order of baille, or technical subjects is outstanding. He has the unique
ability to collect and assemble pertinent facts and to prepare clear and
concise written reports.

") have known Mr. MYROSLAW A. MAKSYMIEC for more than
seven years. For approzimately two years (1954-1956) during that
period he worked under any direct daily supervision in the Office of the
Army Attache, American Embassy, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Since that
time I have maintained periodic contact with My. (then M/Sgi E-7)
MAKSYMIEC.
Although Mr. MAKSYMIEC's painary job was photographer and
chief of the photographic laboratory while working with me in Ethiopia,
he was also in charge of supply and transportation for the Office of the.
Army Attache.
In the field of photography I consider Mr. MAKSYMIEC to be one
of the outstanding photographers in the Armed Services of the United
States. His work with me was consiston'ly superior both from a technical
viewpoint and from a photographic result viewpoint. None of the assign-
peats that 1 gave Mr. MAKSYMIEC were routine, nor were they easy.
variably they involved considerable ability, temnally, diplomacy, and
judgment. He always accomplished his mission. His detailed captions
were usually accurate and valuable, showing a keen insight into the
subject (human or machine) being covered.
--
His work in photography vas so outstanding that at one time at
Addis Ababa, al a request from TIBE LIFE Magazines, 1 consented
for Mr. MAKSYMIEC to completo a photographic report commenced by
Mr. Alfred Eisenstadt, one of the outaluding photographers in the U. S.

Several piges of pictures taken by Mr. MAKSYMNEC appocred with the

Enclosure No. 3. Page 1
During the period 1954 through 1986, 1 was assigned by Army Attache
System, G2 Intelligence, Department of the Army, to conduct, direct,
establish photographiq center and perform specific photographic assign-
ments in Ethiopia, Africa,
Mission and Tasks
During this period I directed and participated in photography of se-
lected areas, equipments, training film, and selected subjects.
I modified and planned the installation of photographic equipments
that were faced with situations of excessive heat in some inglances and
of severe low temparatures in others. These conditions were also subject
to abnormal influences.
It was essential that 1 had a thorough fambiority with the mission ob-
jectives that would permit me to plan the photographía recording and re-
porting on film within a minimum of interference with propram oporating
sequences. This required me to participate with operating officials,
engineers, scientists, as a member of the team in order to define the
capabilities and limitation of camerus and equipinení do the total planning
of the specific program. This broad knowledge permitted me to utilize
my abilities, imagination, and creative ability to fully develop the photo-
graphic aspects.
I determined the kind of film, position, camera coverage, background, etc.
Lúčvëlopod-me-load schedules based on iniation requirements,
priorities, manpower, and the degrer ofnbilly avaliado.
-reviewed quality and quality of work performed by means of visual
inspection and by discussions with ieu leaders, particularly where
problem areas existed or the mission was nie will intoned scope and
objectives.
I was respongy Ble for the precur at of photopiastic equijenert ond

cluded the repair and maintenquier of all equiperents in vso.

Artistic Serpents
I exercised artistic and creative ability in using photography as a
means of communication of information, historical, splendor, etc., tu
fulfill educational, military, informational objectives.
I exercised control of the settings, actions of the event to be photo-
graphed. I ugnested actions/behavior of pah.cipila; selected backgrounds;
rehersed actions prior to photographing events.
Training
I condicted orientation and briefing courses for U. S. personel in

Army:
"Whether this in mouseal ve whether you can appropriately pass
this letter on to officials concerned in the Department of Defense I do not
know. But Edo went to write the strongest sort of commendation of the .
work of Afaster. Berivant Myroster Al Mayted. Sergeant Abajurice
was associated in Me Office of the Army Aluche here in Addis Ababa,
particularly for the purpose of photographie coverage.
It would please motif you would be able to forward this letter of
mire to appropriate officials in the Defense Department. I know that
Colonel John D. Townsend, who was the Army Allache here during
practically all of Baegoant Makaymico's service, would agree with me
both in my esinute of the Scent's usefulness and efficiency and in
seeing to it that this letter of commendation be endorsed in the Defense
Department.
S.
At the present time Sergound Maksymion to assigned in the photo- -
graphy laboratory in the Pentagon. Undoubtedly he is making a fine con--
tribution there. I do know that he was of vant importance to out total
American operation here in Ethiopia, not only military, while he was
stationed with the Aemy Attache in Addis Ababa. He is a compotent, co-
operative, and persistent workman in attaining desired goals. His photo-
graphic output is way above average, both in quantity and quality. The
Army Attache system, based on my observation of Sergeant Maksymice's
work in Ethiopia, stands in very great debt to him."

asset in his work. where extreme attention to detail and
good Judgement-are-absolute necessities. He exhibits a
willingness to work for the group, no matter the hour,

Mr. Myroslaw Maksymiec

Washington, D. C. 20016
Dear Mr. Naksymiec:
This letter is in response to the comment you mado
to the Director on Alumni Day, 26 April 1975, concerning
a special medallion for NPIC employees who participated.
in the Cuban missile crisis,
I have had the appropriate records reviewed. The
Certificate of Commendation you and other NPIC employees
received was awarded by direction of the President in
recognition of the meritorious service performed.
It is hoped that the lack of a medallion to accompany
this certificate will in no way detract from the contribu-
tion you made during this period of crisis.
Sincerely,
/c/John E. Blake

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

:
DD/A 75-2034
26 APR 1975
1. The facts behind the question raised with the
Director by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are,
according to him, as follows.
2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the
Cuban missile crisis it appears that two different types
of recognition were given. Determinations were made
first on certain individuals whose contributions were
such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A
second group of some 200 were then identified for their
level of contribution and received some kind of certifi-
cate from the White House signed by the President. Mr.
Maksymec was in the latter group and espouses the cause
that a "special medallion" should have been given along
with the White House certificate. Mr. Bob Gaynor also
spoke to me on this matter on Saturday, and has a good
recollection on the whole matter.
3. Will you do what you can on the matter and pre-
pare me a letter to be sent to Mr. Maksymec?

He mentioned that Mr. Blake, at the direction of the DCI,
(1975 Alumni Day) was to explore and advise him (Maksymiec) of the
possibility of striking and issuing a medal to about 200 Agency
personnel (of whom he is one) for their participation in certain
aspects of the 1962 Cuban crisis.
Our meeting ended with Mr. Maksymiec indicating he had no
intention of "going after anybody," but he was curious what was in.
his file, and that was the basis for asking to see it.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Mr. Myroslaw Maksymiec Retired Employee
-
The meeting with Mr. Maksymiec on 6 May 1975 was to satisfy his
request to review his official personnel rile (this matter was
being treated in the manner of a request under the Freedom of
Information Act). Location: Main Reception Interview Room at
Headquarters Building
-
3. p.m.
The duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of which time
Mr. Maksymiec used approximately 7 to 8 minutes to quickly thumb-.
thru the OPF. It is my impression that he was surprised: 1) ve
vere allowing him to see all the material in the file ( he described
vividly, a 1971 unpleasant encounter with Mr. Echols, the Director
of Personnel, who refused to show him a document and would only
read to him a small portion from it
subsequent interview with the DCI, Mr. Helms), and 2) at the
this caused his request and
reality that the file contained nothing actually derogatory
(he stated he had seen and signed the fitness reports so these
represented nothing unknown).
-
The major portion of the time was consumed in my listening
to his evaluation and assessment of the various supervisors and
co-workers at NPIC and their shortcomings. He regaled me with
much of his background and history with the military and initial
application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his personal
acquaintance and relationships with notables
Ambassador to Ethiopia, Joseph Simonson, the Emperor of Ethiopia,
a former American
several Generals and Congressional personalities, Mr. Helms and
Mr. Arthur Lundahl, and his membership in the Explorer Club.
-
-
:
Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environmental
Coating Industries Corporation located in Annandale, Virginia
the company removes corrosion and stains from surfaces.
offered the company services at the 1974 Alumni session, to
He
clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the front of the..
building, at a cost of $300. He plans to follow-up on his pro-
posal, since he has not heard anything from the Agency.

first-level supervision to allow him to learn the skills required to perform
these duties.
To. insure that he is given every opportunity to perform in his new
section, written assignments and accomplishments will be submitted on a
daily basis.
In line with previous reports, it is still felt that Mr. Maksymiec is
essentially mis-assigned as he is an expert photographer and should be assigned
in some area where his skill can be utilized to its fullest extent.

During the past reporting period, Mr. Maksymics' responsibilities were more
pointedly directed towards the requirements of a laboratory technician's described
in the position description and less towards his previous utilization as a photog-
rapher. A conference was held with him on 15 June to explain the need for this re-
direction and a memo ATB 147/70 dated 16 June was prepared and furnished to him
detailing of performing these duties and was anxious to stop being thought of an
a photographer and welcomed the opportunity to move into a more technically oriented
activity. The specific duties outlined are listed in Section B of this report.
It was expected that there would be a learning period during which his pro-
ficiency would gradually increase in these new responsibilities. However, progress
has not been as rapid as had been hoped due to what appears to be a lack of
initiative on his part coupled with cevere emotional outbursts against hic immediate
supervisor and other Center personnel. The latest of these occurred on 22 August
in which he used abusive language in the presence of other Branch personnel in-
cluding the Branch Chief against his Section Chief. This necessitated a written
letter of reprimand and his transference to direct supervision by the Branch Chief,
and as of 5 October 1970, to another Section within the Branch.
The ratings of M in Duties 1 and 2 of Section B reflect primarily the subject's
reluctant participation in data collection and his lack of initiative in learning
the operation of the microdensitometer. In duties 4, 5, 6, he has required a mu̸z-
imum amount of supervision which has resulted in senior personnel doing the work

I concur with the rater's comments. We have been making every effort
to aid Mr. Maksymiec in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician.
To date, there has been little noticeable progress; in fact, the temper out-
bursts mentioned above indicate a deteriorating condition. Unless this
situation improves, it may be necessary to recommend termination action.
1. As. I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot
find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since
this would go a long way to resolving his problems.

has not completely heeded this advice.
Two distinct training activities were advised for assisting him in making the
transition: a courge of Instruction in math necessary to discharging technician's
duties, and on the job project work. The former persisted for only a short time, due
presumably to his lack of ability and/or interests. He improved very little from this
instruction. His sistance on a project for developing an ammonia leak detector was
effective, and the project was a success; however, his thin knowledge of the seientific
method diminished his appreciation of the concept of experimentally controlled
variables. In short, he had to be watched closely to insure that his well-meaning
"Improvement" did not disrupt the experimental plan. His interest and cooperation in
this program were commendable, and his overall project performance was adequate.
Mr. Maksymice is basically mis-assigned. His abilities and interests lie
in the photographic field where he does a very commendable job. Rwever, the
Laboratory needs the services of properly trained technicians to assist the physical
scientists in their research efforts. Since Mr. Maksymiee's expertise is not in
this area, it is again recommended that suitable employment as a photographer be
found for him.

Section C Continued
SECKET
Fitness Report
He has also had serious disagreements with a summer intern and another
member of the laboratory which had to be settled by conferences with the
Isboratory chief. A major disagreement with the Laboratory Chief took
place recently which resulted from his feeling that he had been treated
unfairly without consideration for his age, knowledge and training.
As a result of these problems, a series of conferences with
Mr. Maksymiec and senior members of the division were held in order
to find a possible solution for his problem. Because of these meetings,
an in-house training program has been initiated for Mr. Maksymiec.
It is hoped that this will do much to alleviate his feelings of repres-
sion and make him a contributing member of the laboratory once again.
Section D_Continued
In spite of the reduction in need for Mr. Maksymiec's primary skills,
he has expressed a desire to continue his present assignment. Therefore,
a program of retraining has been instituted to broaden his knowledge and
increase his versatility in carrying out laboratory investigations.
Mr. Maksymiec is a hard working, dedicated employee and there is every
reason to expect that he will try hard to overcome his deficiencies.
However, his age, limited education, previous success in photography,
and lack of knowledge in scientific methods pose serious obstacles to
be overcome. His present attitude is characterized by his own statement,
"Show me how, and I will do it."

There have been a few minor personality conflicts on procedural matters
related to job assignments between Mr. Maceymic and both staff and non-staff
personnel, which have been reported to his laboratory chief and the executive
officer, TD5. It is believed that this is due to his strong desire to excel

that he will avoid such occurrences in the future.

Mr. Maksymiec's ability as a staff photographer is un-diminished. His
photographic ability is considered by all in the Center as excellent.
It has been pointed out to Mr. Maksymice that the laboratory does not.
have a basic requirement, or a slot for a photographer, and since he is curried
on a D & E technician, he should be more qualified than he is in other aspects
of photographic and scientific research other than straight "picture taking", as
he does not have the basic foundation either in formal education or experience
to perform successfully as a D & E technician. This lack of qualification in
this area can be partly explained by two factors: (1.) Mr. Maksymiec's position.
description was recently changed due to the reorientation of the laboratory'a
primary mission and function; and (2.) Because of his previous photographic
responsibilities he did not have the opportunity to gain the new skills required
to fulfill his new duties as a D & E technielun. Mr. Maksymiec will have to
be re-trained from a photographer into a D & E technician go that he can con-
tribute more to help solve the laboratory annigned tasks.
Mr. Maksymiec still had problems in his relationship with other members
of the laboratory during this reporting period. It appears to have been about
his concern with his position in the laboratory grade stricture and his feeling
that he was "ignored" by senior members of the laboratory, Mr. Maksymicc
ceems to have had a feeling that members of the laboratory including his Chief
did not recognize his ability as a photographer and pay suitable deference to his
age.

I concur in the ratings and comments of the rating officer. In the latter
part of the rating period the activities of the Exploratory Laboratory were being
changed from ad hoc research projects to a directed program of planned investi-
gations against NPIC and community problems. This change in activities reduced
the freedom of choice in tasks to be accomplished and increased the demand for
versatility in laboratory personnel. The lack of freedom and the assignment. of
unfamiliar tasks are distasteful to Mr. Maksymiec since he doubts that these
activities will provide the personal recognition he has enjoyed for many years
an outstanding photographer.

This review course in grammar and punctuation was too advanced
for Mr. Maksymiec. He needs an elementary course on the English
fundamentals preferably on a tutorial basis before he can adequately
apply the rules of punctuation and grammar to his work.
In a personal conference with Mr. Maksymiec, the instructor
analyzed his weaknesses in grammar and punctuation and suggested
ways in which he might improve his performance in these areas.

Mr. Maksymice also took the Army General Classification Test, Civilian
Edition, to find out his overall level of mental ability. His score revealed
that he exceeds approximately 78 percent of adults in general mental capacity
as measured by this instrument. A safer evaluation of his performance is
that he is probably in the upper 25 percent of adults regarding his global
intelligence.
F
On the Michigan Vocabulary Profile Test, an instrument that attempts
to measure a person's intellectual interests as well as the amount of infor-
mation he has retained in various areas of knowledge, Mr. Maksymiec indicated,
when compared with college freshmen, that he exceeds approximately 50 percent
in his knowledge of human relations, 69 percent in government, and 67 percent
in the physical sciences. On the lower side, he does as well or better than
24 percent in his familiarity with commerce, 3.1 percent in mathematics, and
24 percent in fine arts.
In order to find out Mr. Maksymiec's ability to handle English, a
basic necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the
Cooperative English Tests. When compared to college freshmen, he showed that
he exceeds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his understanding of vocabulary;
from 5 to 17 percent in his ability to comprehend what he reads; from 2 to
11 percent in his speed of comprehension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his
overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions.
In his skill to express himself properly in English, he exceeds from 1 to
6 percent of college freshmen. When reading and expression are combined
into one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec exceeds from 6 to 12 per-
cent of college freshmen in his overall usage of English.
The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made
the most of his learning opportunities both within and outside the military
service. Although he completed only eight years of school, he has acquired
a considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading, and personal
experience. In spite of his broad experiences and acquired knowledge, it will
be necessary for him to improve his reading and writing skills in English,
however, before he begins college courses. Although he manifests a high
interest in engineering and scientific fields, he should probably not con-
sider these fields as majors because of his deficiency in mathematics.
is believed the skills in English can be developed but it is doubtful if
the mathematical deficiencies can be overcome sufficiently to major in a
scientific area. It is probably advisable,
It is probably advisable, therefore, for Mr. Maksymiec to
consider one of the social sciences as a college major. His background in
photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-
propriate social science, would probably provide him with the necessary
qualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analyst in govern-
ment service.
It
It is understood that Mr. Maksymicc has enrolled in Montogomery Junior
.. College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will
take a special English course concentrating on the fundamentals of reading

JUH
Mr. Maksymice, In serving as the senior laboratory technician, setu a fine
example for those whose responsibilties are similar and for the younger professionals
for whom he provides photographic laboratory services. As a photographer he possesses
Hic
rare compositional skills; his photographs of equipment for report and briefing
purposes are exceptionally well-crafted, the finishing of curpassing quality,
work is careful, thorough, painstakingly accurate, and professional by all standards.
After more than a year in his present position, he feels more relaxed and
self-assured. He asserts his views and ideas more competently and has become an
integral and important part of this laboratory's operations. Mr. Maksymice works
exceptionally well with others, accepts responsibility freely and requires a minimum
of direction. Most of his assignmerita come as discretionary ordern, with complete
freedom to utilize his own talento and inclinations towards the solution of his
assigned problems. He continues to improve his capabilition, and is presently enrolled
in a Department of Agriculture course in the fundamentals of photographic color
procencing, at his own request,
Mr. Mokzymlec's one major weakness lies in the difficulty with which he writes
reports. The ability to communicate ideas and results of investigations clearly,
through written reports, is a necessary attribute of laboratory branch members, and
Mr. Maksymice sust concentrate extra effort to improve his performance in this regard..
During the next reporting period, he will be given assistance to improve his roping
capabilities.

aspects of theoretical photography. He has acquired proficiency in the use
of laboratory measuring instruments. He has applied himself and learns
rapidly, with good retention. His frame of mind has improved, and this is
manifested in a more relaxed, yet completely involved approach to his work.

thereby enabling the United States to respond immediately and
effectively to the developing threat. The outstanding
achievement of the members of the National Photographic
Interpretation Center is in keeping with the finest traditions of
service to the United States,"

performing duty at any time during this period are hereby authorized to
wear the emblem or ribbon for the following decoration, as appropriate

SUBJECT
: Commendation
1. As Director of Central Intelligence and on behalf of the
entire intelligence community as well as the United States Govern-
ment, I wish to commend you and the personnel under your command
for the outstanding work you have been performing, especially during
the past four months of the Cuban buildup. .
2. Your analysis and interpretation-of-the-Cuban photography
and the manner in which-you-reported your findings to the President,
tus-principal policy advisors, most particularly the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of Defense, and the entire intelligence com-
munity have been of the highest order.
3. I have full knowledge of the tremendous pressures and long
working hours with which NPIC was confronted. I regret that the
anonymity required of a professional intelligence agency such as yours
prevents public acknowledgment of NPIC accomplishments. You and
your people should take great pride in your accomplishments as well
as in your ability to perform them without public acclaim.

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON
November 8, 1962
While I would like to make public the truly
outstanding accomplishments of the National
Photographic Interpretation Center, I realize
that the anonymity of an organization of your
high professional competence in the intelligence
field must be maintained.
I do want you and your people to know of my
very deep appreciation for the tremendous task
you are performing under most trying circum-
stances. The analysis and interpretation of the
Cuban photography and the reporting of your
findings promptly and succinctly to me and to
my principal policy advisers, most particularly
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of
Defense, has been exemplary.
You have my thanks and the thanks of your
government for a very remarkable performance of
duty and my personal commendation goes to all of
you.
Mr. Arthur C. Lundahl

Sincerely,
The n
