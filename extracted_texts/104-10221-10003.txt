There is a good chance that Nexico may participate in tha
Fifth Industrial Fair in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in September
1963. The announcement was made by Dr Emilie Vora Blanco,
president of the National Chamber of Industry of Mexico,
upon his arrival in Nexico City from Zurope on 30 Septorbor
1962. While in Europe, Dr Vera Bianco had interviews with
Europaan industrialists and government officials, among
them the assistant Trade Minister of Czechoslovakia, who
showed great interest in Nexico. (Mexico City, La Prensa,

SECRET
1. The attached passports were obtained from a sensitive
photo coverage at the airport in Mexico City of passports of
persons arriving on all flights from Havana, Cuba, and
Brussels, Belgium. (Many Soviets travel to Mexico via
Brussels.) The operation is conducted with the knowledge of
a particular office of the Mexican Government but is not a
liaison.
2. It is suggested that your desk review the passports
of your citizens, and send the copy to the 201 file in RID if
there is one, and take whatever other action you wish. There
should be no dissemination of the passport and no exploitation
thereof without prior coordination with WH/3/Mexico and with-
out due care to protect the source.
3. Coptes of these passports and the reels have been
furnished TSD/IB therefore you should not send your copies
to them.
4.
The manifests have been sent to RID/ZZ for processing.
5. Any questions on the above or the attachments should.
be directed to the LITEMPO case officer, WH/3/Mexico, x6026
or x6110, Room 3B003.

Compañeroes
I have arrived here together with Comandante Adan after a series of
hardships and of many delays owing to a number of reasons which he can
explain in detail oven better perhaps than I could..
I have been making these trips without a visa because the compañero
Enrique seems not be overly fond of me, and motivated by two reasons.
One of them is to try to put my shoulder a little to the wonderful
struggle you are carrying on, by a reportage on the guerrillas. The other
reason was my concern over a number of circumstances, and basically the
arrest of Galvan in Quatemala.
So I came with the wish primarily of giving you the items of infor-
mation I had, and particularly to Comandante Adan. I make this clear
because there has been considerable speculation to the effect that I was
being sent by the Cuban comrades and even that my opinions were not mine
at all but the expression of their opinions. In fact, some comrades
suggested to me the advisability that I should mention this here.
I refused, of course, for a basic reasons because it is not so.
I did not come here as a representative of the Cuban comrades, whom I have
64
not seen since February, when none of these problems had arisen, or if
they had arisen they were not acquainted with them, or if they were
acquainted with them they did not tell me about them. So, I have no idea
what, their opinion on the subject may be. Consequently, all I can do is
speculate on what might be their thinking to the limit that I am aware of
their general ideas; and then, since I know what they think about the
liberation movements in Latin America, I can imagine what they night
think with regard to these problems.

The following pages contain a translation of a talk
by Mexican journalist Victor Rico Galan. The talk was
recorded on a small portable tape recorder and was then
taken to the hills and played to the Guatemalan guerrillas.
This taped talk and seven other small rolls of taped
propaganda and discussion were captured in mid October
1964 by the Guatemalan Army in a raid against guerrillas
in the Panzos area of Alta Verapaz. The identities of
some of the names used in the talk are as follows:
Commandente Adan: Marco Antonio YON Sosa, leader-
of the "13th of November" guerrilla movement. This is
the first time we have heard of YON Sosa referred to by
this name.
Companero Enrique: a mockingly respectful reference
to Guatemalan Chief of Government Col. Enrique PÉRALTA.
The arrest of Galvan: Felipe Galvan Bartoluchi,
Mexican courier to Guatemala was arrested in Guatemala
City in March 1964. He was carrying two suitcases of
communist literature and records at the time, and was
himself documented as "Isidro Alfaro Ramos".
Sierra de las Minas: Mountain area north west of
Zacapa; guerrilla safe area.
PGT: Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, the
Quatemalan Communist Party.
Lula Turcios Lima: Second in command of the
"13th of November" guerrillas.
Comrade Rolando: Obviously a pseudonym. Wo have
been unable to establish this man's true identity.
Pancho Villagran Kramer: Francisco Villagran Kramer,
leftist Guatemalan political leader; head of the URD Party.
Alfredo Guerra Borges: Central Committee member of

I have also received a series of letters from various countries, and
in my travels I have noticed how people would ask me with enormous interest
about your struggle. In Mexico I pretty nearly told them in jest that it
seems that they regard me as the owner of the Guatemalan revolution
because every time that some news item or rumor reaches them all the
revolutionary people come and talk to me on the telephone or send for me
to find out what my opinion is, as though I had a direct wire to the
Sierra de las Minas there to be informed of every last thing that occurs
to you.
Act
I tell you all this in somewhat prolix detail because I am afraid
that you, buried to some extent here in the mountains, may, be aware of
the historic role you are playing at this moment. And I also want to
tell you that here in Guatemala, where I have been for two weeks--although
I was here covertly and that, of course, limited my activity--I havo
nevertheless been able to see the interest, devotion, and enthusiasm
with which the guarrilla struggle is being followed.
My opinion is that the guerrilla movement in Guatemala has definitely
taken hold and that it will end only on the day of victory. I want to
tell you also recently I famd out that Comandante Guevará thinks exactly
the same. A comrade in the Mexican Communist Party, a member of the
Central Committee and nausean, visited Cuba. A close personal friend
of mine, he visited Cuba and had an interview with Che mainly on economic
matters, together with other Mexican newsman. They talked for a long time,
and when they finished Che asked them a number of questions about Maxico
and then they asked him about the liberation movements in Latin America.
Cha told them that in his opinion the two countries in which the movement
vas most solid and firm despite every difficulty ware Quatemala and Vono-

But you also can imagine that, since you also know what they think.
So there would be no sense to my trip here if its purpose were to tell
you something that you may know perfectly well. What I have stated here
has been on my own exclusive responsibility and as a result of my [word
“unintelligible) working alone.
I have told the Comandante that in my opinion there have arisen here
a number of problems which have objective roots but which have become
somewhat complicated and distorted to the extent of leading to a situation
that may be dangerous in the future, that may convert the Trece de
Noviembre into just another group, another sect, that may therefore
isolate slightly from the masses in general or at least from a number of
strata of the people whose support in the struggle is important.
On the international plans I have seen the importance of the Trece
de Noviembre as a symbol of the struggle for national liberation not only
of Quatemala but also of Latin America, and the importance of Comandanto
Adan as the chief or head of that nucleus. The reportage I wrote on it
m.b
just a year ago was successful partly owing to the collaboration of the
A
Cuban comrades and partly because of the natural curiosity aroused by the
subject. It was reproduced by newspapers in the United States, in Europe--
for instance, L'Estrelle de Paris reprinted it; it was reprinted by the
New Statesman of London; newspapers of a broad but important left wing in
Europe--I even have a magasine from New Zealand which reprinted the reportage.
By that I convey to you the importance which was attributed to the
moverent. I have not mentioned Cuba or China, of course. You know that
the interview was published by Hoy, the organ of the FURS, and in China
it was reprinted by the Party organ, People's Daily.

they always maintained was that the fundamental nucleus of the 26 July,
organisation was an agent of cohesion of the revolutionary forces, and they
succeeded in polarising those revolutionary forces and succeeded in avoiding
problems, and this in the end led the revolutionary forces to victory.
With regard to this, I would like to tell you something else? I have
never beeh in favor of that attitude, very widely generalized in Latin
America, which is to say: "Well, you can see what Fidel did. This was
not done by Fidel; this was done by Fidel." I think this is abysmal error,
because what Fidel did he did under very special historical circumstances,
and what you are doing is different and has to be different. You have no
reason at all to follow the Cuban or any other experience, but I do think
it is advisable to learn from international experience and take advantage
of it to the extent that it may be useful,
'
tain
I say this because it seems to me that there has been here a certain
idealistic tendency to take a position above the masses. I am referring to
the debates on the character of the revolution, on the participation of
the bourgeoisie, whether the Chinese or the Soviets are right, and a number
of questions like that. I realism very well that when I say this you may
say that I am half out of my mind or that I sum unwilling to commit myself
to a position. That is not sos I shall try to explain my idea as clearly as
I can.
My idea is this: When you are struggling in a country which is highly
developed, very complicated, politically very sophisticated, where there is
a working class of great experience, politically info med, militant, where
oven the peasants themselves are acutely aware of their problems, their meds
-let us say France, let us say Italy--all these rigorous analyses of the
composition of the bourgeoisie, distinctions mong various aspects of that
bourgeoisie, analyses of the nodds of the working clase, of the international

are not understood, you see? and in the second place they cause a state
of confusion, especially among a people which is not politically sophisti-
cated, as in Guatemala--, I think that despite those --- those negative
things this has been the clang of a bell; has shown the comrades in the
POT the extent to which they had committed errors and abandoned a number
of possibilities of struggle.
About that I have talked to them at considerable length and have talked
to them in utter loyalty and clarity, and they admit that all that is taking
place is not the product of error on the part of the Trece or a bad line
of the Trece exclusively but a product of their very own errors also.
They do assume their share of responsibility and I think it is important
that you know and appreciate that fact--important for this reason, that there
might arise in some comrades, and I am referring particularly to Rolando,
a certain lowering of morale: that he might think that he erred in some things
and might allow himself to be destroyed politically. I think this would be
a serious error, do you not? and I think it would be false attitude. We must
start from the premise that everybody has committed errors and that these
errors have been commonplace everywhere. Let us remember, for instance,
that in Cuba there was in the organisation of that famous strike, the one
that failed, of April 1959, none other that a David Salvador, who was a
Falangista, and there was none other than a (Bill DeWalt?] who was an
imperialist agent; and that in Cuba there were public statements of the
26 July movement which Fidel Castro had to discwm later, and there was
constant misunderstanding between the people who were in the sierras and
the militants in the cities; and there were very earious conflicts between
the PC? and the 26 July movement; and there were all those parasites from
the Escambray Second Front who were good for nothing. In short, a series
of problems, which did not prevent attaining victory because the position

I think for this reason that you must view your problems not as
another group carrying on polemics with other groups but to some extent
from the height in which you are placed, oven physically. You must
realise that the difficulties there have been are due basically to the
fact that the comrades in the POT have long delayed turning into deeds
their own ideas on the struggle. They have set forth a line to the effect
that aspects may not be discussed but that (phrase unintelligible] correct.
The 11-point resolution of December which places the armed struggle and
especially the guarrilla phase at the core of the revolutionary struggle
seems to me to be correct in general. But they have had many difficulties
because there have been debates, obscurities, some of them perhaps did not
understand that or were opposed--I do not know, I do not have many details.
But of course it has not been possible; they have not found it possible or
else have lacked the capability to devote their activity to the armed
struggle. Consequently their participation, which there has been--wə cannot
deny it; I think it would be unjust to dany the participation of the PGT-
has been the participation of a rearguard, of support. They have lost
cadres here in (Ixtabal?) and elsewhore suffered the consequences of the
struggle; some comrades of the POT are actively persecuted--but always in
connection with support activities.
I believe your role is to drag them into a more active participation
in the struggle--not to fight them or fight them only to the extent that
such a fight may lead than into the battle and not occasion a split. In
my opinion this is going to be much easier from now on because, altough
what happened with the publication of the newspaper is dangerous in my
opinion--and it is dangerous because it poses a number of things which

to face the problem of defeating a bourgeoisie such as the French bourgeoisie,
which has ideologists and has rulers of the caliber of a De Gaulle, and
face the problem of defeating an idiotic bourgeoisie such as the Quatemalaṇ:
bourgeoisie, with a ruler like comrade Enrique, is it? In other words, the
weapon needed to shoot down De Gaulle--to state it thus in very simple
personal terms--has to be much more long-range and much more perfect than
the weapon required to shoot down Peralta. Peralta can be brought đơm
just about by pitching a rock at him, can he not?
This, all this tends to indicate that to exaggerate idealogical questions
to the masses will lead us nowhere. I have been able to observe that the
following has happened with the newspaper--and I told Comandante Adan yes-
terday-- that those who understand it do not approve of it. And I am not
referring to the people of the PGT but to many well-meaning people; for
instance, to Rodrigo Asturias, who is in Mexico, a survivor of the [Cumquat?),
a wholesome fellow, studious, concerned, who is very amious to come here
to join the struggle--he was really dumbfounded at the document,
The same
for honorable people like Carlos (Barquesada]. On the other hand, most of
the people, the masses that do not understand it, cannot understand all that
complicated terminology, all that obscurity, all those generalisations of
concepts that do not stimulate anybody to the struggle, that do not pose
actual and concrete objectives.
That is my opinion. I believe that on this point you must establish
a very skilful, vary intelligent balance between your own political training
and your daily contact with the masses, and you will gradually be told [sic]
what the masses must be told.
On this point--I say this rather to carado Holando--, putting these

are necessary. They are necessary because for a party, for a group to have
authority it has to persuade masses which have high political sophistication.
In our countries we face no such problems. We do not face such problems
because our masses are thoroughly unconcerned from a political standpoint.
In another --- rather, stated in better terms, more clearly and more
accurately, they have a very elementary understanding of their problems.
The concern of the peasant is for the soil; I do not think it goes beyond
that at the moment. I believe that if the peasant is offered land, is
offered schooling for his children, medical care, and so forth, he will not
demand any more explanations. He sees no other problems
So, when I read in Revolucion Socialista all these things, about the
Bolivian masses, the armed militias, it is a truly shocking confusion. And
I say this because I know Bolivia, I have been there, I have seen their real
problems. When I see all this about Peru, where the masses are said to be
doing their will, with a semifeudal government, it is truly it seems to
C
me that we are falling into a number of questions which there is no purpose
in discussing here.
And it is not that I champion the abandonment of ideology. No, I think
that you, the leaders, the people of the central nucleus, must study, must
read, must read the classics. The other day I heard u recording by our
comrade (Surcio?] with reference to this, and I think the attitude la vory
proper. You must have the clearest possible view, but I think it would
be mistaken on your part not to realise that if you advance too far ahead
you will isolate yourselves from the masses.
Also, and in connection with this same subject, it is not the same thing

ideas into slightly theoretical form, it would be necessary to reread and
study that famous document by Eao Tse-tung on contradiction, where he
explains how contradictions are gradually displaced in the evolution of
society and particularly, in a revolution, how the basic contradiction
gradually displaces other contradictions which often are the most apparent
ones and are most manifest to the masses and which all express the basic
or fundamental contradiction but express it in different ways.
So we have no reason to propose the destruction of the bourgeoisie and
alienate the support of a number of people who feel bourgeois. I myself,
to come here, was helped by petty bourgeois of this area itself. These
petty bourgeois, of course, are not the national bourgeoisie to which the
program of the PGT refers, but they feel they are bourgeois. They cannot
distinguish, when you condemn the national bourgeoisie in the newspaper,
they cannot distinguish between themselves and whether they are or are not
the national bourgeoisie. They feel affected. Why should we alienate their
collaboration?
I even pointed out to the Comandante cases such as that of Pancho
Villagran r
ameri there is no doubt that he is bourgeois, a bourgoois
ideologist and a bourgeois politician, yet he has given you his collaboration
and may give it again. What need is there to have a fight with him? Ona
must maintain the firmness of principles, as Comandante Adan did in the
interview, specify clearly the disagreements, but not picture him as an enemy.
It seems to me that on this point Comandante Adan expressed the true policy,
which consisted not in saying, "Villagran is our easy because he is bour-
geois”—which would be the logical consequence of what has been published
in the newspaper-but to say, "He is my friend but I think that he is
mistaken; that he is not going to accomplish anything." This seems to ne

being carried on in the mountains.
Now I would like to say a few words for our comrade Rolando. They are
nothing secret, but they are things which interest him personally.
Isabel is in Cuba. I loft 15 days ago today; that is, yesterday, Satur-
day, it was two weeks. The day after my departure she was to leave for Cuba,
by way of Europe, of course, so she would be able to return. The trip had
already been set up by Comandante Quevara, and Isabel had been invited,
but it had not been made definite because the Cubans move very slowly in
some things. Just after the trip of (woman's name] and the letter Rolando
sent me, and in view of what he was requesting of me in that letter--and
the difficult situation that she was in, obviously, from every viewpoint,
including the economic one, and the my difficulties in any attempt to give
any help--I of course tried to activate the matter of her trip, went at it
in a direct manner, and arrangements were made right away. She did not
want
to 80.
First of all she was very interested in knowing how the situation
would come out here and what I would propose on my return, etc. In addition
she was very concerned about the health and the morale of comrade Rolando.
So she did not want to go, and I had a rather hard time persuading her.
At last I succeeded; I showed her that in any event Rolando in my opinion
would have to devote some time to his treatment. Whether this was done in
Cuba, or Mexico, or Czechoslovakia, she would be in a position to accompany
him when he left she of course would be notified in Havana, and (from there]
she could get in touch.
"
In any event, if comrade Rolando decides to go via Mexico, I want to
give him my telephone number so he can locate me right away. He can use
the name Rolando. My number is 23 07 92. He will find me the up to 1000
or about 1930 hours (several words unintelligible]. So if he goes clandes-
tinely and has any problem he can talk to me, carefully, of course, as the

On the point, which I think has been posed here rather insistently, of
whether the bourgeoisie participates, the famous thesis of the four classes,
in other words, they were telling me--I am referring particularly to the
comrades of the political commission, with whom I had a lengthy meeting--
they have applied it somewhat mechanically, somewhat as convention dictates,
as has been done by a majority of the parties in countries such as this one,
but without actually having a clear notion on the subject, and among them
there were arguments, struggles, and disagreements with regard to the role
of the bourgeoisie.
So I think that it is perfectly possible to debate on this point. I
do not think that the policy should be to set out a public thesis, and even
less a public polemic. I do not think that it is particularly important
to the struggle that the theory of the four classes to uphold publicly. I
do not think that anyone will be disappointed to see that in this country
there is a peasantry or a proletariat so radical and so enlightened that
it will refuse to cooperate with the national bourgeoisie. So I think it
is a somewhat unproductive polemic.
I am also fully convinced that the national bourgeoisia has no revolu-
tionary role to play at this time in Latin America and much less in Guatemala.
And that it does not depend on the theories proposed or the thinking of Guerra
Borges, or the thinking of Rubio or the thinking of anyone else. I believe
that is a fact, and facts are above all else. And I think that the moment
that the struggle grows up, that the revolutionary power grows strong and
is established on a free territory, this will be seen still more clearly.
But I see no reason why this should be announced a priori; that is, I do
not see why we should make the revolution in the newspapers, if it is
11

the right thing to do. Also, the movement is at a stage where what it
needs is friends.
Well, I think I have talked a good deal and rather haphazardly, but
I wish you had arrived; I was clinging to that hope, although I knew it
was very unlikely, since you have already delayed too long. Unfortunately
it has not been that way, has it? So I wanted to leave my greeting to you
and some of the impressions I have of the situation.
I can add something to what I have already told you. The comrades of
the POT asked me after I had been here for quite a few days and they had
shown me a number of things--I even think that they wanted to be sincere
because they also showed me tapes in which they were harshly criticized,
1.4
in which their own cadres criticised them--they arranged interviews for me
with persons within the party who are in disagreement with the leadership--
in short, I was able to get a considerably more objective picture--they
asked me for my observations and criticisms, which I gave them in all loyalty.
The basic criticism I believe continues to be the lack of more active
participation in the armed struggle and of the channeling of cadres to the
armed struggle.This I think continues to be the main problem; they admit it.
In general I must tell you that most of my criticisms were well received
by them.
I oven asked for a talk with Guerra Borges because I thought that his
article in the International (i.e. World Marxist) Review contained some
expressions of opinion which were not correct, although in others it was
on the right track. We discussed it and he had a receptive attitude, and
in the and admitted that there was some error, owing to the need to make
the article too condersød.

As to this matter of Rolando's health I think it is very important

indefinitely, with him in pour health. I have talked about this to the
comrades in the POT here, although it looks as

wall, that is all for the time being. I hope your meeting will be
successful. I hope that the difficulties will be overcoma and that this
situation will be taken advantage of to reshapo all things and to give new
drive to the struggle. I think the experiences acquired can be very
weful-for instance the experience here of Comandante Adan and the boys
with the peasants and the plan to organise them and occupy lands. I
think it can be developed into ever more perfect forms. Of courɛn that
directive of occupying lands, given here in practice, is a provocation which
can result in the peasants' being massacred, but when it is done in a
planned manner, in a way that the guerrilla can offer them protection and
in which they can be taught to protect themselves, as in the caso that has
happened here--I think it can be a first-rate revolutionary factor.
I think you ought to give special attention to these things-and
above all else is the problem of unity. If on the one hand you do not feel

:
you are in possession of the truth but on the other hand you do not feel you
are victims of the possessors of the truth--I say this for comrade Rolando-
I think you can accomplish a great change in the outlook and give a great
push to the struggle. You have to know, be aware of, have a clear idea that
the situation in the POT is at this time rather good. A number of factors
have contributed to this, including, for example, people who are attacked
in Revolucion Socialista, such as the PUR. The PUR has had a very clear and
well-defined attitude, very positive, consisting in declaring to the PCT that
they were for unity at all times, but on the basis of its being real unity;
that is, on the basis that they would, in every way possible, continue
collaborating with the guerrillas at every moment. I think that in the base
organizations of the PCT this attitude has been brought forth.
So, there is nowhere that I can see any real reason for a break nor the
desire for a break on the part of anybody. The problems that have come up
can be discussed as between equals, clearly, and they can be a positive
factor, become a positive factor of impetus for the struggle, eliminating
everything that is a burden or an error or a provocation.
I am sending a cordial greeting to both, those I know well as a result
of oral expressions and recorded tapes--this employment of tape recorders
is extremely useful-and whom I would have liked very much to hug personally.

Many people still think that the guerrillas are only supposed to kill

arrived [Dondomitaf] took this note to us, which I would like to read. It
is dated 21 September 1964. It is a note which (Juan Chaoon] sends to comrade
Adan, and it reads as followss
Compañero Comandantes I reiterate to you and the comrades our
fraternal greeting and our wishes that you will (word] in a revo-
lutionary manner for the good of the country. This is to ask you
to issus instructions for a meeting of the titular leadership of the
[FAR]. For that I shall go the place to which you may call me. I
make this request because here the substitute command that had been
operating since the event at [Simpa] ceasel to operate at all for the
last thirty days or longer. Also because since you, cœurades of the
Trece de Noviembre organization, publicly expressed your[word] toward
us Communists, there have arisen problems which must be solved if unity
is to continus. At a meeting of the titular command, with you in
attendance, it shall be seen whether the problems arison can be
overcome or whether they are going to leave us disjointed [desarii-
culados), as we are now, with reference to the matters of major
importance in our movement. Incidentally, the tasks assigned to
the comradea as special responsibilities, are being carried out, so
that the [FAR] [has been] operating in practice. However, it is not
enough for each to carry his immediate tactical responsibilities,
Hatters (in prespact, or of perspective] have to be attended to, and
these in the last few months, as I have said, have not been attended to
with the proper authority and have been completely abandoned during

POR VICTOR RICO GALAN
POR
1
En un editorial reciente, Siempre
censuró con energía la conducta
de nuestras autoridades policíacas
en el aeropuerto, por los malos tra-
tos y las vejaciones a que son so-
metidos los viajeros procedentes
de ciertos países, sobre todo de
Cuba y de España. Aceptaba
nuestra revista como cosa norinal
la vigilancia sobre visitantes po-
tencialmente peligrosos, pero acu-
saba a las innúmeras policías que el mexicano padece
de realizar mal esa función o no realizarla en absoluto, a
cambio de actuar con una insolencia y una prepotenciá
intolerables
.
Como por encargo, los acontecimientos posteriores han
venido a darle a nuestro editorial más razón incluso de la
que pretendía tener. El pasado día 7, un norteamericano que
responde al nombre de Henry Agüeros Garcés, lanzó una
_ granada de mano contra los talleres del periódico El Día.
con intenciones verdaderamente siniestras: la granada fue
lanzada en un lugar tal, que sólo la rápida intervención de
los trabajadores del diario pudo evitar una catástrofe de
incalculables proporciones, de la que no estaría excluida
la pérdida de muchas vidas humanas, tanto en el edifica
del periódico, como en la zona aledaña.
sólo
No se trataba, por otra parte, de un hecho único ni ais-
lado. En fecha anterior, aunque reciente, el Instituto Mexi-
camo-Ruso de Relaciones Culturales sufrió una agresión
análoga, y el arma utilizada resultó ser idéntica -según la
policía- a la que explotó en el patio de El Día. Casi simul-
táneamente fue ametrallado el departamento que habitaba
el corresponsal de la agencia yugceslava Tanjug.
la circunstancia de encontrarse en un quinto piso salvó
la vida de su esposa, que bañaba a su hijita recién nacida.
pues varios proyectiles de grueso calibre entraron por las
ventanas y se alojaron en el techo de la habitación. En am-
bos comos, la lenidad y la indiferencia de la policía fueron
evidentes. Ni aparecieron los mulpables ni se hicieron inves-
tigaciones serias.
Además, somos muchos los mexicanos que, por ocupar-
nos de cuestiones politicus nacionales e internacionales con
un criterio opuesto al del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos,
recibimos un alud de amenazas y anónimos injuriosoa, kin-
to por escrito como telefónicamente. La redacción de los
anónimos y ol lenguaje uhliando indien con clandad que
son extranjeros quienes les hacen, y probriblemente cuba.
nos contrarre volucionanos. Por nain.
te co.
san, del dominio puuuuu, es indiscutible que decir contra-
nevolucionarios cubanoa equivale a decir Agencia Central
de Inteligencia (CIA) de los Estados Unidos.
÷
La cla de violencia, espionaje y amenazas ha llegado
a un punto tal, que motivó una carta del director de la re-
vista Politica a las autoridades responsables, exigiendo que
se aplique la ley a los autores de tales hechos delictuosos
y denunciando los catastróficos electos que para el país
puede tener el tolerarlos. Sin embargo nada se había hecho
hasta que se produjo el atentado contra El Día y fue caplu-
rado su autor.
Capturado, no como resultado de investigaciones po-
licíacas, sino gracias a la diligencia de un joven obrero de
los talleres de El Día, que lo persiguió y le dio alcance. Por-
que Henry Agüeros Garcés entró en México como Pedro por
su casa, no fue molestado por policía alguno, no fue foto-
grafiado en frontera ni aeropuerto, y pudo incluso utilizar
un nombre falso para obtener alojamiento en un hotel. ¿Y
cómo no? Las vejaciones a ciudadanos extranjeros que nos
visitan tienen un reverso: el trato obsequioso y hasta ab-
´yecto que se da a los ciudadanos norteamericanos. Esos
mismos polizontes que fan groseros y bestiales se muestran
con quienes vienen de Cuba o de España son la imagen
misma de la amabilidad y la obsecuencia cuando el que
llega tiene una tarjeta de turista que lo acredita como norte-
americano.
-
--
Ser norteamericano es, en México, una patento de cor-:
so. Y eso, a pesar de que por la frontera norte o en los vue-
los internacionales que del norte proceden llega a México
la peor gentuza Hágase una estadística de los delitos co-
metidos en nuestro país por extranjeros, y se verú que los
yanquis so llevan la palma, con cifras imposibles de igua-
lar, y con crímenes cuya degradación moral es también
inigualable. Todo lo cual prueba hasta qué punto era justa
la censura a la policía que hacía SIEMPRE! en su editorial
ya citado es una policía que injuria, humilla y veja, pero
que no investiga los delitos reales y mucho menos es capaz
de prevenirlos.
-
Queda por aclarar hasta dónde esas innumerables po-
licías mexicanas ilegales y por eso imposibles de contro-
lar legalmente están penetradas por la CIA, la FBI, Y.
otras agencias extranjeras dedicadas al terrorismo, al es-
pionaje y a sembrar la zozobra en todas partes. Queda por
aclarar hasta dónde de ese norte revuelto y brutal que
nos desprecii, como decía Martí, es el que verdaderamente
dirige a pollontes cuyos sueldos legales difícilmento justifi-
om el demnacho y el lujo en el que vivon. Quedan por ada.

Transmitted herewith please find copies of three tapes confiscated
by the COG military from the guerrillas in operations subsequent to the
guerrilla attack on the small garrison at Panzos (CUAT-4309, paragraph 4).
The tapes were received by the Station from ODIBEX in mid-November.
Station mode copies to pass to the Guatemalan Army and to ODIEEX and kept one
copy for study. The originals were returned to the Guatemalan Army after
a master copy was made.

THE TAPES
4
The original tapeu vere small and were eight in number and vera
recorded by the guerrillas at the speed of 1 and 7/8ths. According to
information taken from the tapes, the recording was done on a Philips recorder.
Judging from the sound's it is felt that the tapes were made indoors by inex-
periaxed perennel. This belief is supported by one of the documents captured
which went into detail on the prolams the guerrilles vere having with the
recorder and on how to correct them. The master copy made by the Station
(transmitted herewith) was recorded at the same speel on three tapes which
total about 16 hours of poor listening.

INFORMATION FROM TAPES
speech made
A. Tepo 1 sido 1. A apeoch made by Victor Piso Galan (Mexican
novapaperean who is very leftist) to guerrillas under the command of Marco
Antonio Yea Sosa. Generally, he informe the guerrillas that the revolution
in Guatemale is the revolution of Latin America, He reports that persons
in Latin America and Europe are keenly interested in the Guatemalan revolu-
tion and send letters to Gelam affirming their supĵort of it. He then goes
into the problems of the apparent split between the 13 November sent and
the FOT leadership. He states that the PCT has not given the guerrilles the
proper support sud has taken too soft a line in the revolutionary struggle. He
talked to the fur leadership and asked that personal feelings be set aside and
suggested complete cooperation with the guerrillas to overthrow the present
government. At the end of the tape the guerrilla theme song is sung by a group
of querrilles.
Tape 1 side 2. This side discusses (voice unidentified) the inter-
view Yon Soña had with newspapermen in the Sierra de las Minas. The speaker
explains how the interview was disseminated throughout Guatemala by Supplement
1 of the Revolurion Socialista. The interview will soon be translated into
German, French and other languages and will be sent to Mexico, Latin America
and countries in Europe. The speaker then goes on to explain how the guerrilla
publication, Revolucion Socialista, has created great enthusiasm (does not say
where) and how it will make people aware of the role the guerrillas play in
Guatemala. Its main object is to attack “imperialism and the Quatemalan Govern-
mant.
C. Tape 2 side 1. This side deals with generalities on the revolu-
tion going on in Guatemala. It discusses the need for a new government to
represent the people. It states that the guerrilla movement is the vanguard
of the messca of vorkers and composinos. At the end of the tape it salutes
the workers of the world.
D. Tape 2 side 2. An unidentified voice discusses, in very general
terms, the problems of the guerrillas in shipping various articles (weapons,
literature and tapes) to different parts of the country. The major obstacles
to smooth movements of the articles throughout the country aro police and mill-
tary check points on the major roads and the fact that large truck shipments
cannot be mounted, foreing the guerrillas to hand carry most of the material.
Rɩrough negligence, many guerrillas have been captural with compromising Esterial
in their possession. Pseudonyms are repeatedly mentioned on this side - Rolando,
Rudy, dan, and Mateo which cannot be identified by the Station.
->
E. Tape 3 side 1. This side is taken up by en unidentified person
reading passages out of Revolucion Socialista and Marxist literature.
F. Tape 3 aids 2. On this side there are discussions of the problem
faced by the gerrillas The first problem is the trouble the Mando General
ung having vith the Gatemalan Communist Party (the Farty tended to isolate
itsalf from the parrillas). Other problems included communications between
guerrilla unite throughout the country; problems with who recording machine;
and the problem of putting out propaganda which can be understood by the
campesinos. 111 these problems vere discussed in very general terms omitting
aaste, places and dates.
b
COWLINIS DROWN FROM TAPES
The infers the found on the tapes is of no operational value to the
Strtion since it deals with propaganda and guerrille problems already known by
the Station What is of interest is the apparent effort by the guarrilla
leadership to use tapes as a means of operational communications and to reses
the illiterata campesinos and workers with spoken instead of vritte) propagazła.
The operational use of tejes vould obviate the need for pristal internal

pore to then than would printed propagands. The Station has not based these
conclusions solely on the three tapea transmitted with this report. Two
days ago, PEDEM-1 informed DOSCHER that the police recently confiscated 24
tapes from the guerrillas (mide on 6 and 9 December, HOGA-7612) and that
these topes consist of operational problems faced by the guerrilla leadership
and propaganda. The Station will attempt to make copies of the tapes mentioned
by RADTH-1 if they can be obtained. If the tapes commot be scquired the
Station vill receive copies of the scripts taken from the tapes (police are.
doing this now).
5. Since the tapes are not of operational value the Station real
is not necessary to retain a copy for the files and is passing
the mastar copy from which reproductions were made for ODIEKR

On 23 October 1963 David Turner, leader of the Vanguard of National
Action (VAN radical pro-Cuban revolutionary group), informed members
of the VAN directorate that he had received a call from Thelma King,
pro-Cuban deputy to the National Assombly, a few days earlier. Turner
said that the purpose of the call was to arrange for Turner to meet.
Victor Rico Galan, a Mexican newspaperman who works for Fidel Castro.
Türnor said that the interview took place in Rico's room at the Hotel
International, and was attended by King, Turner, and Hugo Alejandro
Victor, president of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP, People's Party-
Communist), with which the VAN is disputing leadership of the revolution
in Panama. Turnor said that Rico questioned his guests about unity
among the leftwing groups in Panama, and Victor cddly informed him
only that offats were being made to reach an understanding. Turner
refrained from mking any comment at that time. Rico invited his
visitors to have lunch with him; however, Victor declined, and King
wont in search of copies of newspapers which had reproduced statements
of Panamanian students warning against plans of the National Guard to
stage a coup d'etat in Panama. Rico had specifically asked for these
publications. This gave Turner an opportunity to talk alone with
Rico, and he informed him of VAN activities and of the steps being
takon by the VAN to bring about an armed movement in Panama, since
conditions were ripe for such action.

Around 26 October 1963 Ruben Dario Souza Batista, national secretary-
general of the PDP, said that a Cuban agent had recently visited
Panama to urge the VAN and the PDP to resolve their differences and
unite. The PDP, however, violently rejected the suggestion.

said that PDP leaders planned to ascertain the correct name of the
agent and submit a written protest concerning his activities to
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.
1
Around 5 November 1963 Ruperto Luther Thomas, national secretary
of propaganda of the PDP, informed regional-level PDP leaders that
Armando Conte, a writer for Tiempos in Mexico, recently came to
Panama and spoke with. Victor. 2 He said that he was an emissary of
the Cubans, and had come to Panama to convince Victor of the need
to support the Cuban line of armed revolution. Victor told Conte
that the PDP would not be told what to do, because it had its own
line on the Panamanian Revolution.
Field Comments
1.
2.
Rico arrived in Panama from San Jose, Costa Rica, on 20 October 1963,
at which time he provided the following personal date on his
landing card:
Born on 6 February 1928 at El Ferrol presumably in Mexico 7
Citizen of Mexico, bearer of passport No. 16897
Occupation
-
newspaperman
Permanent Address - Providencia 930, Mexico, D. F.
Rico left Panama for Venezuela on 22 October 1963.
Travel records contain no information on the arrival of any
person with the name Armando Conte during the period in question,
and the name is believed to be a pseudonym used by Rico. It
is interesting to note that two VAN sources identified the
visiting Mexican journalist by the name of Rioo or Risco;
however, no PDP source has reported that name, and Souza's
comments as reported in paragraph 2 tend to indicate that the
visitor concealed his identity from the PDP.
Headquarters Comment. TDCS-3/563,671, of 31 October 1963, described
Rico Galan's visit to Mexico in the same general terms.
