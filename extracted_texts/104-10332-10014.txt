Agee Memo - New draft
Here it is... with Jeremy's improvements. Please read it carefully as I had to rush through this. Some of Jeremy's comments were slight
wording changes so as not to offend "the Board" so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOIA
section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now
because I did add a bit about Scelso being an "official". And don't forget to attach to Stokes-DCI letter which I will fax back to you.
Have fun - and let me know if you need help.

and the job of processing this material is just impossible.
Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go through this step by step,
although I was not going to do this at this time. I am going
to modify the line of inquiry somewhat.
Do you know how many telephone intercepts there were
in the Mexico City station?
Mr. Scelo. How many lines were being tapped?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, at the Cuban and then at the Soviet.
Mr. Scelo. I think there are about 30 lines being tapped

Meeting with ARRB Staff
1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,
Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had
been identified as potential appeal items, and on the
Agency's concerns re the Australian documents? I requested
that the Board reconsider the release of the statements on
Mexico City political action programs, Scelso's comment on
Agee, the reference to the Mexican Police as a source and
Warrenton as site of the Agency's Record Center,
2. Marwell agreed to send a “staff recommendation” to
the Board recommending that they delay the release of these
four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The
rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next.
Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing
to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that
the Board would agree to delay the release.
3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to
the ARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief
the Board members at the 27 September meeting. As I
understand it, DO/Mexico (Mike L.) will be preparing
evidence memos on “political action programs” and “Mexican
police" issues and OGC (Linda C.) will take the lead on
Agee. I will contact the DA/IRO (Don Hatch) on the Warrenton
issue.
4. Concerning the Australian documents, Marwell agreed
to delay Board action until the 16 October meeting. The
Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the
ARRB staff as soon as possible.

Mr. Scelo. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith.
I have a few questions to ask you on
that. This refers to the envoy operation that was the
joint operation conducted by the Mexicans and the Americans
and I believe this indicates that there were 30 lines, in;
fact, connected at one time, so that your early testimony
was, in all likelihood, accurate.
I am going to have to ask you also to read the section
marked number 3, Oswald coverage.

that they were engaged in political activities. The Chinese had
fact, been using the NCNA office for propaganda and support
pro-Chinese revolutionary organizations in Mexico and Central
America.
Central American Exiles
.
Mexico has traditionally been a haven for political exiles from
Central American countries including communists and other
extreme leftists. Several Central American parties, including the
Guatemalans, maintain liaison sections in Mexico City in order
to keep lines open to the Soviets, Cubans and others. They
operate semi-clandestinely for the most part in order to avoid
repression from the Mexican government.
Washington DC
20 December 1966
Because of the strategic importance of Mexico to the US, its size
and proximity, and the abundance of enemy activities, the
Mexico City station is the largest in the hemisphere. Altogether
the station has some fifteen operations officers under State
Department cover in the Embassy political section, plus about
twelve more officers under assorted non-official covers outside the
: Embassy. In addition, a sizeable support staff of communications
officers, technical services, intelligence assistants, records clerks
and secretaries bring the overall station personnel total to around
fifty.
Liaison Operations
Dominating the station operational programme is the LITEMPO
project which is administered by Winston Scott, & the Chief of
Station in Mexico City since 1956, with the assistance of Annie
Goodpasture,‡ a case officer who has also been at the station for
some years. This project embraces a complicated series of opera-
tional support programmes to the various Mexican civilian
security forces for the purpose of intelligence exchange, joint
524
operations and constant upgrading of Mexican internal intelli-
gence collection and public security functions.
: At the top of the LITEMPO operation is the Mexican President,
Gustavo Diaz Ordaz,‡ who has worked extremely closely with the
station since he became Minister of Government in the previous
administration of Adolfo Lopez Mateost (1958-64). Scott had
also developed a very close working relationship with Lopez
Mateos, and, since Diaz Ordaz became President two years ago,
Scott has been working closely with the current Minister of
Government, Luis Echeverria. Thus the LITEMPO project
focuses at the top on the President and the current Minister of
Government who will be the second consecutive choice of PRI
kaders to pass from internal security to the presidency.
Scott's chummy relationship with Diaz Ordaz none the less has
its problems. In 1964 Fulton Freeman went to Mexico City as
Ambassador to crown a Foreign Service career that had started
in the same Embassy in the 1930s. He is expected to retire after
the 1968 Olympic Games. At the time of his assignment to Mexico
City Freeman's expectations of meaningful diplomatic relations
with Diaz Ordaz collided with the President's preference for deal-
ing with Scott, and Freeman was relegated to protocol contacts
with the President while his diplomatic talents focused on the
Foreign Minister. The problem of who would deal with the Presi-
dent was confused somewhat by the Ambassador's insistence, not
long after arrival, on a detailed briefing about the station opera-
tional programme, which Scott refused. Eventually both Scott
and the Ambassador visited the White House, where President
Johnson settled matters according to the wishes of the Agency
and of his friend Diaz Ordaz. Scott continued, of course, to work
with the President and the Ambassador never got the full briefing
he had demanded. Since then the relations between Scott and the
Ambassador have warmed, but the Ambassador forbids any
station operations directed against the Mexican Foreign Ministry.
While Scott frequently meets the President and the Minister of
Government, two non-official cover case officers handle the day-
to-day contact with the chiefs of the security services subordinate
to Echeverria. One of these officers is a former FBI agent who
worked in the legal attaché's office in the Mexico City Embassy
- the legal attaché is usually the FBI office in an American

What do you mean, things like this
Mr. Scelso. Planes were held for travellers who would
otherwise miss them, for Cuban officials, and so on.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Did the Agency ever actually investigate,
this particular matter?
Mr. Scelso. It investigated to the extent that there
was nothing left to investigate. The plane was gone. The
man was on it. He had not identified himself before he left.
.
We had very complete coverage of the Mexico City Airport:
and watched the Cuban flights closely, but where it sometimes
happened that an important Cuban official would come late,
he would go directly to the plane without going through
travel controls.
At that time, the man was gone. There was no picture
of him. Nobody looked at his passport.
Period.
Mr. Goldsmith. You did not bother to ask any Cuban
employees in the Airport about the man?
Mr. Scelso. We did not have any source of Cuban

embassy. The FBI officer had left the FBI to come with the station
but pains have been taken to conceal his CIA employment in
order to avoid the bad blood that would result from the ci
'stealing' of an FBI officer. The two non-official cover officers and
the equivalent of an AID Public Safety mission but in Mexico this
function is performed secretly by the station in deference to Mexi
can nationalist sensitivities - as is the case in Argentina. Through
the LITEMPO project we are currently providing advice and equip
ment for a new secret communications network to function be..
tween Diaz Ordaz's office and principal cities in the rest of the
country. Other joint operations with the Mexican security ser
vices include travel control, telephone tapping and repressive
action.
The station also prepares a daily intelligence summary for Diaz
Ordaz with a section on activities of Mexican revolutionary orga-
nizations and communist diplomatic missions and a section on
international developments based on information from head-
quarters. Other reports, often relating to a single subject, are
passed to Diaz Ordaz, Echeverria and top security officials. These
reports, like the daily round-up, include information from station
unilateral penetration agents with due camouflaging to protect the
identity of the sources. The station is much better than are the
Mexican services, and is thus of great assistance to the authorities
in planning for raids, arrests and other repressive action.
Liaison between Scott and the Mexican military intelligence
services consists mainly of exchange of information, in order to
keep a foot in the door for future eventualities. The US military
attachés, moreover, are in constant contact with their Mexican
military intelligence counterparts and their reports are received
regularly by the station.
Stan Watson, the Mexico City Deputy Chief of Station, has
been meeting with a South Korean CIA officer who was recently
sent under diplomatic cover to monitor North Korean soundings
for establishment of missions in Mexico and Central America
Communist Party Operations
The station CP section consists of two case officers, Wade
Thomas and Ben Ramirez, both under Embassy cover, plus
526
-
à
two case officers outside the station under non-official cover: Bob
Driscoll, a retired operations officer now working under con-
tract, and Julian Zambianco who was transferred from Guayaquil
to Mexico City about a year ago. These officers are in charge of
agent and technical penetrations against the revolutionary organi-
zations of importance. The quality of this intelligence is high,
although not as high as it was before 1963. In late 1962 Carlos
Manuel Pellecer, the station's most important communist party
penetration-agent, broke openly with communism by publishing
a book. He was a leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party
(PGT) and had been Minister of Labor in the Arbenz government
during the 1950s. However, after the Agency-sponsored over-
throw of the Arbenz government Pellecer made his way to Mexico
City where for years he was the station's best source (cryptonym
LINLUCK) on all the revolutionary organizations in Mexico, not
just the Guatemalan exiles. His book, of course, was financed by
the station and distributed by the Agency all over Latin America.
Pellecer is still being used by the Mexico City station as a propa-
ganda agent, as with other former penetration agents who form-
ally break with communism without revealing their years of work
as spies - Eudocio Ravines, ‡ the well-known Peruvian defector
from communism is a parallel case. Another book by Pellecer,
also financed by the station, has just appeared. This book is a
continuation of CIA exploitation of the Marcos Rodriguez and
Joaquin Ordoqui cases in Cuba, and is aimed at denigration of the
Cuban revolution.
The station also collects information about communists from
the US living in Mexico. Many of them arrived during the Mc-
Carthy period and some have subsequently become Mexican
citizens. Information about them is mainly of interest to the FBI,
which calls them the American Communist Group in Mexico
City (ACGMC). Information collected about them includes that
obtained through the LIENVOY telephone-tapping operation des-
cribed below.
The station also receives copies of reports from FBI penetration
operations against Mexican revolutionary organizations. Mexico
is the only country in Latin America, except Puerto Rico, where
the FBI continued operations against the local left when the CIA
took over in 1947. The FBI intelligence is of high quality.

nym: LISAMPAN) is still in the 'interference-complaint-test
stage.
Another important operation directed against the Cubans
sophisticated provocation that won the CIA Intelligence Med
for Stan Archenhold, the case officer who conceived it
operation consisted of a series of letters sent to the Cuban intells
gence service in their Mexico City Embassy from a person
purported to be a CIA officer trying to help them. The letter
purport to implicate Joaquin Ordoqui, a respected, old-guar
leader of the Cuban Communist Party and a high-ranking mit
tary leader, as a CIA agent. The letters are based on information
from Carlos Manuel Pellecer, the Guatemalan exile and penetra
tion agent, who was closely associated with Ordoqui and Marcon
Rodriguez when all three lived in Mexico City during the late
1950s. The letters continue to be sent to Cuban intelligence al
though Ordoqui was arrested in 1964, and the desired contro
versy and dissension in the Cuban revolutionary leadership
followed.
As the cover of Sherry, the chief of the Cuban operations sec
tion, is in the Embassy consular section, he has been able to med
several of the Cuban consular officers directly. However, his main
agent for direct assessment of the Cubans is Leander Vourvoulias
Consul of Greece and President of the Consular Corps.
Support Operations
The support operations must also be detailed. The joint opera-
tion for telephone tapping, LIENVOY, is effected in cooperation
with the Mexican authorities and has a capacity for about forty
lines. The station provides the equipment, the technical assistance,
couriers and transcribers, while the Mexicans make the connec
tions in the exchanges and maintain the listening posts. In adď
tion to monitoring the lines of the communist diplomatic missions
and those of Mexican revolutionary groups, LIENVOY also covers
special cases. For years the telephones of ex-President Cárdenas
and his daughter have been tapped, and recently tapping ba
started on that of Luis Quintanilla, a Mexican intellectual whoi
planning a trip to Hanoi with the publisher of the Miami New
and with a fellow of the Center for the Study of Democratic
532
Nestitutions in Santa Barbara. Reports on plans for this trip are
Ent immediately to the White House.
The station also has its own unilateral telephone-tapping
operation which is limited to special cases where the involvement
of the Mexicans is thought to be undesirable. Connections for this
operation are made outside the exchanges by telephone company
engineers who work as station agents, as in the case of the bugging
of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN). However this is restricted as
far as possible in order to avoid damaging relations with the
Mexicans in the event of discovery.
Travel control, general investigations and occasional surveil-
lance are the duties of a six-man team called LIFIRE. They obtain
flight-travel lists from the airport, which are passed daily to the
station and take photographs of passengers to and from com-
munist countries and of their passports as they pass through
immigration.
Another eight-man surveillance team, known as LIEMBRACE,
has vehicles (including a Volkswagen photo-van) and radio-
communications equipment and is mainly concerned with Soviet/
satellite and Cuban targets. It is administered by Jim Anderson,+
who also controls another eight-man team (LIRICE), similarly
equipped, which deals with the Mexican revolutionaries and other
miscellaneous targets.
Postal interception is mainly directed towards the mail from
communist countries, but can occasionally be used to get corres-
pondence from selected Mexican addresses.
As in every station, a variety of agents assists in support tasks
which they perform in the course of their ordinary jobs. For
processing the immigration papers for station non-official cover
personnel, for example, Judd Austin, ‡ one of the US lawyers in
Goodrich, Dalton, Little and Riquelme (the principal law firm
serving American subsidiaries) is used. The Executive Vice-
President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico
City, Al Wichtrich,+ channels political information to the station
that he picks up in his normal work with American and Mexican
businessmen. For technical support the station has an officer of
TSD under Embassy cover with a workshop and qualification:
in audio, flaps and seals, and photography.

When Yatskov is transferred back to Moscow - he has alreant,
been in Mexico for some years - we shall decide whether to try to
defect him through LIOVAL-1. Recently Peter Deriabin,t.
well-known KGB defector from the 1950s who is now a US citizen
and full-time CIA employee, went to Mexico City to study
voluminous reports on Yatskov written by LIOVAL-1. He con
cluded that there is a strong possibility that LIOVAL-1 has beeth
recruited by Yatskov and is reporting on Paul Dillon, the station
officer in charge of this case. Nevertheless, the operation con
tinues while the counter-intelligence aspects are studied further
ban Operations
The Cuban operations section consists of two case officers,
Francis Sherry and Joe Piccolo, and a secretary under Embassy
cover and one case officer under non-official cover. An observa-
tion post for photographic coverage and radio contact with the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team is functioning, as well as LIENVOY
telephone monitoring and LIFIRE airport travel control. Through
the LIFIRE team the station obtains regular clandestine access
the Prensa Latina pouch from Havana, and copies of corres-
10
dents throughout the hemisphere are forwarded to the stations
concerned.
The station double-agent cases against the Soviets, LICOZY-pondence between PL headquarters in Havana and its correspon-
LICOZY-3‡ and LICOZY-5,‡ are all being wound up for lack
of productivity or problems of control. One of these agents
LICOZY-3, is an American living in Philadelphia who was re
cruited by the Soviets while a student in Mexico, but who reported
the recruitment and worked for the Mexico City station. He
worked for the FBI after returning to the US - the Soviet case
officer was a UN official at one time - but recently Soviet interest
in him has fallen off and the FBI turned the case back over to the
Agency for termination.
Against the Czechs and the Poles many of the same types of
operation are targeted. Access agents, observation posts, tele-
phone tapping, surveillance and travel control are continuous
although with somewhat less intensity than against the Soviets,
In the Yugoslav Embassy the code clerk has been recruited by the
CIA as has one of the Embassy's secretaries.
Until the New China News Agency (NCNA) office was closed
last month by the Mexican government, the Soviet/satellite sec-
tion of the station was responsible for following the movements
of the Chinese communists. Telephone intercepts through
LIENVOY and occasional surveillance by the LIRICE team were
directed against them, but the most important intelligence col-
lected against them was from the bugging of their offices. The
audio operation was supported by the Far East Division in head-
quarters, who sent an operations officer and transcribers to
Mexico City. Now that the NCNA offices are closed, the audio
equipment will be removed and the station will continue to
follow up the many leads coming from the bugging operation.
Through the LITEMPO liaison operation the Mexican immi-
gration service provides special coverage of all travellers to and
from Havana on the frequent Cubana flights. Each traveller is
photographed and his passport is stamped with arrival or depar-
ture cachets indicating Havana travel. The purpose is to frustrate
the Cuban practice of issuing visas on separate slips of paper in-
stead of in the passport so as to obscure travel. Prior to each
Cubana departure the station is notified of all passengers so that
name checks can be made. In the case of US citizens, the Mexican
service obliges by preventing departure when requested by the
station.
The most important current operation targeted against the
Cuban mission is an attempted audio penetration using the tele-
phone system. Telephone company engineers working in the
LIDENY tapping operation will eventually install new wall-boxes
for the Embassy telephones in which sub-miniature transmitters
with switches will have been cast by TSD. At the moment,
however, the engineers are causing deliberate interference in
Embassy telephones by technical means in the exchange. Each
time the Embassy calls the telephone company to complain of
interference on the lines, the engineers report back that every-
thing in the exchange is in order. Eventually, as the interference
continues, the engineers will check street connections and finally
arrive to check the instruments in the Embassy. They will find the
wall-boxes "defective' and will replace them with the bugged
boxes cast by TSD. Right now, however, this operation (crypto-

Soviet/Satellite Operations
The largest section in the station is that covering Soviet/satell
operations. It has four case officers, three intelligence assistir
and a secretary, all under Embassy cover, and four case offices
under non-official cover. It is headed by Paul Dillont and
other official cover case officers are Donald Vogel, Cynthia
Hausman and Robert Steele. A number of sensitive operations
are underway.
The station has two observation posts in front of the Soviet
Embassy, which cover the entrances, plus a third observation post
in the back of the Embassy to provide coverage of the gardens
The LICALLA observation post in the back is the closest of five
houses bordering the Embassy property - all five are owned by
the station. Several years ago films were made of Soviets con-
versing in the garden, but attempts by Russian lip-readers to dis-
cover their conversations were unsuccessful. From one of the
front op's, radio contact is maintained with the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team for signalling when a particular Soviet surveil
lance target leaves the Embassy, his route and other data. Photos
are regularly taken from all the OP's of Soviets and their families
and all visitors to the Embassy. When visitors use vehicles, photo-
graphs are taken of their licence plates for tracing. Occasionally
the LICALLA OP is used for electronic monitoring, since it is
close to the Embassy, but so far attempts to pick up radiations
from Soviet cryptographic equipment have been unsuccess-
ful.
In addition to the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, several other
support operations include coverage of the Soviets. Through the
CIENVOY operation, Soviet telephones are constantly monitored,
and through the LIFIRE travel-control operation photographs of
travel documents are obtained along with data on arrivals and
departures. Monitoring of Mexican diplomatic communications
reveals requests for Mexican visas by Soviet officials, including
the diplomatic couriers. In addition, NSA is also monitoring
several communications systems involving 'burst' transmissions
from the USSR to as yet unidentified agents believed to be in
Mexico - possibly Soviet intelligence officers assigned abroad as
'illegals', with false identity and non-official cover.
528
The station runs between fifteen and twenty access agents
mainst the Soviets with varying degrees of effectiveness and
ecruited by the Soviets for use as double agents against the
liability. Several of these agents are suspected of having been
Ration. Two of the most important of the current access-agents
are Katherine Manjarrez, + Secretary of the Foreign Press Associa-
tion, and her husband - both of whom are targeted against the
Soviet press attaché and the Tass correspondent. Others are
¿cowl-1‡ and LiOVAL-1.‡

-
LICOWL-1 is the owner of a tiny grocery store situated in front
of the Soviet Embassy where the Soviets buy odds and ends in-
duding their soft drinks - TSD is studying ways of bugging a
wooden soft-drink case or the bottles themselves. More import-
ant, LICOWL-1 is involved at the moment in an operation against
the Embassy zavhoz (administrative officer), who spends consider-
able time chatting with the agent. Because Silnikov, the zavhoz,
has been on the prowl for a lover or so he said to LICOWL-1 –
the station decided to recruit a young Mexican girl as bait: An
appropriate girl was obtained through BESABER, an agent who
is normally targeted against Polish intelligence officers and who
runs a ceramics business specializing in souvenirs. By loitering at
LICOWL-l's store the girl attracted Silnikov's attention, and a
bot necking session in a back room at the store led to several
serious afternoon sessions at the girl's apartment nearby -
obtained especially for this operation. Silnikov's virility is as-
tonishing both the girl and the station, which is recording and
photographing the sessions without the knowledge of the girl.
Although promiscuity among Soviets is not abnormal, relation-
ships with local girls are forbidden. Eventually it will be decided
whether to try blackmail against Silnikov or to provoke disrup-
tion by sending tapes and photos to the Embassy if the blackmail
is refused.
LIOVAL-1 is not as interesting a case but is more important.
The agent is an American who teaches English in Mexico City
and is an ardent fisherman. Through fishing he became acquain-
led with Pavel Yatskov, the Soviet Consul and a known senior
KGB officer - possibly the Mexico City rezident (KGB chief). Yats-
kov and the agent spend one or two week-ends per month off in
the mountains fishing and have developed a very close friendship.

Attached is an MFR summarizing my meeting with Mr. Whitten. On a more personal note, Mr. Whitten is an extremely
charming and interesting gentleman. The meeting with him went much better than I had hoped, but it was also rather emotionally
distressing for both Jeremy and I. Mr. Whitten broke down several times during the meeting and was obviously feeling very scared.
Although Jeremy is sure that the Board will do the right thing here, we both agreed that Mr. Whitten is without doubt someone who
should be protected even if it means going to the President.

Format of Transcripts
i
The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff
produced was much the same as those of the Spanish.
language transcripts described above.294/ Mr.
Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English. 295/
Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation
"(previously transcribed)" after the meter number
referring to the reel footage location of a
conversation.297/
Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this
notation meant that the conversation had already been
transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:
"Previously transcribed" means, for instance,
I went to the embassy first and the embassy
number was 605055. Now this number 501264
belonged to the film's office. So consequently
if that particular call went out of the main
building to the films office and it had been
transcribed before, that is exactly what I
would do, put down "previously transcribed".
So there was no question of doing it twice.298/

Q: Had the information concerning Oswald's visit
4
to the Cuban Embassy in addition to the Soviet
one, that Oswald had been requesting a visa,
if it had been sent to CIA headquarters, would
his case prior to the assassination have been
handled in any different manner?
A: It would have been in the case of dissemina-
tion of information about him, but I do not
think that any operational action would have
taken to apprehend him or to contact him or
to try to force him back to the United States.
Q: ...how would the dissemination have been
treated differently?
A: Well, it simply means that we would have dis-
seminated any additional information that we
got. 657/
It cannot be determined with exactitude whether or
not this additional information about Oswald was reported
to Headquarters.
In all likelihood it was not. The Chief
of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station
was ever criticized for this failure to report in the
face of a specific request to do so by CIA Headquarters.
He said:
No. That was not because we were trying to go
easy on them, it is simply because it is in the
nature of the business. What you are trying to
do is engage, as I used to say, in important il-
legal manipulations of society, secretly.
We were running, at that time, a vast poli-
tical action program in Mexico City to try to
swing Mexico around from its Leftist direction
to a middle of the road direction and it succeeded.

I do not know whether you informed yourself about
the magnitude of our political action program at
the time--absolutely enormous.
We were trying to follow the Soviets and
all the satellites and the Cubans. At the same
time, the main thrust of the Station's effort
was to attempt to recruit Russians; Cubans and
satellite people. 658/
Perhaps the nature of the CIA Mexico City Station's
handling of the Oswald case prior to the assassination
can best be summed up in Dave Phillips' response when
he was asked how he would characterize that handling:
"At the very best, it is not professional, at the best." 659/
V. Mexico City Station Reporting of Information Concerning
Oswald After the Assassination
A. Reporting of information concerning the photograph
of the Mexico Mystery Man
Even though some people in the Station clearly dis-
associated the photograph that was described in MEXI 6453
from Oswald after receiving the 10/11 cable, -656/ it is
clear that some people still considered it possible for
some reason that the photograph was of Oswald. In Octo-
ber, Ann Goodpasture had argued this very point with Win-
ston Scott. 657/ On the day of the assassination, the
Mexico City Station cabled Headquarters that it was sending

17 May 1996
Interview with John Whitten (S)
:
1. On 22 April 1996, from approximately 1000 to 1600,
Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of the JFK Review Board, and I spoke
with Mr. John Whitten at the U.S. embassy in Vienna). Gunn
conducted the interview by showing Whitten various documents and
I his prior testimony before the HSCA. Mr. Whitten was eager to
help the Board in any way he could and even offered to come to
the US if need be. Gunn concluded that it would probably not be
useful to take Whitten's deposition at a later date. Although
Whitten had in general a good memory, Gunn felt he did not add
anything of significance to his prior testimony before the HSCA.
After the interview, Mr. Whitten took us to his apartment and
then later to a restaurant with his wife. We left Mr. Whitten
about 1900. (S)
2. Mr. Whitten was extremely worried and upset about the
release of his name and on several occasions in the interview was
on the verge of tears. Although I was expecting him to be angry
with CIA and the Board, instead, he clearly felt hurt and
betrayed. His obvious physical problems add to this feeling of
being vulnerable. Physically he is not well; he is paralyzed on
This left side and has great difficulty walking. On a map, he
pointed out his apartment and indicated what he believed to be
serious threats to his safety should his affiliation with CIA
become known. Within a block of his apartment, he pointed out
the headquarters of the PKK, the Anarchist party and a bar where
many Middle Easterners would congregate. He then pointed out
these places to us when we went to his apartment. He made it
clear that there was no way he could defend himself from any
attack. (S)
3. Mr. Whitten also stated that he has been retired for
almost as long as he worked for the CIA, and that he has a
completely different life now in Vienna] He and his wife have
lived in Vienna approximately 25 years. He is a member of
various musical and art societies. He sings in a prominent
Vienna Men's Choir. He has published various articles on music
(his specialty is Johann Strauss). He has received many medals
for his work in the arts in Vienna which we saw when we went to
his apartment. (S)

he committed perjury when applying for Austrian residency by

could subject him to criminal penalties in Austria. He stated on
several occasions, should his affiliation become known, he would
have to leave Austria. On other occasions, he stated that he
would turn himself in to the Viennese authorities and offer his
services as a consultant to the police or intelligence service.
He obviously was extremely distraught and was voicing what he
believed were his options should his name be released by the
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no
matter what happens he would never betray the CIA by telling
anyone about his work as an intelligence officer. (S)
5. By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions,
I had assured him that CIA was doing everything to protect him
and Gunn had stated he would argue for his protection to the
Board. He clearly looked upon Gunn and I as his allies in this
process and even stated that he had a "wonderful" day talking to
us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident all would
⠀ turn out well. (S)
6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn
about how this issue would be handled by the Board. Gunn
believed that it was more than likely that the Board would agree
to protect him and that he would make the strongest argument he
could to them. The Board will make its decision in it's next
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for
anyone from CIA to come down to that meeting. We agreed that
should the Board make the reprehensible decision of releasing
Whitten's name, that we could not imagine a stronger case on
which to bring an appeal to the President. (S)

I OBJECT VIOLENTLY TO THE REVELATION OF MY NAME REGARDLESS OF
THE LAW. HERE ARE SOME REASONS:
1. I EMIGRATED TO AUSTRIA TWICE, FIRST IN 1971 AND AGAIN IN 1983
BOTH TIMES I HAD TO FILL OUT AND SWEAR TO LENGTHY FORMS ABOUT MY
BACKGROUND. I USED MY RETIRED STATE COVER BOTH TIMES, THEREBY
COMMITTING PERJURY TWICE UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW MY OLD FRIENDS IN HIGH
PLACES WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT ME HAVE ALL RETIRED OR,
EVEN MORE, DIED. AUSTRIAN JUSTICE IS NOTORIOUSLY IMMUTABLE. DO YOU
WANT ME TO GO TO JAIL?
2. LIVING SINCE RETIREMENT IN AUSTRIA FROM 1971 TO 1980 AND FROM
1983 TO THE PRESENT, I HAVE ACHIEVED HIGH POSITIONS IN VIENNA'S
MUSICAL BODIES, BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE JOHANN STRAUSS SOCIETY AND
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE VIENNA MEN'S SINGING SOCIETY, AND I AM
PERSONALLY KNOWN TO SEVERAL RECENT AUSTRIAN PRESIDENTS, MANY
REPORTERS AND RADIO FIGURES. I SUFFERED A DISABLING STROKE IN
DECEMBER 1993 AND MY WIFE AND I, BOTH 75, CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST HERE
BECAUSE OUR 2000 SQ. FT. APARTMENT IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF 2
POST OFFICES, SEVERAL SMALL SUPER MARKETS, MY FAMILY PHYSICIAN,
DENTIST, MY UROLOGIST, AND AN EYE DOCTOR AND OPTICIAN. WE ARE
WITHIN WHEEL CHAIR DISTANCE OF THE CONCERT HALLS AND THE OPERA.
WHERE CAN YOU DUPLICATE THIS FOR ME?
3.
OUR
DURING MY ACTIVE CAREER IN VIENNA AROUND 1959 I INTERROGATED AND
BROKE AN INTELLIGENCE SWINDLER WHO HAD BEEN A NAZI ASSASSIN. I
PROMISED HIM SECRECY IF HE CONFESSED, BUT THE US ARMY PUT OUT A
"BURN NOTICE" ON HIM, FORCING HIM TO MOVE TO GERMANY. I AM SURE HE
WOULD LOVE TO FIND ME AND SHOOT ME.
4. VIENNA IS FULL OF ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL
ASSASSINATIONS, EVEN OF A CITY COUNCILMAN, BY THEM IN RECENT YEARS.
UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW, I, AS A FOREIGNER, CANNOT EVEN GET A PISTOL
LICENSE. YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF OUR
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD.
4.
I HAVE TWICE TESTIFIED BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMITTEES ABOUT
THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. THEIR FULL REPORTS SIMPLY CALLED ME THE
"DESK OFFICER" AND THAT HAS SEEMED TO SATISFY EVERYONE. NEEDLESS TO
SAY, IF YOU DO EXPOSE MY NAME, I WILL NOT EVER TALK TO ANY
JOURNALISTS OR SO-CALLED HISTORIANS.
5. IF MY NAME IS EXPOSED, I WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LEAVE VIENNA,
WITH THE WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF FURNITURE, PICTURES, LIBRARY, CLOTHING,
ETC. WHICH I PACKED AND PAID TO HAVE MOVED OVER HERE IN 1983.
BECAUSE OF MY STROKE, I WILL BE UNABLE TO DO ANY PACKING AND THE
MOVE WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE. WHERE CAN I RESETTLE IN A 2000 SQ FT.
APT. SO CONVENIENTLY LOCATED.
6. MY WIFE AND I LOVE LIVING HERE FOR MANY REASONS, AND LEAVING
WOULD BE A CRUEL AND NEEDLESS FATE.
7. I REGARD THIS LAW AS DISHONORABLE AND UNWORTHY OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST ME, I WANT TO APPEAR
BEFORE THE BOARD AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT, WHOM I HAPPEN TO ADMIRE. I
WILL PAY MY OWN WAY BACK TO DO SO. I SERVED IN WWII AND NEVER
SPARED MYSELF; IN THE OUTFIT I WORKED HARD, WAS FEARLESS IN DEALING
WITH MY SUPERIORS (CORD MEYER AND DICK HELMS CAN TESTIFY TO THAT)
AND MY ADVERSARIES. I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK OF THREATENING TO EXPOSE
THINGS TO PRESSURE YOU. I WILL BE EMPLOYING AN ATTORNEY OR TWO,
FAMILIAR WITH OUR AFFAIRS, TO REPRESENT ME. I WILL NOT DENY, THAT I
CONSIDER YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE IMPLEMENTING THIS LAW TO BE ENGAGING
IN DISHONORABLE CONDUCT, UNWORTHY OF OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICE.

Subj: Ex-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire
Ex-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire
By Michael Dorman
(c) 1996, Newsday
The chief CIA investigator of President John F. Kennedy's assassination has
testified that another high CIA official - noted for seeking conspiracies -
disobeyed orders in repeatedly conferring with the Warren Commission shortly
after the murder. The witness also said a colleague once told him that the CIA
official, the late
James Angleton, "has ties to the Mafia."
Almost 33 years after the assassination, the identity of the witness, who held
various top-secret CIA jobs, is considered so sensitive that federal authorities
insist on withholding his true name. He is known only by the alias "John
Scelso."
While Scelso testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in
1978, his 192-page testimony was kept secret until now. It has just been sent to
the National Archives by the Assassination Records Review Board, a federal
agency that screens assassination documents and makes public those that do not
endanger national security.
Sceiso's testimony, which criticized operations of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service
and other agencies, likely will renew debates, especially among conspiracy
theorists, on the assassination and how it was investigated.
When Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Scelso was chief of a CIA

ammunition. A Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko, was known to have told
investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald - identified by the Warren Commission as
Kennedy's assassin - was not a Soviet agent. But Scelso said: "I later heard
that Nosenko was discovered to have been dissembling, not being on the level.
That Information was imparted to me by CIA officers."
Based on the information CIA headquarters had on Oswald before the assassination
-
chiefly that he had been in the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union,
then returned - Scelso said he saw no reason to pay him special heed. "Oswald
just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector," he said. But he conceded
that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents in Mexico City,
for example - had not reached headquarters before the assassination.
It dealt chiefly with Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in
Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban visa two months before the
assassination. Scelso said the information failed to reach Washington because of
simple overwork and bureaucratic delays in the Mexico City office. He revealed
that all the outside telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban embassies were
tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded.
After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made
while he was in custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same
man who had visited the embassies.

responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America. Richard Helms, the CIA
chief of clandestine services and later the agency's director, placed Scelso in
charge of the assassination investigation. Angleton, a counterintelligence
official with close ties to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, "immediately went
into action to do all the investigating," Scelso testified, criticizing the
move sharply.
-
"Helms called a meeting at which Angleton and a lot of others were present and
told everybody that I was in charge and that no one should have any
conversations with anyone about the Kennedy case without my being present
which was violated from the word 'go' by Angleton, who dealt with the FBI and
the Warren Commission and (Warren Commission member and former CIA Director
Allen) Dulles himself. ... Angleton ignored Helms' orders. I tried to get Helms
to make him obey and Helms said, "You go tell him.'”
Angleton, who died in 1987, spent much of his career searching for conspiracies
- believing that there was a Communist mole in the CIA - and was presumed by
other CIA officers to have tried to press a conspiracy theory on the Warren
Commission. The commission found no evidence of a conspiracy. Angleton was
fired
in 1975. Years later, a mole was found - Aldrich Ames - but he had entered the
CIA after Angleton's dismissal.
At one point in the 1978 House testimony, committee attorney Michael Goldsmith
asked, "Do you have any reason to believe that Angleton might have had ties to
organized crime?"
"Yes," replied Scelso, who is now retired and lives abroad, government sources
said. He said the Justice Department once asked the CIA to determine the true
names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the Mafia was
hiding Las Vegas "skim" money there. "We were in an excellent position to do
this and told them so whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, 'That is the
bureau's (FBI's) business." "Scelso said he discussed the situation with
another CIA officer. "And he smiled a foxy smile and said, 'Well, that's
Angleton's excuse. The real reason is that Angleton himself has ties to the
Mafia and he would not
-
want to double-cross them."'
On another subject, Scelso gave Kennedy conspiracy theorists a slight piece of

politics, nor has it undertaken such activity anytime in the
recent past. Nevertheless, any public confirmation by the
U.S. Government of those activities would risk an adverse
reaction. Such adverse reaction would impact on current
Mexico City Station operations and be harmful to U.S.
interests.
CHADivison officers]
3. (S) As has been described to the Board in previous
briefings by the Mexican branch chief, Mexicans guard their
sovereignty carefully. Nothing will infuriate them more
than allegations of CIA meddling in their internal politics.
In fact, earlier this year, the Mexican Government postponed
a visit to Mexico by the DCI for fear that it might be
perceived (and exploited) by the Mexican media and political
opposition as the CIA being called in to assist with
handling the problem of the Peoples' Revolutionary Army.
4. (S) The fact that the CIA activity to which the
Mexicans would object occurred more than 30 years ago will
not lessen the reaction. Release of the Scelso comments
would risk an adverse reaction from the Mexicans, which
would likely include calls for an examination by the Mexican
Government of current CIA activities. This could lead to
increased scrutiny of Station operations and personnel and
could jeopardize our unilateral activities. It could also
have a chilling effect on activities conducted jointly with
the Mexican services, who will be reluctant to engage in
programs that could become subject to public scrutiny and
political debate.
5. (S) Furthermore, the fact that these statements
were made by Scelso amounts to an official confirmation of
the underlying facts, making it very difficult for CIA to
protect the same or similar information from further release
in the future. Speculation in books, articles, and other
publications, or disclosures by Congress are often perceived
by the public as evidence that that information is in the
public domain and therefore is no longer classified. The
CIA has nevertheless been able to legally protect the
information from unauthorized disclosure. The courts have
held that because there has been no official confirmation,
(i.e. declassification by the appropriate CIA official) the
CIA may continue to protect from release the
the information at issue even when there has been widespread
public discussion on the issue in question.
be
6. (S) In this case, should there by a question raised
as to the classification status of documents on the
political program referred to by Scelso, it would be
difficult to convince a court that such information had not
been declassified because of the release by the Board.

described above, but also result in reluctance by Mexican
liaison to provide similar assistance in the future. The
Mexican Government would likely be subject to criticism by
groups and individuals opposed on nationalism and
sovereignty grounds to such close cooperation with the U.S.
Government and, even more so, with the CIA. The continued
success of CIA cooperation with the Mexicans, whether it be
with the President the intelligence service, or the police, any
depends on the fact that those relationships are, and
continue to be, secret.
10.
Hee,
(S) CIA requests that the Board continue to
withhold this phrase from release and substitute in "other
sources" or something similar to this. Omitting the fact
that the airport information was obtained from Mexican
counterparts would probably leave the impression that the
information was obtained unilaterally. Although this still
presents some risk to national security, it does achieve
some level of protection to the Station's equities with
liaison.

(S) "That is, the variety and number of telephone
taps, surveillance teams, photo operations and other
technical operations is exposed by Agee in his book. That
exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world by a lot..."
(Scelso, pg. 141)
As
11. (S) CIA objects to the release of the highlighted
phrase because, for reasons described in Section 1, it
amounts to official CIA confirmation of the existence of a
teltap operation conducted jointly with the Mexicans and
with close collaboration with the President of Mexico.
this Board is well aware, CIA has consistently requested,
the protection of liaison involvement in this teltap
operation. As the Board has agreed with CIA's position on
this matter, the only issue is whether this statement
reveals what we have agreed meets the criteria for continued
protection under the JFK Act.
12. (S) For the Board's convenience, several relevant
pages from Agee's book (Inside the Company: CIA Diary) are
attached. These pages explain in great detail the teltap
operation and the fact that it was conducted jointly between
the CIA and the Mexicans. Although such disclosures by
former employees are disturbing, they do not amount to
official confirmation of the underlying information.
Standing by itself, Agee's book can be dismissed by the
Agency as speculation, and do not compromise CIA's ability
to keep the information classified. Scelso's testimony,
however, amounts to official confirmation of Agee's book,

President, and his testimony was taken under oath, with the
knowledge of the Agency, and in a classified setting.
Furthermore, the attached letter to Louis Stokes, Chairman
of the Select Committee on Assassination from former Acting
DCI Frank Carlucci also indicates that Scelso was acting as
an official of the CIA. The DCI states that any classified
testimony made by Agency staff before the Committees would
be considered "authorized provision" of the information.
This was to ensure that "all persons respond fully and
truthfully" to the Committee. Carlucci's letter, especially
taken together with the first few pages of Scelso's
testimony, make it clear that Scelso was speaking as an
official of the CIA.
7. (s) A court would, therefore, probably find that
Scelso's statements were not just merely speculation by a
former Agency employee, but in fact, were official
confirmation of the political action program. Anything
suggesting official confirmation of classified information
would lead a judge to the conclusion that the information at
issue had been declassified by the CIA. This would make it
very difficult for CIA to continue to protect this
information from unauthorized disclosure. When confusion
arises as to the classification status of information, it
could lead to complicated legal proceedings and protracted
and unnecessary litigation at great expense to all parties.
II. Liaison with Mexico
"We did not have any source of Cuban employees. We only had
Mexican police"...We had a whole reporting set up there with
that, two of them, who watched things like that. (Scelso pg.
185).
8.
(S) Release by the Board of Scelso's comments about
the Mexican police in conjunction with surveillance coverage
of the Mexico City airport could similarly have a chilling
effect on our current liaison relationship with the Mexicans.
The Station has worked, and continues to work, with liaison
against compatible targets, including tracking the arrival
and departure at the Mexico City airport of targets of
interest. Although the targets have obviously changed since
the time that Scelso is speaking of, these surveillance
operations are ongoing. The success of these current joint
operations could be threatened by any revelation today of
Mexican cooperation with the CIA in the past.
9. (S) CIA objects to this release on similar grounds
as stated in the prior section - disclosure of the Scelso
comments would constitute official acknowledgment by CIA of
the assistance provided by Mexican liaison to the Agency.
Such acknowledgment could affect not only current operations

and does effect the Agency's ability to protect the
information from further release. Equally troubling is the
fact that Scelso's testimony could be read to confirm not
only what is accurate in Agee's book, but also what is
inaccurate.
12. (S) Furthermore, the language used by Scelso is.
clear. The use of the phrase "exposed by Agee in his book"
does not allow for any other interpretation except that
Agee's description of the teltap is accurate. If Scelso had
used other language, such as "has been written about
elsewhere", the existence of the joint teltap operation
would be protected. We request that the Board protect the
phrase as it is and use the above substitute language. Such
substitute language would not alter the story of the JFK
Assassination, yet would still allow for the protection of
the joint operation.
13.
(S) While the connection between Agee's book and
Scelso's testimony may at first seem attenuated, anyone
involved in the review process conducted by this Board will
know that it is not. Many individuals follow the decisions
of this Board closely, and Agee's writings about the CIA are
also well known. It is to be expected that those who read
the Scelso report would then turn to Agee's book.
