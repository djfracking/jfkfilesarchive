1. Subject was intervieved for an immigrant visa on 7 July 65.
Unfortunately Clastonbury could not be present because of other business.
The interviewing officer was briefed prior to the meeting and faced the
applicant with a series of questions regarding her association with
Soviets and any approaches that may have been made to her in light of her
unusual life. In response to these questions, we are told that SLIOOR
gave thoughtful consideration to each question and probably truthfully
replied that although she has met several Soviet diplomats, no approaches
for cooperation were made to her. She realized the full implication of
the questions and made no attempts to be evasive. Subject was given
her visa immediately after the interview.
