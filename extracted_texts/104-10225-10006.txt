MEMORANDUM FOR:
Chairman, GS-12 Evaluation Board
FROM
SUBJECT
:
:
Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin America Division
Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-13, Daniel Flores
1. Mr. Daniel Flores was recently assigned to OTR as an
operations instructor to capitalize on his fine operational
record which he developed during his two field assignments in
Guayaquil, Ecuador, and in Lima, Peru, and his most recent
operational assignment with LA/COG. His overall performance
has clearly been characterized by exceptional proficiency and
he has been rated by his most recent supervisor as "outstanding"
for his handling of a sensitive on-island case and his development
and pursuit of Cuban operational leads. Mr. Flores has definite
growth potential and clearly meets or exceeds the criteria for
promotion to Grade GS-13, a promotion which is most strongly
recommended.
2. During the past year Mr. Flores was responsible for
handling a very sensitive, and well placed on-island Cuban asset.
This asset is probably one of the "messiest and disorganized
individuals" with whom a case officer in this Agency has had
to contend. However, Mr. Flores clearly demonstrated his fine
handling abilities in his manipulation and exploitation of this
agent. As a result of his guidance and his ability to effectively
debrief this person, Mr. Flores was able to make this asset
one of our most productive on-island sources. During the last
year this source produced 51 reports on subject matter which
often commanded attention at the highest levels of our government.
3. Mr. Flores has shown a remarkable growth potential
during the last year. He is determined, persistent, serious,
and commendably aggressive. He is mature, self-assured, and
his operational decisions are sound. His managerial skills are
in keeping with his operational potential. He was often called

MEXI 51744
SHORTLY BEFORE THE DEPARTURE OF THE FORMER COS, HE
SUBMITTED A SPECIAL MEMORANDUM ON SUBJECT'S PERFORMANCE
(MEXICO CITY 50702) WHICH CONCENTRATED MOSTLY ON SUBJECT'S
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE CI FIELD. A COPY OF THIS MEMORANDUM
IS AVATI ABLE IN SUBJECT'S PERSONNEL FILE. THE UNDERSIGNED
FULLY ENDORSES THE LAUDATORY .COMMENTS IN THAT MEMORANDUM, BUT
SINCE SUBJECT HAS TAKEN ON BROADER RESPONSIBILITIES, IT IS
NECESSARY TO COMMENT ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS WORK.
FOR THE PAST MONTHS, SUBJECT HAS BEEN DIVIDING HIS
TIME AROUT EQUALLY BETWEEN HIS CI RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER
STATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPALLY THE CUBAN TARGET. SUBJECT WAS
GIVEN THESE ADDITIONAL DUTIES BECAUSE THE CI OPERATIONS GROUP
IS WELL ORGANIZED AND REQUIRES LESS DIRECT C/O INPUT, AND ALSO
BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO DEDICATE ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES AGAINST
THE CURAN TARGET. THIS STATION IS ONE OF FOUR WITHIN THE
DIRECTORATE WHICH HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR A CONCENTRATED EFFORT
AGAINST CUBA, AND THIS TARGET NOW RANKS NUMBER ONE AMONG THE
STATION'S MANY PRIORITY OBJECTIVES. SUBJECT'S PAST EXPERIENCE
IN CUBAN OPERATIONS, HIS ABILITY TO PASS AS A NATIVE IN THIS
COUNTRY, AND HIS OTHER STRENGTHS, WERE THE INGREDIENTS WHICH
THE STATION NEEDED TO EXPLOIT IN THIS EFFORT.
-¡
SUBJECT HAS TAKEN OVER THE PRINCIPAL STATION OPERATION
DIRECTEN AGAINST CUBA. THIS WAS A FAIRLY NEW OPERATION AT THE
TIME IT WAS ASSIGNED TO SUBJECT AND IT WILL MATURE UNDER MIS
DIRECTION. FOR REASONS OF SENSITIVITY, A MORE DETAILED REVIEW
OF SUBIECT'S WORK ON THIS OPERATION CANNOT BE PROVIDED, BUT
THE RECORD SHOULD NOTE THAT DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS, HE
HAS HANDLED THIS OPERATION IN A THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL MANNER
WITH STEADY PROGRESS BEING MADE TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE
OPERATIONAL AND REPORTING POTENTIAL. ALSO DURING THIS
REPORTING PERIOD, SUBJECT. RENEWED CONTACT THROUGH MIS OWN EFFORTS
WITH A FORMER REPORTING-ASSET WHO HAD DRIFTED AWAY FROM
COLLAHNAATION WITH THE ORGANIZATION. SUBJECT IS NOW ATTEMPTING
TO BREATH NEW LIFE INTO THIS OPERATION AND BRING IT BACK UNDER
CONTROI.
SUBJECT ALSO COOPERATED WITH ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY
IN ATTEMPTING TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH A LOCAL CUBAN

upon in the last twelve months to act as Chief of his section,
a GS-14 position. He demonstrated sound leadership qualities
by stimulating interest and enthusiasm in his staff. His
operational programs were aggressive and imaginative.
Mr. Flores' supervisory talents combined with his excellent
professional skills portend a continuing and successful career
in this Agency.
4. While assigned to LA/COG, Mr. Flores was involved
in the spotting, assessing, developing access to, and eventually
pitching a Cuban who was the head of Cubana Airlines in a
Latin American country. The recruitment pitch was not successful
but the details of this operation were handled in the most
professional manner. Mr. Flores developed more leads to relatives
and friends of Cuban officials during this period than any other
LA/COĠ operations officer. He has native fluency in Spanish and
feels "at home" operating in the field. While in LA/COG
1
..
Mr. Flores was called upon to do a considerable amount of TDY
travel since he was on call, to meet his on-island asset anytime,
any place whenever the agent traveled out of Cuba. In addition
to these travels, Mr. Flores did a lot of traveling seeking
out and debriefing potential access agents. During this last
year he clearly demonstrated his ability to function independently
and to assume responsibilities usually reserved for officers
much more senior in grade and experience.
'

}
5. Mr. Flores was assigned in July 1976 to OTR on a
two-year rotational assignment as an operations instructor.
Upon completion of this assignment, Mr. Flores will return to
this Division to assume responsibilities, either at Headquarters
or in the field, commensurate with his demonstrated operational
and managerial talents. In recognition of Mr. Flores' outstanding
agent handling skills, his overall professional competency, and
his obvious growth potential, it is strongly recommended that
Mr. Flores be promoted to Grade GS-13.

SUBJECT
WAS IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING THIS OPERATION WITH LOCAL LIAISON
AND WITH THE OTHER AGENCY. THE OPERATION WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARRANGING A MEETING WITH THE TARGET, BUT
SINCE THE TARGET'S RETURN TO THE CAPITAL CITY, HE HAS REFUSED
EFFORTS BY SUBJECT TO CONTINUE CONTACT.
ANOTHER EFFORT AGAINST THE CUBAN TARGET UNDER SUBJECT'S
RESPONSIBILITY INVOLVES THE RESOURCES OF THE SPECIAL CI
OPERATIONS GROUP. FOR SOME MONTHS NON, THIS GROUP HAS BEEN
TRYING TO MOUNT A SENSITIVE FI COLLECTION EFFORT AND PROSPECTS
REMAIN FNCOURAGING THAT THIS EFFORT WILL SOON BE OPERATIONAL.
THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLEX UNDERTAKING WHICH REQUIRES PATIENCE
AND AN FLEMENT OF GOOD LUCK IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SUBJECT
DESERVES CONSIDERABLE CREDIT FOR THE PROGRESS MADE THUS FAR
AND IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN, THIS OPERATION SHOULD
BE PRODUCING WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
APART FROM HIS WORK AGAINST THE CUBAN TARGET, SUBJECT
WAS SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING AN ACCESS AGENT AGAINST A CHINESE
OFFICIAL AND LATER WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH CLOSE RAPPORT WITH
THE OFFICIAL HIMSELF. FOLLOWING UP ON A LEAD FROM ANOTHER
SOURCE THAT A LOCAL NATIONAL HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH
A CHINESE OFFICIAL, SUBJECT USED HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE AND
APPEARANCE AND RECRUITED THE LOCAL UNDER THE GUISE OF BEING
A MEXICAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO WANTED TO MONITOR THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE CHINESE IN MEXICO. ASSESSMENT INFORMATION
UUTAINED FROM THE NEW SOURCE GREATLY FACILITATED THE ABILITY
OF SUBJECT TO ESTABLISH CLOSE RAPPORT WITH THE CHINESE OFFICIAL
ONCE CONTACT WAS MADE. SUBJECT WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THAT THE
TARGET WAS POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE ON SEXUAL GROUNDS, BUT
TIME DID NOT PERMIT THIS VULNERABILITY FROM BEING EXPLOITED
BEFORE THE. TARGET COMPLETED HIS TOUR AND DEPARTED THE COUNTRY.

MANNER IN WHICH SUBJECT EXPLOITED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH

cont.
movements of an operational target, and to devise a secure and timely method of
approach to the individual Cuban.
In comparing Mr. Flores' performance as an operations officer and as a
supervisor, I believe his performance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity.
Mr. Flores has all the attributes of an excellent case officer: he is aggressive,
thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet in an operational situation. He is
further aided by his fluency in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully
passed himself off as a Mexican businessman. During his TDY travels, he has
repeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long
hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations.
•
Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau-
cratic requirements of his position. While he is a good writer, he tends to handle.
his written tasks in a hurried manner and consequently, his work oftentimes requires
review. He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling
the paper flow requirements. I mention these points not because they represent
basic shortcomings, but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance
in his operations officer capacity.
In sum, Mr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated
operations officer. His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the
human target has been amply demonstrated. He has now quite successfully been
introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for
assignments of this nature. I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions
of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

Continuation of Section D of Fitness Report on Daniel Flores,
GS-12, for period 22 June 19 November 1976
-
niques for a U.S. citizen who is scheduled to serve as an NOC
Officer in the Caribbean.
The first independent training task given to Mr. Flores
was of a third-national field agent serving as an access agent,
but this task was cancelled at the last minute when the con-
cerned Base discovered grounds for field termination of the
agent rather than providing tutorial training for the agent in
the U.S. Mr. Flores was justifiably irritated at this turn of
events which denied him what held promise for being a challeng-
ing initial training program.
It was with regret that we learned, early into what turned
out to be Mr. Flores' only independent training program, that
a priority requirement of his home-base Division would necessi
tate his return to Division duty soonest. The Division agreed
to our request that Mr. Flores conclude the training program
he had tailored, and begun, and Mr. Flores is to be commended
for having done an exceptionally fine job in this assignment.
The completion-of-training report was also well organized, and
the questionnaire which asks for an evaluative follow-up from
the trainee's field Station is to the point.
Early in his assignment Mr. Flores took over the mainten-
ance and improvement of the Unit's operations training slides,
consolidated them into an extremely functional package, and
solicited ideas from other instructors to improve the package.
Much to his credit and the Unit's benefit, Mr. Flores managed
to persuade another Agency component to undertake--without
charge--a major revamping of some of the slides using computor-
designed art work to replace some of the less impressive early
work in this field.

Mr. Flores came to the Cuba Operations Group from a brief assignment to the
Office of Training. Prior to the OTR interim, Mr. Flores had been a COG case officer
and was therefore familiar with its operational techniques. During this ten-month
period under review, Mr. Flores served as a section chief with responsibilities for
East Asian stations with a Cuban target (Tokyo, Manila, and Hong Kong) and Canada.
Mr. Flores was the only GS-13 officer to hold section chief responsibility, yet his
performance compared favorably with that of the GS-14 section chiefs. As a section
chief, Mr. Flores was supervisor for two operations officers, one intelligence analyst
and a secretary. He was responsible for ensuring the prompt handling of correspondence
to and from the field stations, and providing operational guidance and direction on
matters pertaining to Cuban operations. His section was managed in a competent
manner with Mr. Flores demonstrating his ability to delegate functional responsibilities.
The Cuba Operations Group also functions in a direct case officer capacity, and
Mr. Flores frequently traveled TDY to handle cases. He was the operations officer
for one particularly sensitive and productive on-island reporting case. This required
him to travel on short notice and to arrange for secure meeting and debriefing
sessions of this reporting source.
Mr. Flores also traveled to Canada on various occasions to meet with liaison
contacts and participate in developmental operations. One particular recruitment
attempt. required Mr. Flores to spend several days in a motel room observing the

ROOM
Mr. Flores joined the Agent and Liaison Training Unit in mid-
June 1976 and after a week's familiarization with training materials,
aids and office routine of the Unit, he attended a two-week Instruc-
tor Training Workshop at the Special Training Center. On completion
of the Workshop, Subject returned to the Unit for further familiari-
zation with the routine of the Unit, assisted in several surveillance
problems, and monitored a two-week training program which included
active participation as a trainee himself in the SAI (or persuasion
skills) portion of the program. Subsequently Mr. Flores assisted as
a role-player in a brief but significant program involving the train-
ing of a prominent U.S. citizen assisting the Agency in southern
Africa. Mr. Flores then assisted another instructor in devising and
conducting the first program this Unit has undertaken designed to
teach surveillance awareness/detection to Staff Employees who are
deemed likely to be subjects of terrorist surveillance and attack.
Mr. Flores then planned for, and from 12 October through 19 November
conducted a tutorial training program in clandestine operations tech-

STATION'S EFFORTS DIRECTED AGAINST THE HARD TARGETS IN THE
FI FIELD. SUBJECT PARTICIPATES IN ALL LEVELS OF ACTIVITY
WITH THIS UNIT FROM THAT OF A MANAGER TO SERVING AS AN
OPERATIONS OFFICER. THE LEADERSHIP AND EXAMPLE WHICH HE

Chief, ALT Unit
: Completion of Training Report
Trainee: Daniel Flores
Training Program: MURAD
21 September 1976
1. For your information and for documentation in Daniel Flores'
official personnel file, this memorandum certifies that he received
the five-day SAI Persuasion Skills course at an NOCB safesite in Ar-
lington, Virginia, between 11 and 17 August 1976. The instructor was
Mr. George Steitz.
2. Briefly, the SAI course is a program in human relations and
communications effectiveness on the interpersonal level. It provides
the trainee with a framework for analyzing problems usually encounter-
´ed in supervisory or in agent development, recruitment, and handling
situations and with a system for presenting his ideas in a way stand-
ing the best chance for success in gaining a target individual's will-
ing acceptance. Flores was an active and most interested participant
throughout the program and achieved a good understanding of the basic
principles involved. A copy of his course critique is attached for
your information.
"
3. Since Flores is an ALT Instructor, we plan to dispense with
the formality of a post-training questionnaire.

in terms of paper flow and personnel administration. He demonstrates
an ability to advance further along these lines. Also during the
period under review he participated in an approach against the
local head of Cubana Airlines in a Latin America country. Although
the recruitment effort was not successful, it was conducted in a
professional manner and Mr. Flores used an access agent relative
in a very effective manner.
He has been perhaps the most aggressive officer in the Cuba
Operations Group in pursuing leads for interviews of relatives,
friends, and acquaintances of Cuban officials posted abroad.
During the period under review he conducted at least six such
interviews and developed good assessment data on various targets.
As a native Spanish speaker, Mr. Flores has the ability to
pass as a foreign national and has successfully carried out roles
as a Mexican citizen, using OTS-provided false documents. This
ability to pass as non-American has been of great assistance in
handling the key case he relinquished only on leaving LA/COG.
:
Mr. Flores has now overcome an earlier reluctance to be
aggressive which former supervisors might have noted.
I am
confident he will maintain and build further on what I have found
to be a highly i improved sense of enthusiasm. I am sure he will
be a strong contributor to his new component.
$
:
No. 3
He is an officer who merits further responsibility and one who
should continue to rise in rank as he assumes these additional
responsibilities. It has been a pleasure to work with him and
I should like to do so with him in the future.

Trained: Mr. Daniel Flores
Instructor: Mr. Steits
August 1976 -
To us in making decisions about future SAI training or application, .
your answers to the following questions will be most appreciated.
1. Do you feel SAI training was helpful to you? (If you choose to do so, please
explain why or how.)
This course was extremely useful to re. One of the main
features of the course -- how to percieve the others percon's objectives before
your own - was of particular interest because, as an instructor it will be one
of the rain tools I will use in evaluating the level of understanding of each
trainee. This experience will also be very helpful to me in my career as
a case officer. I can think of several instance where SAI could have helped me
turn several failures (recruitment pitches) into succe£zes.
$
2. Did SAI training provide you with any concepts or tools which can be applied
in a practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any
examples you care to mention?
The benefits that this course will provide for
me in my job as an instructor are clear. I am absolutely certain that putting
the SAI concept into practice will bring forth not only self satisfication but
career benefits as well. This will also be very helpful to me in my personal
life. I can see now that some of the concepts will be put to work inmediately.
mich
3. What elements, segments, or aspects of the SAI training were of the most interest:
or use to you?
The greatest revelation from an operation point of view, was the
clarifcation of perhaps an erroneous idea we have about obtaining our intelligence
objectives. I always operated under the belief that the most important thing in
my work was to attain my objectives, i̟.e. the recruitment of an agent. SAI
revealed that this is true but it also revealed that it is more important to
first considered the target's (agent's) objectives. Once we do this our chances
(in my opinion after taking SAI) success would probably increase by at least
90 per cent. If I were to strees one point it would be that more emphasis be
placed on dealing with the target's rather than the CO's objectives.
4. Would you recommend SAI training for other of our personnel?
I am sure that bany people would be recorrended for this training and that all
would benefit. it. However, I would strongly recomend that personnel
officers be gin SAI a. a prerequisite to their
would certainly help
.he.
ther in dealing with large mumbers of different people.

means that much higher criteria is being applied than for most lead-

'
Mr. Flores has proved to be a professional agent handler, and has
been used very effectively in two new, sensitive operations run from
Headquarters. Although he did not participate in the recruitment of
these sources, Mr. Flores was brought in to provide initial training,
and detailed guidance necessary to develop the new assets into reporting
sources. One was a complicated case of a DGI walk-in who Mr. Flores
helped debrief, then trained and dispatched back to Cuba. The other
was a successful false flag recruitment of a source with excellent
access to the Cuban leadership; Mr. Flores' job, after being introduced
by the recruiting officer, is to make the source into a fully controlled
asset and maximize the excellent potential for intelligence information.

BIONATE RE OF EMPLOYER
LA/COC has six operations officers performing duties similar to
those assigned to Mr. Flores--Case officer responsible for recruiting/
handling agents directed against a hard target and also staff duties
as a Desk Chief. These tasks are unique within the Latin America
Division as these officers serve as field case officers and also as
Headquarters desk officers. All on-island Cuban agents are handled by
these six employees. I would rank Mr. Flores in the middle of this
group, but it must be taken into consideration that all the other
officers are senior in grade.

This officer has worked under my supervision for approximately six months. This
is the first fitness report I have prepared on him. After two field tours and his
current assignment to Cuba Operations Groupy, he has developed into a solid and
professional operations officer with the skills we hope our employees will develop. He
is now highly motivated and creative in his work. He has demonstrated, particularly in
recent months, a gratifying degree of drive and interest.
He has handled one of our most productive and sensitive on-island assets. With
his guidance this agent has produced, within the past six months, some of the highest
quality intelligence on Cuban plans and intentions this Agency has obtained. Because
this agent must be serviced via TDY travel, the responsible case officer must be able
to work with very little guidance and have the tradecraft skills and reports writing
ability to work largely on his own. With this case Mr. Flores has demonstrated himself
to be a first-class agent handler, highly attuned to operational information and
quality intelligence production.
As Section Chief I have relied upon him heavily to provide the institutional
memory our work demands. He has full grasp of all operations directed against Cuban
officials, not only in those countries under his direct responsibility, but throughout
Latin America. Since all of the officers in this section travel frequently to meet and
debrief agents, Mr. Flores has frequently acted as Section Chief during the absence of
the other two officers, a GS-14 position. He has been able to handle the job well both

I agree with the ratings given by the rating officer.. Mr. Flores is indeed a fine
operations officer and should have an exceptionally successful career in operations.
The only weakness in him that I have ever noted is an occasional lack of drive and
self-motivation and as noted by the rating officer, particularly in recent months, he
seems to have cured this and has indeed been going at a fast pace.
Mr. Flores is leaving Quba Operations Group for a rotational tour in the Office
of Training. I believe that when he finishes this tour, he should return for an
operational assignment in the Latin America area. He is an exceptionally fine ease
officer, has a native command of Spanish, and has a way of dealing with his agents that
gets the most out of them, Piture tours for him should involve supervision of younger
case_officers, and he should begin to move into the managerial aspects of operations,

His professional, no-nonsense handling has already contributed to
highly significant information (a value quotient of 7.0 with one
XX report) on some of the Agency's current Cuba priorities including
Cuba's negotiating attitude vis-a-vis the U.S.
In his capacity as Desk officer for field stations in Latin
America, Mr. Flores is charged with providing guidance and support
aimed at recruitment operations against Cuban officials. He has
conducted interviews of Cuban exiles in the U.S. and initiated a
promising recruitment operation against a well placed third country
official in Cuba. He supervises one intelligence analyst and, together,
they effectively ensure timely response to field requests and help
stations to identify operational opportunities, recruitment targets
and--where necessary--keep them aware of the priority of the Cuban
target.
By his performance, Mr. Flores has demonstrated he is a versatile
case officer with good operational instincts; he is showing increasing
agressiveness and imaginative support of field stations in their
efforts to recruit Cuban officials. While he is an excellent agent
handler who gets maximum intelligence production from his assets, he
is less thorough when handling the administrative details involved in
his operations. He needs more supervisory experience, and still tends
to rely excessively on his [As to search for operational leads and
conduct operational research.
Mr. Flores was sponsored by the Division, and attended the mid-
career course in November 1974. He has excellent potential for further
advancement in the Division and has been a significant factor in
LA/COG's success over the last year in developing access to Cuba, a
recognized hard target.

handles two of LA/COG's most sensitive on-island agents and during
this period, he has met these two agents in Europe and in Latin
America. He has certainly targetted these two agents against priority
objectives and the intelligence produced has been of vital interest to

tiations. Latin America Division has received commendations from

Subject's staff duties include desk chief responsibilities for support
and guidance to field programs including the research and targetting
required to conduct an effective recruitment program. Although such
duties requiring supervision are new to him, he is also making
progress in this capacity. With proper guidance and assistance, he
will develop into a most effective supervisor.

Mr. Flores native fluency in Spanish and his Latin background
have proven most valuable to Cuban operations. In fact he represents
himself as "Latin American" in handling one of this agents. For an
officer his grade, he is very mature, self assured, has good common
sense and is certainly a professional. Subject has completed two tours
in the field and is an experienced ops officer. He is intelligent,
imaginative, uses good tradecraft at all times and has a clear headed
approach to the business. He expresses himself well orally and in
writing, and works very well with other case officers. Mr. Flores
keeps up to date on political, economic and social affairs pertaining
to Cuba and he willingly accepts difficult tasks requiring frequent
separations from his family.
Subject definitely has potential.
He is operationally agressive
and is gaining experience as a manager. Mr. Flores is already perfor-
ming at a higher level than his grade. In approximately a year, he
should be again dispatched to the field as a senior officer responsible.
for handling Soviet, Chinese or Cuban targets. During the next
reporting period, Mr. Flores should receive training in superivsion.
He is a solid performer in the Cuban Operations Group and has contri-
buted much to our successes during the past year.

activities in Latin America, due largely to Mr. Flores'
professionalism.
Mr. Flores' current assignment is a combination of
operational and Headquarters desk responsibilities, the
latter calling for the support of field stations in their
efforts to develop individual Cuban recruitment programs.
His extended TDYS have understandably prevented Mr. Flores
(from devoting much time to his desk responsibilities and it
is somewhat difficult to judge his performance as a desk
officer. He has a good grasp of what needs to be done, and
his handling of specific tasks indicates good managerial
potential. Nevertheless, he does need additional desk
experience, especially in areas which will allow him to use
his operational ability to support and guide field stations
that are developing Cuban operational programs.
--
COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL (CONTINUED)
this aspect of his performance was less noteworthy, and it
is believed more attention and research could have been given
to this activity. Mr. Flores writes concisely and well, and
his CI/CE instincts are sharp and true. He can be expected
to turn in a solid desk performance in the future.

In a very short time, Mr. Flores has become an important factor in
LA/COG's efforts to directly handle Cuban on-island agents, and to
expand its recruitment program. His fluent Spanish, past operational
experience, versatility and ability to blend into the local scene in
most Latin American countries, make him highly qualified for his present
assignment. He demonstrates sound operational judgment under often
trying conditions, and good ability to communicate effectively both
orally and in writing. His frequent TDYs demand long and unusual hours,
which he gives ungrudgingly.
Almost immediately after his assignment to LA/COG in March 1974,
Mr. Flores was called upon to handle a sensitive walk-in case. The
agent had already been recruited and many of the developmental aspects
of the case had been resolved prior to Mr. Flores introduction, but it
still required a Headquarters based case officer to provide the neces-
sary continuity wherever the agent surfaced overseas. The case is com-
plicated and time-consuming, involving extended TDYs and utmost
adherence to good tradecraft procedures. It has developed into one of
our most productive sources of information on Cuban clandestine

I concur with the rating officer's comments and performance evalua-

handling of a sensitive agent. While the agent's bona fides had already
been established and his modus operandi determined, considerable ad hoc
judgement and direction were required to continue the agent's motivation
and ensure his viability. Mr. Flores did extremely well in his guidance
of the agent in a series of complicated, extended meetings which took
place in several LA countries. Good, professional tradecraft and sound
judgement were exhibited by Mr. Flores.

In carrying this heavy workload, Subject demonstrated that he is
a superior agent handler. He succeeded in conveying to these
people a sense of mission and participation which has kept their
morale and motivation, and hence their production, at a high level.
He also insisted upon work and security discipline, with a result
that the record of these agents in prompt and reliable appearance
for meetings and in responding in writing to requirements is
extraordinarily good. They all have a clear idea of what is
expected of them, confidence that performance will be rewarded
and conversely that non-performance will not be tolerated. Just
prior to his departure, Subject successfully terminated an entire
surveillance team of long standing, a measure which was decided
upon simply because the team had been heavily used for over five
years and from a security standpoint replacement seemed to be in
order. Letting old agents go is always a delicate and usually a
thankless task. It takes finesse and bargaining skill. Subject
showed these and more in divesting us of the team without a hitch.
During his last month in Lima, despite the fact that he was
burdened with the problems of closing out his household and the
normal operational and administrative cleanup prior to PCS depar-
ture, Subject made two very significant contributions to Station
objectives. First, he coordinated with the Peruvian Government
the official but necessarily discreet visit of a senior BKHERALD
officer. Since the Station is not declared, Subject had to main-
tain his LNGOLD cover throughout, further complicating this delicate
assignment. During the visit, he coordinated frequently with the
head of the Peruvian National Intelligence Service and with the
chief administrative aide of the President of Peru. He also
participated directly in one meeting with the President. This
was of course not the type of assignment which would normally be
entrusted to a "junior officer", but Subject is junior only in
relative grade, certainly not in maturity, self-assurance or judg-
ment. Then with only three days left in Lima, Subject led an
installation team which entered a building recently purchased by
the MPCHEEKS, remained for almost 48 hours and made two apparently
excellent audio Installations.
The Station will miss Subject a great deal. As the above
incidents demonstrate, when the tough or sensitive assignments
came up. he was the officer we turned to most frequently. He
never balks, argues inconvenience, or seeks the way out. He is
cooperative, helpful, and in a low-key way is always effective.
We hope he will not object to the term "old reliable" he has
been that in Lima, and more.

Subject's tour in Lima' has been cut short by the serious
Illness of his daughter. As a result of this illness it was also
necessary for him to spend the months of December and January on
emergency leave in the United States, returning without his family
in February in order to transfer his ops workload and pack out his
personal effects for PCS transfer to Headquarters on 4 March.
Although the undersigned had the privilege of working with
Subject only briefly, as rating officer he had the advantage of
taking over handling of most of Subject's cases following the
departure on emergency leave. Thus he was able to observe first
hand and in detail the human material with which Subject had worked. '
the progress he had made in developing their access and capabilities,
and the respect these agents had for him.
During the period covered by this report, Subject continued
his pursuit of the MPCHEEK target as his primary operational
responsibility. He developed and recruited a prominent member of
the local MPCHEEK community who has good access to the MPCHEEK
embassy and handled four other access agents. He also handled a
unilateral surveillance team and the Station's press placement
assets via a principal agent who in turn handled three sensitive
assets.

As the rater makes clear, Subject will be missed in Lima and
we can only sympathize with the reasons why he must now leave. He
was doing the Station a great deal of good and advancing his own
career nicely as well. It is worth recalling that Subject pre-

The pace of the course was
exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting
the SAI concepts into practice by the trainee himself. That is, perhaps a live
excercise with a person who is not aware of the training situation. A trance
could be tasked to elicit information from an unwitting participant. The use
of videotapes and/or movies would help in testing the trainees perceptiveness
through the course.

enthusiasm in what he was teaching. The end result of the professionalism that
Mr. Steita demonstrated in the class is reflected in the comments stated here and

as it developed, and make appropriate on-the-spot adjustments to control the asset's
'All this had to be accomplished with great regard to security because of
the sensitive position occupied by the agent. Subject's performance has been
effective and, given the operation's importance, can really be called outstanding.
The agent is again a prime source on the radical sector of the government, which is
crucial to developments locally.
Further, this officer continues to manage an outside principal agent who in
turn handles leftists, Communist Party and press placement assets, so directing these
efforts that they contribute effectively to overall Station objectives. More
recently. Subject has taken over the unilateral deployment of a new audio operation
targetted against a senior local Communist Party official and is carrying it through
successfully. This officer also handles much of the support requirements for his
various operations, including management of safehouse keepers, overseeing a small
surveillance team, and acquisition of rental care and property in alias. There is
little doubt that some of Subject's success can be attributed to his Latin background
and fluent Spanish. But both of these advantages might be wasted by a less capable
all-round officer. In his case, they provide him with complementary skills that
enhance his superior performance. In the view of the reporting officer, Subject
carries more than his own share here in Lima in a manner normally calling for an
officer of considerably more senior grade and experience.

A comment must be made on Subject's great ability to
adjust rapidly to one-time and target of opportunity assign-
ments. His performance in meeting with two high level agents
of other stations who had to be met during stays in Poru,
and his on-site assistance in an audio operation against a
priority target have been of the highest order. No doubt his
fluent Spanish greatly assisted him in these tasks, but his
experience and good judgment were major factors in his excellent
performance in the role of utility operations officer.
To exploit Subject's talents to the fullest, and provide
him with the professional challenge equal to his ability, he
has now been assigned the management and handling of the
difficult Chinese target, a top priority for the Station.
This is a true measure of our confidence in him.

1.
In the period of this report, Subject established himself and his
family at this post and undertook the direction of the Station's
operations against the subversive left which had formerly been handled
by an officer two grades senia to Subject. He has proved equal to the
task. He learned his new assignment rapidly and adapted well to the
handling of his cases through outside principal agents, a security
requirement of the local scene which can be frustrating for an
aggressive officer with fluent Spanish such as Subject. However, he has
shown maturity and superior handling ability in directing his assets
against the subversive left and particularly the Communist labor union.
His intimate knowledge of the extreme left enabled him to plan secure
contact with a "walk-in" to the Embassy who at first appeared genuine.
After thoroughly debriefing this individual, drawing upon his knowledge
of the extreme left, Subject was able to recommend no continuing contact
with him due to specific fabrications on the part of the walk-in.
He is careful in management of funds entrusted to him for his
operations and provides required administrative and operational reports
in a timely manner. There have been past comments on Subject's weakness
in writing. He has worked hard on this, and the rating officer feels
that he is now competently producing the reports required. Subject
understands that this is an area that requires continuing attention for
a growing professional.

Following realignment of Station officer assignments last year, Subject was given the
responsibility for operations against the MPCHEEK "hard target". He also assumed
additional -tasks in more traditional areas, such as coverage of the local government,
penetration of the Communist Party, and press placement activity. The breadth of these
operational commitments attests Subject's professional ability and versatility. (This
would be a senior case officer's load by any description and Subject's performance at
it was the reason behind our recommendation for accelerated promotion last year.)
Particularly against the difficult MPCHEEK target, this officer has displayed
admirable determination despite the inherent frustrations and disappointments of work-
ing against this remote and suspicious group. During the period under review, his job
has been the more difficult since the MPCHEEKS, in all probability reacting to a
Station attempted recruitment operation (in which Subject played a major role), have
withdrawn into a defensive shell which makes access operations verge on the impossible.
Nevertheless, he has continued to probe their defenses, and has managed to develop two
leads which, with the exercise of patience and application of his proven operational
resources, could eventually give us access to the official MPCHEEK Mission here. This
officer refuses to become discouraged, a quality officers working on hard targets must
have.
Special mention is made of Subject's successful bid to make recontact and establish
regular meetings with a valuable penetration of the revolutionary government. The
agent had broken contact with his former handler in the belief that such action was.
dictated by his security situation. Our choice of Subject to attempt to recontact this
asset was dictated by his experience in dealing with skittish Latina and our belief
that Subject could bring it off with tact, reading the situation

As described, this officer is a steady and solid performer who carries a major
case load securely, productively, and without complaint. He has even volunteered
to take on additional work when he has seen opportunities to help the Station's
overall mission. Because he blends in well on the local scene, he is often
drafted for afl kinds of ad hoc operational work. This is invariably well done.
He is operationally aggressive but also shows lively awareness of the tricky
operational climate here and does not push beyond what the traffic will bear.
His agents respect his seriousness, which permits him to get more utility out of
them. He is a pillar of this Station.

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of
intelligence and is realistic in evaluating potential sources.
His fluency in the Spanish language has facilitated his movement
in the local community and he has developed several potentially
useful sources and identified others.
In considering this officer for promotion, two facts should
be kept in mind:
a. He is probably older and certainly more mature than
the average officer at his grade level. He is anxious to
get ahead and this explains much of his initiative and drive.
b.
The rating officer has rated him very realistically
which, in my view, adds to the importance of the outstanding
rating given him on Specific Duty No. 2.

There has been little bet's performance since the
submission of his last report covering the period through 30 September
1970.
The highpoint of his activities during this period, as it has been
throughout his tour, has been his management of a sensitive technical
operation which has been a consistent producer of unique and high level
intelligence. This has been a good performance on Subject's part
indicative of his professional capability to conduct clandestine
operations.
-
Subject's writing ability has improved during this period, and
there is little doubt that his efforts in this regard are paying off.
Further experience should see continued improvement of his writing
skills.
As Subject's first tour comes to a close he can look back on a
generally strong performance in all phases of his operational activity
on behalf of the Base's objectives.

the target is good. The project is, however, in need of good human
reporting assets and it is expected that as Subject overcomes a
weakness mentioned in the next paragraph he will be able to devote
more of his time to this important task.
--
--
The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation
of written material
and
dispatches, intelligence reports
finds it necessary to spend an extended portion of his time on its
preparation. The rater has discussed this with Subject on several
occasions, and it is believed that his difficulty is due to a lack
of experience, and that in time and with a continuing effort on his
part he will develop his writing skills.
The Subject's overall attitude and response towards his pro-
fessional responsibilities during the first tour have been positive.
He is interested in the kind of work he is doing, likes it and is
willing to put in the kind of long hours it sometimes demands
without complaint.

disciplined, effective manner enabling him to maintain a continuity
and productivity within the Base operational requirements with security
and dispatch.
Socially Subject and his wife are proving to be good mixers and
both are gaining in popularity within the local foreign and indigenous
communities. They both have gained the respect and appreciation of
the
complex not only as compatible personalities, but in her
willingness to participate actively in Joint charitable endeavors and
his professional cooperative attitude. Their optimistic and positive
conduct at official and non-official functions is a credit to the Base.
Subject's native fluency in Spanish and his Latin background is
proving to be a definite asset in the performance of his assigned
operational tasks and ability to handle agent assets amicably and
productively.
He maintains accurate accounting records and is demonstrating
responsible acute cost consciousness in the use of funds and properties.
This rater's principal criticism of this employee is his tendency
toward Impulsiveness and too-quick judgement before weighing all the
facts and Implications in the pursuit of his operational requirements;
however, this weakness is more a function of his inexperience in the
field and will be resolved as he gains more field experience..
Subject, although exhibiting resourcefulness and imagination in
performing his assigned operational tasks also has a tendency to accept
the Judgement of other senior grade officers too readily rather than
express his own convictions and trust in his own assessment of a
situation.
1
This rater has conseled this Officer regarding these tendencies
and he is taking measures to rectify them.
In Judging his over all performance, this Rater is of the opinion
if he continues to apply himself in handling tasks worthy of a senior
grade officer, he should be considered for a promotion to the GS-10
level at the earliest opportunity.

This employee, a GS-09, arrived PCS at the Guayaquil Baue on
13 May 1969 and has been under this Rater's supervision during this four
and one-half month period. Guayaquil is his first overseas assignment
with this Agency.
During this short reviewing period, this officer has demonstrated
a marked insight and knowledgeableness of the operations he has been
assigned, and has provided a number of good ideas and suggestions for
the betterment of these operations. Subject is proving to be a hard
worker and has not complained of the many extra hours he has devoted to
his operations. He has accepted responsibilities without hesitation
and is not afraid to take on difficult tasks using initiative and
ingenuity in their completion. This latter quality has been amply
demonstrated when the Rater was unexpectedly confined to a hospital in
the Panama Canal Zone for the full month of August 1969, leaving this
employee solely responsible for the Base as the only inside Case Officer
at the Bace during this time. Rater's absence corresponded with a
change in Case Officer PCS assignments at the Base, which left the Base
temporarily depleted of Officers. During this period, Subject exhibited
an ability and maturity expected of an officer of higher grade and
greater field experience. He organized his increased workload in a

highly for the training and experience he has had. He has taken on,
in the absence of the Chief of Base and other senior officers, respon-
sibilities uncommon to an officer of his junior position, and he has
handled them in a superior fashion. He and his wife have entered into
their representational responsibilities with great enthusiasm and
effectiveness, and I predict a most highly successful tour for him in
Ecuador. Because he has shown a personal and professional competence
beyond his grade level, it is strongly recommended that he be con-
sidered for promotion to GS-10 at the earliest opportunity.

The period covered by this report encompasses the middle portion
of the Subject's first tour as a Case Officer. His performance
during this period has been balanced in that he has shown the kind
of intelligence and maturity necessary to successfully carry out
clandestine operational activity He has also shown a weakness which
he will need to overcome in order to achieve his full operating
potential.
The Subject has turned in fine performance in the overall
management of a very important and sensitive audio operation which
has been under his caro since the pre-installation phase. His sure
and careful handling of all succeeding phases of this operation led
to a secure, uncomplicated installation, the recruitment and training
of support agents, and the dissemination of valuable intelligence
information. Subject's natural fluency in the Spanish language has
been especially useful in this operation. His handling of this
installation has been of a high professional caliber throughout.
The Subject is also responsible for the management of a project
targetted against the subversive left. His handling of this project
has been good: he is a good agent handler; knows how to target his
assets against objectives of most importance; and, his knowledge of

He had responsibility for a variety of FI projects, including
several complex and sensitive ones, which he ably handled. He had a
full workload and in addition to his assigned responsibilities he was
given FI assignments of every type as they arose. On one occasion he
was sent on an operational trip to New York City where he was to con-
tact, assess and support a target personality. Owing to circumstances
beyond his control nothing went as expected but Mr. Flores, acting
alone, improvised and adapted to the situation. This is indicative of
the initiative and eagerness he displayed in his desk work. He was
willing to learn and he accepted guidance and instruction to the letter.
In addition Mr. Flores writes well and this is always an asset.
Mr. Flores is fluent in Spanish.
Spanish. It is my impression that if
there is one thing that Mr. Flores wants to be that is a field case
officer. He is now getting that chance. He will soon leave on an
assignment to Ecuador. I have no doubt that he will do very well.
Mr. Flores did not have any managerial duties.

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a maximum of
19 hours per week while attending university full-time. In August
1967 he will obtain his bachelor's degree in political science. He
will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university
studies and will be recommended to the Office of Training for admission
in the CT class beginning November 1967.
•
The limitations imposed by part-time employment have prevented
us from assigning Mr. Flores to jobs within the branch such as the
monitoring of active field cases which require close, daily attention.
-However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in
the duties described above is excellent. He accomplishes his tasks
quietly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his super-
visor. Because he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of
great use to the Branch in screening quickly and accurately materials
which are of counter-intelligence interest.
Mr. Flans agency work background, coupled with his formal
education about to be completed and his own desire to make a career
in intelligence make him an extremely valuable employee, one in whom
the Agency should not hesitate to invest time and money for the
advancement of his career training.

I would rate Mr. Flores essentially the same as Mr. Trettin,
I wish to stress that, although young and inexperienced in
intelligence work at the present time, the potential is certainly
there. After CT training Mr. Flores should be a fine, dedicated

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a
minimum of nineteen hours per week; he is also full time
a
college student in his senior year, majoring in political
science and specializing in Latin American studies. Sub-
sequent comments should be prefaced by the statement that
Mr. Flores' overall performance of his assigned duties would
be considerably more efficient if he were able to devote full
time to his assignment. On the other hand, Mr. Flores is
preparing himself academically for a useful career with the
Agency and in the rater's opinion shows promise of becoming
a very capable and competent officor.
Mr. Flores is bilingual and has served very efficiently
as a translator for the Branch. He has gained very valuable
experience as a case officer in the handling of two contract
agents of WH/COG/CICS, and in doing so has demonstrated tact,
`sound judgment and a fine ability to handle people.
·
Mr. Flores
is very personable, intelligent and makes an excellent appearance,
With the completion of his studies he should be ablo to mako
the transition from Intelligence Assistant to Junior Case
Officer, which the rator heartily recommends.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS
Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective, their relationship to

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a maximum of
19 hours per week while attending university full-time. In August
1967 he will obtain his bachelor's degree in political science. He
will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university
studies and will be recommended to the Office of Training for admission
in the CT class beginning November 1967.
The limitations imposed by part-time employment have prevented
us from assigning Mr. Flores to jobs within the branch such as the
monitoring of active field carcas which require close, dally attoation.
However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in
the duties described above is excellent. He accomplishes his tasks
quietly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his super-
visor. Because he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of
great use to the Branch in screening quickly and accurately materials
which are of counter-intelligence interest.
Mr. Plows agency work background, coupled with his formal
education about to be completed and his own desire to make a career
in intelligence make him an extremely valuable employee, one in whos
the Agency should not hesitate to invest time and money for the
advancement of his career training.

Mr. Flores was a particularly useful and versatile employee in the
WH/SA counterintelligence operations unit. Although he had no operational training
or previous operational expérience, he learned rapidly and performed well the
operational support type duties assigned to him. His fluent knowledge of the Spanish
language, his willingness to learn and perform tedious tasks, and his conscientious
approach to his work were important factors in his performance. His previous
assignments in the RI Division and in WH/SA as a translator and in conducting name
traces gave him a good background.
With respect to specific duty #3, on two separate operations in New
York City Mr. Flores participated in the training and preparation of agents for
dispatch to Cuba. In the first operation he interpreted for training in S/W, OWVL,
W/T (medium speed) and related subjects.. The second operation involved OWVL
only. This experience enable Mr. Flores to perform duties (specific duty #3.)
relating to communications with agents in Cuba.
Mr. Flores plans to continue his university education and attain a
degree. Arrangements have been completed so that he may work in the Agency on a
part time basis beginning in January 1965. He will attend classes at a local
university as a full time student.
Mr. Flores was promoted from GS-04 to GS-05 on 16 March 1964.
has been performing duties at the GS-06 level, and he should be promoted.

'Mr. Flores entered on duty with Special Affairs Staff in June 1963. Due to his
proficiency in Spanish he was assigned to translating duties and immediately proved
to be an invaluable asset to this office as well as to the Staff as a whole. Ha
worked many late hours and weekends helping to facilitate the flow of translations
from this office to the different components within SAS. His performance of these
duties can best be characterized as "exceptional" in all degrees.
Mr. Flores expressed a desire to move into a position of greater responsibility
and this request was readily granted approximately one month ago. He is currently
being trained as an intelligence assistant in Ops Support functions and his
performance to date has been excellent. In his new duties Mr. Flores requires very
little supervision. This can be attributed in part to his degree of intelligence
as well as the background he obtained for his present duties while assigned to his
previous job in RID/INDEX. Mr. Flores spent approximately one year in his former
job and the knowledge he brought with him routing to name tracing procedures has
enabled him to grasp the duties of his new position quite rapidly.
As a means of furthering his education Mr. Flores is attending American
University at night. He has expressed a desire to obtain some agency training and
would like very much to be enrolled in the Intelligence Orientation Course as soon
as possible.
Mr. Flores entered the agency as a GS-4 in March 1962. It is strongly
grecommended that he be promoted at the earliest possible date to a GS-5.

During this reporting period, Mr. Flores continued to conduct himself
in the exceptionally proficient manner which was noted 1:A1AM Fitness
Report. He is one of two name tracers who specialize in a particular arca,
a fact which tends to increase the difficulty as well as the responsibility
of name tracing. In spite of this burden, Mr. Flores has consistently
maintained an above average level of production and an exceptionally high
quality in his finished products.
Mr. Flores is a conscientious and highly motivated employee who
evidences a sound sense of responsibility. He has frequently voiced a
desire to take advantage of any career opportunities the Agency may
offer to him. He is currently enrolled as a full-time student at the
American University.

TEST RESULTS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FACT FINDING PHASE OF MOST PERSONNEL OPERATION". EVALUATION OF
THESE MEASUREMENTS IN RELATION TO OTHER FACTUAL MATERIAL IN THE PERSONNEL RECORD PROVIDES ONE OF THE BACTS FOR THE
SELECTION AND PLACEMENT OF APPLICANTS AND FOR COUNSELING WITH NEW EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER
AN INDIVIDUAL CAN AND WILL PERFORM THE DUTIES OF A SPECIFIC JOB MUST REST ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE RECRUITER OR PLACE -
MENT OFFICER, WHO CONSIDERS ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY, BACKGROUND. AND PERSONALITY IN RELATION TO THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE AGENCY.
THIS REPORT EVALUATES THE SUBJECT'S PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING HIS SCORES WITH THOSE OF A NATIONWIDE GROUP OF
TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS OF THE SAME 3x.. SPECIFIC APTITUDES ARE IDENTIFIED BY USING A VARIETY OF TESTS RANGING FROW
WORK SAMPLES OF FILING AND CHECKING TO MEASURES OF REASONING ABILITY. IN EVALUATING THESE TEST SCORES FOUR GENEPAL
CONCEPTS SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND. (1) TESTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SCREENING OUT POTENTIAL FAILURES THAN IN IDENTI
FYING THOSE WHO WILL PERFORM SUCCESSFULLY. (2) PERSONS #HOSE SCORES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE LOWEST 16% ORDINARILY
ARE NOT SUITED FOR OFFICE WORK, (3) MOST JOBS DO NOT REQUIRE HIGH SCORES ON ALL TESTS. BUT HAVE A RANGE WITHIN
UNICH PEOPLE CAN DO THE WORK EFFECTIVELY AND TEND TO REMAIN ON THE JOB. (4) EFFICIENCY IN PLACEMENT NEGESSITATES
MATCHING THE JOB AND THE INDIVIDUALI DOTH THOSE BHO ARE OVERQUALIFIED AND THOSE WHO ARE UNDERQUALIFIED ARE LIKELY
TO QUIT.
A DESCRIPTION OF THE SIX TESTS IN THE BATTERY IS GIVEN ON THE BACK OF THIS FORM. IN CABIS WHERE THE PATTERN
OF THE TEST SCORES APPEARS TO INDICATE APTITUDE IN PARTICULAR AREAS THIS WILL BE NOTED IN THE ATMARKS DECTION.
WHERE RESEARCH STUDIES MAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TESTS TO JOB PERFORMANCE THESE COMMENTS WILL

HEMORANDUM FOR:
Secretary, CSCS Panel A
17 AUG 1971
SUBJECT
1. It
Recommendation for Promotion to Grade
CS-11, Daniel Flores
It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be promoted
from GS-10 to CS-11.
2. Hr. Flores is 36 years old and joined the Agency in
March 1962. He has successively been a file clerk, trans-
lator, intelligence-assistant, carcer trainee and operations
officer. He worked part time for several years so that he
could obtain his BA degree from American University. This he
did in 1967 with his specialty being Latin American Affairs.
+
•
3. Mr. Flores, who is bilingual in English and Spanish,
has just completed his first overseas tour as an operations
officer in Guayaquil, Ecuador. It is on the basis of his
very fine performance during this tour that this promotion
request is based. Also as a result of his record' in Guayaquil,
he has been assigned to Lima Station as an operations officer
in a position which is rated as GS-13.
4. The Chief of Base, Guayaquil, and the Chief of Station,
Quito, both have rated "r. Flores as "Strong" in his fitness
reports and both have stated that his performance in Guayaquil
merited a Quality Step Increase. This QSI request is currently
being processed and is based on the outstanding job Mr. Flores
did in connection with a very sensitive technical operation.
He planned the pre-installation aspects, supervised the instal-
lation, located the listening post, recruited the transcriber/
secretary and precessed all the intelligence which was produced.
The intelligence derived from this source has been of consis-
tently high quality and the operation has been described by the
Chief of Station, Quito, as the best and most productive of
all the operations in Ecuador. Throughout all aspects of the
operation, Mr. Flores maintained tight control on its security
and avoided any problers in this respect.

SUBJECT

Secretary, CSCS Panel (Section C)
Recommendation for Promotion to Grade
GS-10, Daniel Flores
1. It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be
promoted from CS-09 to GS-10..
2. Mr. Flores joined the Agency in 1962; initially
he was employed on a part-time basis in the Wii Division
while attending the American University. He received his
AB degree in 1967 and became a full-time staff employee.
On the strong recommendation of his supervisors, Mr. Flores
was accepted for the Career Training Program which he com-
pleted in August 1968. After rejoining the WH Division,
he was selected for assignment as an operations officer at
the Guayaquil Base where he arrived in May 1969. Mr.
Flores is bi-lingual in Spanish.
3, Both as a Headquarters and field operations
officer Mr. Flores has carried out his assignments with
intelligence, enthusiasm and initiative. As the Guayaquil
Base officer in charge of Communist penetration operations,
his performance has been of high caliber. In August 1969,
during the forced absence of the Chief of Base and other
senior officers, Mr. Flores assumed the full responsibilities
for running the base for a period of several weeks.
he per-
formed the duties of Acting Chief of Base in a superior
manner. In addition to his operational competence, the
Guayaquil Chief of Base has observed that Ar. Flores'
ability to develop social relations with ease has been a
distinct asset for the Base.
4. Mr. Flores has already proven to be a competent
operations officer. As he further develops through experience
and responsibility he should become eligible for rapid ad-
vancement. In any case he is already performing at a level
far higher than his current grade and a promotion at this
time is strongly recommended,

duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organi-
zation in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour
of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assign-
ment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that

of this organization.
4. Salary and allowances paid by your cover facility shall be re-
tained by you to the extent that they do not exceed the salary and allow-
ance payment due you on the basis of your grade level with this organiza-
tion. If such cover payments are less than the amount due you, the dif-
ference will be paid to you by this organization. If such cover payments
exceed the amount due you, the excess amounts will be remitted to this
organization at intervals to be designated by the Office of Finance.
Computations hereunder will be based on the aggregate gross amounts due
and received. That portion of retirement contributions withheld by your
cover facility which exceeds the retirement contributions applicable to
your organization salary will be deducted from the gross amount of the
overpayment. Upon integration, the payroll office of this organization
will establish the date on which you would normally receive a regular step
increase from your cover facility. Failure to report a grade promotion
received from a cover facility ices cause errors in processing regular step
increases. Regular s
Regular step increases, incorrectly processed in such manner,
should be reported immediately to this organization. To eliminate this
problem, any grade promotion received from a cover facility will be re-
ported immediately by you to this organization's payroll office through
channels showing both the old and the new rate and the effective date.
All salary difference payments and adjustments will be reflected on earn-
ings statements.
5.
Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in
full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility
and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments
of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however,
to preserve the security of your cover position.
8. Upon integrating into your cover facility you will continue
to be covered by the particular retirement system in which you are a par-
ticipant as an employee of this organization. Salary received from your
cover facility and any salary differences payable by this organization will
be subject to appropriate retirement contributions.
b. Appropriate Federal income tax withholdings shall be made from
taxable income received from both your cover facility and this organization.
Additionally, while serving in the United States, withholdings shall also be
made for District of Columbia or State income tax, when applicable.
You may
claim reimbursement for excess income taxes paid on overt tax returns by rea-
son of taxable income from your cover facility exceeding the taxable income
due you as an employee of this organization.

All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at
the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility.
While integrated you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home
leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of
your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization.
Upon termination of your integration, your unused annual leave, sick
leave, and home leave will be transferred to your credit with this
organization and your leave record will be reconstructed as of the
beginning of the leave year in which you return to this organization,
as explained in the Handbook on leave for Special Situations. Serving
in an integrated capacity does not permit the carryover from one leave
year to another of an annual leave balance which exceeds the ceilings
authorized by regulations of this organization and the Federal leave
law. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a
lump-sum payment for accrued ammal leave, upon your "resignation" you
will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization,
including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility in order
to receive credit for such annual leave.
6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all
information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released
in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such
secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the espionage laws,
as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations. The termination of
your employment with this organization will not release you from the obli-
gations of any security oath you may be required to take.

LARRATIVE COMMENTS
Significant strengths and weaknesses and their relationship to overell
performance in the Operations Course. This section emplifics and explains,
6s necessary, the rating letter given above.
Mr.
Mr. Flores' overall performance in this course was at the high
proficient level. He is a very friendly and personable individual
who put forth a good deal of effort to do well in the course.
Flores takes a very practical approach to solving problems and his
attitude throughout the course was excellent.
Mr. Flores acquired a good understanding of the principles and
techniques of Clandestine Services operations, and in problems requiring
face-to-face encounters with simulated agents in the live excrcises he
came through as a very friendly and personable individual. He was
particularly effective in debriefing situations and demonstrated
flexibility in meeting the problems that arose during the simulated
agent meetings.
Mr. Flores demonstrated a good understanding of Clandestine
Services programs in Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence and
Covert Action. His performance was graded strong in handling of a
simulated walk-in defector, and in a Counterintelligence case study
and a Covert Action case study his understanding and analyses were
Judged highly proficient. He received a rating of adequate in photography.
Mr. Flores has good writing skills and acquired a thorough under-
standing of intelligence and operational reporting procedures and
formats of the Clandestine Services. His intelligence reports were
consistently complete, accurate and clear. His operational reports
suffered occasionally from weak organization, and on one occasion he
had difficulty distinguishing operational from intelligence information;
but his reports were generally complete and accurate and showed a sound
understanding of operational reporting requiremento.
Mr. Flores is a personable and intelligent individual who got along
very well with his colleagues and with the instructors. With his excellent
attitude and strong desire for a career in the Clandestine Services
together with his willingness to work hard, Mr. Flores should have little
difficulty in developing into an effective case officer as he gets greater
experience.

OVER. ALL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The RATING LETTER reflects the over-all performance of the student in the course and is thus a measure of
the extent to which the student possesses the skills and techniques required in the production of finished in-
telligence. The rating is not necessarily arrived at by mathematically averaging in the skills ratings, but
takes into consideration any outstanding strengths or weaknesses that should be reflected in an evaluation of
the performance of the student as a whole. The RATING LETTER is a consensus of the view of the faculty.
REPORT OF OBSERVATIONS, JUDGMENTS AND IMPRESSIONS
RATING
P-
This is a general, unspecific, narrative report of observations, judgments, and impressions. It includes intangi-
ble factors such as the student's attitude, cooperativeness, attentiveness, maturity, and judgment. It also includes
the general impression the student has made on the faculty. This report will not be included unless the instructors ·
believe that it would add something to the previous evaluation of performance in skills as well as to the evaluation
of the OVER-ALL PERFORMANCE of the student.

Recommendation for Promotion to Grade
GS-10, Daniel Flores
:
1. It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be promoted from
GS-9 to CS-10. Mr. Flores has been in his present grade since
April 1969.
2. Mr. Flores joined the Agency in 1962. Initially he was
employed on a part-time basis in the Mi Division while attending
American University. He received his AB degree in 1967 and became
a full-time staff employee. On the strong recommendation of his.
supervisors, Mr. Flores was accepted for the Career Training
Program which he completed in August 1968. After rejoining the
All Division, he was selected for assignment as an operations
officer at the Guayaquil Base, where he arrived in May 1969.
t
3. ` Mr. Flores has made a most impressive beginning in
Guayaquil. He has adapted to new tasks and a new environment
with a mature assurance and a professional approach. Shortly
after arrival in Guayaquil the Base was temporarily depleted of
other officers. Mr. Flores carried out the duties of acting
Chief of Base in a most commendable manner. His fluency in
Spanish and his Latin background have been definite assets in the
performance of his duties. His performance to date has demonstrated
that he handles his agents securely and productively, Both Mr.
Flores and his wife have been well accepted within the local
community and they carry out their representational duties very
effectively.
4. Mr. Flores has proven to be a competent operations
officer. As he further develops through experience and responsibility
he should become eligible for rapid advancement. In any case he
is already performing at a level higher than his present grade and
a promotion at this time is strongly recommended.

forthcomings he also said this to during a private
meeting. Thus far, however, there has been no notice of the
promotion action. The COB assumes that the delay is related in

and some further action by the Base is necessary in addition to
Flores
the recommendation contained in last Fitness Report,

1. Mr. Flores has been working in WH/COG and its predo-
cessor groups since 1963. His fitness reports have been
consistently good and the comments of his supervisors laudatory.
In mid-1965 Mr. Flores was changed from full-time to part-time
staff omployee in order to allow him to attend American Univor-
sity on a full-time basis. His course of study loads to a
Bachelor's Degree in Political Science with emphasis in Latin
American affairs. Mr. Flores has made the Dean's List the past
two somesters and will receive his degree in August 1967.
2. Throughout his carcor Mr. Flores has shown himself to
be a strongly motivated employee, willing and capable. The
calibre of his performance has been consistently good and he
has shown steady improvement as he acquired the skills and
knowledge of intelligence business. He is reliable' and con-
scientious and we have good reason to expect that ho will
develop into a very competent operations officer. He will
apply for the CT program in September and his application will
be wholeheartedly supported by WH/COG.
3. In WH/COG Mr. Flores has served as an Intelligence
Assistant in support of CI operations. In addition he has
assisted in the training of agents in radio and secret writing
communications. Mr. Flores is bi-lingual Spanish and
English
-
-
and is adept as an operational Translator-Interpreter.
4. Mr. Flores was promoted to GS-05 on 16 March 1964.
He has been performing duties at GS-06 level for the past two
years and it is sincerely recommended that he be promoted ‹
promptly to GS-06.

1.
Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Carcer Service, If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me.
However, if the lead of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
•
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. This in no way affects
your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it
preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA Sys-
tem if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
your read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 28-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
L
4.
It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service, They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be for-
mally considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be
made within 30 days of the Gate of this memorandum.

: Mr. Daniel Flores
Recommendation for Promotion
i
{
In
1. Mr. Flores has been with the Agency for about
eighteen (18) months and has been a member of SAS since
June 1963. During the six (6) months he has been with
SAS he has demonstrated intelligence and initiative.
addition to his fulfilling his primary responsibility as
a translator, he quickly picked up the knowledge and ex-
perience necessary for an Intelligence Assistant in tho
Operations Support Section. His duties and responsibilities
accordingly have been broadened. He has demonstrated ability
to function independently as a member of the Operations
Support Staff. He is cooperative and has maintaned à cheer- -
ful disposition under presure and through many late hours
and weekends of duty.
2.
In view of his excellent performance in SAS, his
intelligence and ability, and his growth potential for a
career in CIA, I strongly recommend that ho be promoted to
GS-5 as soon as possible.

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct."

Mr. Flores had just been recently released from active duty with the USMC when
he came in for interview. He has served two tours which included Security guard
Embassy duty in Peru and Boliva. His wife was formerly stationed at the Embassy with
Dopt. of State. He appears to be a mature young man, clean cut, neat ppearance,
dark complexion and coloring. He is planning to contine his college education
at C.U. and is available to work the 8330 - midnight PI shift. A clerical position
at the 08-4 leveà was discussed in the interview. His wife is a secretary with a lau
firm in town; they have no children.
toqu
T
Mr. Flores is in excellent health and had a very good rep ri with the Marine Corps..
Known of nothing in his background that would be unfavorable in event of reference
shack. At initial interview he stated that he had no foreign connections, however,
after contacting his family in Texas it was determined that his step-mother was
born in Mexico and although bhe came to the US in 1922, she has never become a
US citizen.
Full clearance.

The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agen-
cy to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Gov-
ernment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive
responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows
that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is
a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security
checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness,
and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may
be offered. This is called "clearance" of an applicant.
2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely un-
aware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the
Agency make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency
are conclusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no state-
ment of specific reasons is made to the applicant.
3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to
full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv-
ing an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency.
Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the appli-
cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage
of applicants are not cleared.
Statement of Understanding
and Agreement
I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-
tions.
I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.
SIGNED at Washington, D. C., this
