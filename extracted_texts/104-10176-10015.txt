that the same source also indicated that the coffee-house known as
ASU DE WA CSLSUGIRU to which he was referring, which is identical
with the establishment of this name listed in the 1957 Tokyo Directory,
in the type of place which is not frequented is general by American
nationals stationed in or visiting Tokyo ao tourists; rather it caters
mainly to indigenous patrons and their guests, or to foreign residonta
of Tokyo who have been introduced to the place and the management by
Indigenous patrons. These foreignors then become regular patrons
after becoming known to the managemen, inasmuch as the above
described ASU DE V'A (BCSUGI&U coffee-bouse geserally fits the
description of the "Tomorrow is Ico Lete Club" mentioned by
Valentino HAHN as a night:lub" to which he was taken by George
PERIS, it is suggested that they are one and the same establishments,

and Valentine HANN with George PLASTEROPOULės aka PËRs, and
in tura, PERIS' role vis-a-vis kAHN's introduction to the ALU DE WA
(JCSUGIAU coffee-house, it is suggested that PERIS may have played
a similar role in terms of introducing William MARTIN to Japanese
night-life. This may have eventually led to MARTIN's contact and
invalvement with Japanese individuals, who introduced him to or
indulged his masochistic interests,
11. Additional information on the individuals mentioned above
will be forwarded as developed. It is requested that addressees far-

9. With reference to the 'Tomorrow is Too Late Club', men-
tioned in paragraph 5 above, to which Valentine Hääl claims to have
been taken by George PARIS, an exact and direct re-translation of the
club name into Japanase from the English as given by HAHN, would
read "Asu de wa Ososugira¨. it is noted thai thở Takys Telephone
Directory for 1957 contains a listing for an establishment of this

Ginza, 8-Chome, 3 Banchi, Tokyo-to, Telephone Nos.: 57-0945,
57-6363, 57-6328. A reliable source, who is familiar with the city of
Tokyo, advised in October 1760, that as of 1759 this establishment
was still operating at the listed location, and that it is a colies-bouse
rather than a nightclub in the western senso, although alcoholie
beverages are available for consumption on the premises by the
patrons. The same source also advised that the above coffee-house

Nolan CHILD and Mortimer Claggett Cllmä, Jr. will be furnished
separately.
S. The activities and contacts of George PERISTERUPCULLS
aka PERIS in Japan and Korea are currently being investigated by this
Agency.
6. George 3. PERUTZROPCULÚS aka PERIS, identified above,
and known to William H. MARTIN as “George PARIS, is idontic al
with the individual whom Velestia HAHN aka Valentis Vasiliyevich
KHAN aka ↳ an¬ika HAN, admitted former (1967) Soviet agent, identi-
fled as “George PARÍS, a Greek businessman in Ickyo“, and as one of
HAHN'a close contacts and friends in Japan. then interviewed by
representatives of this Agency la 1958, Valentine HAHN advised that
the above “George PARIS was the person who introduced HAHN to a
Tokyo nightclub, located off the Ginna, the name of which HAHN gave
only an "The Tomorrow is Too Late Club". HAHN claimed that this
was an exact and direct translation into English of the actual J'apanese
nama, which, however, he never mentioned during the interview,
Date of HAHN's visit to this "club" in company of George PERIS aka
PARIS, is estimated to have been somewhere between 1956 and 1957.
HAHN stated that as the "Tomorrow Is Too Late Glub' he was intro-
duced to a Japanese hostess by the name of Norike MATSUZAKATA
alias Noriko AWAJI, with whom HAHN sabsequently enjoyed dates.
It is believed that Noriko MATSUZAKAYA Y AWAJI became the mistres
of Valentine HARV for an unésterminos period of time following his
original introduction to her at the above "Club“ while in the company
of George PERISTALPCULAS aka PERIS aka PARIS. HAHN also
advised, that following his original introduction to this establishment
by PERIS, HAHN had taken a member of cenamed married American
nationals, who were stationed in Tokyo, to the same club, where such `
persons had also been introduced to and had enjoyed dates with the
hostesses. At this time, there is no information to indicate that
either William Hamilton --ARTIN ov Beruna Ferguson MITCHELLs
re among the United States nationals HAMN referred to as having
been taken to the aforementioned club by HAHN. Neither is there any
information currently availeàis to reflect that Filliam hamilton
MARTIN was known to Valentine HAHN through their mutual acquaint-
anteship with George PARETEROPOULLE.
