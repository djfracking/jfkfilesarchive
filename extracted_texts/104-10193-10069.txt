Memo for File William P. Burke
->
Subject: Longevity Step Increase
-
In reviewing this file under the Security
reinvestigation program, it was noted that the
3rd LSI (as GS-15) was proposed to be made effective
on 13 Sept 60, but that the effective date had been
changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for
the change is presumed to be due to LWOP. Form 560
shows 225 hours of LWOP during the waiting period..
If those figures are correct, then there was no
"excess" LWOP, since the law provides that a maxi-
mam of 240 hours of LWOP is creditable toward com-
pletion of the waiting period in the case of LSI's.
I called this case to the attention of Joe
Tracy, C/Payroll, who will review HOP records and,
if required, issue a memorandum to correct the
effective date of the last LSI.

William P. Burke, Memorandum of Performance
William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office,
continues to manage his office in a thoroughly competent. and
efficient manner. Mr. Burke is a conservative who sometimes
finds it difficult without most careful and protracted
consideration of all factors involved to adjust to changes in
methods and objectives particularly those peculiar to clandeo-
tine support. While his conservation added to his meticulous
legalistic approach might be something less than desirable in
certain areas it is a definite asset in New Orleans. When
called upon in emergency he willingly and efficiently devotes
his entire time and energy to the solution of the problem
regardless of personal inconvenience. Mr. Burke represents
the Agency well in his area and readily maintains respect in
the community.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Director for Operations
SUBJECT:
William P. Burke, Memorandum of Performance
1. William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office,
continues to manage his office most efficiently and to demonstrate
thorough knowledge of his area. His inherent conservatism and some-
what legalistic approach tend to make it difficult for him to accept
change and methods peculiar to clandestine support without most care-
ful consideration of all the factors involved.
2. Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area. His con-
servatism is to a degree an asset in New Orleans; it could conceivably
be a handicap elsewhere.

AFFENDIX "B"
(Sec. 16. in Form 2005; Sec. 17 in USSC Std. Form 57)
In the spring of 1942 the war care pretty close to New Orleans. There were sub-
marinos in the Gulf, tankere were being torpedoed as they left the river, and the
hospitals were filled with horribly burned serien. I was anxious to do that I could,.
but I felt trat at my age there was little hope of taking an active part. I became an
Air Raid vardon, and helped sell some for Fonda, thought that was about all I
I
would be able to do.
Then the larine Corps came out with an announcement that commissions were open
in Aviation Intelligence to sen up to 45 years of ae.I saw the kecruiting officer,
azú ho recommended me for sich a commission. Nothing happened for cate tinc, so when
I was next in Washingtor on business I sent to Barine Corps Hondquarters and looked p
upColonel Halford, shom I had know in New Orleans,
He ascertained that Aviation Intelligence was filled up, but stated that he
would be glad to have ne in the Recruiting Divisior, and that I might transfer to
Aviation Intelligence later on. I was delighted to get into the Marine Corps, and
accopted a crissen as Captain on 8 September 1742.
After an indoctrination course at Quantico, Va., I was ordered to San Antonio,
Tex., as partetent recruiting officer. I púbined thire for three contin, duvoting
most of my time to the Student officer procurement program in the various Texas
colleges.
In December, 1947, the Wuring Corps, which had, prior to that time, been an
exclusively volunteer organization, was placed under the Selective Service System,
and Marine Corps Kondquarters decided to follow the end of the Navy and appoint
a Marine officer as to constate Salective Service Mondquarters. I dus one
of these appoiniod, and was ordered to Raleigh, N., on 12 January 1943.
.
The post at haloigh as one of sale imperianes scause of the large Marine Corps
hases at how liver, Cherry Point and Late, a ich over one hundred thousand
Varinès are in training, and at which construction and maintainence programo
involving several hundred millions of dollars were in operation. It was my duty to
supervise the induction of all North Carolina selecties who wore usɛigned, to the
Karine Corps through the Selective Service Statue, and to represent the various
Varine Corps installations in their dealings and disputes with local draft boards
concerning the deferment of about five thousand civilian mployees.
In eddition, I tock an eaxive part in the administration of the Selociivo
Service Headquarters in Raleigh and throughout the ciste, interviewing reģistrants,
their employers and dependente, edvising, local ara aspoal boards, setting up replace-
ment schedules for various inaltiries und passing on the merits of about oleven
thousand appeals.
mus
The work was interesting and productive, and living in Raleigh me certainly
"good duty", but I had never lost my desire for overseas duty and made two attempts
to transfer to Aviation, both of whieh sere uns. Then, in September 1944 I
beard that Marine Divisions overseas were badly in need of Legal Officers, and I
immediately applied for trenster. I was ordered to leadquarters for incontrination,
and, after a your of duty in the office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, I
was to Cup Lejeune in February 145 for further training. In April 1945 I sailed
from San Francisco, and in Pay I joined the Fourth Marine Division, Ileet Larine
Force, Nacific, at Neui, as Divisica legal Officer. I continued in that post until
the war ended and I procured a transfer to the insetive list.

Dear Mr. Camp:
I am today in receipt of your letter or

I was not in New Orleans at the time when
Mr. Clapp was here and accordingly did not
have the pleasure of seeing him.
I am sorry that Mr. Clapp did not succeed
in making contact with Mr. McBride. If I
happen to learn of a more recent address of
Mr. McBride, I shall pass the information on

in the capacity of liaison officer with Selective Service and
later, as legal officer with the Fourth Karine Division in the

DATE: SEP 15 1949
SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr. Willian Patrick Burke, Jr.
1
1. It is requested that the attached recommendation for
promotion of Mr. William P. Burke, Jr. from P-7 to P-B be approved
even though Mr. Burke has not served the required time in-grade
as established in Paragraph 4c of Administrative Instruction
No. 20-1. This recommendation is based upon the fact he has
served in his present capacity as Acting Chief, New Orleans Office,
100/C, for approximately one year and his performance of duty has been
outstanding.
2. Mr. Burke entered on duty as Acting Chief, New Orleans
Office, 00/C, on 9 September 1947 in which capacity he is still
serving. The position of Chief, New Orleans Office, has been
allocated as a P-8.
3. Subsequent to assuming his duties as Acting Chief of the
New Orleans Office, Mr. Burke displayed great initiative and
unusual ability in planning his organization and without any loss
of time, placed it on a highly productive basis. Mr. Burke has not
overlooked any possible sources of intelligence within his area, and is
submitting extremely valuable reports, particularly those that pertain
to Latin America. In addition, Mr. Burke's office has produced
comprehensive reports on the intelligence potentialities of Houston,
Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma, convincing this office that field offices
in both localities will be justified.
4. Mr. Burke's accomplishments as Acting Chief, New Orleans
Office have been outstanding. Due to his unusual leadership the
morale of his office personnel has been maintained at a high level,
despite heavy working conditions.
5. Mr. Burke received an A.B. degree from Loyola University,
New Orleans, in 1919 and LLB degrees from Harvard Law School and
Tulane University in 1923 and 1925 respectivaly. Ir. addition, he
spent one year of study at Cambridge University, England. Upon
graduation from law school, he became affiliated with various
prominent law firms in New Orleans, and in 1937 established his
own firm which he operated on a successful level until his entry
into the military service during World War II.
6. Mr. Burke has an outstanding military record, having
served approximately three years in the U. S. Marine Corps during
World War II, and being honorably released from duty with the rank

Dear Bill:
Prior to leaving CIA, I want to record my sincere
appreciation of the films jeb done by you in New Orleans.
Your achievement is all the sore noteworthy when it
is remembered that you started in your city singlehanded
and with little guidance or procedence. Within the space
of less than a year, you have created an effective field
office which is now making a significant contribution to
national intelligence.
Inspections reveal that your relations with the local
Armed Persons repursentatives no well ag with your alients
are excellent. Noted alsd is high morale in your
office.
Please accept my congratulations for this aplandid
record and accept my gratitude for your loyal support.
With beet wishes for your continued success,
Very sincerely.
