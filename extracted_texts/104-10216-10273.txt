1.
OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY
A.
Preparations were underway in early November to
dispatch AMTRUNK-13 to Madrid in mid-November to cement
the recruitment of AKTRUNK-19. These plans fell
through when the Madrid Station notified Headquarters
and WAVE that their workload would not allow sufficient
case officer time to handle AMTEUNK-13 in Madrid at this
time. WAVE agreed to postpone ANTRUNK-13's trip to
Madrid several weeks until Madrid Station's workload
abated somewhat.
B. The prospects of finalizing the recruitment of
ANTRUNK-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE
of another open letter from AMTRUNK-19, this one
mailed from Mexico City in mid-November. In ANTRUNK-19's
first letter, mailed from Montreal in mid-October, he
suggested using a friend in Mexico City as a cut-out to
initiate a channel of communications between himself and
AMTRUNK-13. In his second letter, AMTRUNK-19 stated
that he had made the necessary arrangements with his
friend in Mexico. Although WAVE, Headquarters and MEXI
traces on ANTRUNK-19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,
Nexico Station stated that IDEN A was well-known to one
of its PBRUMEN assets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties.
WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to ANTRUNK-19 in
AMTRUNK-13's handwriting to keep the channel with A-19
alive. ANTRUNK-19 appears eager to see AMTRUNK-13 again
and has stated in both letters that he has considerable
information to discuss in detail. It is well realized
that this open letter channel is far from ideal but it
is hoped that in early January 1965 ANTRUNK-13 can re-
contact AMTRUNK-19 and provide him with a system of S/.

4. PROJECTED PLANS
Primary tasks to be accomplished are the mounting of
Operation AMTRUNK X in early December, the dispatching of
AMTRUNK-13 to Madrid to finalize the recruitment of AKTEUNX-19,
and the staging of another contingent of HHAPRON recruiters for
infiltration in March 1965.

as well as debrief him thoroughly and levy PI and
KHAPRON requirements upon him.
C. In mid-November after the postponement of AMTRUNK-13's
Madrid trip, preparations began to launch Operation
AMTRUNK X in early Pecember. This operation would attempt
to re-organize the ratline to and from Havana and the
ANTRUNK infil area for the future use of infiltrated
MHAPRON recruiters and other agent assets as necessary.
Secondary objectives are to bring into the infil area
a cache of weapons and explosives for AMTRUNK-10/AMLASH-1
and to teach a system of S/W to one or more assets in the
area. The tean is to be composed of the same four individ-
uals who participated in Operation ANTRUNK IX in October
1964: AMAGREE-1, Team Leader; AHAKA-1, Radio Operator;
and AMTRUNK-16 and -20, Guides. It was decided to sheive
the V-20 as the Intermediate Craft (IC) for this opera-
tion and substitute a 17' Johnson boat with twin 75 hp.
outboard motors which could maneuver through shallower
water and which could be more easily canouflaged. The
basic reason for this decision was the fact that Decem-
ber through February are the low-water months in the
AMTRUNK operational area. During this shallow water
season, the heavier, wider V-20 can only be used in the
deeper and more heavily-guarded infiltration canals.
D. Through the combined efforts of AMICE-14, the AMTRUNK
P/A, and AMAGREE-1 and AMAKA-1, four radio operator
candidates, to be trained for future use in PM opura-
tions, were recruited during the reporting period.

Recruiting for MHAPRON infiltration candidates con-
tinued during the reporting period. One prospective
infiltree was recruited during the month of November
and the case officer was active in assessing and debrief-
ing two other candidates. It is hoped that by March 1965
one or more of these candidates will be trained and pre-
pared for infiltration for clandestine MILAPRON recruit-
ing. In large measure this will depend upon the success
of Operation AMTRUNK X in re-organizing the ratline to
and from Havana.

S/V Message No. 13 was sent to ANTRUNK-11 in response
to his Message No. 15 in which he stated that both OWVL
receivers were now in his possession. WAVE Message No.
13 to AMTHUNK-11 gave directions for the disposition of
the OWVL receivers and the activation of OWVL contact
with both AMTRUNK-11 and ANTRUNK–10.
