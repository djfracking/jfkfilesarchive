Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification

RECORD NUMBER :

RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER
December 8, 1995
S
Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 15
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 7
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.
Substitute Language: SSN
