SUBJECT
Request for Voluntary Retirement
Ony Vitale
This memorandum submits a recommendation for your
approval; this recommendation is contained in paragraph 4.
2. Mr. Guy Vitale, CS-08, Intelligence Analyst, Westora
Hemisphere Division, Clandestine Services, has applied for volun-! ^>
tary retirement under the provisions of Headquarters Regulation
20-50j, to be effective 28 February 1959.
3. Mr. Vitale has been designated a participant in the CIA
Retirement and Disability System and meets the technical require-
ments for voluntary retirement under the System. He is 51 years
old with over 28 years of Federal service. This service includes
over 21 years with the Agency of which 5 years were in qualifying
service. The Head of the Clandestine Services Career Service and
the CLA Retirement Board have recommended that his application for
voluntary retirement be approved. I endorse these recommendations.
4. It is recommanded that you approve the voluntary retirement
of Mr. Guy Vitale under the provisions of Headquarters Regulation 20-
50]..

THROUGH
: Head of D Curcer Service
SUBJECT
:
:
20 October 1965 -
Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System.
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employes
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici̟-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. Ny
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 66-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees".
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head-
quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questio
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case te formally
considered by the Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of
the date of this memorandum.

considerably in cutting down the size of the input backlog.
Mr. Vitale also continues to perform the Records Officers

necessary. In addition Mr. Vitale's valuable background

SECTION C/Continued
NARRATIVE COMMENTS
For approximately four months during 1967, Mr. Vitale
worked with me in providing Headquarters' support to JMWAVE
in its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such
a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,
requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable in (1) the preparation of operational proposals
for the 303 Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational
information periodically requested by the front offices of
both WH/COG and WHD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel
newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations. While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,
cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all
tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner. He always
expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary
to finish the task at hand. He has a very pleasant person-
ality, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits
a good sense of cost consciousness in the use of government
equipment and materials. The rating letter "S" most accurately
reflects the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the
period he was under my supervision.

Mr. Vitale, continues to perform his duties as an operational
support assistant capably. His background knowledge of Cuban
paramilitary operations has provided the Branch with very useful ·
continuity. His ability and experience in locating material and
in handling records for headquarters support to WH/COG Special
Operations contribute substantially to the Branch's operational
support effort. Mr. Vitale carries out his assigned duties in a
willing, loyal and highly dependable manner. He recently has been
given an additional assignment on the CUIS Machine Input Program
which he is handling in a highly efficient manner. He gets along
well with his colleagues and contributes to the smooth running of
the office. He does not have supervisory responsibilities, but
does show concern for officient and economical use of government
property.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING' OFFICIAL
As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but
must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a
more junior clerical type and that Mr. Vitale should not be considered
as performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a role
and his official position title should be changed to prevent any
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to
the Agency.

1.
> Mr. Vitale since he was assigned to metally on a part- '
time basis and later as a full time assistant has performed
adequately as an input analyst in addition to his proficient
work as a Records Officer and General support assistant. The
quality of his input has been good and his production has helped
considerably in cutting down the size of the input backlog.
Mr. Vitale also continues to perform the Records Officers
function for the branch with a sound knowledge of general records
procedures. His attitude and attendance record continue to
reflect a willingness to assist the branch in whatever way
necessary. In addition "Mr. Vitale's valuable background
knowledge on a former vital portion of the branch's effort
continues to be utilized to a considerable extent. He gets
along well with his colleagues and contributes to the smooth
running of the office.
Mr. Vitale is presently within 2 years of retirement or
4 years, if he does not receive an overseas assignment. He has
told the career panel, he would accept an overseas assignment
to either Vietnam or Laos. In view of his experience with
paramilitary operations, it is felt this would be a more fitting
assignment for him than the present one, even though he has been
performing quite satisfactorily.

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but I
must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a
more junior clerical type and that Mr. Vitale should not be considered
as performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a roie
and his official position title should be changed to prevent any
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to
the Agency.

During the past year subject has continued to be a most cooperative,
loyal and willing worker on a project that due to its nature is more
frustrating, and demands more with less apparent return than most
projects. As on his previous fitness report, I have rated him very
high, primarily due to the fact that he'd mature and many years ex-
perience with the Agency have made him of much more immediate value
than most of his colleagues in the GS 7-9 level. Consequently, although
he has made GS-8 within the past year, I feel he is still undergraded

He at all times has been a most cooperative, loyal and willing worker
with good security habits. Although, he does not have the ambition or drive
to get to the top of the ladder that many younger officers may have (not
everybody can or wants to be Chief, but can still be one of the best indians
in the business), his great store of general knowledge and many years of
agency experience have made him of much more immediate value than most of

has received such a high rating. Consequently, it is recommended that
Mr. Vitale be promoted to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.

ted his usefulness in the preparation of research paper's and the mainten
ance of files. Supervisor feels that Subject's productivity and effecti-

Section 3. Comments of Reviewing Official:
1
This employee had no qualifications for assignment in the German desk or
German operational field. He was carried in the German Branch in a
casual status while an assignment suitable to his talents was being located.
The fitness report for the period of his duty with the German Branch is
accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried
out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
