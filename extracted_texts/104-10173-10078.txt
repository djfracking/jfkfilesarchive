with the deak clerk, VASLOUCH/2 made a point of asking for hér
key which indicated her room number and the case officers were
therefore able to get rooms on the floor just below hers.

amount of time she could spend away from her unwitting travoling
companion.) As previously arranged, DI UBALDO went to the
Subject's hotel room at 0700 hours the next morning and brought

The facts developed on the second subject are as follows: For

several years VASLOUCH/2 had been contacted at the Brasilian
Embassy by Valentine S. LOĠUINOV, an attache at the Soviet
Rabsesy. These contests took place every two or three months
when LOGUIHOV would bring visa requests from his Embassy. The
last of these business contacts was in February of this year.
On 27 April, while VASIOUCH/2 was in Mexico City, LOGUINOV.
phoned the Brazilian Rebassy asking for VASLOUGH/2 and when
informed that she was not in, requested her home phone number
(mlisted) from the girl answering the phone, Hilda BOLIVAR
(girl friend of SANCHEZ). The girl refused to give out the
mmber. at 1000 on 1 May, LOGUINOV apparently having acquired
the gimber from the consular list, called VASLOUCH/2 at her
home only to be told that VASLOUCH/2 was working that morning
at the Bräsillan Rabassy. He finally got VASLOUCH/2 on the
telephone at 1600 houre and stated that the date was an

One thing that stayed in V/2's mind was that in conversation
with LOGUINOV he referred on three occasions to the possibility
that their daughter might very well marry a Russian, a point
that might relate to any operational approach LOGUINOV may
make to the VASLOUCHES. V/2 stated that LOGUINOV was the only
one that had ever come to the Brasilien Embassy regarding visas,
She also stated that over the past years she has called his
office four or five times regarding visse and has never been
able to reach him. V/2.also recalled that during their outing
at the Capri Restaurant LOGUINOV stated that he was planning to
rent a beach house and was looking forward to the VASLOUCHES
sponding time with him and his wife there during the summer
months. V/1 inquired as to the whereabouts of the former
PRAVDA correspondent, Borovsky, and was told he was in Moscow,

met with V/Z on 20 May, from 0700 - 0900 hours. At this meeting,
V/2 was given the KEYWAY sterile phone number and told that all
future contact should be made to Cline using this number,” She
was also given our initial assessment of the significance of
LOGUINOV's approach (the tracos' from Headquarters had still not
been received). In our opimba there were three possibi
and two of them were unlikely. First, LOGUINOV's approach
could be an innocent one and be merely for the purpose of
establishing a friendship, an extension of this thought would
be the possibility of his interesting in defecting. Given the
aga difference in the two couples and weighing other factors,
this was considered unlikely. The second possibility is that
the Soviets have been alerted, possibly by V/1's open_code
cable to Finland, to the SLOUCHES possible involvement with
the Americans. This also is unlikely for had this bom the easo
the last thing the Soviets would wish to do would be to alert

in Miami. Relating to this, V/2 stated to the C/C
that in one of V/1's meetings with COROMA of the Foreign Office,
CORONA stated that he was requesting Helsinki to raise the
status of its representation in Havana and to post a charge
there.. V/2 was told by the C/O that after checking with
Headquarters concerning LOCUINOV's background, specific guldanes
on how to handle the relationship would be forthcoming.
}
3. From SANCHEZ, V/i elicited road building information
which he had put on an overlay which was passed by V/2 (sent
to SAS Reports). SANCHEZ had invited V/1 to Oriente Province
with him in the near future to see some of his projects.
Reluctantly we instructed V/2 to tell V/1 to turn down the
invitation on grounds of ill health but to leave the way open
for a similar invitation in the future. It was thought that
this was best until we could assess LOGUINOV's interest in the
VASLOUCHES. V/2 also passed the war mamiss V/I had assigned to
his principaleontacts and a diagram of the Brazilian Embassy
including measurements of the out building which DI UBALDO had
discussed with V/2 in Mexico City relating to its possible usa
as a deed drop. A pamphlet eptitled, Liat of Exports and
Imports of Cuban Koralen Irade Bakerngines, also was passed.

She
was told that final guidance on this matter would be given her
at a subsequent meeting to be held in the afternoon after
DORKNOSE had received the Headquarters traces. The discussion
then went to the communications.
6. When the Subject stated that her husband was unable
to bring out either the pads or his instructions on how to use
the pads which had been given him in New York, it was decided
to issue two reduced size OTP's soncealed in a shaving kit,

The case officer was careful not to alarm V/2 and to convey that
har daughter's present plight had no relation to her intelligence
involvement with ODYOKE. On the contrary, she was very fortunate
to have us to advise her on how best to deal with her problem.
V/2 was concerned about her daughter because her daughter had
not socially with an OPACID officer in Hoscow named Richard
Jacobs who has sinus been png'd by the Soviete. When asked
about other contacts of her daughter's in Moscow she stated
that her daughter was in love with one of the UAR Embasay
secretaries who had left Moscow and was presently assigned in
Tokyo. She mentioned that another UAR secretary stationed in

Also a secretary of the Mexican Embassy named Areando CANTU.
She mentioned that during her scheduled fall visit to see her
daughter she had promised to take her daughter to Tokyo to
