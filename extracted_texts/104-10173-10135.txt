two tickets for the Bolshoy Ballet performance on 11 Juno.
Subject invited LOGINOV and his wife for dinner and LOGINOV

(P-10971). ORTIZ was Mexico's first Ambassador to Israel and is
rery pro-Israel. He recently retired from the Mexican Foreign
Service. His last job was Ambassador to Chile. Ho is 57 years
old and apparently a good friend of Subject's. Subject invited
ORTIZ: because he knew that LOGINOV has been interested in public
opinion in Mexico about the recent Israel-Arab war. Subject had
been only able to give LOGINOV the opinions of Mexican Jews and
he wanted LOGINOV to talk to
talk to a real Nexican. The dook was slightly,
loaded since Subject knew that ORTIZ is an Israeli partissa.
Subject purposely avoided the subject but it was not long before.
ORTIZ Baked LOGINOV about the Soviet position on the matter.
LOGINOV answered with a banality about the USSR only wanting peace.
ORTIZ then unloaded on LOGINOV for about half an hour He told
him that he had been in Israel as ambassador and had seen both
sides. If the Soviets wore interested in peace, why didn't they
help the miserable and diseased Arabs with medicine, hospitals,
Job training, agricultural aid, etc? This is what they need
not tanks and jets. The Soviets are the real aggressorn by
arming the Arabs and ogging them on And what fools the Sova
are since the Arabs will never learn to operate any equipment
much less sophisticated stuff. Soviet hypocrisy is obvious to
everybody FEDORENKO's performance at the UN was shameful, etc.
LOGINOV never answered a word. Subject later reported the above
to the Israeli Ambassador who was pleased since ORTIZ is not a
Jew and he is sure the above would be reported to Moscow.

her Spanish is extremely limited, she did not participate in
general conversation. However, she handled herself well and did
not seem in the least ill at ease. In a side conversation she
told Subject that they have a fifteen year old daughter who is
living with her mother. She said that she has known LOGINOV

that she is a chemical engineer.

Flores Tejada. I do not remember seing anybody from the US, but
I arrived somewhat late, Kai Somerto the ambassador from Finland
was present and so was the mayor general Natahn Aferi from Ghana,
the ambassador was most friendly as well as Jan Hant the commercial
counsellor and Jiri Stram Svestka the second secretory in

Next day we went to the Soviet embassy for the exhibition of
a fil whose title I think was the Father of the Soldier, a rather
childish film but that brought tears to the eyes of some of the
embassy wives who attended. There was an small group of people,

(201-285412)
1. Forwarded herewith is a Personality Assessment Questionnaire
on LOGINOV prepared by LIREALM-1 in February 1969.
2. By virtue of membership in the same club in which they are
both active participants in the same activity, LIREALM-1 has known
LOGINOV for a little over two years. In this club they have several
mutual contacts. As a result LIREALM-1 has met LOGINOV several times
at social activities in the homes of these contacts. Although LOGINOV
has never been a formal target for LIREALM-1, the relationship has
been close enough and of sufficient duration for LIREALM-1 to fill out
a meaningful Personality Assessment Questionnaire.

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
1. This is a new, experimental version of the Personality Assessment
Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ III) which has been in
use for several years. This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires
far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.
2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de-
veloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities. The
system employs in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations
of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are
used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are
weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile. Working from the
profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic
aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The goal of the assess-
ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.
3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete
this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fact,
it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are
encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking. Mark such
items with a "G," instead of the customary check mark or "X.” Thus, an
observer with very limited contact can be expected to enter more "G's"
'than "X's."

On Sunday 11 June, Valentin Loguinov was able to obtain for us
two good tickets for the Ballet Bolshoi at Bellas Artes and
afterwards we went to have something to eat at Lady Baltimore in
Madero Street. Very few people were there, which is not surprising
in view of the bad quality of their food and poor service. But
it was the nearest spot for a quick bite.
-
Loguinov was very much interested in knowing what my US
friends thought about the situation in the Middle East and what
they would do about it. He was insistent about the possible help
that the US would give to Israel, he said that the US had already
given Israel a considerable amount of ammunition and planes, and
specially money, the URSS had to give some help to the arabs in
view of the help given to Israel. According to him there was not
the slighest doubt that Israel had been the agressor. The URSS
would never consent to any territorial gains by Israel.
+
During our conversation about food, specially about seafood
he let it be know that he had been in Mazatlán several times.
/tha
He said that everything which had taken place in the Middle
East had been plotted in advance by the US and Israel.

A sensual eater who tends to eat by himself when possible.
He seems to eat all types of food and has something of the
air of a glutton about him. He eats with obvious pleasure,
savors his smokes and afterwards will linger alone at a table
with self-satisfaction. It is easy to imagine him hovering ·
alone over the buffet at a cocktail party savoring the tidbits.
+
A conventional eater who usually goes along with the crowd.
He probably has food allergies that prevent him from eating
certain foods. He gives the impression of enjoying smoking
more than eating but his table manners are adapted to what-
ever situation he is in. It is easy to imagine him taking an
indigestion pit in the privacy of his room.
L
A conventional eater who always goes along with the crowd.
He eats with little relish and rarely mentions anything about
his likes or dislikes. He smokes at every opportunity, but..
more mechanically than with pleasure. He usually tries to
adapt his manners to the situation but may be a little awkward
and òbvious in doing so. It is easy to imagine him grabbing a
bite at a sidewalk stand at any time of day.
A gourmet eater who has marked and varied sophisticated
food tastes. Dining is quite a ritual with him, and atmo-
sphere and service are almost as important as the food. He
is graceful and cultured at table and smokes in the same
manner. It is easy to imagine him dressing for dinner, en-
joying fine wines and food by candlelight.
An unconventional eater, a man who "eats like a bird."
He eats in a preoccupied way, obviously indifferent to
his food and surroundings. It would not be surprising to
learn he was a food faddist (vegetarian, health foods,
¨¨etc.).
None of these descriptions really fit.

LICOZY-B
3 June 1967
}
After a long hiatus, I called Subject on ca 14 May and
learned he was out of the country. I called him again on 6 June
and we made a date for 8 June. The meeting was in the breakfast
room of the Del Paseo Hotel from 0810 to 0915. The next meeting
is at the same place at 0830 on 15 June.
F
Subject was all excited about the Israel/Arab conflict
and we spent the best part of the meeting discussing it.
3. He said that LOGINOV called him on 5 June and pressed
for a luncheon date the same day. Subject put him off until 8 June.
LOGINOV wanted newn on the local Jewish reaction, was everybody
behind the Jews, was money being contributed, etc. Subject who
was sadder than hell about Soviet support of the Arabs gave him
holl and to direct questions got the admissions from LOGINOV
that the Israelis wore acting in self-defense and that the
Americans and British were not providing the Israelis air cover
LOGINOV mentioned that he would go to the USSR on home leave in
July.
-
4. On 6 June Miriam AVILA Kata, who is also very excited
about the war and who told Subject that she had gone to the
Israeli Embassy to volunteer to serve in Israel, told Subject
that when she returned home on the evening of 5 June, LOGINOV
was waiting for her on the street. His purpose was the same as
wanting to see Subject, to pump her on local reactions to the war.
She also gave LOGINOV hell.
5. She then told Subject that in Holy Week she had been
called to the American Embassy and had been asked about her contact
with LOGINOV. She said that she had seen the same American
(no name given) about two weeks ago. She then told Subject that
LOGINOV had asked her to introduce him to "one of her progressive
friends" or "someone in the U.8. Embassy" as a return for the
favor of insuing a visa to Dr. Yuriy KUTLER.
"
6. The above is a capsule account of her relationship with
LEVENDERIS. I played innocent until I got the whole story but
finally admitted that we had talked to her when he asked, "if it
wasn't you, who?" I told him that AVILA had notides that Subject
was in contact with us and had in fact worried that her activities
(future) might hurt him which she was definitely against.
7. It appears that AVILA told Subject about us because of
LOGINOV's appearance on 5 June and her emotional state about the
war.
I will discuss this further with Subject at the next meeting,
particularly what advice he has or will give her about cooperating
with us.

'
+
A hearty eater with well-defined preferences. He eats and smokes
with considerable gusto but tends to be a little on the coarse and
boorish side. It is rather easy to imagine him eating huge sand-
wiches and drinking beer with the boys at the neighborhood bar.
A heavy eater with limited preferences. He eats and smokes
with gusto but his manners are definitely coarse and boorish.
It is rather easy to imagine him becoming quite sharp with a
waiter who serves him unfamiliar fond or a dish prepared in
an unfamiliar way.
Á sensual eater who knows all the restaurants and their native
specialties. He is very anxious to have others try dishes he
has discovered. He eats with obvious pleasure, savors his
smokes, and though rarely gauche, he is more aware of his
food than his manners. It is easy to imagine him cooking and
serving special dishes to his friends.

A steady drinker who obviously enjoys being "tight.“´ In a way

ways remains quite dignified and usually maintains his poise:
even though others are becoming quite drunk or tight. He
still remains part of the crowd, however-that is, he gives
few signs of being disgusted or bored.
A light drinker who paces his drinks. He seems to drink only
because it is socially necessary. As a party progresses he
tends to become aloof and distant. Is likely to continue to

others. Often singles out and associates with someone
rather like himself. As the party progresses; he shows
obvious distaste for anything he considers crude or bois-

behavior..
A very light drinker who either drinks only because he
has to or refuses to drink at all. Is usually not really

Overall impression of driving and walking behavior:
(Check the most appropriate description.)
An active, alert individual with a purposeful stride who appears
"to have a very practical mind. He enjoys "fixing things," ap-
pears to have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in c
relaxed efficient manner.
An active individual who is somewhat standoffish (or negative)
toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to
have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and
_ is reluctant to share his possessions with others. He "fixes
things" in a matter-of-fact way, appears to have good know-
ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes
even hostile) but efficient manner.
▾
An active, alert individual with a free-and-easy stride who.
appears most of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tries
to fix things, but is often quite good at getting others to fix
things for him. He appears to have little knowledge of auto-
mobiles but drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.
An active individual who has a cautious tinge to his walk as
though he is easily embarrassed or easily startled. He appears
rather helpless and awkward when he has to "fix things." He
evidently has little knowledge of automobiles and drives in à
careful (sometimes tense) but efficient manner. ·
A well-controlled and attentive individual who walks in
something of a clipped, formal manner. Although generally.
practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must
read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."
He appears to have acquired considerable knowledge about
automobiles but drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly
controlled manner.
A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu-
pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he
does so with intensity and precision. He is often very well
read about automobiles and cares for his car or sees that it is
cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

A well-controlled individual who has a glide (or grace).in
his walk. He has little or no interest in "fixing things"
but usually knows the best places to get things done and is
inclined to be quite particular in how things are done för
him. He appears to have relatively little knowledge of
the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and takes
good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence
but usually at a fast pace with not too much awareness of
others.
A rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rap-
idly and rather awkwardly. He has little or no interest in

He is a good-humored fellow who sometimes can be considered
jolly and carefree. His humor is clever and well timed. He is
quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and often
can do a good job appropriately livening up a party. Although
something of a tease, he is never cruel or insensitive.
He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person
who, at times, can be surprisingly gay and carefree. However,
when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and causes some strain for
those around him. His humor is often clever but he can be
quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.
-
He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-
priate. He does not necessarily appear to be a humorless person,
but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-
cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way..
he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied.
than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.
He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense
It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-
sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.
He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with a subtle wit. He'
can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.
However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his
sense of humor and he can be quite condescending towards
people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.
-
He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who can be quite
flippant at times. His humor tends to be a bit far out. He
seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is
sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing.or
subtly hostile.
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

Overall impression: Which of the following best describes him?
He is an earthy, lusty man who shows little embarrassment about
sex. He treats women appropriately, but makes little effort to
conceal his admiration and attraction. He appears virile and
self-confident with women, and most women seem to like it.
He is an earthy, Justy man who on occasion can be crude or
even vulgar. He treats women rather harshly, und can become
quite pushy, when attracted to a woman. He seems to be very
proud of his virility, Many women would be offended or re-
buffed by his aggressiveness, but this does not seem to bother
him.

He is a somewhat sensual, rather soft man who is very consid-
erate of women. He is prone to hold a woman's hand overly
long when talking to her and frequently puts his arms around
women he admires. He often uses flattery and compliments
but does so rather graciously. Most women usually like his
attentiveness..
1
"He is a sensual person, but is embarrassed and insecure about
it. He is a rather soft man who tries hard to be inoffensive.
However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his
eyes when he thinks no one is looking. He is also prone to
brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets
a chance.
He is a self-confident, rather polished person who is proper
and conventional with either men or women. He is always
considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to
ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.
In a group, he always behaves according to protocol and
usually can be quite efficient in doing so.
He is a self-confident and precise person who has something
of the air of a professional man about him. He is polite,
almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to
light a woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken
care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in
his relations with women. Sometimes his formality is out
of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners
or procedures to fit the situation.
He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly and
sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way
but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness .
He is neat, even dapper, and can be quite fastidious.
Most of his relations with women appear to be quite pla-
tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several
very close friends who are women.
He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some
people consider odd or unusual. He shows little or no
interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc
cupied person who only seeks out people with similar
interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him
most of the time.
None of these fit. I would describe him as:

a. Re SOSWIRL
As requested at last meet BESARER gurned
in bio data on girlfriend he had talked to 8GSWIRL operator about.
(See attached note from operator). No traces. He will turn in
at next meet his version of what he told her. He is most upset
by this matter, particularly since I had told him that Headquarters
wanted to drop him. I reiteroated that he was on probation.
CHMYKHOV and LOGINOV
(P-6235)
(P-11712)
:
1). On 20 May CHMYKHOV and LOGINOV arrived at
BESABER's plant at about 1400. L was driving a brownish Chevy
Impala, 34-DA. L was interested in seeing the house that BESĀBER
had located for the Sovietė. He said they wanted a house for
three, possibly four months (starting 1 June) and could easily
spend up to $6,000 MN per month.
i
2) BESABER could not leave the plant, but put them
in touch with a Sra. LARA who took them around to seven housen,
one of which they liked. They returned to BESABER's plant at
about 1700, sat around for about an hour, leaving because they
said the couriers were coming in that night and they had a lot
of work to do. (Couriers did arrive that night).
3).
=
CHMYKEOV drank heavily (scotch) but did not
show any effect; LOGINOV didn't even finish one Scotch and water.
4). L said he would probably return to Cuernavaca in
& few days to sign the lease on the house and would look BESABER
up. BESABER told L that he had a friend with a tennis court and
in a few weeks when the friend returned to Mexico he (BESABER) would
arrange a day of tennis.
5). L did˝most of the talking although C was pleasant,
told a number of good jokes (in poor Spanish) and generally impressed
DESABER as boings pleasant type, not "pesado," as he assesses L.
Re COIGNE's request and as a follow-up to LIKAYAK/3's
report of 28 April 1967 re Lorenzo CARDENAS (P-5409), I asked
"BESABER if he knew of a house of prostitution at Dr. Manuel
Ugarte 103 A. He did not, but will check it out through the
doormen of several hotels.

On 29 January 1969, Samuel J. KARTASUK met with Subject to
deliver the recruitment pitch as advised by Refs.
refused to cooperate on the grounds that he does not want to get
Subject initially
involved in this type of business and that he had given the same
answer to "the other side." He readily admitted that he has been
under intensive development by Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412) to spot
Mexican students who eventually may go to WOLADY; he denied, however,
that he has ever accepted the money LOGINOY continually offers him.
Subject volunteered that Yuriy CHERNYSH (201-825743) is currently
developing one of Subject's students (which we knew), and that Subject
would like to foil CHERNYSH's attempt.
In spite of Subject's expressions of reluctance to be recruit.
he answered a number of questions put to him by KARTASUK and he
agreed to a follow-up meeting on 7 February. At that meeting, he
submitted to more intensive questioning about his background, family,
and his association with the FJSTEAL community. There were no attempts
at evasion and many of his answers were corroborated by information
that was already known from other sources. Subject agreed to continue
meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional
information on his contacts with LOGINOV and other members of the KGB.
3. Subject's activities immediately following the pitch were
monitored closely by LIEMBRACE and by LIFEAT for the week between the
two meetings. The second
The second meeting was counter-surveilled with negative

results. Although the recruitment is still tenuous, we believe that.
it can be firmly cemented and that Subject is committed whether or
not he is ready to admit it to himself at this point.

Il. KARTASUK believes there is a reasonably good possibility
that subject would consent to recruitment; if the approach wore made
in such a way as to make him believe that he is working against
FJSTEAL intelligence meddling and not against the FJSTKAL people and
system. Additionally, we believe it may be possible to introduce
stability into Subject's life, to give his firm direction and goals,
and to turn some of his liabilities into assets.
.12. Following successful recruitment by KARTASUK, the case will
be handled by an inside case officer so that developments can be
monitored more closely through other assets and the risk reduced.

Summary.
-
1. As reported by Ref A, Samuel J. KARTASUK succeeded in meeting
with Subject in Acapulco and in spending nearly a full week with him
for the purpose of establishing rapport and assessing him for possible
recruitment per Ref B. Assessment by both KARTASUK and LIOVAL-1
indicates that Subject is essentially apolitical with attitudes-20
that he could
pro-Vēst as pro-Soviet. KARTASUK believes, however
be recruited to work against FJ8TKAL intelligence if he were made to
believe that he is not working against the FJSTEAL people.
2. Recent LIFKAT reveals that Subject is having marital problems
and that he consented to see´à psychiatrist after his wife made good
her threats to leave. According to Subject, he was diagnosed as
"paychopathic" with problema stemming from his mother's possessive
attitude. The character assessment by KARTASUK agrees with that of
LIOVAL 1 but neither has called Subject "psychopathic."
$
While wo recognize possible problems, we feel that a
recruitment attempt should be made by KARTASUK. Following the
recruitment we plan to have KARTASUK sover further relationship with
Subject and to handle the case from inside where it can be monitored
more closely.

years, and for WOLADY, where he would like to live. He believes that

WOLADY citizens want peace and are basically good but that both are
victims of their political systems. Although Subject wanted at one

scruples in regard to marital fidelity and, while his wife isnot
happy with his affairs, they have apparently arrived at some sort of
working agreement on the subject.

Subject has told both KARTASUX and LIOVAL-1 that he earns
about $4000. (MN) per month and is, therefore, forced to live on a
modest scale. While he would like to live better, he is not ambitious

✓
Subject would find easy money a great temptation, that Subject could
be influenced fairly easily, and that principles would not stand in
his way.
9. With KARTASUK, Subject spoke of his mother on several occasions.
He accuses her ofpossessiveness and claims that it is for this reason
that he rebels against anyone's possessing him, including his wife.
This problem is apparently genuine as confirmed by LIFEAT in recent
Stake.
Subject consented to psychiatric treatment when his wife made
good her threat to leave him (though she returned after several days).
Per LIFEAT, Subject said that he has been diagnosed as psychopathic
and that the paychiatrist lays the blame at his mother's feet.

L
Conclusions
▸
10. LIOVAL-1 has assessed Subject since early March 1968 and
KARTASUK assessed him during a week of uninterrupted close association.
Both assessments are virtually identical in all major respects. There
is little doubt that Subject does, indeed, have some personality
adjustment problems and that, if he is recruited, he will require firm
handling. Neither KARTASUK nor LIOVAL-1, however, describes Subject
as "psychopathic."

1. My last meeting with Subject was on 23 March, at
which time she agreed to provide information on LOGINOV
obtained during their normal business contact and any further
social contact initiated by him. She was to call mé after
their next date or any other significant contact she had with
him. Since I had not heard from her, I called her at her
apartment about 2115 on 11 May. I apologized for calling so
late, but said I had just got out of work and had a package.
for her I had brought back from the States which I wanted
to deliver before the contents got stale. Could I drop over
that night or perhaps another evening. Subject immediately
recognized the "package" as the Benson and Hedges cigarettes
I had promised her, gently protested, and then told me she
was not feeling well, but the doctor had told her she had
to eat, and it so happened she was just going out for a bito
when I called. I consequently suggested we have dinner together,
which we did from 2145-1215 at the Gondola. Afterwards, wo
went around the corner to her apartment for a nightcap until

purposes with Jorge *ARIAS Buerba, a teacher at the Mexican
North American Cultural Institute in Mexico City. The Soviets
have long had an interest in the Institute and its personnel
because most of newly arrived Americans study Spanish there
GAZIYEV has attended the Institute since his arrival in Mexico,

6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was
probably talking about Subject, since:
(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North
American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had
GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted
"
with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject
an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although
Subject told me he had not gone).
(b) Subject had gotten married that month.

7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had

but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was
developing into something more than occasional chats between
classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject,
before this with the idea of having him deliberately
cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject was living

I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been
talking about someone else over the phone or that they had
never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.

10. On 1 November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother
Javior in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a
quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and
would like my advice. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience;
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to
ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in
El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security.
department" about his predicament. What did I think he should
do?
11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a
"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know
how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S.
Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of

kept informed to some extent about Subject through his younger
↳
brother, Javier ARIAS Buerba, from whom I have been taking
Spanish lessons since July 1967.
3. Subject was a casual contact of Station officer Olivia
C. RAGNITY in 1965 and 1966. Other than a file card noting
this contact,
to Station traces on either Jorge or
Javier ARIAS Buerga.
4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly
and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a
friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically,
he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths
}
and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative
factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political
Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union.
i
We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong
anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in
the United States. The brother is married to an American and
lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business.
One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in
California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.
The sister in California is a naturalized American citizen. The
brother and the sister in Chicago are not.
5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call
from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:
GAZ "I saw him, he arrived yesterday.”

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Embassy
refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't
i
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.
After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
States to study sometime; and they might even want to go to
the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very
serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy
department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had
told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.

invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was
now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartment
twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said
that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
(Subject) got married (Subject was married about mid-April
1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he
and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. Subject finished
Reating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had
his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another

time.
13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our
home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did
not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.
Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the
7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by
assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he
felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embassy
altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for
lunch sometime in the near future.
14. For various reasons, including the poor state of
Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did
not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, It
I:
played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisfied he answered
my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and
still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject.
had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on
1 November (1.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and
on one occasion had met another Soviet there).. This was that
he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting
the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too
hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable
ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits
and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was
genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to
impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and
felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the
visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.
15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
=
tä
apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went
Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place
about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find
only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third.
person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV
introduced the third person as Valentin "something." When I
asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted
and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description
of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was
with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and
described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually, with LOGI NOV expressing interest
+
in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.
LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject: if
he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to
start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although
it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.
LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject

with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to feel Subject out
on his political rows. Subject said that he couldn't remember.
views,
most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory
remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
"100% capitalist, " completely pro-American, and had absolutely
no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt
and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be *** a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,
I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
said that LOGI NOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda.”
16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics
were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out
of him. Prior to his marriage, he was keeping such a hectic
schedule botween his Institute and private classes that he
wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing
problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
job with the American School (although he gave up most of his
private classes).
8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's
relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number
of reasons, however--including my going to the States in June--
we were not able to get together until 11 July.
til 11 July. On that date
I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little
Spanish restaurant downtown.
9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would
voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had
developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation
around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV
was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,
as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that
they never talked politics. In reply to an offhand question
about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV,

thoughts in the seven weeks since she had agreed to cooperate,
but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from the
start, was very friendly, and seemed to onjoy the opportunity
to get out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't
go out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading,
listening to records, tending to her dwarf trees, etc.) She
made it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind
1
by werning me half-seriously and half-playfully that I shouldn't
think I could "buy" her with gifts. "You've bought me up here,"
she said, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That's

the only way you'll get anywhere with me.' Most of the evening
was spent in general and (especially back at her apartment)
increasingly fuzzy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her job,
the Russians "as people," her very humanistic philosophy about

a smart girl, but I think less profound and sophisticated than

person, and she has given me no reason to doubt or suspect
anything she has told me

3. Contact with LOGINOV. Subject said she hadn't been
out with LOGINOV since our last meeting and had had only one
face-to-face contact with him. She said this was a little
over a month ago (early April) and was occasioned by her
efforts to help a client by the name of Dr. Yury KUTTLER get
Soviet visa. She Said KUTTLER is & dentist and definitely
à Communist sympathizer, if not a Communist. (KUTTLER has

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's
activities and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said
that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself
i
at the Institute and did not have any particular friends there
whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes
open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would
let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to" GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance
if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions
of appreciation.
19. The question that remmins unanswered after all this is,
of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject
1.
over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while
!
LOGI NOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took
place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the
truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV
told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV
concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-
Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on
24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that
GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife
over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase.
the memory of the first dinner.

Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him,
on the whole kept his composure very well and treated Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject
was leaving, LOGINOV again said he'd come by the Institute to
me Subject in the near future, but he novor did. “One day in
late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by
name.
However, they did not converse with each other.

related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject
returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in

others present, and the evening passed without any reference-
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes

Valentin LOGINOV (201-285412): Assigned to the
Soviet Embassy in Havana several years ago. He pursued..
AMSLOUCH/3 (daughter of AMSLOUCHes 1 and 2): when stationed
in Havana, and later in Moscow. AMSLOUCH/1 described
LOGINOV as a rough peasant type. AMSLOUCH/1 when in Mexico
about a year ago was looking at the Mexico Diplomatic List
and noticed that a LOGINOV was assigned to Mexico.
AMSLOUCH/1 asked a girl working at a foreign consulate in
Mexico (identity) if this was the same LOGINOV who had been
stationed in Cuba. The girl replied in the affirmative, and
stated the LOGINOV worked in the Soviet Consulate handling
business dealings between her consulate and the Soviet
Consulate. The girl described LOGINOV as "a very nice
fellow."

terminated we assume Subject is exploring new areas against the
LIOGLE/LIRELIC target and we would appreciate advice on this.

We recognize that very often one-time tasks, spotting,
and research are performed by agents in the field without
Headquarters' specific knowledge. : Increased reporting on this
kind of activity, which is valuable and necessary even though
much of it may lead to dead ends, would give us a better under-
standing than we now have of the contribution which LIREALN-1-
is making to the Station. Headquarters appreciates the opera-
tional reporting which the Station has been providing on LIREALM–1
and urges that it be continued on the same frequent basis.

Russians in return, as he initially told Subject he was expecting
an official Soviet invitation to visit the USSR. As it turned
out, however, he had a nara time even getting a Soviet visa.
Subject finally called LOGINOV herself to try to push things
along, but LOGINOV showed no willingness to facilitate things.
(LIENVOY has Subject on the phone to LOGINOV on 5 April.
After discussing KUTTLER's case, Subject remarked to LOGINOV
that she understood that "you (ustedes) must have some reason
not to want to give him (KUTTLER) the visa." LOGINOV replied
that there were "reasons enough.")
4. A day or two after her telephone conversation with LOGINOV,
Subject said she went over to the Soviet Embassy personally to
see if she could get anywhere with LOGINOV. LOGINOV received
her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his
office (she said it was the first office off the outside
Reception Room). She again asked LOGINOV to try to sim
speed up the granting of KUTTLER's visa. LOGINOV hemmed and
hawed, indicating that he wasn't even sure the visa would be
granted. He finally told Subject that look, he had gone to
KUTTLER for dental work once, and XUTTLER had charged
him much
too much. Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to give him
a visa. Subject said she could not tell if the destist bill
was the real reason for LOGINOV's negative attitude, but when
she persisted; LOGINOV finally relented and the following
exchange ensued;

1. Headquarters has carefully considered the case of
LIREAL!-1 from the standpoint of rafiifications of the con-
promise of January 1968 and of his operational utilization
by the Statión. With regard to the compromise, Headquarters
tends to believe that the damage done by that occurrence is
somewhat greater than the Station estimites. It is obvious,
however, that no one how or probably even in the future can
arrive at a hard estimate of the degree to which LINEAL:1-1
was blown. We can all agree and must assume that he has
been compromised to some degree. The minimum degree of con-
promise would presumably be a listing of LIANALM1-1's name
in local Soviet files, and presumably also in the Moscow
hearquarters central registry, as "possible A. I. S." While
such a label is unfortunate, could affect future assignments,
and will limit his sphere of activity in Mexico, there remains
a wide area of operations in which he can be employed. The
Mexican authorities are, to the best of our knowledge, unaware

the unfortunate flap, we feel that he can continue to be of
service at his present post. In spite of the obvious special
need for a more careful weighing of operational risk versus
gain factors (even more important here than in the case of
the usual presumably "clean" non-official agent), we feel that
neither the flap nor his LPOLODE status should inhibit the
Station in the energetic use of his not inconsiderable talents.
Headquarters can appreciate the necessarily slow pace of the
developmental activity to which he has been assigned, as well
both of which
as the required alterations of his targets
factors have been largely beyond Station control.

The purpose of this dispatch is to provide Headquarters
with additional information requested in reference B in the
hope that it will assist the interested components in formu-
lating a clearer picture of the reference A incident. The
Station has consulted at length with Wallace B. ROWTON on the
details that are provided below as well as, of course, with
LIREALM-1 himself.

First, with regard to paragraph 2b of reference B, a
fuller account of the FRADYER/ROWTON/LIREALM-1 meeting at
Sanborns will, it is felt, shed more light on the impressions
that Headquarters had formed of the probable identification of
ROWTON as LIREALM-1's "boss." The following chronological
account has been prepared by ROWTON from his reports and memory
in consultation with LIREALM-1 (the numbers in the left margin
refer to the time at which the events mentioned below took
place):
1610
(January 16) LIREALM-1 met with ROWTON at the
latter's home as planned. ROWTON informed
LIREALM-1, much to the latter's disappointment,
that unfortunately he had not as yet received
the reimbursement for operational expenses
($2,357.35 MN) requested by LIREALM-1 on
10 January 1968, nor had he received from the

of using a contact which LIRELIC-1 had with a PBRUMEN citizen

citizen owns a small hotel in the Mexican resort occasionally
visited by LIRING personnel. Although LIRELIC-1 himself once
delivered a package sent by his Acapulco friend and managed to
have one or two meetings with representatives of the LIRING
Commercial Section (to discuss the possibility of "trading"
with PBRUMEN), it was decided in the end that LIRELIC-1's
access to LIRING was too superficial to be of any great benefit.
This decision was bolstered by the departure, for PBRUMEN in
April 1968 of LIRELIC-1's PBRUMEN friend, who left for what
appears to be an extended visit to try to solve complicated
personal problems. Thus, with the "shelving" of possible
operational activities against LIRING, LIOGLE became LIRELIC-1's
only target in April of this year.

Unlike his contacts with the French, LIREALM-1's
dealings with LIRELIC-1 have been completely clandestine.
LIREALM-1 meets LIRELIC-1 under alias in out of the way
restaurants and other public places. A drop constituted by a
P. O, box rented by LIRELIC-1 under alias (to which both he --

and LIREALM-1 have keys) was set up for LIREALN-1 to receive
operational messages.

References D and E reviewed an incident which occurred
on 16 January and had a direct bearing on LIREALN-1's security.
It is the opinion of this Station that the person who saw

that this person could not have been Valentin Sergeyevich
LOGINOV, who claimed to have observed the meeting. Reference E
pointed out that before joining the PBRUMEN Section in October
1967 LIREALM-1 had for some time interested himself in the
activities of the Soviets at Station request. He first made
contact with LOGINOV, for example, in April 1967 and met with
him on the average of once a week until October 1967.
Reference E also pointed out that LIREALM-1 only had four
meetings with the Soviet from October 1967 to January 1968.
The Station wants to emphasize once more that these were all
at LOGINOV's initiative. LIREALM-1 had discontinued his efforts
to maintain contact with the Soviet at Station's directive.
As pointed out above, one of the main targets now handled by
LIREALM-1 is the French. One of the best places to meet
Frenchmen is the French Club. Station would be very reluctant
to have LIREALM-1, a long-time member of that club, terminate
his membership. Neither does the Station want him to be too.

does not believe, knowing what it knows of LOGINOV, that

security and believes that he can continue to provide valuable
services to this Station.

2. LIREALM-1's efforts against the local Fronch target
have produced some notable results. First, through detailed
analysis of personality and other data provided by LIREALM-1,
the Station selected an access agent to the official French
community who was later successfully contacted and was offered
a contract (see reference C). The Station is already at work
on what appears to be a good lead provided by the access
agent spotted and developed by LIREALM-1. It should be
emphasized that LIREALM-1 was in no way connected with the
approach made to the French access agent. The second item
on which LIREALM-1 has made progress has been the development
of a Mexican employee of the French Embassy who is used as a
general courier inside the Embassy. This development, for
security reasons, has been slow. LIREALM-1's "line" has been
that a person with "the ability" of the courier can and
should expect a better paying job than the one he currently
holds. The courier onded up taking that line as his own to
"protect" him (as ho probably would have some trouble if the
· Embassy discovered he was looking for another job). LIREALM-1.

at some length without attracting the attention of the members
of the Embassy. This is as far as the Station will allow
LIREALM-1 to go in this case, which is currently boing reviewed.
to decide who will continue the development of the Embassy
courier and how. LIREALM-1 will not, in any case, have any
connection with the person selected for this task. He will
continue to maintain contact with the courier but will start
to see him less often and will admit, in the end, that finding
a job for him turned out to be more difficult than expected.
"
3. LIREALM-1 meanwhile is continuing to cultivate a
number of selected members of the French Embassy and reports
on their activities as a matter of routine. He has also
maintained contact for some months with a wealthy Mexican
businessman who is a good friend of DEVOSJOLY, the ex-French
intelligence officer who provided the material for Leon URIS'
best seller Topaz. LIREALM-1, in fact, had established
DEVOSJOLY's identity as coauthor of the book long before this
became known publicly. He was shown by DEVOSJOLY's friend a
safe at the latter's house in Mexico City full of documents
probably belonging to DEVOSJOLY. This information was reported
to. Headquarters via "special" channels.

4. LIREALM-1's handling of LIRELIC-1 encompasses two
targets. By far the more important one is LIOGLE. The goal
here is hopefully to turn LIRELIC-1 into a penetration of
LIOGLE using several good contacts he has in this organization
as a stepping stone. Some steps have been taken in this
direction. LIRELIC-1 has addressed personal requests for
-assistance to current key LIOGLE personalities. He has also
submitted his curriculum vitae in the hope of landing a job
in LIOGLE. This has so far failed to produce any concrete
LIOGLE job offer. LIRELIC-1 realizes, of course, that he is
of no value to LNHARP unless he obtains a job giving him access
to hard information on LIOGLE plans and activities.
The
promise of a regular salary, as a matter of fact, is completely
dependent on LIRELIC-l's ability to penetrate LIOGLE.
effort to maintain interim contact, however, and help LIRELIC-1
liquidate some personal debts, the Station, via LIREALM-1,
made him a loan of 3,000 pesos. Further details on the LIOGLE
aspects of the LIRELIC-1 operation will be covered in the
forthcoming LIOGLE/LIRELIC progress report.

made to FRADYER by ROWTON and an equally hasty decision taken
by FRADY ER on the spot. ROWTON and LIREALM-1 had met previously
only in ROWTON's home, except on two occasions when ROWTON
picked up LIREALM-1 in his car in the Ciudad Deportes (near
the main Mexico City bull ring) between regular meetings to
pass him funds. ROWTON- had never met with LIREALM-1 at

With regard to where and how often ROWTON and
LIREALM-1 have had operational mootings in the past, as
requested in paragraph 3 of reference B, Station files show
that between 20 October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met
with LIREALM-1 at his home ten times. Besides these meetings
with LIREALM-1 at his home, ROWTON recalls only two other moetings

possible positive identification of ROWTON in the event

The only telephone contact that has existed between them has

With regard to the frequency of LÍREALM-1's meetings
with LOGINOY, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B,
LIREALM-1's contact reports list only four meetings during
the same period, all of which occurred at the French Club, and
one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at

complicated by the character and modus operandi of LOGINOV,
as well as the limitations of LIREALM-1's cover situation at
the time...
8. A principal dilemma facing the Case Officer with
regard to LIREALM-1's exposure to the Soviets has been his
regular attendance at the French Club. Since the French target
has been one of the main ones left to LIREALM-1 after the
elimination of the Soviet, Indonesian, and UAR operations, it
was considered necessary for LIREALM-1 to continue his normal
contacts with the French. He could have dropped his membership
in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soviets,
but this would have broken a long-established pattern and

therefore ruled out as counterproductive.
9. Subsequent developments appear to confirm the
Station's view that LOGINOV based his provocative remark on
a hunch or, at most, on a strong suspicion concerning
LIREALM-1. As mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B, such
prolonged social contact between an American and a Soviet
"is almost inevitably construed on both sides to have intel-
ligence connotations." The Station wishes to emphasize,
however, that whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind
of LOGINOV concerning LIREALM-1 were already generated months
before he joined the PBRUMEN Section in late October 1967.
10:
In conclusion, the Station feels that nothing has
been noted in the subsequent operational activity of FRADYER
or ROWTON to indicate that either of them has been identified..
as an intelligence operative. ROWTON has had no contact of any
kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any
surveillance, either physical or technical, of his person
or home. Both he and FRADYER, however, will continue to
maintain maximum security to avoid any further exposure to
such persons as LOGINOV. LIREALM-1, on his part, has been
able to improve his cover by opening an office and making his
overt activity as plausibly commercial as possible.

concern
1. Reference caused deep concern in Headquarters
which we know you share. To hold any agent meetings in that
particular Sanborn Cafeteria is unorthodox enough, but to meet there
with someone in the category of LIBERI/1, whose cover is of special
importance, suggests an unawareness or disdain of basic operational
security which merits reprimand.

"
2. We appreciate your candid account of the LIREAL!/1-LOCINOV
episode, and have several comments to make:
a. Why LOGINOV would have said, "I saw you talking with
your boss the other day" we do not know, but the fact that he made
such a banal remark with a slight prin certainly implies that ho did
not have ordinary commercial business in mind.
b. In the context of the dispatch it sounds rather as
though LOGINOV was referring to moeting between LIREME/1 and one
other man, not two, in which case it was probably NOWTON and not
FRADYER when he identified as the bess. (/o assume that NONTON and
LINEALL/1 had been together in the downstairs cafetoria before the
brush meeting with FRADYER took place, but this may be incorrect.)
.
3. In order to shed some additional light on the mattor, we
would like to know even more about this particular Wednesday meeting
and the pattern of meetings which have preceded and followed it.
Were RONTON and LIREALM/1 meeting together in the bar or cafeteria?
What was the appearance of the later three-way, fifteen-minute
conversation upstairs in the silver shop (1.c.) casual, serious,
intenso, sotto-voce, conspiratorial? Was any pretense made of
"shopping"?) Our feeling is that ROTTON is as much compromised as

1. Since joining the staff of the PBRUMEN Section of
this Station in October 1967, LIREALM-1 has been handled by
Wallace B. ROWTON under the over-all supervision of the
undersigned. His three main activities have been 1) to.
handle LIRELIC-1, an asset who we hope will turn into a
penetration of the Mexican PRI, 2) to continue to develop
rapport with and report on the local official French community,
and 3) to determine the degree to which LIRELIC-1 can develop
access to LIRING and its personnel. LIREALM-1 has continuéd
to see a number of contacts he had developed before joining
the PBRUMEN Section, either at Station directive or by social
encounter. One of these contacts has long been Valentin
Sergeyevich LOGINOV, Second Secretary of the Soviot Embassy
and known KGB officer whom LIREALM-1 first ran into while
playing tennis at the French Club, where both LIREALM-1 and
LOGINOV are members. Station soveral times asked LIREALM-1
to break contact with LOGINOV, but this has not been possible
since LIREALM-1's continued membership at the French Club
is desired for operational reasons and LOGINOV, who probably
joined the club for similar reasons, has continued to be one
of its active members.

LIREAL:1/1, but in ROWTO's case the lens is less because of accepted
risks in his style of operating and since we have always assumed that
his cover was thin
what is important to know in this case is
where and how often ROWTON and LIREL/1 have had operational meetings
in the past. Considering this we had assumed the RCWTON-LINEALN/I
Lectings were truly clandestine.

4. Another point to be resolved is the frequency of: LIREAL:!/1's

meetings with LCGINOV
games were a frequent occurrence, although LIRTAL:1/1 had been told
almost a year ago to break contact. Even if these meetings could not
have been avoided as the Station claims, why were they not
reported? The issue takes on even added significance as we understood.
the Station and leadquarters had been in agreement for some time
that LIREAL!/1 was to avoid any continuing contact with Soviets.
Hindsight in this case certainly proves the correctness of the carlier
judgment. (Experience shows that prolonged social contact betwcon
an American and a Soviet is almost inevitably construed on both
sides, and with reason, to have an intelligence connotation.)
5. The fact that LOGINOY did not mention the Sanborn's meeting
to FRADYER can hardly be read to mean that LIREALM/1 is clean in
LOGINOV's eyes, although FRIDYER would naturally have been anxious to
see what, if anything, would happen when he next saw LOGINOV. face
to face. It is true that we have no evidence that LINEALM/1 has been
"definitely branded as a WOFI operator" but if he is oven highly
suspect there is still cause for deep concern.
6.
Various levels and components at Headquarters are trying to
evaluate and debate this episode, and we would like to have your
recommendations as an aid to our decision. From the few facts that
we have we believe we must proceed under the assumption that LIREALM/1
is suspect or possibly compromised in the eyes of the Soviets.
Accepting this, do you consider LIREAL"/1 has further utility in
Mexico? If so, we would like your views as to his proposed targets
and handling procedures. After receiving further details as
requested in paragraph 3 and your recommendations, Headquarters will
advise you its decision.
7. Wo recognize the Station is as disturbed about this breach
of basic operational judgment as Headquarters and do not wish to
belabor the point. We trust however that this experience will be a
lesson well learned and that in the future the Station's clandestine
operational procedures will be truly clandestine and professional
in style for all of the Station activities, not just LIREALM/1.

The undersigned reported the above to his superiors
as soon as he received LIREALM-1's report. A check of the
LIEMPTY log for 17 January showed that LOGINOV had left the
Sovict Embassy at 1404 and had returned at 1708 hours. This
mado his presence at Sanborns at the time of the meeting
between LIREALM-1, ROWTON, and the undersigned impossible,
as it would have given him about 10 minutes to leave the site
of the mooting, get into his car, and drive to the Soviet
Embassy, an impossible feat even in light traffic. It is
clear thon that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the
meeting but was told that LIREALM-1 met with two Americans.
It was and still is the undersigned's conviction that whoever
saw LIREALM-1 was unable to positively identify ROWTON or
tho undersigned. The undersigned reasons that had LOGINOV
known that ho, the undersigned, had talked to LIREALM-1,
LOGINOV would have mentioned his name after failing to
obtain any reaction from LIREALM-1 from mentioning the
latter's "boss" The undersigned believes that LOGINOV, who
is not completely stupid, would have either said nothing or
would have gone all the way in his statements to LIREALM-1
had he known the undersigned's name. By the same token it
appears that LOGINOV failed to identify ROWTON. The
undersigned had only met with one other Soviet besides
LOGINOV at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and
that Soviet was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting
with LIREALM-1 took place. ROWTON has never had any contact,
social or otherwise, with any of the Soviets.

5. The undersigned is the first to recognize that meeting
with LIREALM-1 at the Sanborns silver shop was a thoroughly
unwise move: He wishes to emphasize that this was the only
☐ meeting at the time that he had held with LIREALM-1 outside
of a safehouse. All meetings between the undersigned and
LIREALM-1 have since been held under the most secure con-
ditions on the edge of the Federal District and, in one case,
beyond. While this does not make this decision any wiser, he
also wants to emphasize the fact that it was made on the spur
of the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned
"felt sorry" for LIREALM-1 because of the latter's financial
difficulties with the Station over his last accounting. The
undersigned unwisely put LIREALM-1's morale for a brief moment
over basic security considerations. He is not in the habit
of doing this as a matter of course. The day before his next
scheduled tennis meeting with LIREALM-1 the following Wednesday,
LOGINOV called LIREALM-1 and asked to be excused as his leg
had worsoned. The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his
regular tennis game with LIREALM-1 but made no mention of
his previous conversation with him two weeks before. The
undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until
he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association
functions. Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and
artists which kept LOGINOV busy, however, this meeting did not
materialize until 28 March. Although the undersigned and
LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more than two hours
on this occasion during a visit to the local Home Fair, LOGINOV
never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting. He has
never brought LIREALM-1's name to the attention of the
undersigned.

CURRICULUM VITAE:
Subject claims that he has served in the Red Army. (8)
(Subject's name was reportedly listed in February 1960 as about to

that Subject was being considered for assignment there as D
diplomatic attache.)
14 September 1960: Subject and his family arrived in Havana, where
Subject was assigned as Attache at the Soviet Embassy. (3, 28).

think he not only had had ulterior motives in dating her, but
had dated other girls the same way.) I didn't reply directly,

commercial passenger ships operating between Veracruz
and New York for the month of Sepetember 1965, including
the cost of travel and baggage. In December 1965 Subject

Reson visa and Boviet travel business, but
that she otherwise had not seen hia. Although given apple
opportunity, she said nothing about LOGINOY having waited for
her in front of her apartment or about his questioning her about
local reaction to the Israeli-Arab var. As for the second
question, she assured LEVENDER IS that she had told no onè of
ber contact with him or GPURE.
10.
We are inclined to believe that Bubject lied about not
telling anyone of her contact with us because it would have been
extremely embarrassing for her to admit that she had failed both
to follow instructions and to keep her promise. While it is un-
certain exactly why she did tell LICOZY-5, the apparent timing
(the second day of the Israeli-Arab var) suggests it was the
result of her agitated state of mind, her anger at the Soviets for
their support of the Arabs, her possible imminent departure for
Israel and the uncertainty of her fate, and her warn regard and
respect for LICOZY-5 as a fellow pro-Zionist. (Subject, whose
mother is Jewish and who became romantically involved with: Israel
and Zionism after visiting Israel a couple of years ago, told
LEVENDERIS on 2 August that she had indeed gone to the Israeli
Embassy to volunteer to serve in Israel and had been insediately
accepted because she had had training in nursing. She said she
had been told to stand by for transportation to Israel and had
expected to be called literally at any minute. She said that the
brevity of the war had made her services unnecessary, howover.)

11. While it is clear Subject lied about not having revealed.
her contact with LAPURE to anyone, we are inclined to believe that
LICOZY-5 made up the story of LOGIHOV waiting for Subject in front
of her apartment and questioning her about local reaction to the
Knowing LICOZY-5, it seems very possible that he invented
the story in order to explain why Subject confided in him - 1.0.,
cho was already emotionally upset about the war and when LOGINOV
contacted her she understandably told Subject, which led to her
revealing the whole story. In any event, we consider the case
closed and do not intend to pursue the question of who is telling
the truth with LICOZY-5.

3. Subject said that she had originally met HARRIS while do.
was vacationing in Mexico and had maintained a correspondence
with him. Tą July of this year, be called her from New York and
asked her to meet him in Cozumel the week of 24 July. During a
week together in Cozumel, they decided to get married. Subject
said she thought that one day she would like to return to Mexico
with her husband to live, but that their present plans were to
remain in New York indefinitely.
4. In view of "Subject's plans to leave Mexico indefinitely,
we no longer have any operational interest in her and do not plan
to seek an Operational Approval for her.
5. Subject stated she had had no social contact with valentin
Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-355412) since December 1966, although she
had seen him several times on business since thon. She reported
an 11 May that her only noteworthy encounter with him since
December took place in April in connection with efforts on her
part to secure a Soviet visa for a leftist client of hers. LOGINOV,
balked at granting the visa because of alleged personal dislike of
the applicant, but finally gave in as a "personal favor" to Subject.
He stated bluntly, however, that Subject should realize a favor
must be repaid by a favor" and renewed in much more direct terms
a prior request that Subject introduce him to someone anong ber
friends who was or was inclined to be sympathetic toward the Soviet
Union. Subject replied somewhat flippantly that sho'd keep the
request in mind in case she met or thought of anyone in this
.category. (Subject had earlier reported that LOGINOY had cace
specifically asked her if she had any friends in LMPERE, but that
she had dodged the question and he had not pursued it.)
6. LICOZY-8 told Francis J. COIGNE in June 1967 that on 5 June
LOGIKOV had pressed his for information on the local Jewish reaction
to the Arab-Israeli war. LICOZY-B also stated that on ĉ June
Subject, who was very excited about the war and had even gone to
the Israeli Embassy to volunteer, to serve in Israel, had told him.
that when she returned home from work on the evening of 5 Juna,
LOGINOV was waiting for her on the street and tried to pump her.
for information on local Jewish reactions to the var. LICORY-5
stated that Subject told him abe gave LOGINOP bell for the Soviets'
support of the Arabs.
7: LICOZY-5 stated that Subject told him that in arch she had
been called to IMPURE and had been asked about her contact with
LOGINOV. She added, according to LICOZY-5, that she had seen, the
same LNPURE officer (no name given, according to LICOZY-5) a couple
weeks earlier. LICOZY-5 said that she also told him that LOGINOY
had asked her to introduce him to "one of her progressive friends”.
- or. "someone in LNPURS.
8. The above represented a capsule account of Subject's
relationship with her case officer, Keith B. LEVENDERIS. CUIGNS
played innocent until no got the whole story, but finally admitted
that we had talked to the girl. COIGNE told LICOZY-3 that Subject
had no idea that he was in contact with us and had in fact worried
that her activities in our behalf might create trouble for bis.
Asked by COIGNE what advice he had given Subject, LICUZY-5 said
that he had told her to be truthful with the LAPURA officer and
to be careful with LOGINOV.
0. On 2 August, during a very friendly "farewell" lunch,
LEVENDERIS asked Subject both about her most recent contacts with
LOGINOV and whether anyone knew of her contact with LAPURE. (She
had previously given the strongest assurances that she could be
counted on to keep this contact confidential.) With respect to

Elizabeth Duncan WILDE
DATE OF MEETING : 12 December 1967
1. A. Headquartors officer made arrangements by telephone for
me to interview Subject on 12 December. She was told that I would
arrive at Toledo at 10:30 and call her. However, my plane developed
mechanical trouble and I called her from Pittsburg to advise that
I would be 3 hours late. I arrived at Toledo at 13:30 and called
her.
We agreed that I would come to her mother's apartment at 14:30.
The interview lasted from 14:30 to 18:30. During the last hour we
were joined by her mother but, since she is senile and hard of
hearing, we were able to continue talking without interruption.

2. I introduced myself as Peter Clark from the Embassy in
Mexico. Subject accepted me without question and immediately began
Stelling her story which was about the same as we had received from
the political officer. The telling took only 10 minutes. I had.
considerable difficulty in taking her through a chronological account
and holding her to one subject. It became obvious that she is a
very self-centered person who is not interested in others unless
they make a strong impression on her which LOGINOV obviously did.
She is impossible on names dates or times, asking me at least three
times during the interviow to repeat my name. On the other hand
she was completely cooperative and did not appear to be withholding
or distorting information.
T
3. The following account of her contacts are pieced together
from her chaotic account and, thus, is by no means perfect:
a. She was in Mexico about 10 days on her most recent trip
and met LOGINOV about a week before she left (ca 10 November). She
met him at a party given by a Spanish couple (names forgotten) at.
their home in the southern part of the city to which her host, Dr
Frederico MARIN (see below) had been invited. It was a large party
which included Mexicans, foreigners and diplomats. She met LOGINOV
through a German man whom she had just met (van Henrichs or Kendrichs,
no meaningful traces.) She talked to LOGINOV on and off for an hour.
After an exchange of amenities she remarked that he spoke good English.
He said it needed improvement and asked if she would be willing to
give him lessons. She would like to but must leave in a week. He
asked if she had any American friends who could teach him. She
explained that she had friends when she lived in Mexico from 1954 to

to Mexico and opened the Scientific Institute for the Correction or

Subject was obviously a very handsome woman who appears to
have spent her better years running through a series of wealthy
husbands and lovers. As noted above, she is extremely self-centered
and is uninterested in other people as people. Thus she is a poor.
observer and reporter. She has a "bug" on Jews and Negrees. She
went into great detail on how American "ZIONISTS" control all the
information media in the United States and even influence government
policy. This is a "conspiracy" which is currently engaged in sup-
porting the Negro movement, especially moving into white housing..
This is the subject of her book, noted above. She has also had 4
accidents in the last four years (two fires in her home and two
automobilo accidents) which she considers a plot against her. She
suspects an old, vindictive lover from whom she broke when she dis-
covered that he was a Jew. Although Subject is not nearly as bad as
the above distillation would suggest, she is slightly unstable. Sho
is very much interested in helping us against LOGINOV and stated
several times that she would cooperate completely. She is clearly not
suitable for a long-term or complicated relationship with LOGINOV but
could be used on a short term basis to introduce another person or
to be an instrument in a provocation.

19.
At the conclusion of the interview, Subject was told that,
although she had every reason to interpret events as she did, LOGINOV
specializes in contacting and developing Americans as he did her.
From her story, there was no reason to believe that he was displaying
vúlnerabilities. Therefore we have no reason for her to attempt to
prolong the relationship or cultivate him. On the other hand she has
to contact him in order to get back her manuscript. She is not to
suggest further contact but is to report to us any further contact

However she offered to make
inquiries and suggested that he go to the American Embassy to find
a teacher. He answered that both the American Embassy and his own
would frown on the idea and would not think well of it. Later she
asked what he would do with his English once he had learned it.
He answered that he would like to go to the United States What
would your government think of that? Ho answered, "Well we all
have to better ourselves". During this discussion he got the story of
her life including the fact that she has written a book which is
still' in manuscript (see below). Ho expressed interest and asked
to read it. She said she had a copy and he asked her to drop it off.
at his embassy. He also said that he doesn't like Mexicans but pre-
fers the company of Americans who are more like Russians, Upon
parting it was agreed that she would drop by his embassy to give him
the manuscript:

b. Two days later she dropped by his embassy and he talked
to her in the outside reception area. She left him the manuscript
and told him that he could keep it until she returned to Mexico. He
gave her his card. Ho told her that she shouldn't call him because
his phone was always tapped (she assumed he meant it was tapped by
his own people). He added that he supposed the same thing happened
at the American bassy and asked, if she went there often. She
answered that she had only been there twice in hor life. He again
inquired about her American friends in Mexico and she answered that
she had no current ones. He again said he would like to meet
Americans and asked her again to look for an American who could teach
him English. On parting he said he would call her before she left
(he knew that she was leaving in a few days to take care of her sick
mother).

c. He called a day or so later and came over at ca 10:00,
to Dr. MARIN's house where she was staying (not on LIENVOY). He
asked when she would be back and how could he contact her in the
United States. She gave him her mailing address and promised to
answer if he wrote. He again asked her to find him an English teacher.
She asked him, if he ever thought of going to the United States.
Smiling, be answered, "Yes, who doesn't dream of going." He added
that he can't go anywhere until he learns the language.
She asked,
if he would like to make a change. He answered that he has to be
careful because he has a mother and family in the USSR. (From this
Subject inferred that he would like to change and is only afraid of
penalizing his family). He left on the note that she would try to
find him a teacher and would contact him upon her return to Mexico.
Subject and Dr. MARIN agreed that LOGINOV was a fine
person and they should help him get a teacher. Dr. MARIN suggested
that Subject go to the American Embassy since they give English classes.

(Comment: Mexicans still commonly believe that the Mexican
American Cultural Institute is part of the Embassy). Therefore
Subject went to the Embassy on the morning of 16 December and was
referred to a Mexican girl on the second floor (USIS). Subject told
this girl her story and received the names of several teachors at
the Institute. As she was leaving she thought that the Embassy
would be interested in her story and thus fell into the hands of tho
political officor. She then went back to the Soviet Embassy but
LOGINOV was not in so she left the list of teachers with the guard for
him. She left Mexico the next day, 17 December.

4. LILYRIC photo coverage shows that Subject was at the Soviet
Embassy from 13:35 to 13:42 on 16 November (after leaving the American
Embassy).. She arrived and departed in a taxi. LILYRIC also reports
that LOCINOV was out from 13:14 to 13:52 on that date which confirms
Subject's statement that he was not there. LILYRIC photo coverage
also shows that Subject visited the Soviet Embassy from 11:20 to
11:54 on 10 November 1967, arriving and departing by taxi, (her first
visit to the Embassy). Again, LILYRIC has LOGINOV in the Embassy
from 09:07 to 13:45 on that date, thus confirming that Subject
actually did see him. Thus her first meeting with LOGINOV at the
party was probably on 6 or 8 November 1967. On 7 November LOGINOV
was at the reception in the Embassy. LIENVOY has no information on
a social engagement for LOGINOV at this time.

5. From her account it was obvious that she was extremely
impressed with LOGINOV both physically ("he is such a handsome man")
and as a person. From her conversations she concluded that he liked
Americans and was interested in meating them, that he is really
interested in learning English so that he can go to the United States
and that, somehow, he didn't want his own people to know about these
interests and intentions. In fact, LOGINOV, "did a fine job in de-
briefing her and in keeping the contact open. This type of activity
has become standard for him in México.
6. Although the subject of his marital status never came up,
Subject assumes that LOGINOV is single. "He acts like a single man"
He loves parties and dancing and sports. (Again, standard behavior
for him.)
7. BIOGRAPHIC DATA:

initiated by LOGINOV. Obviously disappointed, Subject agreed to obey
instructions. After she has reobtained the manuscript she is to call
the Station (x870%, Betty calling for Bill Smith) and set a time for
the meeting "at the house" (Dr. MARIN's) or at "the Cafe" (Cafe Miš- ·
sissippi). Subject expects to return to Mexico sometime in the spring
of 1968.

He is
a pediatrician who owns a hospital or sanitorium (name and location

His wife died a year ago. She gave his address as Rio
over since.
Duero 54, telephone 11-83-60 (no Station traces but checks out in the
telephone book). She made me promise that I would not contact him
because, as a Mexican, he wouldn't want to get involved between
Soviete and Americans. However, when Subject returns we intend to
meet him through her to investigate his possible usefulness and as a
means of further assessment of Subject.

LEIN's account of his first two meetings with LOGUINOV. It appears to me that
at the second meeting, 26 April, he moved in a lot faster than is customary with
the Sovs. For this reason I wonder if possibly the Soviets are deliberately trying
to get a look at him independent from LEONOV, who may well have been reporting
rogāļanky his meetings with.
No understands ho is not to be dangled in front of Soys, and I told him that
after today's tenis match, he is to make himself unavailable for two or three
weeks for tennis (or the movies) and see what kind of initiative. L is prepared to .

This would, however, allow us to plant an American girl at the French Club if
wo wished and play her into L's hands. Will discuss with Paul when he returns.

PROGRESS REPORT
1. This report covers the activition of LIROCKET-1 in the
period 1 August to 8 December 1957. During this period; with the
exception of a summer treuk, LIBOCKET-1 m²intained his rolo as a
teacher at the Soviet Embassy. In an effort to summarize the more
salient occurrences during this period, we have endeavored to present
it, ás far as possible, in & chronological manner under the name of
the individual to whom the material is related.
"
=
.
Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSKY (201-038975). On 1 August,
KAZANTSEV verbally admonished Vladimir Maksimovich GONCHARENKO (201-
760865) for arriving at the class some 15 minutes late and for
having neglected to pay LILCCKET-1 on this date. XAZANTSEV, quipped
to LIROCKET-1 that "these young men are becoming more irresponsible.
Pavel Fedorovich NOVALAV told LIROCKET-1 that he was preparing
invitations for the departure of one of LIROCENT-1's previous
students and that he would put one aside for LIROCKET-1, KAZANTSEV
interrupted and stated, "I's inviting the teacher and I will give
him the invitation." KOVALY made no further comment on the subject.
Later, when alone, KAZANTSLV told LIROCKKT-1 that he was the "number
two man in the Soviet Eabasy" even though he holds the number three
position. He referred to himself as the Charge d'Affaires.
This was
the first time that KAZANTSEV had ever spoken of his rank or position
to LIROCKET-1.
-
3. On 17 August KAZANTSEV studied for one hour with LIROCKET 1.
LIROCKET-1 commented that BAZANTSEV's level of fluency exceeded all
of his other students. According to KAZANTSEY, upon his return home
in June, he was required to take hià English language examination and
scored a final mark of 4.5 out of a possible 3. KAZANTSEV lost the
1/2 point only because he had not read any English language books
during the previous months.
4. On 24 August, KAZANTSEV stated that his wife had been having
stomach trouble of a undisclosed origin. She had just returned from
the hospital where she underwent tests to determine the nature of
her illness,
5.
During the class of 29 August, KAZANTSEV read an article in
the English language newspaper, The Nova, portsining to the diminuition
of the male sex drive anong heavy smokers. This triggered a long
monologue by KAZANTSEV on the evils of pornographié literature.
KAZANTNEV· found this aspect of western society distasteful and serving
no useful purpose.

On 31 August, KAZANTSV told LIKOCKAT-1 that Semen
Tarasovich BAZAROV (201-049257) was again interested in taking.
English lessons from LIROCKET-1. LIROCKET-1 commented that he
might be able to accomodate BAZAROV only from mid-September to the
end of November. KAZANTSIV left the room and contacted BAZAROV.
Upon returning KAZANTSSV stated that BAZAROV would have pressing
obligations in connection with the forthcoming anniversary and
olympics and could not begin classes until sometime thereafter.
7 On September, KAZANTSEV commented that he would like to
continue studying English because be expected to return PCS to his
country at the end of 1967 or early 1968. KAZANTSSV acknowledged
that he might be asked to stay on during the Olympics. However, he
indicated that this was unlikely to prevent him from returning,
KAZANTSEV reiterated his desire to depart Mexico in the near future
"

8. On 10 October, KALANTSEV received several pocket books in
English which he had requested LIBÖCKET-1 to pick out for him.
LIROCKET-1 selected them from his own library. KAZANTSEV stated that
he did not care what subjects were chosen; he wanted them only to
improve his reading ability. He did mention, however, that he prefer-
red not to read books which had either violence or pornography ag
their central theme. LIROCK&T=1_brought a book on science fiction
which did not particularly interest; KAZANTSEV, a book on ballet, and
a book on the FBI in which KAZANTSKV seemed very interested. KAZANTSEV
stated that he would have to discontinue all of his classes from 10
October to 16 November as he was scheduled for vacation đủring this
period.

9. On 16 November, KAZANTSEV interrupted a class containing
Vladimír Maksimovich GONCH JENKO (201-760865) and Yevgeniy Ivanovich
BEDRIN (201-760230) to announce that he would not study that day.
Immediately, BKURIN wheeled around and told KAZANTSEV very explicitly
that he should remain and study. To this KAZANTSKY replied in English,
"See the pressure my chief puts on me". It was quite apparent to
LIROCKET-1 that BEDRIN was in charge of the language lessons and that
KAZANTSEY was seemingly very hesitant to defy BEDRIN's challenge.
KAZANTSEV stated that he hid wanted to take a weeks leave, but in
deference to BEDRIN's wishda, KAZÁNTSEV remained during the rest of
the class, although his presence was somewhat of a disruptive factor.
Later during the class, LIKOCKET-1 had KAZANTSEV and BEDRIN ask each
other questions in English an exercise which KAZANTSEV enjoyed in
that his English is superior to BEDR IN 'B. However, BEDRIN rose to the
occasion, comported himseli in a fine manner, and there ensued a
lively exchange of questions and answers on non-controversial topics.
->>>
.10. ĠONCHARENKO was absent from class from 10 August to 19
September. During this period he was on home leave.
11. On 19 September GONCHARENKO returned to class and LIROCKET-1
complimented his on his improved Mnglish facility. CONCHARENKO
-
stated that he had worked diligently on hid English during this summer
vacation. During the period 19 September to 7 December, GONCHARENKO
did not attend classes regularly.

FUTURE PLANNING
24. Future planning:
$
LIROCKET-1 will continue to teach
the Soviet Embassy, Mexico two days per week for a total of five
hours. His work appears to be quite satisfactory and he is ap-
parently well regarded as a teacher by the Soviet Ambassy.
LIROCKET-1 assesses KORNYUICHIN as the most interesting pupil with
whom he is in contact and, accordingly, intends to concentrate his
efforts toward establishing a social rapport with KORNYUKHIN which
will lead to an exchange of visits. LIROCKET-1 has been given
several Personality Assessment Questionnaires for use in recording
observable behavioral patterns in his students.

CEDRIN was absent from class from 10 August to 19 September.
During this period he was on home leave.
13. On 19 September, BARIN returned to class and commented that
he had not looked at his English lessons since August. BEDRIN related
that he had spent most of his vacation in the Leningrad area which is
his home as well as his vife's.
14. On 21 September the subject of conversation turned to
alcoholic beverages. BEDRIN stated that he couldn't drink vodka like
he used to as it gives him too much of a hangover the following day.
BEDRİN stated that he preferred whisky (Canadian Club and Seagrama)
any other drink.

18.
During the classroom discussion of books on 10 October,
LIROCKET-1 noted that BEDRIN has somewhat of an obsession with books
of a pornographic naturè, BEDRIN had previously remarked to LIROCKET-1
that he enjoys a good spicy story and that during a 1966 layover in
Brussels, he sought out and enjoyed viewing a number of sex movies.
16. On 12 October, LIROCKET-1 commented that he might visit the
States during the last of October. BEDRIN, privately, asked LIROCKET-I
to purchase for him two 7 inch reel recording tapes and two 8 inch
reel tapes. BEDRIN said that "another friend" had brought him some
tapes in the past. This was the first time BAD I had over requested
LIROCKET-1 to perform any personal favor. On 31 October BEDRIN canceled
the order relating that he did not need the requested tapes insuch
as a "friend" had purchased some Grundig tapes for his while in the US.
17.
On 16 November, BEIRIN strongly advised KAZANTSEY to remain
for his class rather than skipping it. (See KAZANTBEV, 16 November.
incident).
18. Valentin Mikhaylovich KORNYUKHIN (201–374727) began classes
on 21 November, in the company of KASANTJEV. KORNYUKHIN possesses
good, fluent English although his grammar is somewhat unpolished.
Ils speaks with a decidedly British accent. KORNYUKHIN stated that he
had been in Mexico for approximately five months and had served
previously in Burma from approximately 1962-65. After his assignment
in Burna, KORNYUKHIN had worked in Moscow (1965-67). KORN YUKH IN
appears to be between 35 and 40 years of age, blonde hair, trim,
athletic appearing approximately 6 feet tall and weighing between
165-170 pounds.
19.
On 23 November, KAZANTSEV and KORNYUKHIN studied together.
During the lesson a slight difference of opinion arose between the
two over what their government's position was during the 1964 Cyprus
crisis. The exchange reflected the obdurate, somewhat dogmatic
character of KORNYUKHIN. LIROCKET-1 characterized KORNYUKHIN as.

possessing very strong and fixed ideas. KORNYUKHIN did not appear
to be awed by KAZANTSEV's official position and spoke openly and
forcefully to him.
.20 On 29 November, during the course of a discussion,
KAZANTSEV and KORNYUKHIN again became embroiled in an animated debate.
KORNYUKHIN debated KAZANTSEY in an effective and energetic manner.
seemingly unafraid of correcting or disputing KAZANTSEV. The
argument was not personal nor was there any apparent evidence of rancor
between the two.
21. On 7 December, KORUNYUKIN studied along with LIROCKET-1.
LIROCKET-1 soon discovered that KORNYUKHIN was somewhat of a chameleon
in his personality in that he was completely difference without the
presence of KAZANTSEV. KORNYUKHIN manifested a friendly, affable, and
responsive manner, gratefully accepting any criticism from LIROCKET-1
regarding him use of the language and giving up all pretensions of
being a hard-nosed personality. LIROCKET-1 garnered the impression ·

wers unmanageable, unorganized, and uncontrollable. KORNYUKRIN stated
that he was more impressed with Burma than either India or Mexico.
MISCELLANEOUS
22. During the 28 September class, LIBOCKET-1 was sought out
by Yevgeniy Nikolayevich COLLITSYN (201-773422) who began talking to .
LIROCKET-1 in fairly adequate English, capable of making a conver-
sation. GORLITSYN Commented that he preferred to study his English
glong rather than in a clase with a tutor. GORLITSYN also stated that¨
he would be required to take his inglish exam in the near future and
that he would hermetically seal himself off for one week while be
prepared for it. GORLITSYN stated that he wanted "to maintain his
20% bonus" by passing the Eglish exam. LIROCKET-1 views GORLITSYN
as somewhat of a bumpkin; not particularly intelligent, but a plodder.
He appears to be a loner in his relationships with others of the same
nationality.
23.
**
During this same class, Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201–
285412) spoke briefly with LIROCKET-1. LOGIMQY asked LIROCKET-1 if
he would have time to teach English to his eight year old son.
LIROCKET-1 stated that the hours requested by LOGINOV for lessona
would be impossible to accommodate. LOGINCY then began talking of his
love for sports and his background as a former Judge in Olympic akiing
as well as refering to various other sports including tennis.
LOGINOV's English is good, although not as fluent as KAZANTSEV's.
LOGINOV's problem seems to be & lack of practice. LIBOCKET-1 charac-
terized LOGINOY as a highly perceptive individual with a keen sense
of intelligence.

Nikolay Daitriyevich #CHERNYSHEV, Repatriate from Venezuela
1. According to LIENVOY on 4 September 1967, Valentin
Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412), Consul of the Soviet Eabassy
in Mexico City placed a call to Havana, Cuba stating that he
had in Mexico a family of & persons that had to be sont from
Cuba to Odessa by boat. LOGINOV said that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs had ordered that their passage be paid to the
border of the USSR. The family name was given as CHERKYSHEV
According to LOGINOV the family had been given permission
live in Groznyy in the USSR by the Miatry of Foreign Affairs.
3. On 7 September 1967, LICOZY-5 reported that LOGINOV
had booked passage to Cuba for a Russian emigro, Nikolay
CHERNYSHEV and his family. CHERNYSEV's wife was born in Italy.
and his three children Igor, Nataliya and Sergey were all
born in Venezuela. LOGINOY also stated to LICUZY-5 that the
CHERNYSHAVÉ were repatriates from Venezuela.
3. Plans to send the CHERNYBURY Iasily to the USSR via
Cuba were apparently changed because LIFIRE reported their
departure for the USSR via Montreal via Canadian Pacific
Airlines Flight 582 on 28 September 1967. The following
information on the CHERRYSHEV family was available from the

apparently, scrutinizes and approves the names of doctors and
dontists patronized by the Embassy personnel. Recently a
Man on Duty said over the phone that LOGINOV had forbidden
to be given out the address of a German dentist, whom the
Sovicts visited quite frequently before.
LOGINOV is also in charge of making up a duty rostor
for appointing a Man on Duty who would be responsible for
anything that took place at the Embassy on that particular
day. No one, oxcept the ambassador, sooms to be exempt from
that duty. On a few occasions LOGINOV oncountered hostility
to hic arbitrary manner of making up the duty roster. Thus,
When a Man on Duty called Nikolay Sorgoyovich LEONOV, Press
Attache and a (former?) Cultural Officer, and told him that
LOGINOV put his name down as the pesponsible Man on Duty for
the Embassy for that day, LEONCV said that he was very busy
and lot LOGINOV do it himself.
Obviously LOGINOV had made a number of secret enemies
with his dictatorial manners and his disdainful, monotonous,
and slow way of talking. His medium- to high-pitched voice
sounds as if he is extremely bored with the world and aoos

His physical appearance ssoms to confirm that impression

with such a seeming-scarcity of work for the Congulate,
it would be sufficient to have only one man forit. But the
Sovict Embassy has to have three mon handling consular duties.
The Consulate is open to visitors twice a week and only two
hours a day. Even that is too much for an occasional person
who desires à visa for visiting the USSR. However, in addi-
tion to their regular duties, the consuls have to arrange
various matters relating to visiting Soviet cargo vossols,
artistic and cultural groups, etc. On several occasions,
they had to do un errands outside of their overt field on
activity. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why, in many
instances, they cannot be reached on the telephone. All
three of them speak fluent Spanish and have no difficulty in

There is no indica-

Soviot Wives. One of the reasons may be that he would not

than his own countrywomen, in especial his wife, who is a
large unattractive Remale.
Nevertheless, LOGINOVA seems to be quite pleasant, with
a nice cultured voice, and gets along with her husband well
thanks to her good humour and social activity. She has
been quité brominent in Nestkom work and in the children's
summer camp. Shortly after their arrival, LOGINOV bought
a tape-recorder for his wife for 115 dollars. Whether it
was to be used for music, or other purposes, has not been
determined.
Once in a while, LOGINOV goes on drunken sprees. Thus,
on 12 Köşem February 1966, he and NORMUSHKIN drove up to
the Imbassy gate at three a.., pounded on the gate, blow
their horn and had alterations with Stanislav Sergeyevich
SILNIKOV, who was on duty at that time.

Another very prominent trait of LOGINOV'S character is
his extreme chauvinism, bordering on jingoism. In reference
to other nationalities, LOGINOV use's such deprecatory epi-

It is doubtful if LOGINOV has any true friends. His
sneering attitude is probably the reason for it. Although
he made everal errors in judgement in his work and social
behaviour, LOGINOV by no means is a fool and should be kept
in mind for any possible developments.

It seems that in the future, NORXUSHKIN may slow down

progress should be watched with interest and caution.

Proviously he was mentioned as an assistant Cultural Attache,

no indication that SHPAXEVICH was ever riotous on dead drunk
He is neither a skirt-chaser, although with his fluent Span-
ish and a human tank for a wife, SHPAXEVICH would be justi-
fied in un investigating greener pastures among the
Mexican women. But he is decidedly devoid of any imagina-
tion...
Despite her great bulk, SHPAKEVICH'S wife, Tatyana Ivan-
ovna, seems to be a very amiable person and all the Soviet
wives agree that the is very "nice". Tatyana is to yours
SHPAKEVICH'S junior, but she acts like a protective mother-
hen towards him. She has high blood pressure and that was
probablý why she left for Koscow over a month ago. Conse-
quently SHPAKEVICH is here all by himself for the present and
some of his friends, who refer to him simply as "SHPAK", in-
vite him occasionally for dinner or lunch.
Yet SHAPEVICH can also hart some people's feelings with
his callous indifference. Once, when Nina Atanasyevna Y
NIKIRINÄ, wife of the films representative, Aleksandr Alek-
sandrovich, begged AKHIKË SHPAKEVICH to drive her home from
the Embassy, since she was dead tired arter running errands
for the Hestkon, SHPAKEVICH told her in an indifferent manner
that he had no desire to do so and walked away.

so hurt by SHPAKEVICH'S attitude that she cried in the street
on her way home. Acts of this nature oannou endear him to
some people and by all incications, SHPANEVICH does not seem

round out what SHPAKEVICH wanted to tell him, BAZAROV Çave
a verbal lashing that actually sizzled. Nevertheless,
later SHPAKEVICH called again and asked for the ambassador.
The Nan on Duty, Ivan Fedorovich SOLOMATIN, told SHPANEVICH,
he roasted you and me before for a disturbing his
rest and now you want some more of it?" But SHPAKEVICH was
hot to be put orr and SOLOKATIN with a sigh buzzed BAZAROV
again. A first BAZAROV was angry but later calmed-down and
discussed with SHPAKEVICH the well-being of PLISETSKAYA and
her group. The above incidnet may characterize SHPAKEVICH
in Ambrican vernacular as a "post" and a "jork". Both ex-
pressions describe his true nature quito woll.
It is doubtful if this one-time assistant of the cul-
tual attache had any extensive schooling. Such inadmissible
expressions as, for instande, "Ya khochu dolozhitsya" is a
clear indication of his low educational level.
But with all his shortcomings, SHPAKEVICH is probably
well liked by the majority of the Soviets. Ho is easy to
get along with, especially with his friends. His closest
friends are the families of the Soviet correspondents, the
KUCHIROVS and the DOLGOVS, and he is also very intimate with

the United States that morning. PRIKRODKO
and KUCHEROV both appeared genuinely sur-

that she knew LOGINOV. LOGINOV, for his
part, also seemed surprised that PRIKHODKO

17 February: KUCHZROV came over to LIROBBIN-2's apart-

tation to the Soviet Army Day reception
which he had promised on lü February to
deliver personally. As KUCHAROV knew,
LIROBBIN-1 had left for the U.S. KUCHEROV
invited himself in for several drinks and
stayed for two hours talking about nothing.
At one point he noticed a scratch on
LIROBH IN-2's knee and used the opportunity
to administer a sympathetic caress which
wound up going down the length of her leg.
He did not attempt to follow up this amorous
gambit, however, and finally left with
nothing more than a good-by bear hug.

dofinite reading in the fall, when the large number of Soviets
now on vacation, including PRIKEUDKO and LOGINOV, have returned
and the Soviets have resumed their normal routines.
In the course of the reporting period, the LIROBBINS
also provided information on 14 non-Soviet acquaintances of
interest to the Station.

CONCHARENKO and ROMANCHENKO left. The two men were introduced as Vladimir

interested in taking English lessons, and thereupon left with the comment
that he didn't believe he was needed. SOKOLOV was the first of the twosome
to speak, repeated that he and KOVALEV wished to take lessons, and then
turned things over to KOVALEV, who, he said, spoke better Engb ish than hẻ.
KOVALEV proceeded to state that he had served in Washington, D.C. for three

Business Hours. According to LIROCKET-1, traffic through the front
foot gate is essentially controlled by a single guard who operates
the gate latch electronically by means of a release button inside
the gatehouse. In the course of approximately 125 visits to the
Soviet Embassy from January 1966 to the present, IROCKET-1 on
occasion has seen as many as three guards in the gatehouse at one
time, but there has usually been only one guard présent when he
has entered and exited the gate (usually about 0915 and 1145,
respectively, on Mondays and Fridays prior to mid-January 1967,
and about 1530 and 1800 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from mid-January
to mid-May 1957). Even when more than one guard has been present,
it has appeared that only one of the guards has actually been on
duty and that the others have simply been lounging in the gatehouse)

3. To gain entry through the foot gate, the would-be visitor
presses the white doorbell button to the left of the foot gate..
This button rings a buzzer inside the gatehouse. The guard on duty.
promptly looks through the observation window which directly faces.
the footgate. If, presumably, the guard is satisfied that the
caller or callers do not look dangerous or suspicious, he disengages
the gate latch electronically by pressing one of the two release
buttons inside the gatehouse. After the gate latch disengages, it
is up to the caller to push (or, when the caller is leaving, pull)
the gate open and then close it behind him. The gate locks
automatically when closed. According
According to LIROCKET-1, there is a
keyhole on the inside of the gate, but there definitely is no keyhole
on the outside. LIROCKET-1 has never seen anyone open the gate
with a key.
4.
.
LIROCKET-1 has been present in only about five instances
when non-Soviets in vehicles have sought admittance through the
vehicle gate, which is adjacent to the foot gate. In each of the
five instances, the callers have been delivery men whose trucks
have apparently been recognized by the guard. In each instance,
the truck has pulled up with its nose to the vehicle gate and the
guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually. The vehicle
gate consists of two doors which open inward. It is secured by
one dead bolt from one door to the other. LIROCKET-1 has never
noticed a padlock on the gate. After being admitted to the Embassy
grounds, the trucks in each case have driven únaccompanied to and
parked under the portecochere on the north side of the main Embassy
building. After closing the gate, the guard has returned to the
gätehouse, where although LIROCKET-1 has never actually observed
a guard doing so - he has evidently telephoned someone inside the
-main building to give notification of the truck's arrival.
.
5. LIROCKET-1 has been present perhaps 25 times when pedestrian
callers (delivery men, students, persons on visa business) have
rung the foot gate buzzer, and in each instance the guard has
routinely let them in without going to the gate to question them
or observe them more closely. On one occasion, as many as four
young Mexican males who appeared to be university students rang
the buzzer while LIROCKET-1 was inside the gatehouse, and the guard
let them in in the routine manner..
.6.
Once inside the gate, the pedestrian caller is expected
to present himself at the gatehouse door, which is usually left
open, and state his business. The guard then either goes next
door to summon an Embassy official from one of the two offices oft
the Reception Room, or, as in Subject's case, uses the interphone
to call someone inside the main building. (In LIROCKET-1's case,
the guard calls one of his Soviet students.) If instructed to have
the caller wait, the guard shows him into the Reception Room.
LIROCKET-1 himself has been asked to wait in the Reception Room
about 55 times. On approximately 15 occasions, he has been invited
into the gatehouse by the guard on duty to chat. On the latter
occasions, he has either remained in the gatehouse until one of his
Soviet students has appeared to escort him into the main building
or has left the gatehouse after a few minutes and gone to the
Reception Room to continue waiting for one of his students to
arrive. On approximately 60 of LIROCKET-1's visits to the Embassy,

LIROCKET-1 estimated that while he was present in the
Reception Room between January 1966 and January 1967, he observed
Soviets in the first office about four times as often as in the
second office. From mug shots, he identified the following Soviets
as having been the primary users of the two offices during the
times he was present:
(a) LOGINOV, one of the two Soviet Vice-Consuls until he
LIROCKET-f
became Consul in September 1966. LOGINOV is known KGU.
frequently saw him in the first office and saw him receive

7. Offices Off the Reception Room. There are two offices off
the Reception Room. The first office is known from other sources
to be used for visa interviews. The second office is presumably
used for the same purpose. The first office opens directly into the
Reception Room. The second office is at the back of the first
office and is entered either through the first office or through
an outside door. (LIROCKET-1 has never seen the outside door used,
however.) One or both of the offices were occupied by Soviets
(about 20% of the roughly 40 times LIROCKET-1 was in the Reception
Room prior to mid-January 1967 (usually on Monday and Friday"
mornings between. 0915 and 0930). The Soviets frequently left the
door to the first office, and somewhat less frequently to the
second office, open when they were present. The first door or both
doors were sometimes also left open when no Sovict was present.
When the door to the first office or the doors to both offices
were open and LIROCKET-1 sat opposite the door to the first office,
he could see about a quarter of the interior of the first office
Although
and a small part of the interior of the second office.
official Soviet visa hours are only on Tuesdays and Fridays
(from 1100-1300), LIROCKET-1 saw Soviets in both offices with about
equal frequency on Monday and Friday mornings. From what LIROCKET-1
could see, the Soviets rarely seemed to be busy with desk work,
but confined themselves to looking over newspapers, opening mail,
chatting with each other, etc. Frequently Sovicts went into one
of the offices for just a moment and then left. Since LIROCKET-1
has begun going to the Embassy about 1530 on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
however, he has always found the door to the first office shut and
both offices evidently empty. (COMMENT: This is probably explained
by the fact that the Embassy lunch break is from 1400-1600).

found LOGINOV doing paper work and a stack of 30-35 passports on
his desk. LIROCKET-1 also recently stepped into the first office
"to see LOGINOV at 1830 on a Tuesday, but LOGINOV was just leaving
and LIROCKET-1 did not stay. LIROCKET-1 has never been inside the
second office. His sketch of the second office is based on what
he has been able to see from the Reception Room and the first office
In order not to seem curious, he purposely did not look around the
first office when he was in it and consequently does not know what
kind of furnishings, if any, are on the far side of the first office.
.9. From January 1966 to January 1967, LIROCKET-1 was in the
Reception Room on 8-10 occasions when other non-Soviet visitors
came in. The Soviet interviewer ushered the visitors into one of
the offices and closed the door to the first office on about four
of these occasions. On two occasions, the Soviet interviewer
ushered the visitor into the first office and did not bother to
close the door. On four or five occasions, the Soviet interviewer
came out into the Reception Room to talk with the visitor in
LIROCKET-1's presence.
In each of the six or seven cases in which
Subject was able to hear the conversation, the Soviet and the visito
were discussing visa matters.

The LNPURE officer also informed the case officer that Subject had
previously mentioned that he had once been "approached" to supply
information on Soviet travelers on a regular basis and had refused
to do so. Subject evidently did not specifically say that he had
been approached by WOFACT, but this was clearly the implication.
Subject told the LNPURE officer that he was willing to supply informa
tion he considered unusual or especially interesting, but was not -
willing to supply information on a routine basis.
▼
3. The Station had no contact with Subject between 6 January
and 28 September 1966. On 20 September,
On 20 September, the Station learned from
LICOZY-5 thất Subject had been invited along with several other
Mexicań travel agents to attend an Intourist conference in Moscow
from 24-29 October. A meeting was consequently arranged with Subject
for 28 September through the LNPURE officer.
5-
Subject told the Station officer who met him that he had
been meaning to contact the Station about his forthcoming trip, which,
he said, he assumed was what the case officer wanted to talk about.
He gave the case officer a copy of his invitation to the Intourist
conference and on his own initiative offered to provide the Station
with a full report of the conference when he returned. However, he
stated that he was not interested in working for the Station on a
permanent, "agent" basis, in meeting under clandestine circumstances,
or taking money. He was willing to help to the extent he was, he
explained, because he believed basically what we did about current
world problems and, after all, had lived in WOLADY for many years and
On the basis of this interview.
regarded it as his "second home".
-
and a review of Subject's file, Subject impressed the case officer
as a somewhat disingenuous egoist who, despite a genuine sympathy
for WOLADY, regarded his cooperation with the Station primarily as a
means of insuring his business contacts with LNPURE and as something
which had to be kept to a minimum lest it limit his independence or
detract him in any way from his business and personal interests.
This impression served as the basis for the evaluation of Subject
contained in Reference A.
5. The case officer's impression of Subject changed considerably
At this meeting,
with the next meeting, which was held on 18 October.
the case officer gave Subject a defensive briefing for his trip and
went over general reporting requirements. Subject surprised the case
officer with his friendliness and cooperativeness, and went to great
pains to explain that he was more than willing to cooperate with the
Station as long as he did not become so deeply involved in intelligence
work that his business or personal life was adversely affected. The
case officer was impressed by Subject's apparent sincerity and got
the definite impression that ever since receiving the Intourist invita-
tion, Subject had been fearful he was again going to be asked to
accept a double agent role which, if it materialized, would require
him to become far more deeply involved in intelligence work than he
wished. Sensing both Subject's relief at not being asked to under-
take a more demanding assignment and his concern to make it clear that
his heart was nevertheless in the right place, the case officer used
the opportunity to again pose the question of whether Subject would
be willing to report on a routine basis on persons who booked travel
The case officer told Subject that
through his agency to the USSR.
this information could be forwarded to the Station through the INPURE
officer and assured him that his cooperation in supplying such infor-
mation would not involve him in a series of escalating intelligence
assignments. Evidently satisfied that his role would remain a limited
one, Subject agreed to report the desired information on a regular
basis. Moreover, he volunteered to check with other travel agencies
in order to fulfill specific requirements for information on travelers
to the Soviet Union who did not book their travel through his agency.

1. Subject was recruited in May 1963 to accept Soviet recruit-
ment if approached during a visit to the USSR in May-June 1963.
Following his return to Mexico, he reported that no offort had been
made to recruit or, to his knowledge, cultivate or compromise him.
The Station maintained sporadic contact with Subject between June
1963 and August 1964, during which time he furnished limited informa-
tion on Soviet travelers to and from Mexico and on Soviet interest
in increasing tourist traffic between Nexico and the USSR.
The Station was notified in August 1964 that Subject's POA
had been cancelled. There was then no further contact with him until
January 1966, although during the latter part of 1065, Subject on his
own initiative gave the LNPURE officer with whom he regularly dealt

6. Subject was thoroughly debriefed upon his return from the
USSR in early November 1966, at which time he continued to exhibit
the samo friendliness and cooperativeness noted in paragraph five.
He reported that he was aware of no effort to assess, cultivate, or
compromise him in the USSR. He provided information both on the
formal proceedings of the conference and on individual Soviet and
foreign participants, well as on a Spanish businessman he met in
Moscow. This information resulted in three Field Information Reports
(-10,870, 30 November 1966, HMM-10,871, 30 November 1966, HMM-
10,875, 30 November 1966), one dispatch to Madrid (HMMA-30725,
1 December 1966), and a second to Santiago (HMMA-30749, 2 December
1966). Since furnishing information on his trip to the USSR,
Subject has provided information on the travel of the Bolshoi
Ballet in Mexico, on a Mexican traveler to the USSR, and on a
Soviet student group which was slated to visit Mexico, but which
for unknown reasons failed to arrive at the last minute.
*
7. The only Soviet Subject has recently been in contact with
is LOGINOV, whom he occasionally sees on visa matters. According to
Subject, their relationship during the past year has been strictly of
a business nature and LOGINOV has shown no interest in extending it
beyond this. Subject consequently appears to have little to offer
in the way of an access agent to the Soviets in the foreseeable
future. However, as the manager of one of five Mexican travel
agencies representing Intourist and because of his apparently
excellent contacts with key personnel of the other four travel agencies
he promises to be a useful referent on persons who book travel in
Mexico to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries.
+
8. Despite the regularization of our relationship with Subject
and his increased cooperativeness, we do not feel we are currently
in a position to ask him to undergo an SGSWIRL interview. The
relationship between the case officer and Subject at this time is
essentially one of equals in which Subject is voluntarily assisting.
INFORT out of ideological motivation. It is true that his strong
business interest in maintaining friendly relations with LNFORT.
and INPURE provides us with a degree of control, but we feel that at
present it is better left as a form of tacit control than brandished
even subtly. It is our opinion that Subject would regard an SGSWIRL
interview as an effort both to increase our control over him and to

would in all probability undo much of our recent progress with
Subject: Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSWIRL
interview until either we further solidify our relationship with
Subject or we wish to use him in more sensitive work.

there had not been any signs of action, BESABER was instructed
to try to get in touch with LOGINOV regarding the purchase of
vodka (for Christmas). When Christmas passed without any luck
in contacting LOGINOY (BESABER was extremely busy during this
period) we decided to change tactics a bit.

5. Per Station instructions BESABER phoned LOGINOV on
12 January 1967 and made arrangements to drop by the Embassy.
the following morning to show LOGINOV the catalogs of his
mosaic-ware. BESABER was instructed to take advantage of this
meet to try to establish some kind of reason for continuing the
relationship (ténnis and vodka buying were suggested.)

After
a cursory but polite look at BESABER's catalogs he LOGINOV

charge of looking for a house in Cuernavaca to be used by
Embassy personnel (LIENVOY confirms tmt LOGINOV has the
responsibility for renting a house in Cuernavaca as a summer
retreat for wives and children.) LOGINOV told BESABER thất
he was prepared to pay 5,000 ($400.00 U.S.) per month for
June, July and August 1967. He warts a four-bedroom (or more)
house with a heated swimming pool and garden LOGINOV mentioned.

The purpose of this exercise is to establish a
familiar social relationship between BESABER and LOGINOV
that will permit the Station to further assess LOGINSY To
date BESABER's first impressions were not particularly en-
lightening other than his feeling that LOGINOV is susceptible
to further social development. The Station will encourage
this activity with BESABER and it will be helpful if Headquârters
personnel, if they see BESABER during reference trip, also
encourage him.

8. One further matter for the record; BESABER was first
introduced to LOGINOV: by BEWKEP. They again were together at
the Polish Embassy on 4 October 1966. Although BESABER has,
not told BEWEEP of his meet with LOGINOV on 13 January it is
only because BESABER has not seen BEWEEP since before Christmas.
BESABER has been instructed to be perfectly open with BEWEKP
about having seen LOGINOV and in fact it may turn out that
LOGINOV and BEWEEP will visit BESABER together. (LOGINOV
referred to the possibility in his 13 January meet with BESABER).

as his "chief." SOHOLOV Interjected that he was leaving Nexico "sometimo
this year" and wanted to brush up on his English in preperation for the
4th your English proficiency test he would have to take when he returned to
the USSR. Subject and that on the whole, he get the impression that XOVALST
was replacing SOKOLOV. A schedule of two classes a week, from 1800-1930
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, was agreed upon. One of the two Soviets mentioned
that the funds for their lessons would come out of the military department.
1715-1830 SOKOLOV and KOVALEV asked when Subject would suggest
they have their first lesson, and Subject replied that since KAZANTSEV was
away, they might as well begin immediately. The Soviets readily agreed.
Subject described KOVALEVIS English as good. His grammar is a little better
than KAZANTSEV's, but he is not quite as fluent as KAZANTSEY. SOKOLOV'S
English is fair, but he is decidedly behind KOVALEY and KAZANTSSY
in both grammar and fluency. Nevertheless, Subject feels SOKOLOV is good
enough to be in the same class as KOVALEV.

the matter further when Subject (not to be left out of a Good

30-40% discount. Subject even wanted to get me some film

LOGINOV on numerous occasions on the Embassy grounds and in
the first office off the Reception Room. They usually exchange
greetings in English. On 30 March, LOGINOV came up to Subject
in the Reception Room and said that he'd like to speak to
Subject about English lessons for his 8-year-old son.. Subject
said fine, and it was agreed Subject would drop into LOGINOV's
office (i.e., off the Reception Room) when he was through

a very relaxed and casual manner, explained that he had an

boy knew no English and very little Spanish. He stated that
they were going to Moscow on vacation in July and would be

that he would like Subject "to go to teach" the boy, the

give the boy lessons when it came time, LOGINOV said he hoped
Subject would be able to recommend someone else. Subject said
he'd be happy to teach the boy if he had time, but that it was
of course too early to know whether he would be able to fit
him into his schedule in August. LOGINOV. said he understood
and they could talk in specifics in August. LOGINOV added
only that he planned to pick up a special text (or set of
texts) for teaching children English when he was in Moscow.

passports on his desk on 11 April. Subject commented on.
LOGINOV's apparently heavy work load, and LOCINOV rerlied
casually: "Well, you know there are a lot of people who want
to visit the Soviet Union." He continued that most of the
passports on his desk were Mexican, but "several" were American.
He then began shuffling through the pile until he came to one
belonging to an American girl. He opened the passport to
her picture and showed it to Subject as an illustration.
Subject said he couldn't make out the name, but the picture
was of a good-looking, blondish girl who appeared to be 23
or 24 years old. This was the only passport LOGINOV showed
Subject, and the converse topic was thereupon dropped. At
the end of the conversation, LOGINOV stated that he certainly
would appreciate it if Subject could teach his son and he'd

April 1967. My purpose was to see if he knew Herbert Adolf
PELKA (P ). Subject said that he didn't know either PELKA

Subject reported that he had noticed that Ralph WIEGANDT
has become quite friandly at the French Club as a tennis partner
of LOGINOV. (COMMENT: Për LIENVOY WIEGANDT and wife invited
LOGINOY to dinner in March 1967). WIEGANDT is a German who came
to Mexico after WW II. He formerly worked for Rieboldt Chemical
in Germany. His wife is from a well-known German-Mexican family.
from Guadalajara, nee BAHNSEN. His father is a Dr. of chemistry
from Stuttgart who recently came to Mexico. WIEGANDT owns
ar has a controlling interest in Barnices Aislantes, S.A., located
at Avenida Tolteca 176. This company manufactures plastic foam
insulating materials. He lives in Coyoacan in a house which he
recently had built, Europa 26. Subject dislikes WIEGANDT whom he
describes as a pushy, ambitious businessman. The implication is
that he is unscrupulous and would do anything for a¨buck. Subject
doesn't know anything about his politics. Subject will obtain
more background information on him.

Soviets' most able and active intelligence officers. One of the
areas where he was most active, I continued, was in establishing.
relationships with young women like herself. For this purpose,
I said, he used various lines, alternatively telling girls he
was unmarried, divorced, or that his wife was in the Soviet
Union. (This brought the first expression of any kind from
Subject, who smiled faintly when I mentioned his using the
line that his wife was in the USSR. According to LICOZY-5,.
this is what LOGINOV had told Subject.) Encouraged by the fact.
that Subject was at least listening, I went further into the
seriousness of the Soviet presence in Mexico, hitting hard the
fact that the Soviets treatened the security of both the U.S.
and Mexico, individually and collectively. When I finished,

defensiveness that all right, she had gone out with LOGINOV a
few times. Because of her job as head of läst Furopean travel
at Mundos Tours, she had met and had to deal with LOGINOV on
visa matters. One day he had casually asked if she were free
that night and had invited her out. He had always been helpful
to her and she felt it was good business to accept the invitation.
In all, she had gone out with him "three or four times"--usually

if we could arrange something else. Subject professed dismay
that the American Embassy even knew she existed, let alone that
she could possibly be of any help to the Embassy. She then
became very defensive and only reluctantly agreed to meet me
for lunch at the Pergola Restaurant at 1400. The Pergola
just a few blocks from her apartment.
3. Subject was waiting for me in front of the restaurant
when I arrived a couple of minutes before the hour I found
trim, stylishly dressed young woman with glasses and long,
dark hair pulled straight back from her forehead. The glasses,
exposed forehead, and hair style gave her a sophisticated look
which turned out to perfectly express her personality. Sho
did not at first strike me as particularly attractive, but this
was probably because she was tensed up to the point that she
was pale and expressionless and actually trembled slightly when
we first spoke. I later found her, especially when she took
off her glasses, to be quite attractive, and it is reasonable
to assume that LOGINOV is attracted by more than her personality.

City was a major base for espionage and subversion against both

Junė 1966, LIENVOY indicated the existence of something mo
than simply a business relationship between them. Then in
January 1967, Paul Dillon elicited from LICOZY-5 the information

mother, intelligent, definitely not pro-Soviet, and had gone to
college for two years in the United States. The problem in
arranging a meeting with her was to do so in such a way that she
would be either disinclined or unable to say anything to LICOZY-5
or anyone else about the meeting before it took place. It was
hoped that at the meeting she could be persuaded to keep the
contact to herself.

Learning on 23 March that Mundos. Tours was closed
that day and that LICOZY-5 was out of town, I called Subject
at her apartment that morning about 1115. I identified myself
as an officer at the American Embassy, stated there was a
matter on which I thought she might be able to be of some help
to the Embassy, and asked if she by any chance were free to have
lunch with me that day, or, if not, *f*****transpSTASCHI

firm were good customers of Mundos Tours, and that Alejandro
had in fact just recently returned from a three week trip to
Germany. He spoke some English.
7. The appearance of ALVAREZ, who by now was ordering his
first of two martinis, seemed to end any remaining chances of
getting anywhere with the girl. As it worked out, however,
his appearance had just the opposite effect, because it provided

mother--who Subject said is a U.S. citizen--had lived in Moldavia,

had told her daughter vivid stories of pogroms carried out by
the Russians against the Jews, and had fled Rumania before the
invading Russians (evidently during World War II.) The fact
that I had been in Rumania and Moldavia was good for another
ten minutes of conversation and seemed to impress Subject far
beyond its worth. In any event, by the time ALVAREZ left,
Subject and I were on a first name basis and she was telling me
how glad she was she had met me--all of which I attribute to
luck (ALVAREZ, who even quietly paid the check when leaving) and
dubonnet cocktails.

straight home." She admittedly enjoyed his company. She considered
herself "an intelligent person," and wouldn't go out with just
anybody. He too nad to be intelligent and had to be en enjoyable
companion. LOGINOV fit this bill. He was "extremely intelligent,"
very considerate, an interesting conversationalist, completely
unlike the usual 111-mannered, boorish Soviet. But that's all
there was to their relationship. That's absolutely all there
was to it. They never discussed politics, and even if LOGINOV
wanted to do so, she'd refuse, because she had absolutely no
interest in politics. She had her own life to lead, and what
one side said made no more dent in her than what the other side
said. Reflecting for a moment on the above, Subject then added
almost disgustedly that when she began seeing LOGINOV she had s
more or lessed expected that her name would wind up in the
American Embassy's files.

looked to be in his early 30's came up to the table, greeted
Subject, and invited himself to sit down. Subject, apparently
as surprised as I, introduced him as Alejandro ALVAREZ (no
Station traces) of ALVAREZ AUTOMOTRIZ, a local firm which makes
springs for Volkswagens. Subject told me later that his father
owns the business. Alejandro, according to Subject, had once

be had ever asked her of an even remotely suspicious or
interesting nature was whether she had any friends at the
Amèrican Imbassy. She said she had replied tartly that she had'

friends everywhere, and that LOGÍNOV hadn't bothered her with
such questions since. In short, she didn't see how she could
be of any help. I replied that since it was, I who need the help,
this was for me to decide, that whether she liked it or not she
was in contact with an important Soviet intelligence officer
who was of great interest to the United States, and that now
that I knew her better, I was confident she had the intelligence
and judgment to help us. I did not want to interfere in any
way in her personal life. Nor did I really want her to do anything
in the sense that she would have to go out of her way. All I
wanted was that she be is observant as possible during her
normal contacts and dates with LOGINOV, to try to see into the
man, what made him tick, what his problems were, whether he
was satisfied with his work, how he liked to relax, what did
he enjoy, what did he want, etc. Then after each substantial
contact, most probably a date, I'd like to have the opportunity:
to sit down with over lunch or wherever it be and discuss
her observations. This was all I was asking. All right, if
that's all I wanted, she'd do it.
10. There was, I said, one thing I wanted to impress on
her: if we were to obtain any worthwhile results, one thing was
essential... Subject nodded at this point and interrupted:
"I know...keep quiet." I emphasized that this meant with
everyone, indluding her family, her friends, her boss and her
co-workers. Subject assured me that she could be relied upon.

Unidentified Visitor to Soviet Embassy
A sensitive, reliable source has reported that on 9
March 1967 a man who appeared to be an American stopped at
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to talk with Soviet Consul
Valentin Bergeyevich LOGINOV. The man did not enter the
Soviet Embassy. He was driving what appeared to be a late
model Buick Electra with Florida tags 10-W-7776.

KAZANTSEV. KAZANTCEV began talking about his trip on
his own initiative. He said he left Mexico City on 30 May and arrived in
Moscow on 3 June. (He did not say when he returned to Mexico.) He gave no
reason for the trip, but said he had "several conferences and meetings" in
Moscow. Subject interjected that he thought the trip might have had something
to do with the Middle East crisis, since it broke out just about the time
“KAZANTSEV left. KAZANTSEV laughed spontaneously at this idea and replied
that what he knew about the Middle East wouldn't do anyone any good. He
then went on to say he had spent his first weekend in Moscow with his son,
who shortly thereafter left for his summer job in "Siberia." He said he
spent the second weekend (10-11 Juno) with his daughter. The daughter,
according to KAZANTSEV, had planned to go "south" for a 2-3 week vacation in
early June, but postponed the vacation when she learned her father was
coming. (The implication, according to Subject, was that KAZANTSEV's trip
came about fairly suddenly.) What KAZANTSEY was most interested in talking
about, however, was the fact he had unexpectedly had had to take his English
proficiency test in Moscow. He consequently set aside the last three days

the oral test that he was exempted from the written test. He said his
examiners gave him a "4" (on a 1-5 scale) and would have given him a "5".

specified. I gave her the 870 extension and asked that she use
the name "Mary" when calling.

12. There are clearly two essentials if Subject is to
develop into a worthwhile asset. First she is going to have to
come up with more interesting observations than simply that
LOGINOV is smart. She may be able to do this by becoming
more diligent and careful observer--which I think she is
capable of--or it may require an effort on her part to develop
a closer relationship with LOGINOV. One possibility in the
latter direction is to prevail upon her to become more intimate
with LOGINOV than she now appears to be. On the basis of
"LICOZY-5's opinion that she probably sleeps around, this might
be possible, although it is much too early to say. Second,
Subject must prove cooperative. She strikes me as a very indépendent
and strong-willed person; and there is no guarantee she won't
change her her mind or do only what she feels like doing.
It is also possible that in a moment of reconsideration, she
might confide in LICOZY-5, in which case her credibility would
become tangled with his.

8. During the above conversation, we also discussed the
United States, including President Kennedy, whom both Subject
and ALVAREZ claimed greatly to have admired, and Subject's
experience in the U.S., where she attended Kent State University
in Ohio. She stated at this time that she regarded the U.S. as
a second home. She also expressed love for Mexico and together
with ALVAREZ, took pride in pointing to Mexico's progress.

9. Following ALVAREZ's departure, Subject looked at me as
though I were a bad dog or something and asked in a scolding
tone how I could have ever suspected her of cooperating with'
LOGINOV. No, she just couldn't understand it. I replied that
I hadn't suspected her and reminded her that I hadn't said I
did. I then said more seriously that there was one thing that
bothered me, however. On the one hand, she told me she loved
Mexico and regarded the U.S. as her second country; yet on the
other, she claimed to be totally apolitical. The Soviets in
Mexico, I repeated, were working to undermine both countries,
and proceeded to go over again much of what I had said earlier.
I stated that it was incredible to me that Soviet activities in
Mexico didn't make any difference to her. I had contacted her,
I said, not because I had any suspicion of her, but because from
the little I knew of her I had hoped she'd cooperate in helping
us learn more about LOGINOV and his activities in Mexico. Subject
thereupon protested that there was nothing more she could teli
'me.
She had told me everything worth telling about their
association. Moreover, she hadn't seen him since, Christmas time.
LOGINOV was smart, never talked about anything sensitive, and
could probably never be induced to do so. The only thing

While KOVALSV can be very pleasant, he seems to have an antagonistic
strain and occasionally challenges. Subject's teaching with: "That isn't
the way we do it in our coursbs," etc. Sometimes, in fact, the disputes.
on methods, points of grammar, etc. have become rather heated. On these
occasions, SOKOLOV has usually stepped in more or less on Subject's side
and cooled things off. At their second meeting, NOVALSV asked Subject directly
what his views were on the Middle East crisis, Subject turned the question
back on NOVALSY by saying he would frankly be more interested in KOVALEV's
ideas, as he was sure KOVALEV was much better informed about the situation
than he. KOVALE backed away this time, claiming he didn't have much infor-
mation either, but at a later class both he and SOKOLOV parroted the Soviet
line about the crisis--Israel was the aggressor, etc. On another occasion
when the Middle East was again the topic. Subject referred to (what he recalled.
as) President Truman's post-World War II proposal to internationalize both
the Suez and Panama canals. KOVALEV immediately objected to this idea,
although he gave no indication of ever having thought about it before.

March 1967
1. Operational: Met BESABER at his hotel room in Del Paseo
for breakfast. Meet lasted from 0800-0920. Next meet will be
after Easter.
2. Substance
BEWEEP: BEWEKP phoned BESABER on Friday, 3 March 1967
to invite himself, his wife and the RZADZINSKI couple down for
the day on 5 March. They arrived on 5 March at about 1100, stayed
until 1700.
BESABER reported that Mrs. RZADZINSKA is three months
pregnant (by her admission) and that he, BESABER, thinks that
BEWEEP is the father. He cited the following as evidence
=
(1) The RZADZINSKIS admitted they they had been
married for over five years, yet this is her first pregnancy.
(2) Mr. RZADZIŃSKI was totally unattentive to Mrs.
ERSABER and his wife assume that after so many years of
waiting for a child, Mr. R. should have shown more concern for
and interest in his wife.
B.

-
(3) Likewise, Mr. R. was totally disinterested in
the fact that he is about to become a father.
(4) BEWEED, on the other hand, showed concern for
Mrs. R. when she went to sleep in the sun. Twice he suggested
that Mr. R. wake her up so she would not get burned. He didn
(5) Mrs. R. appeared interested in BEWEEP. When he
went swimming Mrs. R followed, proceeded to jump on him and
frolic in the water. Mr. R. paid no attention at all.
(8) Mrs. R. sat next to BEWEEP at lunch (on purpose),
kept looking at BENEEP lovinglý.
Y
(7) BEWEEP, possibly embarrassed by all the attention
Mrs. R. was showing him, made some very complimentary remarks
about his wife. Mrs. BEWEEP, who apparently was completely
oblivious to what BESABER and his wife thought was so obvious
in the MEWEKP/Mrs. R. relationship, was obviously very pleased

Mrs. BEWEEP told Mrs. BESABER that she was not
teaching geography at the Embassy to the children of the officials.
B BEWEEP told BESABER that he thought he would remain
in Mexico until the first few months of 1969, but certainly until
after the Olympics of the fall of 1988.

Tenon RZADZINSKI and wife In addition to the
information above noted regarding R. and his wife, the BESABERS
picked up the following
(1) RZADZINSKI was previously stationed in Vietnam as
a member of the ICC (interpreter). He speaks good. English and
his Spanish, although not as good, is understandable.
(2) R. doesn't understand why the Americans are
carrying out the war they way they are. Without in any way
criticizing the American position, he did say that he found it
unbelievable that they did not destroy the port of Halphang.
(3) R. had contact with Amercans in Vietnam. XX He
spent one month at the Danang air base, apparently anjoyed it.
(4) R. did not get off on politics, possibly because
BEWEEP apparently did not want to talk about such subjects.
3.
Comments
We have no information to substantiate the BESABERS -
supposition that BEWEKP is the father of Mrs. R's expected child.
I told BESABER this. It may be true, but to have any operational
significance, we would almost have to prove it.
PlanЯ
>
I asked BESABER to arrange a lunch with BEWEEP in
the near future to try to see if there was anything more to the
above supposition. (Lunch now set up for 4 April).
b. Tentatively, BÉSABER will invite LOGINOV tó Cuernavaca
for 8 or 9 April to look at houses (for Sov Embassy retreat) and
play tennis at Colonel Higgins (whom I will brief as soon as
I can get hold of him).

not, Mrs. BEWEEP said that her husband had told her BESETON was
in Colombia (SLINKARD had told BEWEEP this). She then went on
to say that BESKTON was the nicest man in the world. "I don't
know what he is, but he's the nicest man in the world." "He
introduced us to another American (obviously SLINKARD) whom we
see often, but it's not the same."
"
Mrs. BEWEEP, still alone with BESABER, was very
complimentary towards the U. S. She said the U. S. was made for
women, the merchandise, the packaging, the stores, etc.
the people are all nice.
wz
Moreover,
Joined by BEWEEP, Mrs. BEWEEP got off on the Russians.
She explained that it was difficult to understand the Russians
since she, ña a Pole, belonging to the Western Cultural traditions
held so many different views about life in general. She was
apparently particularly thinking of the sense of distrust in the
Russian mentality. She said that the Russians here in the
Embassy simply could not believe that the two daughters of the
former Polish Ambassador, Jerzy GRUDZINSKI, had been permitted
to stay on in Mexico after their XXXNENX father's recall last year.

1. Soviets At about 1000 on 18 February Vladimir Ivanovich
SHPAKEVICH (P-8167) phoned BESABER from Cuernavaca. BESABER häd
never met him before. S explained he friend of Valentin Sergeyevich
LOGINOV (P-11712), that L unable to make it because some people
had arrived in town. S showed interest in buying some of BESABER
products, therefore BESARER asked him to come to factory. S
arrived with wife and young girl who works in the Embassy (18–19
years old, tall, good figure, dark brown hair, spoke Spanish,
she wore kerchief) - this probably Tatyana MARKINA (P-12945).
2. 3 brought almost 2000 pesos worth of stuff including two
large screens. BESABER opines that this was not personal
purchase, but rather either for the Embassy or operational expense
deal. 8 also insisted that purchases be delivered to Embassy,
not his house.
.3. 8 invited BESABER and wife to Army Day reception at the
Soviet Embassy (28 Feb 1967), saying that he had forgotten to
bring written invitation but that it would be at the gate of the
Embassy (BESABER was reluctant to go and I thought it better for
him to not appear overly eager so he did not go.);
LOGINS
4. Before leaving (they stayed about 45 minutes) 8 told
MRSABER that would probably come to Cuernavaca the following
day, Sunday about noon. (he didn't.)

On Saturday 28 I went to a party at the house of the Greek
Consul General Leander Vourvoulias, and I saw there Vladimir
Loguinov engaged in a heated discussion with an american
conmul whose name is Sherry. Sherry was arguing that there were
Topolinov with on
Chinwan
A lot of Ohin an North Viet Nem, and Loginov whh myling
that it was a pity that such a big nation as the US should be
fighting an small and poor nation like Viet Nam.
I had a talk with Loguinov, who I think now is in charge
of consular affairs and he told me that he thought that nego-
ciations for the cultural greement with Mexico were still
boys
going on, but that those/who had been awarded the fellowships.
had already gone. But according to what he said there were
quite a few more then ten.
Loguinov was with his wife and talking about the Bolshol
ballet he told me that I should have rang him up and he would
have taken us, me and my wife, to see the ballet and to see
the dancers behind the stage. He said that the ballet was
coming to Canada for the fair and probably would come again to
México.
The Russians will give a party for the consule, film and
drinks, sometime during February.
Loguinov asked me if I thought that some consuls would not
show up at the Russian embassy as they did when they were invi-
ted by the Cubans. I told him that the position was entirely
different because most countries had diplomatic and consular
relations with the URRS.

11. As far as the BESABERS could make out the only purpose
of the visit (other than to get a free meal) was to invite the
BESABERS to come to the Embassy to see Soviet films. Not knowing
how he should react BESABER was non-committal, although he couldn't
resist asking BROVKIN if they had any Westerns in color. (I
told BESABER he should not go to movies and if the subject came
up again to tell the Sovs that while he liked them as people,

he didn't want to hear their propaganda either orally or from the
sound track of some lousy movie).

12. BESABER is less impressed by LOGINOV's intelligence than
heretofore: Between L's and B's heavy-handed propagandizing
(especially in the capptalistic "ambiente" of the BESABERS)
BESABER was less than impressed with their tact.
13. Mrs. BESABER reported that of the three women Mrs.
YATSKOV was by the far the most presentable.

She learned that the
8 were on their second tour in Mexico, that they likød

Plans for future get-togethers include only LOGINOV.
Mrs. BESABER will look for some housing for the Sova in Cuernavaca;
when she has found something, they'll invite LOGINOV down
to have a look at them. There is also the possibility of tennis,
although both BESABERS are loathe to take any Sovs to Mrs.
BESABER's tennis club, practically all the members of which are
Americans. I agree.
15. The BESABERS proposed and I second the motion that I
contact Laurence Higgins, a long-time Station contact and personal
friend of the BESABERS and tell them that the BESABERS are
cultivating Sovs in our behalf, ask him to let BESABERS bring
LOGINOV,XN and possibly others to Higgin's court in Cuernavaca.

At the 28 Feb meet BESABER reported that PMN had phoned him from
Colima on 24 Feb, reporting among other things that he would be in
Colima for another month or so. He said he was working in the
office of Secretaria Particular of the Governor of Colima (tol:
2-04-11) and staying at the Notel Costeno (tel: 2-00-35).

apologize for not making it to the reception. During this

five other people. He showed up at about 1545, stayed until 1830

8. The conversation was characterized by a lot of
propaganda on BROVKIN's and LOGINOV's part. Although Vietnam was
not mentioned, L boasted several times that the Soviets would
get to the moon first, complained about the Kennedy murder
scandal, and generally spoke in an anti-American vein. BESABER
and his wife tried to laugh them out of this theme, but with little
success.

9. At one point BESABER mentioned an article he had recently

DATE OF MEETING:

22 February 1967.
I had breakfast with Subject at the Hotel Del Paseo
from 0900 to 1000 on 22 February 1967. Next meeting is at the
same place at 0900 on 8 March 1967.
2. Subject reported that he had had lunch with LOGINOV
as planned. LOGINOV brought up the following topics:
a.
LOGINOV brought up the Ramparts article about CIA.
Subject hadn't read or heard of it. LOGINOV then said this proved
that CIA was very active and said they were active in Mexico.
He again asked Subject if he had any friends at the American
Embassy. Subject for the nth time told LOGINOV that he hadn't
been in the American Embassy and that an office boy takes care
of visas, etc. at the Embassy.
b. LOGINOV then said that he was going to explain to
Subject the line of the CC of the CPUSSR on China. Then followed
an harangue against the Chinese which Subject stated contained
nothing that hasn't been in the newspapers.
-
'
c. LOGINOV said that he has a Mexican girl whom he didn't
identify and asked if Subject would give her a job or find her
a job. Subject asked about her qualifications, English, typing,
etc, LOGINOV answered that he didn't know. Subject said to send
her around and he would see. To date she has not appeared.
(COMMENT: Subject said he has no intention of hiring her, if
she comes, but thought we would be interested in her identify.
I told him to find out as much about her as possible. However
since LOGINOV didn't say what kind of a job she wanted or what she
could do, I will be surprised if she comes.)

d. LOGINOV went into some detail explaining to Subject
about the party he was giving at the Soviet Embassy on 16 February.
for the Consular Corps. He then invited Subject.

LOGINOV said that Aeroflot service, would be inaugurated
between New York and Moscow in May. Once it is instituted local
Soviets will fly to New York and catch Aeroflot there. Subject
asked about U.S. visas which the Soviets have always complained
about in the past. LOGINOV said that the Soviets will be travelling
from Mexico to New York on Air France and Air France has agreed
to handle the matter of transit visas with the U.S. Embassy.
LOGINOV added that the local Soviets are looking forward to the
stop off in New York which is much more interesting than Montreal.
(COMMENT: If this works out we will have good advance notice of
Soviet travel from Mexico and excellent passport photos).
3. Subject went to the party on 16 February 1967 with his
secretary and his friend,. Sinai Rome, First Secretary and Consul
at the Israeli Embassy.. He saw PRIKHODKO briefly and PRIKHODKO's.
wife attached herself to him and took care of him for the evening.
He noted that YATSKOV wasn't at the party..

4. Rome introduced Subject to Jan JAKOWIEC. The minute
JAKOWIEC heard Subject's name, he asked if he were from Mundus
Tours. They then conversed in Polish. JAKOWIEC told Subject
that the Polish delegation to the Olympics will come on the
Batory and that the Poles are building a ship twice the size of
the Batory which will be put on the Poland-New York City run next
year. JAKOWIEC suggested that they get together for lunch and
Subject agreed. JAKOWIEC said he would call Subject in about
a week. Subject remarked that he is a sharp guy and speaks very
good Russian. I told Subject that JAKOWIEC is the UB resident
and instructed him not to go beyond a social relationship in
any manner. Subject agreed.

for by Mexican Jews.

7. Per LIENVOY, NIKIFOROV called Subject on 20 February
1967 and made an appointment to come to Subject's office at 1100
on 21 February. Subject did not mention this to me. I will bring
up the Subject of NIKIFOROV in an innocuous way at the next
meeting.

he met to in front of the Reception Room. They talked, chiefly about
sports for about 15 minutes. LOGINDY said skiing and speed skating were

Mexico was playing tennis. Subject said that LOGINOV seemed to be an
avid sportsman. LOGINOV said that he was going to Moscow on vacation toward
the end of July. No reference was made to Subject teaching LOGINOV's son
English when the LOGINOVS return from vacation, but Subject assumes this
is still LOGINOV's wish.

with any Soviet since the end of December, LOGINOV called him

wag busy on the 14th but agreed to meet him on the 15th at

said he also intends to make a courtesy call on ECHEVARRIA
soon since he is a very influential man, may become President
and it wouldn't harm Subject to keep his oar in.
4. Subject heard from Pedro Ferriz, a partner of
ZABLUDOWSKI on TV, that USIA in Mexico had payed for the TV

I told Subject that Headquarters had expressed no interest in

said that in 1960 he attended the American Society of Travel
Agents convention in Honolulu. On the way back he took a tour
of the FE and NE with a group of travel agents. In Hong Kong.
the Hong Kong Tourist Board had a cocktail party for them.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
30 January 1967
Cocktail Party with Official
Bloc Representatives
1. At a party given by the local head of the Consular
Corpy Association on 28 June the undersigned met and again
chatted with Valentin S. LOGINOY of the Soviet Embassy. He
also met for the first time Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy
who was introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.
-
1
2. As usual LOGINOV spent most of the time conversing
with undersigned provocating him on a number of issues. The
undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the
Chinese Civil War. When LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undersigned
felt it would be nice if the Soviets helped the U. S. to
bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more on
the Chinese Communist danger. At one point in the conversation
undersigned jokingly asked LOGINOV if there were Soviet
nationals in North Vietnam. The latter said, "sure, we have
many advisors there." The undersidnged said, "no, what he
meant was behind guns or in the seats of airplanes." LOGÍNOV
said absolutely not. It also seems that LOGINOV has been
keeping track of the people he sees undersigned talking with
at cocktail parties. For example; LOGINOV was curious to
know if undersigned has seen "his Haitian friends." Undersigned
asked which one
the black one or the white one. LOGINOV
said the white one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom
undersigned occasionally talks to. Undersigned said he had
seen the Haitian at the Haitian, National Day about a month
ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was
ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV. The latter, incidentally, corners
the Haitians anytime he has a chance to, although he officially
poo poos the Haitian regime. LOGINOV once more asked under-
signed when he would come play tennis with him (this is about
the fourth or fifth time). Undersigned told him he would do
so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often
promised to do. One of the topics that LOGINOV mentioned
was the Protection Section of the Embassy. "Protection against
whom," he asked. The undersigned gave him the usual lowdown:
V.S
on the number of tourists to Mexico and their problems.
LOGINOV must have been interested in the section as he mentioned
that a U. S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had
met recently will be transferring to another post.

3. JAKOWIEC appears to be a man who likes to talk.
Spanish is quasi bi-lingual and JAKOWIEC says, by the way,
that he learned it in Brazil. His wife is a plump, very
Polish-looking woman. Her initial conversation was to laugh
at some of the exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned.
Both Mr. and Mrs JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian.
At one point in the conversation undersigned mentioned there
is hardly a Pole in Poland who does not have a relative in
the United States; JAKOWIEC agreed and commented that while the
Poles are close to Americans in many things they are not so
pleased at other things that the U. S. does. Undersigned
deferred this discussion of this point for another meeting.
As many of the Consular Corps members know that undersigned
served many years in Vietnam, the latter felt that he should
not hide this fact to the official bloc representatives as
they would find out about it anyway. This came out for the
first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when
JAKOWIEC somehow mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of the
Polish members of the Armistice Commission there. The
✓ undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well,
told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as
they were sons of Polish emigrants to France who returned to
Poland after Gomulka took power. When JAKOWIEC started to
imply that this indicated how wonderful things were in Poland,
undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees,
many of whom worked under very difficult conditions in France
in the coal mines, preferred the hard work to the chance of
working in Communist Poland.

MEMO OF CONVERSATION
*
Leila BELAVAL, Visa Officer of U.S. Embassy.
of U.S. Embassy
1. I talked to Lella today about her contact with the Soviet who brought
BAZAROV's passport in for a visa yesterday. She identified the Soviet from
a photograph as Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, and said that he is always
the one who comes to the U.S. Embassy for visas. She did not recognize.
the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, the Vice Consul.”
Actually, Leila believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, said she always.
asks for him as such when she has to call the Soviet Embassy.
A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried
to make a date with Leila. She says that he always asks her what she does
In her free time, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy.
Once shaxx he asked her whether she spent her free time with other people
ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her
off hours with non-Embassy friends. Yesterday LOGINOV again asked hér
what she did in the evenings, and she said she was especially busy now
because she has started taking guitar lessons. He mentioned some Soviet
dance group that was coming to Mexico in a month or so and said he would
like to invite her to go to see them with him. He also told her he was not
married. L'ella said she did not refuse the invitation outright but said that
she did not know whether she would be free when they came or not,
"
a
3. I told Leila à few of the facts of Soviet life: that all Soviets have to
be married in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV is a KGB officer and
was obviously trying to get his foot in the door of the U.S. Embassy through
her, that he was undoubtedly disappointed to hear that she did not spend
all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evidently been
unsure about how to react to LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be
rüde to him, and seemed relieved when I suggested that she simply decline
his invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick-
manner at all, and I gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with
him, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem.
4. Lella mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but is reluctant to
use it. He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in peffect English,
and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself,
but evidently understanding it all). According to the new regulations,
Soviets no longer need visas for continuous transit of the U.S. (I.e., on the
same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on getting a visa for BAZAROV in spite
of this. (This is confirmed in LIENVOY.) - --

One day while Nechiporenko uus in the hotel room, the phone rang and Subject
picked up the phone. A female voice asked for "Givy." Subject Banteringly replied
in Russian that "Givy" wasn't around, but wouldn't ha do. In the ensuing converso-
tion Subject found out that the caller was a 25 year old student, her address and
telethone number, and made a date to meet her the following day at the Lenin Station

one Instance he has claimed to be unmarried when inviting a girl out (27).
