The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.
Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and
Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Because
Coleman had a close personal association with Karamessines he
did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much
about it either--"Helms said send him out." He was instructed to go
ahead.
5. In early July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid. He
had a ten day turnover with Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and
he did not see him. Noel said he didn't know what Hunt did, but
that Coleman need not worry because he was gone.
6. Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which
Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt. Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.
Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to
Spain. Coleman observed that Szulc did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,
but without any conclusions as to its significance.
7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on
the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt.

1. I phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and
said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has
the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the
fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance
activities of Barry Goldwater.
1-
2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns
was not familiar with that title, but recognized it as the predecessor
of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington
field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division.
Chief of DO Division and now DCOS Bonn, might be in a position to
give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I
suggested that he be queried by cable. Burns said Gaines is staying
on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.
--
3. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the
Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt
went to the field in 1965. He could give the background on the assign-
ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms!
direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman
became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide
information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.
I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.
I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in
domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that,
his assignment to Spain after the election could be presented as giving
him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be
sure we know the facts.
4. Lasked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution
of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for
keeping files on Watergate. He said we are on the PLMHPLANK for
messages to Helms. He would advise the action officer. I said we are
available for any help we can give.

under the impression that Mr. Hunc's writing activities
were either being encouraged or subsidized directly
by this Agency in any official effort. Mr. Ryan re-
sponded that he was personally not aware of any such
arrangement.
He added as an expression of personal
opinion that Mr. Hunt had no operational function and
was simply granted the opportunity to write books for
his own personal gain at Government expense during this
period.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
.
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt--Madrid Assignment
•
1. On 22 February 1974, Mr. Frederick N. Evans
and the undersigned interviewed Mr. Edward Ryan,
Chief, Staff D, Deputy Director for Operations, on
the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. During the period
of Mr. Hunt's assignment as a Contract A agent
to Madrid between July 1965 and September 1966, Mr.
Ryan had been the Deputy Chief of the Western European
Division, Deputy Director for Plans. The purpose of
the interview was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any
information bearing on the matter of the operational
assignment of Mr. Hunt during this period.
2. Mr. Ryan stated that the assignment of Mr.
Hunt both to the European Division and to Madrid was
handled without benefit of the routine processing
procedures through the Western European Division.
Mr. Hunt's assignment was coordinated and directed
by Mr. Thomas Karamessines, the Assistant Deputy Director
for Plans. With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan
was unaware of any specific project or target for Mr.
Hunt. Mr. Ryan made the specific observation that if
Mr. Hunt produced positive intelligence on the Iberian
target during this period the officials responsible
for this effort within the Western European Division
were totally unaware of it.
3. Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of
Mr. Hunt's activity and the nature of his assignment
during this period came more, through hearsay than
direct official knowledge. For example, he cited the
comment made by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.
Hunt's to the effect that Mr. Hunt stated that while
in Madrid he was going to "play golf and write books."
Mr. Ryan was asked specifically whether or not he was

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern
1. I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning
in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to
his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial
transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.
2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an
assignment. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des
FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time
Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral
and ten days of religious observations following that. He was back
in mid-June and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend
the National War College which began in August. He did not return
to that office until the end of June 1966.
-
3. Halpern observed that during this period Karamessines.
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this
on their own.
4. Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office
of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FitzGerald until
Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested
someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something
about it (although he may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Watergate--Frank A. O'Malley
1. At 3 p.m. on the afternoon of 19 Bebruary 1974,
Mr. Frederick N. Evans and Lawrence J. Howe interviewed
Mr. Frank A. O'Malley at his residence, 6419 Lakeview
Drive, Falls Church, Virginia. Mr. O'Malley retired
from this Agency in June of 1972. Prior to retirement
Mr. O'Malley was an officer in the External Employment
Assistance Branch, Retirement Activities Division of
the Office of Personnel. It was Mr. O'Malley's function
to assist personnel retiring from this Agency in finding
post-retirement employment. In this capacity Mr. O'Malley
had been instrumental in the placement of Mr. E. Howard
Hunt in the Robert R. Mullen public relations firm. The
purpose of this interview was to attempt to determine if
additional information could be developed from Mr. O'Malley
with regard to the placement of Mr. Hunt with the Mullen
Company.
i
1.
2. Mr. O'Malley began the interview by recalling
the nature of his past Agency associations both with Mr.
Hunt and the Mullen Company. Mr. O'Malley stated that
prior to assuming his responsibilities in the Office of
Personnel he had served with Central Cover Staff in the
area dealing with the funding of covert action projects.
In this capacity he had become familiar with the acti-
vities of Mr. Hunt while Mr. Hunt functioned on the Covert
Activities Staff primarily in the propaganda field. Mr.
O'Malley stated that he first came in contact with the
Mullen Company when he was attempting to find an organi-
zation to handle the public relations effort of a covert
Agency activity known as the Free Cuba Committed. Mr.
O'Malley related that he had arranged this cover through
the Christianform Organization and that his duties in-
volved all aspects of the funding of this activity.
O'Malley described the nature of his working relationship

of Mr. E. Howard Hunt, the issue was raised as to whether
or not the funding of Mr. Hunt's projects continued between

with Mr. Robert R. Mullen as being close and cordial.
Mr. O'Malley stated that Mr. Mullen was in the habit
of confiding to him information concerning other Mullen
business contacts and projects.
specific question, Mr. O'Malley Stated that during the
In response to a :
period of his contact with the Mullen Company dealing
with the Free Cuba Committee, Mr. Mullen told him the
Howard Hughes Organization was a client of the concern.
3. Nr. O'Malley reiterated his previous statements.
that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement
assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,
then Colonel L. K. White. Mr. O'Malley stated that in
view of Mr. Hunt's interests in the public relations
field, it was thought advisable to put Mr. Hunt in touch
with Mr. Robert Mullen for the purpose of gaining the
benefit of Mr. Mullen's guidance. Mr. O'Malley recalled,
after the initial meeting, Mr. Mullen mentioned having
met Mr. Hunt some years previously in Paris, France.
Mr. O'Malley's office arranged interviews with various
organizations including Reader's Digest and the Kennecott
Copper Company. Through the offices of the Mullen Company
an interview was arranged with the General Foods Corpora-
tion, a Mullen client. Mr. O'Malley stated there was.
disappointment that Mr. Hunt had been unsuccessful in
"selling himself" during any of these interviews and that
no job offers had resulted. In response to a question
-
as to whether or not executive level interest was still
being shown in Mr. Hunt's post-employment placement,
Mr. O'Malley recalled that Mr. Richard Helms, then
Director of Central Intelligence, was listed as a charac-
ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that Mr. Holms:
signed a letter of recommendation to the Kennecott Copper
Company on Mr. Hunt's behalf. Mr. O'Malley recalled being
contacted in the last month of Mr. Hunt's Agency service by
Mr. Mullen, who stated that a decision had been made to
expand their operations. In view of this expansion, Mr.
Mullen, had decided he would himself offer Mr. Hunt a job.
Mr. Mullen had stated that he was interested in having Mr.
liunt begin work immediately. However, Mr. O'Malley re-
called that Mr. Hunt completed retirement formalities and
actually started work for the Mullen Company approximately
a week to 10 days later.

O'Malley recalled that Mr. Hunt expressed dissatisfaction
with that suggestion in part because of what Mr. Munt
viewed as that firm's political orientation.
did not claborate further on that remark.
Mr. O'Malley
then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,
Mr. O'Malley
Incorporated, a commercial cover entity of the Office of
Security. Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this.
organization was advertised in the yellow pages and that
Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-
vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion. Mr.
O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when
Mr. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,
Mr. Hunt responded, "Yes, they had done a fine job."
At this point Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from
his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Mr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.
O'Malley stated that this was categorically so.
he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied to him on a number of

occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to
be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used the
services of Anderson Security Consultants. Mr. O'Malley
volunteered the opinion that he suspected the electronic
countermeasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices
of the Committee to Re-elect the President..
.
.7. In response to a question as to whether he had
ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley
replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.
Mr. Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha
Mitchell. As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.
Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spite of the
fact that Mr. McCord told him he could do so on the author-
ity of the Attorney General.
ever referred either William Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.
Asked specifically if he had
McCord, Mr. O'Malley stated that he did not recall spécif-
ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he
had not referred William Shea to him. So, contrary to
previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that
in all probability Mrs. Shea was not referred by this
Agency to Mr. McCord.

with Mr. Hunt while at the Mullen Company on a continuing
basis, because Mr. O'Malley was interested in Mr. Hunt
for possible referral of other Agency retirees.
O'Malley also understood that there was Cover and Com-
Mr.
mercial Staff interest in the Mullen Company, and that
Mr. Hunt became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-
viduals expressed an interest in entering the public
relations field. Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointment
in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on
these occasions.

.5. Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions
requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with

ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with

Mr. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously

request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skills in
the area of locks and surreptitious entry. A resume of
Mr. Thomas C. Amato was provided to Mr. Hunt at that time.
It is Mr. O'Malley's recollection that Mr. Hunt specifically
stated that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was
needed in connection with a requirement of the Howard
Hughes Organization in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. O'Malley
stated the opinion that it was his impression that the
duties involved would include the monitoring of a listening
device in an undisclosed location.

for the afternoon of 20 February 1974 to interview Mr.
William Caufield, Chief, Certification and Liaison Divi-
sion, Office of Finance, and Mr. Joseph Hudson of Pinance
on the subject of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. At the outset of
the interview Mr. Caufield advised the undersigned that

Office of Finance, Mr. Thomas Yale, that discussion on
the subject of Mr. Hunt was to be carried out only with
the Office of the Inspector General.
that he had informed Mr. Yale of the requested interview

of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in
Madrid. A review of travel vouchers indicated that Mr.
Hunt and his family made accountings indicating departure
from Washington, D. C., on 5 August 1965 with un arrival
in Madrid, Spain, on 16 August 1965. The costs of this
travel were charged to the budget of the Western Hemi-

Station Support account. A subsequent accounting sun-
marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for
apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a
payment in the amount of $125 to Mr. F. Reid Buckley for
this purpose.
.4. It was determined that an allottes bank account
in Mr. Hunt's name had been established at the Riggs
National Bank of Washington. All salary and other non-
operational reimbursements were made to Mr. Hunt through
sterile check to this account. An operational account
was established for Mr. Hunt with the Chase Manhattan
Bank of New York City. A review of all payments made to
Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's
operational advanco subsidiary account, or 1442 account,
had been made. There was no record of any operational
accounts or advances being processed through this channel.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Interview with Mr. Raymond A. Rocca
on the David St. John Novels
IC Feds!!, lich 38
1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.
Frederick Evans and Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations..
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-
nation contained in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of the writing activities
of Mr. E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and Mr. Edward
Sayle.
2. During this interview Mr. Rocca was specifically
asked whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of
any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to write novels to improve the image of
this Agency. Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requested of the Counter
Intelligence Operations office to be provided to Mr. Hunt
for whether or not that staff had ever had any relationship
with Mr. Hunt whatsoever. In response to these questions
Mr. Rocca responded "on the record" that he has no knowledge
of any such arrangements nor at any time was he party to any
assistance or any requests for assistance to Mr. Hunt. Mr.
Rocca stated that the particular section which he had been
most actively concerned in the past years was responsible
for handling a variety of tasks categorized under the area
of "setting the record straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office was to counter misinformation cur- .
rently in the media or otherwise believed to be part of an
Reffort to discredit the Agency. Mr. Rocca feels that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt was engaged in any form of Agency
sponsored image activity would have probably lead to the
conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intelligence
Operations. However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that
this was not the case.

3. Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this interview. He was unable to
suggest alternate means of attempting to determine if
any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the
part of senior officials might have been involved rather
than an official sponsorship. It was agreed by all in
this discussion that the nature of any informal support
given to Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define
in the absence of any formalized agreements.

1. The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/OSG
have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this
memorandum. The check included chronological files of communi-
cations of which I was the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain
in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.
2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which
conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period
of my assignment to Madrid. The only points which I recall but
on which I have no documentation are these:
a. There were occasional joshing inquiries made of me
by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence
in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was.
that I knew only what I had heard rumored. For the record,.
at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his
having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during
the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain.
whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by
any Station member.
b. A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now
assigned to Guatemala, was given some information by an
informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spain
by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given
informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John
Oliver. That officer was charged with keeping abreast of
developments related to Vesco. The Station did not pursue
that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of
reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.

SUBJECT: Interview of Mr. Davis Powell
on the David St. John Novels
"
1. On the morning of 15 February 1974, the
undersigned interviewed Mr. Davis Powell, currently
a Budget Officer on the staff of the Deputy Director
for Management and Services. Mr. Powell is located:
in Room 7C18. During 1965 Mr. Powell was Chief of
Support of the then designated Western European Divi-
sion. In July 1965 a contract was written authorizing
salary and benefits to Mr. E. Howard Hunt for an assign-
ment under non-official cover to Madrid, Spain.
purpose of this interview was to determine if Mr. Powell

period.
:
J
2. Mr. Powell responded that from his recollection
it was Mr. Hunt's habit to deal only with the most senior
officer available. In this case Mr. Hunt dealt directly
with the then Chief of Western European Division, Mr.
Rolf Kingsley. Mr. Powell states that, in his capacity
as Chief of Support, any activity undertaken to support
Mr. Hunt's assignment to Madrid was undertaken second
and thirdhand on receipt of instructions from Mr. Kingsley's
office. He further stated that he was never briefed on
the purpose of Mr. Hunt's mission and could add little in
terms of speculation. Mr. Powell recommended that Mr.
Edward Ryan, who was then Deputy Chief of Western European
Division, be contacted. Mr. Powell also suggested that
Miss Martha Seville be interviewed. Miss Seville was the
Executive Secretary in Western European Division during the
time that Mr. Hunt's contract was written and Miss Saville
subsequently served in Madrid herself. Mr. Powell under-
stands that Miss Seville is currently assigned to the
office of the Chief, European Division.

}
i
Mr.
.1. The details summarizing an interview on 4 February
1974 with Mr. Nalter Pforzheimer, Curator, Historical
Intelligence Collection, were set forth in a memorandum
addressed to Mr. Steven L. Kuhn dated 6 February 1974.
Kuhn was briefed by the undersigned on this information
during the afternoon of 5 February, 1974. Later the same
afternoon, at Mr. Kuhn's direction, a conference was held
with Messrs. Scott Breckenridge and John Richards of the
Office of the Inspector General.
2. During this conference the speculation was entertained
that Mr. E. Howard Hunt had, in fact, been under Agency
Sponsorship with the knowledge of Mr. Richard Helms in his
preparation of a series of spy novels under the pseudonym,
David St. John If it can be accepted as a reasonabla
supposition that Mr. Hunt had some highly compartmented
financial arrangement authorized by senior Agency officials
to write these books, then it is likely that this relation-
ship continued after Mr. Hunt officially retired. It is
specifically noted that Mr. Hunt retired 30 April 19701
Subsequent to the retirement, a David St. John book appeared
in print in 1971 and another in 1972. These manuscripts
were apparently prepared during the time that Mr. Hunt was
employed by the Robert R. Mullen Company.
Legislative
3.4 Minutes from the Office of General Counsel make
references to a concern of Senator Saker over an alleged
financial relationship between Mr. Helms and Mr. Hunt
which continued subsequent to Mr. Hunt's formal retirement.
Senator Baker has reportedly made reference to a payment
of some thirty thousand dollars with the parenthetical
comment that Mr. Helms would not have that amount of money

;
to provide Mr. Hunt from his private funds. Mr. Richards
of the Inspector General Staff opinioned that if the
Agency had sponsored the St. John books, it was likely
that Mr. Hunt had so informed Senator Baker.
4. Adding possible weight to this line of speculation
is the fact that subsequent to publishing the last St. John
novel, Mr. Hunt published a novel entitled, Eduardo, using
his old Agency issued alias, Edward J. Hamilton.

C. He also suggested that another person--definitely no friend of
Hunt--who might have some recall or have picked up information about
the book-writing matter might be Anita Potocki of CI Staff, formerly of
Division D. (I gather that she did not have official knowledge, but because
of her dislike for Hunt, she made it somewhat her business to follow his
career.)

6. A check of Office of Security records did not develop
any indication that any of the David St. John manuscripts were
ever submitted for review in accordance with Agency regulations.
There is no documentary evidence currently available to the
Office of Security to either confirm or deny possible Agency
sponsorship of the books written by Mr. B. Howard Hunt under
the pen name, David 58. John..

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kuhn
SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections
1. This date, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor
to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of
Mr. Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances
of any Agency involvement in that effort.
2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear
on the matter, and that he was "reaching, "but stated that has he
reconstructs the matter:
a. He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing
a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-
quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and
agreed with idea that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate
that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.). Gen. Gaynor advised
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. The reaction
he recieved to his raising the issue was that "keep your stinking nose out
of this business." He stated that he was lead to believe that Mr. Helms
desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency
and that Huat's books were a part of the program to do so. He stated that
he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he
recieved lead him to believe this was the case.
->
b. He suggested that two people might be able to assist in clearing
the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Pforzheimer, both of whom were involved.

of all the details on an up to date basis

but being paid by the same source as before. He also advised that he kept'
Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's
activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her
recall about what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be
better than his at this date. (He also mentioned an incident in which Morse
Allen while on a TDY was told by a COS to ask Headquarters to remove Hunt
from the Area because of his direct liaison with the president of the country,
and other activities which were confounding station operations. Later, the COS
told Morse to forget about relaying the message, with the implication that
Hunt was being directed by higher authority in the Agency and the COS did not
wish to get in the middle by complaining. He said Morse would probably

accepted the suggestion and Mr. Pfortzheimer recalls that
subsequent copyright applications were submitted without
the address. Within five minutes of the conversation with-
Mr. Karamessines, Mr. Pforzheimer rocalls being called by
Mr. Richard Helms, then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Pforzheimer recalls the substance of the conversation as
being, "for Christ sake Walter, this is the first book to
come along and say something good about the Agency."
not leave the Goddamn thing alone."
"
"Why
3. The undersigned asked Mr. Pforzheimer, who to his
knowledge, would be in a position to confirm or deny whether
Mr. Hunt was under any form of Agency sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Mr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
only Mr. Helms or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
Mr. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Mr. Angleton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimer replied that he
doubted it seriously.
-
-
4. Mr. Pforzheimer went on to relate that he was
occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on one occasion being asked to research the Indian religious
rites involving use of funeral pyres. Mr. Pforzheimer
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Mr. Hunt's
subsequent novel Tower of Silence, which appeared under the
St. John pen name in 1966. Mr. Pforzheimer parenthetically
pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of
Mr. Hunt's two sons--David and St. John.
5. Tracing Mr. Hunt's career assignments, it is noted
that he was assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director.
for Operations then designated, the DDP/Operations Group, in
February 1965. The first David St. John book was publ
during 1965. From June 1965 through September 1966, Mr. Hunt
was assigned to Madrid, Spain as a Contract Agent. During
1966, three St. John books appeared in print, the highest out-
put for any year. Mr. Hunt published one book under the
St. John pseudonym in 1967, and one each in the years 1968,
1969, 1971 and 1972. Mr. Hunt officially retired as an Agency
Staff Employee effective 30 April 1970.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division.
SUBJECT:
Terence S. CRABANAC - Retention of
Royalties by a Contract Employee
1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is
entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency
salary.
2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's
cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may
remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works, that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his
"cover activities."

detail of his cover was unknown.
3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of
possible royalties earned by Crabanac as a result of his.

for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and his family to renew their
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully

one item appeared unusual. It was an
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

The Office of Finance has not found operational
expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.
6.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessines be questioned
as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred would have been charged.
7. Another possible course of action is to request the
Director to approve my asking a cleared contact at Chase
Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into
Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt
20 December 1973
::
1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.
I had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into
reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt.
4
2. Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964
(by which he fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill.
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn
Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamessines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-
ment by Helms. A mémo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel
(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan
called Coleman in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the
Embassy.
3. Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left.. The President of Uruguay visited President
Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor--
that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. So Hunt took another tour.
Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was
to be sent as DCOS to Madrid.
->>
4. After a couple of months--early 1965--Ryan called Coleman
in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,
told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know.
much about it. It came to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.
Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do
nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers
for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. · Coleman
said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was
no operational reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing anything.
i
