ed by his Cuban principal to obtain information relat-
ing to anti-Castro activities in the United States.
Through his contacts with anti-Castro
individuals, in Miami, the following information was

A meeting of anti-Castro leaders was held
recently at the home of Palayo Garcia. Manuel
Fernandez, former Secretary of Labor in Cuba,
acted as chairman, and the meeting was attended
by former Castro officials, such as Manuel Urrutia,
Manuel Ray, Felipe Pazos, Raul Chibas, Rufo Lopez
Fresquet, Danilo Mesa, Elena Mederos, and Efreu
Gonzalez. ($(4)
At the meeting, Fernandez suggested that
a committee be formed and efforts made to have
the committee travel to Cuba for a conference
with Cuban officials, in order to discuss the
release of political prisoners. It was believed
that the discussion concerning political prisoners
could be expanded to include a discussion of
differences between Cuba and the United States.
Those in attendance agreed that such a discussion
would be timely, inasmuch as it appears that Fidel
Castro is not completely satisfied with Cuba's
relations with the Soviet Union. If the discuss-
