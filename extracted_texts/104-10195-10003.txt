To the Director of Central Intelligence
Sir:
I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the
Central Intelligence Agency as defined below:
"The Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency is a group of
carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to
devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make
a career with the Agency."
In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faith-
ful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the
obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essen-
tial to the furtherance of its mission.
I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue
of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will
be my obligation to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty
as determined by the needs of the Agency, and I have been assured that in
order to carry out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this applica-
tion for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured
that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part,
just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my
tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory com-
pletion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compati-
ble insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall
be entitled to the benefits now available or to be made available in the future
to members of the Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency.

++
The first thing of note is the scattered work and educational history of this
fellow. On paper the case is all against him but in talking to him I conclude that
it is the case of a guy who failed to get the proper job and school guidance when it
- would have been most effective (immediately after discharge ). The guy has intelli-
gence (LA/5 61-01) but perhaps not the final grasp of things to make a go of a
technical degree in College. He probably would have done 0.k. with the Liberal Arts
course. At any rate he has decided on accounting as a career (finds he like it
and can do it well). He's had a tough life to say the least (how much bearing this
has had on his career I'm not trained to evaluate.) My final impression is that he'
neat, clean cut, sincere, reliable, capable of given the proper supervision. Types
about 40 xpm and is learning shorthand from his wife (who's applying as steno). I
think he'd do a competent job and perhaps with experience and training do a very
good one. Wants O/S at earliest opportunity for financial reasons.

JUL 15 10 37 AM '66
During the period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section
at JUWAVE his performance was, in the rater's opinion, not more
than adequate. He apparently was of the opinion the being in
charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing
and other related duties of like nature. As far as meeting the
payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but he
norzally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet
these deadlines. He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,
Finance Branch for betterment of the payrolling system, but un-
fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas
were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good
accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations. Suggestions
made to him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was
determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.
Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject was barely
adequate in performing his assigned tasks.

Lovide best
Indicare significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give OFFICE OF
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in
basis for determining future personnel action. Monner of performance of managerial or supervisory dates and cost consciousness
in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicab
space is needed to comple re
Section C; attach a separate sheet of paper.
1510 37 AM '66
During the period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section
at JMWAVE his performance was, in the rater's opinion, not more
that being in
than adequatē: He apparently was of the opinion, not more
charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing
and other related duties of like nature. As far as meeting the
payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but he
normally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet
these deadlines. He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,
Finance Branch for betterment of the payrolling system, but un-
fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas
were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good
accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations. Suggestions
made to him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was
determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.
Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject was barely
adequate, in performing his assigned tasks.
