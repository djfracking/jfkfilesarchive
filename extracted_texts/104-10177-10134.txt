First published as the "Chilean Times", August 1, 1851.
FRANCE IN MOROCCO
HERE has always been discussion about the peculiar
T
trait of human natur, which finds expression in à feel-
ion of pleasure in contemplating the misfortunes of
others. The great Lucretius in his poem "De rerum natura"
tells of the satisfaction enjoyed in witnessing, from the safety
of the shore, the shipwrecked mariners struggling in the
but he does not seem to have found anything reprehen-
in the sentiment. Nowadays we should, of course,
Indignantly deny any such baseness in ourselves. though
we may not be so sure about "the other fellow" who is quite
capable of putting a banana-skin on the path for our special
benefit. However this may be. it cannot be ignored that
the "foreign" press tends to gloat over the difficulties of
Great Britain. formerly in India and Palestine, now in Iran
and Egypt, conveniently forgetting the fact that no country
in the world with International responsibilities can hope, in
present world circumstances, to evade situations dangerous
• to national prestige.
Just twenty years-no
more have passed since a
magnificent "Exposition Coloniale" was held in the Parisian
suburb Vincennes, which attracted visitors from all parts
of the world and was proudly pointed to in many countries.
as being convincing evidence
evidence that the great nations of
Europe, and the United States with them were in no way
disposed to accept the concept of "the twilight of the West”
or to renounce their "mission civilistrice“.
How stands that Colonial Empire today? It has to be
remembered that France, as a colonial power had a great
asset shored by no other Western nation-the absence of
a rigid colour bar. The extending to "native" peoples of the
full rights of French citizenship went beyond legal formulae;
mixed unions are not frowned on and "a touch of the tar
brush" or of yellow paint in the For East, conveys no stigma.
whatever other handicaps may have to be overcome.
Moreover, colonial France has called forth the energy, and
in not a few cases, the genius of great soldiers and admin-
istrators, second to none, and whatever may happen in the
fug their place in history is secure. Nevertheless, though
the coleur still flies over many lands and over millions
of many races, all of them, potentially if not actually, overseas
Frenchmen, the wave of nationalism rising to full tide after
the disasters of the second world-war has swept away many
land-marks that seemed to have their foundations firmly
based in tradition. Syria and Lebanon, with their great French
Crusader castles, specking still of warriors and heroes of the
past who. lelt their giant bones from Anticch to the Gulf of
Aquaba and beyond-all gone. On Indo-China and Annam.
Tonqum and Madagascar, we see French dominion fighting
there for very life, and fate hangs daily in the balance
Now the interest and anxiety concentrates on Morocco, a
question that really concerns all French Africa, north and
Central.
In Morocco the position is peculiar. Less than fifty years
• ago, though so necr Europe, Mcrccco was very little known
and foreigners were not welcomed there. The mutual jeal-
out of European powers helped to perpetuate this situation
unted became intolerable, and-in return for the usual shady
agreements nut to interfere with the ambitions of others else-
were. France was given a free hand to go ahead. By 1912. it
was possible to speak of "pacification," and since that date,
with a shadowy nutive ruler in nominally supreme authority.
the civilizing of Merccco had gone far enough by 1913 for
that country' to have its "pavilicu" in the Exhibition. But unde;
the surface nationalism fermented, raising difficulties for the
Sullen as well as for French milltary and civil authorities,
These difficulties have now become acute, and have been
ised in the United Nations by the representative of Irek, in
<rn that led the French representative to leave the Mandate
Commission during thearng. It is not only Great Fr
1.c. to inegalable in the Mediterranean ures!

_ who could not pronunce it correctly. The same idea is
used in today's warfare. English speaking troops often
employ words that compet be pronounced easily by the on-
position. The idea even went further in an anecdote publi-
shed in these pages a few weeks ago. American solder to
unknown: What are the words of "The Star Spangled Ban
ner"? Answer: "Damned if I know them". Soldier: "Advance
American soldier, and be recognized."
"Burcombe", also known as bunkum, was the name
of a U. S. Congressman who made a pointless speech to
Impress his constituents. "Chauvinism", the practise of blind
patriolism, comes from the name of Chauvin, a soldier who
was continually boasting of Napoleon's g'cry. "Cabal", an
intrigue, is a word composed of the initial letters of the
nomes of five English gentlemen who conspired against
authority. With these words we have hardly started in an
investigation that can be as exciting as reading detect ve
sicries. But if the history and use of words is an interesting
study, the observation of the mis-use of words is even more
fun. We blush to say that we have an Aunt who "blurshes"
* when she is excited and often remarks on the "beautiful
revenue of trees" in front of her house. Aldous Huxley once
wrote a delightful story about a young man who thought
the word "carminative" meant rad, of or pertaining to that
color. Huxley recourts how the fellow bandied the word
Wabout in an intellectual manner, and, most of the time cat
away with it since none of his listeners knew the aùference.
Actually the word describes a remedy for fetulence: And
now we are going to stop before association makes someone
think of descriptive words for this twittering.

A low weeks ago I commented that the perforniances

To anyone who may feel offended at my comments about
the name of the company. I apologise most sincerely, but
nevertheless I still consider that the Name, Karadura Koncert.
Kompany, was a crumby one. Or should say "krumby"?...
încidentally, the suggestion put forward by "JOE" last week
that the apparent lack of enthusiasm on the part of the new-
members may be attributed to the fact that there are now
more ladies who qualify for membership, and so forth.

I recall a dinner at
the Country Club, two or three years ago, at which the
ladies sang the barrack room ballades of the 1939-1945 at-

And anyone who states that the ladies cre not as keen

D. A. P. in his "Hell Box" the other week expressed his
confusion at vagaries of the English Language as used by
the reporter of a Cricket Match. He needn't feel so upset
about it, because I am more than sure that there are many::
Englishmen who would be as equally puzzled by many of
the terms. And I can't imagine a greater punishment for
any Englishmen than to be cast on a desert island with the
Sports Section of an American newspaper as a sole
companion. I have to confess that, even after a residence:

employees of the Bank that had the doubtful honor of c

points of the game. Once it was explained to me very,
carefully by a profound student of the sporting world how
Baseball was evolved from cricket, but I can't even recall*
that interesting point . . . Maybe the fact that the ground
which the team used was attached to-Tromer's Brewery in!
Brooklyn, and the liquid refreshment was good and plentiful
has something to do with the fact that I didn't pay as much
attention to the game as I should have done . . As for the
word "innings", which bothered D. A. P. so much, I was

Once upon a time there was a Very Old Lady who lived by herself
in a smalt brown house. She had a rocking chair, a thick storybook, and
a clock that chimed. Every day the Very O'd lady sat in her rocking

stories from the thick-book. There was a story about a white topped

But at eight o'clock the chimes d'd not play. At nine the Very Old
Lady put away the thick storybook, turned out the light, and went
to bed. She thought and thought about the chimes and wondered
what could have happened to them. She wondered whether they
would ever play again.
The Very Old Lady was a'mest asleep when she thought she
heard a oneer sound in the room. It was close to her ear. She sat up
in bed and lighted the lamo. She got up and looked in all the corners

There was no one there.

"It must have been a dog barking outside,” said the Very Old
Lady. And she turned out her light and went back to bed.
“Don't turn out the Ught!-I-can't see,” commanded a tiny voice.
The Very Old Lady sat up and lighted the lamp. And there on a
post of her bed stond a wee man no taller than the Very Old Lady's
thumb. He was wearing a little brown hat, brown trousers. and a
Jacket as green as the grass in the meadow. On each of his boots
glittered a rolden buckle.
"My good-vas!" exc'almed the Very Old Lady. "Who are you?"
"I'm Chymer," said the wee man. "I play the chimes in your
clock."
"Bet the chimes didn't play tonight," said the Very Old Lady.
"I know!" said Chymer. "I'm Ured of p'aying them. Every hour
of every day for years and years I've played the chimies. I want a
vacation. I want to travel. I want to see 'a'l forests and gray castles
and white-toned mountains and blue oceans. I'm going to go places
and see all these things!”
The Very Old Lady smiled and nodded her head. "Yes," she said.
"They are beautiful, Rut those things are all many miles away. How
will you travel so far?”
"I'm going to walk," replied Chymer. He pointed to his feet. "See
my shiny new boots!" he said proudly. "They have thick soles; so
they won't wear out."
"But you're so tiny!" exclaimed the Very Old Lady. "You will be
stepped on. Dogs will growl at you. You'll soon be hungry and cold
and tired if you start out to see all those things.”
Chymer's face grew sad.
"Oh, dear!" he said. "I didn't think of that! Perhans I'd better
not go after all. But I can't play the chimes for you when I'ın not
happy. And I'll never be happy arain until I learn all about the
beautiful places and things in the world."
The Very Old lady was silent for a few moments. She was think-
ing of the chimes that sounded like the song of a hird in springtime
and a babbling“ brook and a cooing baby. She was thinking about the
gee man who wanted to travel to tall forests and
mountains and blue oceans. At last she spikė. -
white-topped
“I eo traveline every day." she said. "Every day I read my thick
story hook. It, tells me about..many, beautiful places and. things in.
the world. If you will stay and play the ch'mes in my clock. I will
read to you from my hook. Then, in imagination, we can travel
together all over the world.”
And that is just what happened. Every day after that the Very
Old Lady sat in her rocking chair by the window, with Chymer perched
on her shoulder. The Very Old Lady read to h'm from the thick
storybook. She read abort the whitetopped mountain in Janan, the
gray castle in Spain with a thousand rooms, and the golden horse -
in Africa that could run faster than the wind.
After that every hone, day after day. Chymer climbed into his
home in the clock and rang the chimes-ch'ues as sweet as the song
of a blid in springtime, as sweet as a babbling brook rippling over
· pobhlea, as sweet as a baby couing to its mother.

the United States in preparing reports and furnishing contacts in
the newspaper and lecture field in the United States and abroad.
He will work closely with PP/CRTV Office.

Memorandum of 14 February 1949, entitled "Security and Operational
Clearances," a covert security clearance is granted for the covert
use of the Subject as described in your request set forth in
paragraph 1 above.
3. The Subject is not to represent himself as, nor is he
to be represented as, an employee of CIA.
4. Your attention is called to the fact that a covert security
clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
of CIA Regulation 10-9. Therefore, if you should desire at a later
date to change the status or use of this individual, a request
for clearance to cover any proposed change should be submitted to
this office.
5. This clearance becomes invalid in the event the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this
memorandum.
