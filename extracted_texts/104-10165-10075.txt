in Feiti. These schools and centers will be under the
auspices of the American Orthodox Church.
5. Joseph-Charles's authorship of the telegram which virtually promised ·
telegres which virtually promised
the concession to the new group indicates that his fortures may be

him more favorably than he has done in the recent past.

Naturalized US citizen of Eaitian birth, who makes frequent trips
to Eaiti. Source waistairs close contact with Haitians in the US
and with prominent business and political figures in Haiti.
1. During recent weeks, the fortunes of Cleward Joseph-Charles seen
t: have improved. He has been playing a not unimportant role in
the award of the Haitian gambling concession Collector's rate:
see reference.), an activity which is designed to bring to Eat
some badly-needed foreign exchange. Although I do not believe
that he sees President Devalier es frequently as he used to priar
to his incarceration, he does seem to have recovered some of the
confidence which the President used to repose in him.
2. One reason for President Duvalier's dislike of Charles (and cre
possible reason viny the President eventually threw him in jail)
is that Charles was instrumental in bringing about the marriage
of the President's daughter, Marie-Denise Durrellier, to Colonel
Hax Dominique. Charles and Marie-Denise bave been close friends
for many years. Marie-Denise became pregnant by Dominique and
went to Charles for help. Charles then intervened with Presi-
dent Duvalier, who was Arious, and persuaded him to agree to
the marriage. The President was bitterly angry at Dominique and
somewhat unjustly blamed Charles for the marriage. He agreed to
the recessity for the wedding, but resented his zev son-in-law
and, by association, so to speak, resented Charles. The President
and Dominique have formally reconciled. The President net Colonel
Dominique at the airport, when the latter returned to Haiti, and
made a point of inviting his son-in-law to ride in the presidential
limousine from the airport to the palace. The purpose vas to
demonstrate the burial of old grudges. It remains to be sees,
however, whether or not the reconciliation was genuine and whether
or not the President has really forgiven his son-in-law.

3. Luc-Albert Forcard, Haitian Minister of Tourism, is now in politi-
cal, if not personal, eclipse. He no longer goes to his office.
The New York City manager of the Haitian Tourist Bureau, Jean
Ramah
Sorel, is in Eaiti and is acting in Foucard's steed.
Theodore, Deputy Director of Tourism, is amiable and is a friend
of President Duvalier. He 13, however, of little stature and
is not capable of doing anything more than the routine daily
chores of the office. Foucard cannot afford to call attention
to himself, because he is fearful for the physical safety of
his sister, Madame Saint-Victor. President Davalier recently
dismissed her as his personal secretary and replaced her with
his daughter, wife of Colonel Max Dominique. Since then, rumors
have abounded that Mademe Saint-Victor may be marked for physi-
cal liquidation Collector's note: see reference.]. Whether
or not these mora have any foundation in fact, there is no
doubt that the members of the Foucard family (1 e, Luc-Albert,
Madame Saint-Victor and their sister, Madame Bella Poucard
Poitvien) have all made themselves as inconspicuous as possible.
The President's change in secretaries has led to a diminution
of the power and influence of the Foucard clan.

1. As part of his effort to obtain foreign exchange, Haiti's President
Duvalier has decided to award a gambling concession. A US syndicate,
consisting of a Yew York City firm, Keynote Associates, and of Count
Michel Levitch, Bishop of the American Cathodox Church, has been
see reference
trying to obtain the concession. [Collector's Note:
for additional details.].
12. The Bishop has severed his comfections with Leynote, which bombarded :
President Duvalier with telegrams and made an unannounced trip to
Haiti to obtain the concession.
3. However
, Keynote received a telegram from Antonic André, Direc-
tor of the Bank of the Republic of Eaiti. This message informed them
that they would not receive the concession. President Duvalier
relies very heavily upon Aniré for advice and guidance in economic
matters.
4. Almost at the same time that Keynote received André's telegram,
Clevard Joseph-harles notified the Eishop that he would re-
ceive the concession on the fallowing ters:
c.
A new group of associates of the Eishop will receive
80 percent of the moss receipts from the concession.
The Government of Eaiti will receive 10 percent of the
gross receipts.
The Bishop and his chief partner vill receive five per
cent of the gross receipts.

REPORTED THAT CAMBRONNE WAS A MEMBER OF A COMMISSION ASSIGNED
BY DCVALIER TO INTERROGATE THE PERSONS ARRESTED DURING THE WEEK
OF 1 APRIL 1970.) WHILE CAYARD WAS WITH DUVALIER, CAMBRONNE.
TELEPHONED DUVALIER TO SAY THAT CAYARD SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED
BECAUSE HE (CAMBRONNE) HAD IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF CAYARD'S
COMPLICITY IN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PLOTTING. DUVALIER ASKED CAMBRONNE
TO REPEAT HIS ACCUSATION WHILE HE GAVE CAYARD THE TELEPHONE
RECEIVER TO LISTEN. FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION WITH CAMBRONNE,
DUVALIER REASSURED CAYARD OF HIS TRUST IN HIM AND REQUESTED
CAYARD TO ARREST TWO COAST GUARD OFFICERS DURING THE COURSE OF
THAT WEEK. CAYARD AGREED TO FOLLOW THE ORDER, BUT TOLD DUVALIER
THAT HE KNEW THE ADDRESS OF ONLY ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS.

Political Prisoner
in Hospital
Clemart Joseph Charles was taken
from the National Penitentiary in Port-
au-Prince to Haiti's General Hospital.
The former Duvalier banker has been
jailed since 1971 "for political reasons"
No proper trial was held.
Mr. Charles is suffering from an
acute liver infection and the physi-
cians attending him have warned that
he will die unless he's allowed to tra-
vel abroad for special treatment.
This isn't the first time Mr. Char-
les was taken from his cell to a hos-
pital. Last year he was rushed to
Haiti's military hospital for treatment
of the same disease.
Mrs. Charles has been allowed to
visit her husband.
This is the first time the Duvalier
regime has acted half humanely with a
political prisoner. It's been pointed
out that Marie-Denise Duvalier Domi-
nique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has
often interceded for him.
Army chief-of-staff Jean-Baptis-
te Hilaire will soon be replaced, say
military sources in Port-au-Prince.
His likely replacement? Col. Roger
St. Albain.
On a lighter note, the General ran
for cover on September 22 while there
was a review on the Palace grounds
to commemorate Duvalier's "election"
in 1957. Accidentally the loaded auto-
matic weapon of a militiaman went off i
Many offcials, General Hilaire among :
them, scrambled for protection. Jean-
Claude, his mother and their body-
guard General Gracia Jacques were
trembling, but they kept standing, says
1a-source that was standing close

SOURCE
A reliable source from a Haitian exile leader who is well
educated and who has a wide variety of contacts in Haitian
exile groups.
The exile was aware that his information
would reach the U.S. Government.
1. Clemard Joseph Charles, former president of
the Commercial Bank of Haiti who has been held political
prisoner since April 1970 on charges of plotting against the
government, was recently transferred from jail to the general
hospital in Port-au-Prince. Charles is said to be dying of
cirrhosis of the liver and was transferred to the hospital on
orders of Madame Simone Ovide Duvalier, mother of
Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier.
A
2. Doctors recommended that Charles be sent abroad for
proper medical treatment but Mme. Duvalier authorized his
transfer only to the local hospital. According to close
relatives, this occurred only after Minister of Interior and
Defense Paul B 1 an chet told the President and his
mother that he would refuse to become involved in this case
and would not sign any papers required of him as Minister
of Interior certifying that Charles had died in prison.
Relatives of Charles still intend to press for his removal from
the country.

MEMORANDUM FOR
REFERENCE
:
Deputy Chief, WH/7
Your request this subject
Following our receipt of information that Clemard-
Joseph Charles had taken a list of requirements into
the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and asked help in
filling them, WH Division sent a memorandum on
19 August 1969 to the Chief, DCS, asking that DCS's
contact with Louis A. Brun (from whom Charles had
received the requirements) be terminated.
The DCS New York office on 29 August 1969 sent a
memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted
Brun had been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded
that no further requirements would be given him. This
memorandum did not, however, say that contact would be
terminated; in fact, it said they would continue to de-
brief Brun whenever he returned from a trip to Haiti.
This memorandum was sent to Port-au-Prince (HTPW-1347,
17 Sept 1969).
The Station replied (Port-au-Prince 6496, 11 Oct 69)
that this was not enough, that the contact should be
completely severed. WH/Branch 7 officers then met with
Mr. George Musulin of DCS to discuss the matter further,
WH/7 officers maintaining that there was more political
action hazard to this contact than the FI product
justified. Musulin agreed to raise the matter with
C/DCS. The result was a memorandum on 16 October 1969
from C/DCS to C/WHD which referred to the original WHD
memorandum of 19 August and advised that contact with
Brun has been terminated.
(DIR 48277, 21 Oct 69).
Port-au-Prince was so informed

IN THE AMOUNT OF $600,000.
2. IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN, THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD WAS REGARDED
AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN AND, THEREFORE,
CAYARD AND CONSTANT AGREED TO INCLUDE JACQUES IN THE JUNTA ON THE
GROUNDS THAT IT WAS A NECESSARY EVIL. CAYARD'S ONLY CONTACT WITH
JACQUES, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN INDIRECTLY THROUGH CAPTAIN

Headquarters agrees with Station that the con-
tinued contact between Subject of 201-357029 and IDEN
on behalf of WODISH, poses a potential security threat
for the LNEARP components in Eiti. Upon receipt of
Ref C, the Desk sent a nemorandum to Chief, WODISH, an
19 August 1969, which forvarded a resume of the Ref C
information, and requested that the contact between
IDEN A and Subject on behalf of WODISH be terminated.
2. On 29 August 1969, the FODISH officer who is in
contact with IDEK, replied to the Desk's memorandan as
follows.
m.
Ve (VODISH) have carefully considered the
Deak's comments re IDEN A and his relationship with
Subject. We have concluded that in the matter of t
nine questions concerning the activity of foreign
companies in Haiti, IDEE & has been guilty at
least of sloppy security procedures and (ve) have
decided to modify our relationship with his.

was originally introduced to TODISH in New York City.
by Subject on 15 April 1966. Until the early fall of
1967, much of WODISH activity with IDEN A was devoted
to arranging contacts with various elements of LNHARP,
which IDEN à requested on behalf of Subject, and
reporting operational information. To the best of
VODISH knowledge and belief, however, none of these
contacts produced any tangible assistance to Subject's
various schemes. With two exceptions, WODISH
relationship with IDEN A since October 1967 has been
exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection.
The exceptions were Subject's request for a secret
meeting with a WOLADY envoy in May 1969, and an
independent similar request from another group in
the same month. As has been fully reported, IDEN A
made it perfectly clear to WODISH and to Subject
and to the other group that he was acting only as
a channel and that he was not actively involved or
interested. We (WODISH) simply transmitted the
request. We wish to point out that what the Desk
calls IDEM's "Lobbying" for Subject ended before
October 1967. During the nearly two years in
which the contact in the WODISH New York Office
has dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored
or "lobbied" for Subject's various schemes. IDEM A
has occasionally relayed information concerning them,
but has told WODISH repeatedly that he no longer
vishes to be involved politically with Subject.
"C. We wish also to point out that IDEN A, as a
regular supplier of foreign intelligence on Haiti,
has supplied data which originate with Haitians
other than Subject, and, therefore, IDEN Å is not
merely Subject's mouthpiece. Specifically, IDEN B
and insx C are two of IDEN A's Bitian sources.
IDEN B is a well-known Haitian businessman; IDEN C
is a former deputy.
"d. We (WODISH) are not concerned with Subject,
but are very much so with IDEN A. We do not believe
that IDKY A is involved in any current revolutionary
scheme in Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the

request IDEN & to consult Subject about the requirements
on foreign companies and, in view of the manner in
which IDEN A. handled our requirements, we shall
continue only to accept information which he proffers
on his return from his frequent trips to Haiti, and
shall refrain from briefing him. We have requested
our TOBOMP customers to give us an evaluation of
IDEX &'s intelligence reporting. Unless this evaluation
is unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit IDEN A
in the manner just described. Insofar as contact
tetween IDEX A and Subject is concerned, (1) we cannot
prevent IDEN A from talking to Subject (or anybody
else), but (2) we have never in the past and shall
not in the future request that IDEM A contact Subject
on behalf of VODISH,
3. To date, the VOROMP evaluation of IDEN A's
reporting has not been received. However, since WODISH
has agreed to refrain from briefing IDEN A prior to any
future trips he may make to Haiti, there should be no
recurrence of the type of situation described in Ref C.

Ordre, Progres). Charles hopes that TOP will become one of two or
three political parties in the post-Duvalier period and is convinced
that TOP will win a constitutional victory at the polls and propel
him to power. In the meantime, Colonel Kesner Blain will be the head
of the provisional government. Blain has no long-range political
ambitions. Charles and his colleagues plan a new constitution for
Haiti, which will provide for a President and for a Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister will exercise the effective power. Charles expects
that TOP's electoral victory will make him, as TOP's leader, Prime
Minister in the new constitutional government.
Reportedly, Charles recently received from the US (no additional data
available) the sum of US$230 thousand. This money is to be used to
finance the overthrow of President Duvalier. I cannot confirm the
accuracy of this reported gift.

Opponents of Haitian President Francois Duvalier have formed a new

Cayard (Commandant of the Eaitian Coas: Guard); Captain
Daniel (assistant to Cayard); Gérard Constant (Haitian Army Chief of
Staff); Colonel Kesner Elain (in charge of Haitian Army quarter-
master depots); and Colonel Gracia Jacques (Commandant of the
Presidential Palace Guard). [See 00-3-321/05913-69 (paragraph 2-e)

Contact with
Louis A. Brun/Clemard Joseph Charles
1. On 29 July 1969, Station Port au Prince advised
that Clemard Joseph Charles had passed a list of nine
questions concerning the Haitian economy to an official
of the United States Embassy in Port au Prince. The list
of questions was written in English in standard U.8.
Goverment format and, although sterile, appeared to be
intelligence requirements. Charles told the Embassy
official that he had just finished a "big job" for the
Pentagon and implied that the list also came from the
Pentagon. The Embassy official suspected that Charles
had passed a copy of the list to the National Palace.
2. On 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haiti
Desk contacted Hr. George Husulin, Operational Support
Staff of DCS, and learned that the US office in New York
had briefed Mr. Louis A. Brun and had orally passed a
list of CIRL, requirements to Brun concerning Haiti prior
to his trip to Haiti during the week of 21 July.
Er. Musulin speculated that Brun had probably noted the
DCB requirements on paper and then had passed a copy
to Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.
3. For a number of years, the United States Govern-
ment has been aware of the political ambitions of Charles
and his alleged plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime.
In 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprison-
ment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charles
has been trying to obtain support from the United States
Government for his plots but he has been consistently
rebuffed. Charles is not held in high esteem by U.8.
officials and his motives are highly questionable. He
oves his position in Haiti to his relationship with
Duvalier and his ability to successfully manage some of

"
the more notorious financial rackets of the regime.
Charles enjoys no political following and even the "plots"
with which he is associated are viewed with considerable
reserve. For example, we have never been able to confirm
that Charles was involved with the "military junta" formed
in May 1963, as he claimed. In February 1959, the U.8.
Embassy in Port au Prince commented that, with regard to
the most recent plotting of Charles, "the possibility
cannot be excluded that Charles....could be a provocation
to determine the real motives of the United States Govern-
ment towards the Duvalier regime.” We concur in the
Embassy's views.
4. During the past three years, the WH Division has
been kept advised of the contact between DCS and Brun and
his relationship with Charles. We are also aware from
DCS and other sources of the efforts by Brun to obtain
support from the United States Government for Charles.
Brun is, of course, a close collaborator of Charles and
a business representative of his in New York City. Brun
has contacted officials of the Department of Defense,
the Department of State, and even a person with access to
President Johnson on Charles' behalf. The Chief of
Caribbean Affairs of the Department of State categorically
told Brun in June 1967 that the United States Government
was not interested in supporting the plots of Charles or
anyone else against Duvalier, but this advice seems to
have fallen on deaf ears. The most recent example of
Brun's lobbying was in May 1959 when Brun passed on to
DCS a request from Charles for a secret meeting between
a U.S. envoy and a representative of the "military junta.”
Brun's involvement with Charles requires that he be con-
sidered a biased source of information. While some of the
information Brun has obtained from Charles has been of
interest, there is hardly anything that was not available
through other channels and indeed, much of it was slanted.
5. As was set forth in VH/7 memoranda to the
Operational Support Staff, DCS, on 16 July 1968 and
28 May 1969, we interpose no objection to DCS maintaining
contact with Brun for its own purposes. However, the

relationship between Brun and Charles has now takes os
operational characteristics (agent/sub-agent) with Brun
levying requirements oa Charles in Haiti to service on
behalf of DCS. The relationship between Brun and Charles
also has manifested political and security aspects which
could adversely affect the interests of the United States
Government regarding Haiti. Accordingly, we request
that the contact between Brun and Charles on behalf of
DCS be terminated.

:
ACTION REQUIRED: See Paragraph 5.
1. The Station would like to offer its views on
the WODIS contact, through Identity of Paragraph 1
Reference A (hereinafter IDEN), with 201-357029, as well
as on the question of the requirements which 201-357029
gave LNPURE and which were forwarded to Headquarters in
Reference B.
2. Since IDEN has been told that his contact is with
L&SHOE and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since
201-357029 has apparently, in his mind at least, converted that
fact into contact with RVROCK, and has probably spread both
stories with his associates and thereby throughout the local
milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation.
When we consider that the LNPURE receives all the information
that 201-357029 gives IDEN anyway, and most of the time receives
the information directly from 201-357029, then we have an
operation that is difficult to justify.
3. In the case of the requirements forwarded with
Reference B, we have a situation in which wODISH levied.
requirements on 201-357029, through IDEN. 201-357029
then turned those requirements over to LNPURE which returned
them via 201-357029 and IDEN to WODISH. Why not cut out the
middleman and the security complications, and save the headaches?
4. The Station feels that the WCDISH handling of 201-357029
results in a case that has the potential of causing severe
problems for AKULE, and that it could well be that AKULE will
be made to bear the blame since elements within RVROCK might
feel that the ultimate responsibility for supervision of the
case lies with AKULE.

been received that certain officials of the Huition Army
are trying to form a yasts to take power in the event Duvalier
dies. Bown members of ts junts are reportedly anxious to
overthrow Duvalier, should be recover, but so far have not
establimbed a timetable or decided how they intend to carry
out the coup.

inspired anti-Duvalier plotting by other groups in iti

Request by Haitian
Opposition Group for Secret Interview
with U.S. Official
:
1. This
morandum will serve to confirm the telephone
conversations between your office and the Chief of the Haiti
Desk on 15 and 27 May 1989 concerning the request made
through Mr. Louis A. Brun on the above subject. During these
conversations, your office was advised that the WH Division
has no interest in contacting any representative or member
of the plotting group. ·
3. The WH Division considers Cleward Joseph Charles
to be a perennial anti-Duvalier plotter in Port au Prince
with little means or following to carry out his anti-govern-
ment designs. During the week of 11 May 1969, Charles
approached the Embassy in Port on Prince with basically the
same information as relayed to the DCS office in New York
by Mr. Brun. The only difference was that be did not request
that a U.S. Government official make contact with the intermal
, but rather that the Embassy provide A BOO
that the U.S. Government would look benevolently on the group
once the coup was launched. The Embassy replied that the
U.S. Government had a firm policy not to intervene in such
matters and that no such assurance could be expected.
DOMO
3. Since 1967, Charles has made similar overtures to
the U.S. Government for support of his enti-government plans.
Then revieving these approaches, there has always been sose
doubt as to the accuracy of the information that Charles
(or Brun) has furnished.
furnished. While it was accepted that Charles
was actually plotting against Duvalier, it could never be
determined if he was actually a member of the plotting group,
which usually included members of the Haitian Army, or 18
