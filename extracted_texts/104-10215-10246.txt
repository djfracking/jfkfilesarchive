Tasks: This project conforms to the tasks assigned to the
San Jose Station in 301-46, DI EI and E2.
4. Personnel:
8.
This project, involves in addition to HUMANOID, HUMANKIND-1;
HUMANKIND-3; KU:ANIST-2; and HUGGER, to be designated hereafter as
HUMANOID-1; HUMANOID-2; HUMANOID-3; HUMANOID 4 in the order they are
listed.
b. HUMANOID, is an American citizen, was born in 1922 in DeKalb,
Illinois. He joined the United States Air Force in April 1946 and
spent approximately five years doing general Air Force intelligence
vork. Subject is presently living in San Jose, Costa Rica where he
has been attending school, and since June 1949, when project EUMANOID
was first activated, subject has been the most valuable single agent
of the San Jose Station.
5. Cover: Subject is established in Costa Rica on a purely persona..
basis with no apparent connection with the San Jose station. He is a home
owner, married, and is a fully accepted member of the community on that basis.
Subjects activities in connection with HUMANOID-3 will be handled through
safe house facilities to be acquired by the station. It is felt that the
processing of the material acquirei from HUMANOID-1 & 2, can be done in the
office of the Chief of Station, because of the small quantity of this type
of material. The cut-out and direction activities of HUMANOID-4, will be
handled by HUMANOID in periodic meetings in cafes, bars, or coffee shops,
logical meeting places in San Jose.
6. Contact and communications: Contact between HUMANOID and other
personnel involved in this Project is described above under Cover.
-
7. Control: The control of HUMANOID-is-based upon-his-past-service-
record with the US Government, demonstrated loyalty, and the judgment-of-the-
present and former station chiefs in San Jose. In addition HUMANCID is a
US citizen, and needs the financial assistance he receives for the performance
of his duties.
8. Special Equipment: No special equipment is involved.
9. Coordination: This Project was originally initiated with the
cooperation of the Panama-Station. Continued coordination-with-Panssa
other station_is_not_considered_necessary or desirable.

Excellent and of major importance to this
station.
Information produced by subject through his
sub-agents is in some instances,
.)
documentary and of value. In other cases,
it is eye-witness, high level, and of
considerable value.
Current operational restrictions on this
agent presently prevent full exploitation
of his potential.
.
'
Due to financial pressure, explained in
TRSA-1142, HUMANOID has recently undertaken
a part time job at the School of Agronomy.
His work deals with laboratory and dark
room photographic assignments and is
connected with a Costa Rican Government
project in Ceology. Subject is the most
valuable agent available to this station
and is believed capable of further developed
ment in the event current operational
restrictions are removed. He is conscient- u
ious, hard working, loyal,imaginative, and
amenable to supervision. In view of his
interest in a long range career, a reply
to the question posed in TRSA-1142
concerning career agent status would be
appreciated. Subject has been aware of the
recommended salary increase which has been
pending for over ten months. Although he
has not questioned the delay, it is obvious
that his self-confidence-and-professional-
pride have been shaken somewhat by the lack
of official recognition. We feel strongly.
that agent has earned a raise and that an
increase at this time is not only justified
but would be in the best interests of our
present and future operations. PLEASE

SECURITY INFORMAT
SECRET
TRSA-1142
His
activities and personalities and his grasp of the
various revolutionary movements and figures has been
freely shared with the Station Chief. These "briefing:
meetings represent an intangible contribution to
the over-all performance of this Station. Subject is
eager to expand his operations, and, if headquarters
approves the removal of present operational restric-
tions, it is believed he can be given further
responsibilities, particularly in the recruiting of
additional sub-agents. This Station is presently
interested in accomplishing a parallel penetration of
the Communist Party, in expanding routine investiga-
tive coverage, and in developing additional sources
on political movements. It is believed that subject
has potential in each of these fields. However, as
reported previously, HUMANOID is beset with financial
problems which undoubtedly detract from his full
working efficiency on matters of interest to us.
GI subsistence is currently terminated during the
school vacations and a certain portion of his time is
devoted to odd jobs in an effort to augment his
income. The former Chief of Station recommended an
increase from 1,000 to 1,500 colones in July, 1951, a
recommendation in which the writer concurred. However,
in the event current operational restrictions are
removed, it is desired to recommend at this time an
increase to sixteen hundred (1,600) colones per month.
The additional one hundred colones permonth is
suggested in view of the fact that subject has
borrowed money in recent months to meet hospital bills,
and because he has been aware of and probably counted
on the raise recommendation of the former Chief of
Station. Further, if the restrictions are lifted, it
is desired to utilize subject's time to the fullest
advantage without the handicap of his having to seek
other outside employment.
In an effort to evaluate more accurately subject's
agent-handling ability, the writer monitored a
specially arranged 45-minute contact between HUMANCID
and HUMANIST-2. From a concealed vantage point less
than three feet from the participants, the writer was
able to hear and see HUMANOID's handling of this sub-
agent. The results were worth the effort. HUPANOID
demonstrated complete control over the discussion,
exhibited a natural ability to elicit desired details,
and issued instructions in a commendable manner. It
appeared that subject-has-the-complete-confidence_and_
loyalty of HUMANIST-2 and that his working relation-
ship with this important sub-agent leaves nothing to
be desired.

Subject is presently receiving 1,000 colones

A raise in salary is believed
justified and is recommended below.
Services of this agent are extremely valuable.
As the principal cutout of this station he is
charged with the direction and guidance of
the most productive sub-agents we have at the
present time. His handling of these agents is
carried out in a professional and efficient
manner, and his personal comments and corrections
on their reports, based on his long acquaintance
with local personalities and conditions, are
of considerable value. His attitude remains
enthusiastic and willing.
The information produced by the agents handled
by subject is probably the most valuable being
obtained by this station. In addition to
routine production, this agent's operations
are well-suited to checking on information
received from other sources.
Subject is presently seeking another safehouse
to serve as a meeting place with subagents and
for the processing of material produced by
HUMANKIND-1 and 3. The photographic studio

Mr. John Cavadine
Training Report on Arthur G. VAIVADA, (P) -
Training Alias: "VICKS"
1. Arthur G. VAIVADA was trained covertly by instructors of this
office in Washington, D. C. from 5 October through 25 November 1953.
The original Training Request Form dated 31 August 1953 reveals the
following pertinent information:
"Subject is thirty-one years of age, married, and a U. S.
citizen by birth. VAIVADA's previous intelligence experience
includes eight years with the U. S. Air Force. During this
time he served as an intelligence specialist in the Panama
and Burma-India Theaters. In 1949 he was employed by CIA.
and spent most of the following four years in Costa Rica
where he was engaged in the spotting, recruiting, and handling
of agents. Although subject has never lived in his proposed
area of operations, he possesses a fluent command of the
Spanish language. VAIVADA's future assignment, under contract
agent status, will be that of principal agent with the primary
objective to develop information on the Communist Party in
Argentina. He will also be expected to penetrate or direct
the penetration of the Argentine Communist Party."
2. The instructors who participated in Subject's training indicate
they were most favorably impressed with VAIVADA and feel that he is
qualified for his proposed mission. He possesses a sound practical
knowledge of basic clandestine operational principles. He should
become an increasingly valuable agent in the long range work of this
organization.
3. VAIVADA received instruction in the subjects set forth on the
attached Training Evaluation Reports. The following supplementary
reading and discussion material were also covered.

Instructor's Comments:
VAIVADA impressed the undersigned as an exceptionally conscientious,
mature individual. He has had considerable field experience, yet, he con-
ducted himself during training as though this experience was only secondary
to the more important task of improving his basic knowledge of clandestine
activity.
Subject completed several excellent reports covering assigned reading
material. These reports revealed the extent to which VAIVADA went to do a
thorough, complete job. His oral discussions of the training material
further substantiated the sincere effort this student made to obtain as
much as possible from the training program.
Subject demonstrated and personally expressed his satisfaction with
the progress he made and the benefit he obtained from the instruction
presented to him.

Instructor's Comments:
VAIVADA has had considerable experience in the field, but he was
ready to broaden and enrich his experience with the help of training.
He has a strong bent toward his own opinion and exhibited independence
of mind in analyzing Communist Party activities. He had no difficulty
in absorbing the material presented. He has the ability to apply theory
to practice and apparently is a person who is accustomed to rely upon-
his own judgment. His written work was excellent. He recognized his
own shortcomings and readily accepted constructive criticism. From all
the evidence during training, VAIVADA appears capable of handling the
assignment proposed for him.

Instructor's Comments:
VAIVADA appears to be a hard, conscientious worker. He is quick and
alert of mind and possesses maturity of judgment. Subject studied the
training material with enthusiasm and expressed the desire to improve
himself. VAIVADA displayed an excellent understanding of tradecraft
techniques as portrayed in his written work. He has the ability to apply
theory to practice. His goal was to improve himself to the best of his
ability, as his past experience in the field had been on a trial and
error basis. His experience in South America might account for his
unhurried thinking and action, but it will undoubtedly assist him in his
future operations as he simply refuses to become ruffled or panicky. It
is the belief of this instructor that VAIVADA is well qualified for his
proposed field assignment.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:
Special Deputy, WH
Mr. Ross CROZIER
4 December 1953
By pre-arrangement through Mr. Smyser I had an interview with Mr. Ross
Crozier in my room at the Hotel Raleigh on the night of 2 December 1953
for the purpose of getting an impression as to whether it was possible
that he could be used to advantage in our program.
Mr. Crozier has been a contract agent in Costa Rica for approximately 4
years. He is married to a Costa Rican and has 2 children, ages 2 and 4..
He was in a student capacity in Costa Rica. From my knowledge of .
reporting done by the station in Costa Rica and the indication of sources
of information in reports from that station, I am inclined to think that
he very ably handled himself. In addition, I was very much impressed
with him during the course of the interview and feel that he is an ex-
cellent type, having all the necessary qualifications for giving sub-
stantial assistance to our program. He has 7 months remaining under the
GI assistance bill for educational purposes and it can be satisfactorily
arranged by him to complete his education at San Carlos University,
Guatemala. Under the Guatemalan law his wife, being a Costa Rican,
becomes a Guatemalan citizen upon her establishment of residence in
Guatemala and this is a distinct advantage.
He has a valid U.S. passport on which his two children are carried but
it will be desirable that he enter Guatemala as a tourist, either with a
tourist visa in his passport or on a tourist card. The children could
also be issued tourist cards. The use of a tourist card eliminates
the necessity of his reporting to the police. He can stay 6 months and
then obtain a renewal of the tourist card without leaving the country.
Within a relatively short time he unquestionnably could be of distinct
advantage to us on reporting on activities and attitudes of students and
other elements.
He could act as a cut-out. I feel that he is qualified to actually
develop a penetration into the Communist Party, a feat with which he
had some success in Costa Rica. He could handle an important PP opera-
tion with Enrique SALAZAR Liquens (also known as Oscar H. CARTA in
station files), which operation is presently being handled through
Donald O. Hediger. Irrespective of whether Hediger continues with
Guatemala or is given assignment outside the country, I believe that it
is important to have Crozier with us in Guatemala. We can find plenty
for him to do.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE
SUEJECT:
EIRADIAL
Security Information
25 November 1953
On Wednesday 18 November 1953 subject was introduced to John Heyn. The
introduction was desmed advisable, inasmuch as it would probably facilitate
sibsequent meetings in Buenos Aires where it is anticipated that subject will
be operating, providing his visa is granted.
BIRADIAL indicated he had not heard from the Argentine Embassy of Costa
Rica, hance is planning to have his wife write to follow this matter inmediately.
BIRADIAL mentioned the fact that his wife's relatives, and with whom he
may dwell when he first moves to Buenos Aires, may be in a position to assist
in obtaining a visa for subject. He indicated that having a native of the
country render some assistance in this regard may be the solution to any possible
difficulties. It appears logical, however, he was informed not to make any
approaches at this time.
He agian noted that inasmuch as it will be necessary to stop in Costa Rica
to pick up his visa when granted, he suggested the possibility of leaving for
Costa Rica shortly following the termination of his covert training. As previously
indicated he felt that his presence in Costa Rica, where he can plausibly maintain
himself and his family, and where he may be in personal touch with the Argentine
Embassy, may be to his advantage in securing his visa.
On 24 November 1953, subject called to inform he had received a letter
from the Argentine Embassy in Costa Rica informing him his visa had been denied.
He informed he still felt he could obtain it but it may be necessary to seek
assistance from his wife's relatives in Buenos Aires or it may be necessary to
go back to Costa Rica for a short period to finalize the matter. Too, he
suggested that in the event he cannot obtain the appropriate permission to enter
Buenos Aires the Agency may desire to send him some where else in Latin America,
possibly Cuba (he mentioned specifically) or some other country. In this
connection, he felt that cover-mise he and his family would be in a more secure
position if they were in Costa Rica while awaiting placement.
I plan to see BIRADIAL on 25 November 1953.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Record
SUBJECT
Project HUMANOID
1. A total of $5934.00 was originally requested for this project
for the period 1 March 52 to 28 February 53. The amount actually
approved was $6000.00 (Form No. 51-91, project folder).
2. $5100.00 of the approved amount was to provide for the compen-
sation of four agents who were to be reimbursed as follows:
HUMANOID
HUMANOID-1
HUMANOID-2
1600.00 (colones)
150.00 ( If
250.00 ( 11
900.00 ( 11
3.
HUMANOID-3
The funding requirements for agent salaries were calculted
(by the Headquarters case officer, Tom Barrett) at a rate 8 to 1 (e.g.,
HUMANOID was to receive $1600.00 or $200.00 per month).
4. However, the rate of exchange has fluctuated since the original
funding estimates were made. The present rate is 6.63 to 1. Accordingly,
the monthly pay scale for HUMANOID in U. S. currency would be approxi-
mately $241.00 (or $1600.00). The pay scales of the other agents are
similarly effeated.
5. This situation was explained to the Budget office (Mr. Bauer,
extension 2017) and the Plans office (Mr. Ziegler). I stated that
dollar expenditures would be in excess of the amounts provided in the
project if we were to continue payments to the agents at the colon
rates previously established. Mr. Ziegler informed me that we could
nonetheless continue the present colon pay scale. He further advised
that budgetary adjustments could be made at a later date when it became
evident that the project allotment would definitely be exceeded due to
currency fluctuations. A project amendment is not then required at
this time. The station may be advised to continue payments in colones
in the amounts shown in paragraph 2, above.

Security Information
20 hovember 1953
On Monday 9 "ovember 1953 a meeting was held with subject for the primary.
purpose of delivering hissalary for October 1953 amounting to 350.00. A receipt
for the amount was obtained and returned to Mr. Wolcott, Finance Division. h
copy of the receipt is retained in subject's file.
During the meeting, subject reported his schooling at American University will
terminate in approximately three weeks. "is scheduled Covert training will also
come to an end during the first week in December 1953.
Subject related he has not as yet received any news on his visa for Argentina
for which he made application approximately 90 days ago. You will recall that
subject anticipated it would take approximately 90 days to obtain such a visa.
BIRADIAL informed if he doesn't receive word on his visa within the next
week he plans to have his wife follow this matter by writing to the Argentine
Embassy in Costa Rica.
in
Subject also presented this thought in the event no results are forth coming
within the next two or three weeks: He related that in so far as his friends and
wife's relatives in Costa Rica are concerned, he and his wife and family are in
the states on an extended trip. They are expected to return to Costa Rica.
so far as he knows, he, his wife and the Argentine Consul in Costa Rica are the
only persons in Costa Rica aware that they have made application for the visa
under question. in the event no positive results are obtained on his visa
application, subject wondered about the advisability of returning to Costa Rica,
to finalize his visa affairs and depart for Argentina.
The question of maintaining cover while in Costa Rica was discussed. In this
connection he informed he would have no trouble finding a suitable job which
would lend authenticity to him and his wife's status. Too, it was indicated, and
it appears somewhat reasonable, for subject to remain in the U.S. presently for
too long a period of time may raise some question as to his true status in the
minds of Argentine Embassy Officials in Costa Rica as well as his friends and
relatives in Costa Rica.
.
It is suggested that consideration be given to allow subject to return to
Costa Rica within the near future if the appropriate Argentine Visa has not been
received to: (a) Allow him to finalize such details (b) To preserve his cover
status.
Contact will be maintained with subject for further developments. It is
anticipated that John heyn will meet subject at the next meeting for the first
time. This is recommended, inasmuch as Fir. Heyn who will be in the pertinent
area, may be able to familiarize himself with subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE
SUBJECT:
BIRADIAL
On Wednesday, 14 October 1953 i met with subject at his apartment in
the Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia for the purpose of obtaining
his signature on the Travel Voucher prevously submitted covering his travel
from Costa Rica to Washington, D. C.
BIRADIAL indicated that the combination of his schooling at American
University in the mornings and his covert training in the afternoons which
also keeps him busy during the weekend, is keeping him fully occupied.
Though he did not press the issue, he wondered whether it would be necessary
to continue his schooling at American University. He indicated he thought
he could handle any inquiries regarding his activities satisfactually. We
both decided however that, regardless of the hardship placed on him, he
should continue his schooling at American University since any inquiries
could then be properly and legitimately backstopped. One of the difficulties
involved is the amount of daily travel between the University and his
residence.
oe
Inasmuch as the distance involved plus the high rental cost factor
(175.00 per month) present a few difficulties. This plus the fact that the
plausibility of a student paying such rent is somewhat questionable, BIRADIAL
indicated he might move to a more suitable location.
On 23 October 1953 he informed he was moving to 5008 - 7th St., N. W.,
Washington, D. C. as of this day for cover, convenience, and financial
considerations. He will advise of his new phone number if and when it is
available.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE:
SUBJECT: BIRADIAL (202-2723)
7 October 1953
:
On Monday, 5 October 1953, the writer met with subject at his apart-
ment to deliver the necessary "credentials" allowing his proper entry to
covert training facilities.
During this meeting he informed that he was too late for entrance
to George Washington University. He was then in the process of making
inquiry at American University.
He also mentioned that he opened an account with a bank in Alexandria,
Va. I'm not so sure that this was such a good idea--but the account has
been opened. He had had an account with the Chase National Bank; however,
he has closed this account since he claims he received such poor service
from this bank while at his previous station. He stated he would like to
have an account established with a large banking institution which has a
branch affiliation in Buenos Aires where he will be assigned, so that his
pay may be deposited in the U. S. securely by us.. It is suggested this
be worked out with Finance.
On Wednesday a. m. subject called to inform that his home phone number
is now Temple 6-8651. He has enrolled in American University and will attend
· classes daily from 9:30 a. m. to 11:30 a. m. He is studying Corporate Finance
and other analysis courses. During the conversation he expressed amazement
at the cost of $93 for schooling for one semester. Although he did not
request reimbursement for this amount, it was inferred that he would undoubtedly
appreciate it if this expenditure could be absorbed by us.
In view of subject's past excellent performance in behalf of this Agency,
and inasmuch as he is not highly paid, it is recommended that Agent be
reimbursed for this expenditure even if it means amending the project.
Agent has not been paid for the month of September. I shall check
with Finance and deliver Agent's salary to him.

Request for Amendment
P.2219
1. Project BIRADIAL concerns the transfer of Contract Agent rumanoid from
Costa Rica to Argentina, with interim training at headquarters. Since
approval of the project on 12 August 1953 Humanoid is now known as
BIRADIAL.
2. BIRADIAL, an American citizen born in illinois in 1922, is married to a
Costa Rican girl and has two small children. Since 1949 he has worked
for CIA in Costa Rica as a contract agent and has proven himself particularly
adept at spotting and recruiting agents and has successfully supervised the
direction of a high level Communist party penetration agent. He has been
the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.
3. BIRADIAL has been accepted as a student at the University of Buenos Aires
for the school year beginning March 1954. He is presently undergoing
covert training.
40
In order to enhance BIRADIAL's cover while undergoing covert training, be
has enrolled at American University at a cost of $93.00 a semester
commencing 7 October 1953 and is pursuing his studies four days weekly.
5. Since BIRADIAL is attending class at American University to enhance his
cover during his interim covert training at headquarters, it is requested
he be reimbursed in the amount of 93.00 and the project amended accordingly.

SECURITY INFORMATION
2 October 1953
BIRADIAL 202-2723
1. On 1 October 1953 the writer as Ceorge Wheeler was introduced to
Agent Arthur G. Vaivada (P) by J. G. Hanke at his apartment B-21, Van Euren,
Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia. The introduction was deemed
advisable, inasmuch as Agent is to be inherited by branch II.
Mr. Heyn
informs he is not available to handle Agent at this time but will meet him
in about three weeks.
2. In accordance with instructions received from Covert Training
Offices, Agent is to report for covert training at 2400-20th St. H. N.,
Washington, D. C. on 5 October 1953 at 1415 Hrs. He is to ask for Mr.
Cal when he arrives. Agent is to be known as Hr. Vicks. The instructions
were passed on to the Agent. He was also informed to call X2298 and ask
for George Wheeler in the event he desired to make an appointment to discuss
business matters.
3. In connection with agent's previous inquiry regarding the possibility.
of obtaining U. S. Citizenship for his wife, Mr. Hanke informed him that
under the circumstances under which his wife entered the U. S., namely as
a tourist, it would not be possible to plausibly apply for U. S. Citizen-
ship. Hanke also informed that although possible to rush the Citizenship
through, it was felt inadvisable at this time since the proceedure might
jeopardize the present existing cover arrangement. Agent seemed to
understand the difficulties involved and raised no particular objection.
4. Agent informed several neighbors had inquired as to the nature
of his business. He has informed them that he is a student and is
studying at George Washington University in the field of Economics.
This story had been decided upon before the writer came upon the scene.
Since Agent has not commenced study at Gif it was suggested to him that
he commence taking a course or two as soon as possible. He informed he
would do this as soon as he learns of the details as to his hours to be
devoted to Covert Training.
-
5. Although there is no assurance subject will be granted permission
to enter Argentina, subject previously indicated he could forsee no problem
in this regard. He did make inquiry, however, as to what his status would
be should he not be allowed entrance to Argentina.
6. It is unfortunate that Agent is residing in the Washington D. C.
area inasmuch as that in itself is undoubtedly considered as a Government
Stigma. The possibility exists that the wrong person or persons will learn
of his and his wife's presence in this area.
7. The file fails to reflect what provision, if any, has been made to
pay the Agent. This will have to be worked out.

for their travel there later. She had seen him previously around in San Jose, dressed
in sport clothes and apparently a "playboy." He injected himself into a discussion
between the Argentine Consul and HUMANOID's wife, showing great knowledge of Argentine
visa regulations. This occurred in early July 1953.
3. HUMANOID's wife again saw the same individual in Panama on 22 August 1953, at which

SUBJECT:
HUMANOID
Fil. BIRADIAL
18 September 1953
i
1. During the time that HUMANOID was at Headquarters on TDY in late August ard
Early September, he raised the question of the citizenship status of his wife, who hee
not yet taken out her first papers but wished to do so if possible. His question was
whether it was operationally desirable on our part, which I answered saying it would be
XXX (after talking with Mr. Heyn). Actually, there is no strong advantage, but at least
it should be started sometime, and there is no advantage to us in having her remain
a Costa Rican since she will be an American citizen at some date in the future.
2. Wahn HUMANOID left on his vacation, it was understood that I would be checking
with Mr. Heyn about the means by which his wife might be able to start her papers while
HUMANOID is in training at Headquarters. By understanding is that she would have to leave
the country and recenter an an immigrant quota since she is presently on a tourist visa
and cannot as such apply for citizenship even if her husband in a U.S. citizen.
3. Mr. Heyn informed me that there is a section which handled these questions
of citizenship for people we are interested in, and said he would be checking with that
-person. I told HUM. NOID that the next person who handled him would be able to give him
further details on this whole matter.
4. I would recommend that HUMANOID be given all help possible to have his wife
started on her papers before they go our under BIFADIAL, sime they will be gone for
two years at a minimum and will be delaying her citizenship that much longer if nothing
is started while they are here in the country.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
SUBJECT:
Interview with Arthur G. VAIVA DA
10 stat 53
!
1. On 9 September 1953 subject was again contacted at his apartment and the new
contract was signed. Subject was told that the contract clause dealing with additional
committments not included in the contract was standard agency protection against unauth-
orized promises by persons contacting him, such as the case officer. He was told, how-
ever, that the case officer's personal experience has been that the agency makes all
possible efforts to act in good faith and with common sense if contract problems
arise at a later date.
I
2. The "offset"provisions of the contract was explained, emphasizing the agency's
view that any future cover business activity on his part would be possible only
because of the salary we pay. Therefor, modest profits, if any, would be offset against
salary due to him. It was pointed cut that the case officer's understanding was that
if subject's diligence resulted in sizable profits, the agency would probably consi er
revising the contract to allow subject a share of the profits. However, subject agreed
that this question was really subordinate to the main purpose of a cover activity,
&
which would be to obtain cover, not profits.
NOTE: Subject's questions appeared motiviated by the contract form, which was
more complicated and "legalistic" in appearance that the ne written in the field
under which he has been operating for the past four years. His attitude at all times
was most cooperative, and he agreed that the spirit in which the contract was carried
cut, on both sides, was as important as the provisions. It was carefully explained to
him that the contractserved the double purpose of defining the rights and
obligations of both himself and the agency, EMXXIX and for that reason may at poirts
seem more "legalistic" than a regularly necessary. However, subject stated several
times that he had had nothing but the best of relations with the rersons who have
directed him so far, and it is the case officer's opinion that he has XII the utmost
faith in the good intentions of the agency.
3. Subject was informed that "Career" status, in which he has expressed interest
over the past two years, would be considered at the end of the present the year contract,
and would depend on his operational success during that period and his ability to
provide durable cover which would enable hi to continue working for us.
4. The subject's travel reimbursement is being handled by Hanke (x3504), and will
be ready for him when he returns to washing' on on or about 2 Cctober. Subject went on
vacation effective 10 September and will be at the following addresses during his
vacation:

September 15-25: Mr. L. E. Crozier

5. Subject will contact the case officer on his reutrn to Washington. He has
been given the following address in case he wants to contact us before that time:

Mr. Arthur C. Vaivada
Dear Mr. Vaivada:
Reference is made to your contract effective 1 June 1949 with ODYOKE
for the purchase of information and services of a confidential nature.
Effective 31 August 1953 said contract is hereby terminated by mutual
consent of the parties thereto and in lieu thereof the following contract
is substituted:
ODYOKE, as represented by the contracting officer, hereby contracts
with you for the purchase of certain information and related services of
a confidential nature under the following terms and conditions:
1. Compensation. In full consideration for the purchase of such
information and services, you will be paid an amount calculated at the
rate of $4200 per annum. Payments will be made as directed by you in
writing in a manner acceptable to KUBARK. No taxes will be withheld
from this amount, and it will be your responsibility to report such income
under existing Federal income tax laws and regulations.
2. Allowance. Effective upon your arrival at your permanent post
of duty overseas, you will be entitled to a Quarters allowance equivalent
to that granted a OS-7 Government employee stationed at the same permanent
post of duty. This allowance will be at the maximum rates prescribed in
the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas). No
accounting for this allowance will be required by KUBARK. In the event
that Quarters are provided by your cover company, you will not be entitled
to the Quarters allowance herein indicated.
3. Travel. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for travel and
transportation expenses for you, your dependents and your household effects
to and from your permanent post of duty overseas and for you alone for
authorized travel within your operational area. You will be entitled to
per diem in lieu of subsistence during such travel and while in training
in PBPRIME. All travel, transportation and per diem provided for under
this paragraph must be properly authorized, and expenses incurred hereunder
are subject to payment and accounting in compliance with KUBARK regulations.
4. Operational Expenses. In addition to the allowance indicated
above, you will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary operational.
expenses including, but not limited to, entertainment and the purchase of
information as specifically approved by KUBARK. Such funds will be subject
to accounting in substantial compliance with KUBARK regulations.

d. Subject will use a cover story while in Washington that he is studying at
George Washington University in the field of Economics.
d. Subject's wife has a close friend in Argentine who is married to an Argentine
arry sergeant. Her nore is Alicia Castro de CRUZ, 25 de l'ayo #5327, kar del Plata,
Argentina. This name has been given to the Argentine Consul as a charecter
reference.
f. Subject has 6-7 months of GI bill eligibility left for Argentine studies.
Due to the fact that subject's wife his been witting of his general activities,
it was carefully explained to him that the agency had certain reservations
considering this point. Emphasis was put on the point that good operational
security practices in his future assignment would be of extreme importance
for obvious reasons. It was pointed out that this interim period in Washington
would be an ideal time to separate his activities from home life since his wife.
would no longer be in a community where she and her Jusband were well known.
He was frank in admitting that he realized the dangers also, and would cooperate
to the fullest extent.
NOTE: Subject is sensible in his approach to security and appears to think through
each problem on its own merits. The extent of his wife's knowledge was to known
that he was "going out to (a section of San Jose) for business reasons". She wes
Sawiting of his conrection with Communist activites, since on several occasions
she was able to contact persons when it was not suitable for him to do so. At no
time has she pressed him for information, and his general feeling is that she
should be told only enough to explain undue al sences from home. He was cautioned
that his future superiors whold take a dim view of his wife's participation, even
to the limited extent he has indicated did occur in the past. He agreed that
being in a new community with no local friends of long standing would make
easier for them io start on this new basis.
It is the case officer's opinion that subject has carefully controlled his'
fife's knowledge and acted prudently in matters involving security. His
operational achievements are evidence that his security practises have been
sound, and it is believed that four years of covert contact with a well-known
Communist in San Jose with no security breaches are sufficient proof of his
wife's security consciousness.

MENGRAHJEM POR TILE
SUBJECT:
Interview with Arthur S. VAIVAIK
:
1. On 28 August 1953, Arthur G. VAIVADA was contacted at hotel in Washington, D.C.,
by the Costa Rican desk officer. Subject was briefed on the necessity of submitting
an accounting of travel expenses and given the outlines of his training scherule. He
also signed a pseudonym acknowledgement. In addition, subject was given his full August
salary of $250 (old rate), although it developed that he had been given a half months'
salary by the station prior to derarture. He was told this overpayment would be subtracted
from his travel reimbursement.
2. On the night of 30 August 1953, subject was contacted at his apartment in Virginia.
He requested our opinion as to the possibility of his wife's starting to take cut citizen-
ship papers now prior to departing for Argentina, and the desirability of this for
cover ressons. He was told that the agency would probably not object (he would be given
a definite answere in the near future), but that it right not be possible anyway since
his wife was on a tourist visa. (This answer was also promised soon.) He was told that
the new contract to to signed could not give either life of hospitalisation insurance,
for reasons of cover. He was told that career agent status, which would be considered
at the end of the two year contract to be signed shortly, would allow life insurance, but
not hospitalization. It was explained to him that his present contract did not acknowledge
him to be a U.S. Government employee, but that career agent status would grant that.
NOTE: At all times the subject impressed the case officer with sincerity, willingness to
abide by agency decisions in all matters, and showed a most cooperative attitude.
3.
Subject made the following points while discussing his Argentina assignment:
His application for entrance to Argentina as a student is now in the hands of the
Argentine Consul in Costa Rica. It should be granted in three months. He does not
forees any problems in this respect, but did ask what our plans would be if any
thing did prevent his going there. He was told that we would attempt to place him
elsewhere, but that this was a contingency we couldn't make any plans about until
Bozething prevented his present assignment.
´b. Subject will keep in touch with the Argentine "onsul through a friend in Ohio
who will handle incoming and outgoing mail. This address has been given to the
Consul. He believes that this offers no security problem, since the friend is
an officer in the Aft Force who briefs outgoing military attaches at Wright Field
and as such has a full security clearance. This friend is witting of subjectIs
activities to the extent that he knows subject to be working partine for the
U.S. Government in some sort of assignment. Subject's friend will be cautioned
in this respect.
Subject has told his parents that he is studying at MT for awhile before deciding
where to complete his studies. Communication through them will be through a frierl
at NCT on whom he submitted PRO data when this friend was in San Jose earlier this
year. (A security clearance request has been made by HD/III)." Subject's friend
is also witting to a certain extent since he gave very general information when
obtaining the FRQ data. For personal reasons to do with his marriage to a Costa
Rican, there is no chance that his family in Illinois would make any sort of a
trip to see him.

The attached project is presented for approval.
2. Project BIRADIAL concerns the transfer of Contract Agent
HUMANOID from Costa Rica to Argentina, with interin training at
headquarters. Upon approval of this project, HUMANOID will hence-
forth be known as BIRADIAL.
3. Since 1949, BIRADIAL, a native-born American, has been
the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station. He successfully
directed and exploited a high-level penetration of the Communist
Party of Costa Rica. Among other accomplishments, he recruited
two rail intercept agents, processing the take himself, and has
recruited three additional agents presently being used; he also
set up safe-houses and was in charge of the monitoring post in a
technical surveillance. In the latter instance, his quick thinking
in removing the equipment prevented its discovery, when the opera-
tion was blown due to circumstances unrelated to his handling of
the operation. More recently, BERADIAL personally entered the Com-
munist Party headquarters surreptitiously during the May Day cele-
bration and carried off more than 75% of their official records.
His case officers have been impressed with his initiative, security-
mindedness, and ability to exercise good judgement under operational
stress. BIRADIAL's transfer from Costa Rica to another area has
become necessary due to the expiration of his cover status as a
student there.
4. BIRADIAL has already created his cover for the first year
of his new assignment in Buenos Aires, having been accepted as a
student at the University of Buenos Aires for the term beginning

MIYORANEJK FOR THE CHIEF OF POREICH INTELLIGENCE
SUBJECT: Project HIRADIAL
5 August 1953
1. The purpose of this project is to provide for the covert training
and transfer of a contract agent from Costa Rica to Argentina, where the
latter will develop penetrations of the Communist Party of Argentina (PCA)
and Communist front organizations and perform support functions as assigned.
2. BIRADIAL, an American citizen born in Illinois in 1922, is married
to a Costa Rican girl and has two small children. Since June 1949 he has
worked for CIA, under the cryptonym HUMANOID, in Costa Rica as a contract
agent. He has proven himself particuallrly adept at spotting and recruiting
agents and has successfully supervised the direction of a high-level Communist
Party penetration agent.
3. The agent has been accepted as a student at the University of Buenos
Aires for the school year beginning March 1954. He will try to establish
himself in the photography business, in which he is well-qualified and has had
previous experience, as an ostensible means to make ends meet while completing
his studies.
4. Contact and communications between BIRADIAL and his case officer will
be clandestine, under pretexts still to be arranged. Communications between
the former and any agents or sources he recruits will be arranged according
to the circumstances.
5.
BIRADIAL has been dependent upon this Agency for the past four years,
which financial dependence has increased considerably over this period with
the increase of his family. His motivation is patriotic, and his past actions
and achievements have borne this out.
6. The estimated annual cost of this project is $5,705 salary and
allowances (GS-7), $3,550 travel and per diem (to U.S. for covert training,
leave and return to Argentina), $500 transportation of effects and $720 for
operational expenses and travel, a total of $10,475.
7. WH requests approval of Project BIRADIAL for the period 1 Angust
1953 through 31 July 1954.

b. Personal data:
BIRADIAL is an American citizen born in Illinois in 1922,
who is married to a Costa Rican and has to small children.
He spent approximately 5 years doing U.S. Air Force intel-
ligence work in the CBI and Carribean Theatres. Since June
1949 he has worked for KUBARK in Costa Rica as a Contract
Agent under student cover. He is particularly adept at
spotting and recruiting agents and has successfully super-
vised the direction of a high-level Communist Party
penetration agent.
5. Cover:
a. Clandestine contact will be arranged between the agent and
the case officer. In view of the sensitive nature of his
objectives and the modest position he is likely to occupy
in the American community in Buenos Aires, it is regarded
as inconsistent and insecure for BIRADIAL to enter into a
social relationship with his case officer.
b. Subject has been accepted as a student at the University of
Buenos Aires for the school year beginning March 1954.
Having a wife and two children he will try to establish him-
self in the photographic business, ostensibly to make ends
meet while completing his studies. He is qualified and has
had experience in this business before. By the time his
studies are completed (in about one year) he proposes to
have developed his photographic business sufficiently to
provide adequate cover, justifying his remaining in Argentina.
6. Contact and Communications:
7.
a.
The case officer will contact BIRADIAL directly to provide
him with direction and collect his reports. Both are native-
born Americans. Contacts will be clandestine upon pretexts
still to be arranged.
.b. Any sub-agents subsequently recruited also will be contacted
clandestinely. They will be confined to persons within the
normal social and business strata of BIRADIAL.
C.
No special problems of contact and communication are anti-
cipated.
Control:
Subject has been dependent upon this Agency for the past four

to develop information on FC penetration of government circles.
BIRADIAL will perform cutout duties as assigned by the Chief of
Hission.
5. The estimated cost of this project for the first year is
$10,475.00. This includes: salary of $4205 (CS-7 level) plus
allowances of $1500%; operational travel $120%; operational expenses
$600%; the balance of 34050 comprises $2650 for the travel of 31-
RADIAL, his wife and two children from Costa Rica to the United
States and thence to Argentina; $500 for the transportation of
personal effects either from Costa Rica or the United States to
Argentina; and $900 for per diem while in travel status and
during training at headquarters. Subject is selling most of his
personal effects in Costa Rica. The normal annual cost of this
project therefore, would be $425.
use
6. BIRADIAL will be permitted to take one month of leave with
pay, before entering training. He justly deserves this considera-
tion. While in training a new contract will be signed with BIRADIAL
embodying the features outlined in paragraph 5.
7. Since it is urgent for the preservation of BIRADIAL's cover
that this project be implemented as soon as possible, it is requested
Sthat the effective date be 1 August 1953.

years. The degree of financial dependence has increased
considerably over this period with the increase in his
family. The necessity to meet these responsibilities
assure his readiness to comply with all directions to pro-
tect his job.
b. Subject is motivated by a sincere patriotic desire to ren-
der valuable service to his country. His aggressive at-
titude toward his work and the initiative he has summoned
in pursuance of the tasks assigned to him have constantly
borne evidence of his devotion to the protection of Ameri-
can ideals and interests..

None.
9. Coordination:
10.
Coordination with the Costa Rican Desk and Headquarters Covert
Training will be effected.
Timetable:
The project can be activated upon approval. For the preserva-
tion of BIRADIAL's cover it is important that the project be
implemented as soon after 1 August 1953 as possible. On that
date Subject must move from his home in Costa Rica, and should
then travel to the United States, since his studies and work
in San Jose have been terminated.
Duration of the project: indefinite.

11. Estimated Cost:
The following is an estimate of the cost for the FY 1954.

the past four years in Costa Rica. The San Jose Station was requested
to forward subject's file for your perusal; we hope that you are now in
receipt of this file.
2. This dispatch has the purpose of presenting to you Headquarters' appraisal
of HAND. A review of the Hondquarters file indicates that HUMANOID is
an aggressivo, rather woll qualified operative, dio has enjoyed a good
neasure of success and has exercised good judgment under operational stress.
He desires a career with this Apancy, and is devoted to the work. Subject's
academic education has been designed to fit him to becase an economist..
Prior to entering a contract relationship with EULARK, subject had received
U. 3. Army intalligancs training and had worked for Air Force Intelligenco
in Panama.
3. There follows a summary and appraisal of HUMANOID's work which has been
provided by the Headquarters Costa Rican Deak.
a. HUHAHOID was recruited by the Panama station in November 1948, but in
early 1949 he moved to San Jose, Costa Rica, where he enrolled in the
University of Costa Rica as a student of economics. In Juna 1949
Project HUMANKUID was activated, with subject handling and acting as
cutout for two mail intercept arants and a low level penetration of
the Communist Party. In October 1949 a very high-level penotration
of the Communist Farty was also turned over to the subject, who xas

Since that time [UDAHOID's main cuties have been to act as cutout
and direct those agents, with the exception of the low level penc-
tration who was dropped in mid-1952. HUNAGOID's most important
single activity has been in debriefing the high-level penetration
agent who ho has been ablo to develop to a point where HUMANOID and
this one agent constitute the most important assets of the station.
b. In the course of his operational duties, subject has proved himself to
be very security conscicus and to possess a degree of initiative which
has impressed the station chief on more than one occasion. He has
participated in setting up cafehouses, was responsible for recruiting
the two mail intercept, agents, mid has provided the facilities for
photographing the material these two agents turn over to him for
rapid processing and return to normal mail channala. Subject has
recruited two additional arenta, both of whom are presently being
ured, and carried out a cold recruitment attempt on a Comunist
which in still pending. AROID) participated in a technical sure
vaillance operation in early 1951 during which he was in charge of
the nonitoring post to other with an indigenous agent under his
direction. The operation was blown after a short time due to cir-
cunstances beyond his control, which had no relation, to the operation
itself or the way in which he ran it. Extensive checking cubsequently
allowed that he was not compraised and that his quick action preventad
any discovery of the technical surveillance equipment itself. Kost
recently, HUMANOID surreptitionaly entered the Commnist Party head-
quarters in Costa Rica on May Day and carried off over 75% of the
official records of the Party.
c. Subjoet is an expert photographer and at one time operated his omn
photography shop in San Jose. He is also fairly proficient in send-
ing Horse code, is trained in the use of firearms, and has studied
and worked with charts and maps. No vas trained in jungle warfare
during eleven months in the I theater during the last war while
with the Air Force. He is considered expert in writing reports.
Subject has proved himself to to knowledgeable in the usual techniques
of covert operations after four years of working in San Jose, and las
proved to be invaluable to the station in spotting and/or recruiting
additional agents.
d. HULNOI is married to a Costa Pican woman and has two children.

him on several occasions. There are no indications that she has in

8. The question of a career status was discussed with subject over a
year ago when he was in touch with the former chief of station now
at Headquarters, but no commitments were made in this regard,
although he told that it would be considered, depending on hin
future activities. He indicated his willingness to continue his
operational activities in any other country when his course of
studios andsd in March 1953 at the University of Costa Rica He
is presently sccepted for the March 1754 class at the University of
Luenos Aires where he hopes to get his BS in Sconomics. He has
discussed the question of covert training at Headquarters sors tine
in late 1953 prior to going to Argentina. It is Reedquarters'
understanding that he would come to Headquarters some time in late
August ur September for approximately two months covert training,
after which he might be directed to avait departure for Argentina
until some tizo in mid-Jamary 1954; in order not to arrive in the
area too long before his schooling starts.
1. Additional personal information on subject will be found in the San
Joos Station file.
4. HOANGID appears to be a promising prospect for consideration as one of
the individuals to be introduced into Argentina under unofficial cover,
in accordance with Country Plan objectives. Should you find his quali-
fications of interest and favor his entry into Argentina es a Mission
\ asset, please advise as early as possible, in order that necessary
travel detaile anal training schedules can be arranged at Headquarters.
In view of the higher standard of living in Buenos Aires and subject's
excellent record of service, an amendment of his present contract would
be effected mile he is in washington. Our present thinking is in terms
of annual compensation at 65-7 level ($4205). An American student with
a wife and two children will probably discover this amount to be name
too ample to maintain a normal standard of living. Your comments and
sugį estions mill to appreciated, particularly with regard to any allow
ances that would be appropriate.
5. An early reply would be especially helpful, since EUHAHOID has already
remained in Costa Rica three maths beyond the date of completion of
his studies and should leave thore by August. (He was requested by the
San Jose Station to remain through July to cover the inpanding elections.)
To shall await your reply pending any further action regarding HMROID.

Security Review of Current Operations
Project HUMANOID:
TRSW-816
1. The following comments on reference are submitted
for your information and files. It is to be noted that the
headquarters reviewing officials have arrived at a number of the
same conclusions that we have with regard to the security of tho
Project and the possible lines of action to be followed.
2. with regard to Paragraph 6 of reference, we feel that
although the security risk of contact and communications between
HUMANOID and MUHANOID-3 has not been removed, it has been reasonably
minimized, After the closing of HUMANOID's photo shop in November,
1951, soveral meetings were carried out at night on park bonchos
while attempts were being made to locate a secure safehouse. This
method was not satisfactory because of the impossibility of handling
and discussing written materials, the brief time limit demanded, and
the possibility of accidental recognition of one or the other. A
number of meetings were held at the home of HUMANOID at night with
pre-arranged safety-danger signals. Although the obvious security -
hazards here were aggravated by the fact that a Communist Party
sympathier lives in the neighborhood, the risks were doomed less
serious than park meetings. A safe house was located in May, 1952,
and was used for several meetings, but was compromised and abandoned
When several school acquaintances of HUMANOID pessed by and saw him
unlocking the front door. Meetings were again held at the home of
HUMANOID on a staggered schedule while search for suitable safehouses
continued. (At least ten apartments and offices were examined
and rejected by HUMANOID and the writer during this period.) A new
safehouse was rented on 1 November, 1952, and is presently boing
used for meetings. However, both TUMANDID and HUMANOID-3 have
agreed to abandon this place at the end of the month, because
actual use has demonstrated security weaknesses in exit and ontry.
Another safe office is presently under investigation, and attempts
have been made to limit the live contucts by brush metings in dar-
kened streets and use of a post office box for non-sensitive reports.
We are also actively searching for suitable two-way dead drop
facilities in a further effort to minimize live contacts.

3. With regard to Paragraph 7 of reference, it is to bo
noted that HUMANOID's relations with the Director of the Post Office
have been strengthened considerably in recent months. The Director
has been outspokenly anti-Communist in several long discussions and
has referred once or twice to the fact that his personal war against
the local Communists, 1.0., interception and confiscation of
Communist propaganda, appears to go unrecognized by the Costa Rican
government. No intimated that he is more aware of the dangers
presented by Communist activities than are the security athorities.
We feel confident that no Costa Rican officials are actively
attempting to identify higher elements in the net, control the
operation, or detect the nature of our intelligence interests.
Director's personal consorship mounts to little more than confis-
cating obvious Communist propa anda (most of which is turned over to
us in bulk) and opening lottors for perusal. He has no facilities
for copying such letters and maintains no files of past correspondence.
The Chief of the Costa Rican Intolligence Service is well known to us
and on the rara occasions when he requests the Director to intercept
a letter we hear of it from either the Director or HUMANOID-2.
.
The
4. In view of the dovolopment of more intimate relations
between HUMANOID and the Director and the latter's interest in whether
any record exists of his cooperation in anti-Communist activities, we
have obtained preliminary PRQ data from him and are presently con-
sidering the possibility of requesting clearance as a paid a ont.
This will be the subject of a future dispatch. Purther indication of
the lack of detailed information on the part of the Costa Rican
authorities concerning this project is contained in TRSA-1272.
5. With regard to Paragraph 8 of reference dispatch,
'
we have long been concerned over the lack of additional cutouts and
the scope of responsibilities presently assigned to HUMANOID. We hope
to separate the mail intercept and the Vanguardia Popular operations
in the near future. As previously reported, the possibility exists that
"HUMANOID will depart Costa Rica some time during 1953. We have already
begun turning over the postal intercept activity to HUMIST. When
clearance is obtained for HUMORESQUE, and further observation is
completed, we contemplate turning HUMANOID-3 over to HUMORESQUE. In
addition, we are gathering PRC data on additional potential cutouts.
6. With regard to Paragraph 9 of reference, it is to be
noted that we were in the process of developing cordial relations
with Major Jorge PACHECO as an Embassy officer concerned with visa
security risks, international travel of Communists, arms augaling from
the U.S., etc. PACHECO resigned as Chief of Detectives some months
ago and is not presently connected with the government. We have main-
tained friendly relations with him, however, on the possibility that
ho may again at some future date return to a responsible position.
7. Concerning Para raph 10 of refereme, it is to be
noted that HUMANOID will quite likely depart Costa Rica during 1953,

thereby eliminating the security aspects of the fact that his
intelligence activities are known to a wide circle of indigenous agents.
The Director of the Post Office is under consideration for recruitment
as a paid agent. It is not believed that subject's wife represents
a security hazard. Our limited observation of her indicates that
she is discreet, a conclusion which is strengthened by the fact that
no security broeches have occurred as a result of her generalized
awareness of HUMANOID's intelligence activitios. It is expected that
she will apply for U.S. eitizenship in the near future.
8. Headquartora' recommendation that HUMANOID exercise
extrame cantion in all of his intelligence activities will be followed.
The diagram attached to reference is acurate with the one addition
that HUMIST is cognizant of the postal intercept activity. During
this developmental period, HUMANOID has been acting as a cutout
between HUMIST and the Chief of Station. In the near future direct
contact will be established between HURIST and the Chief of Station, and
HUMANOID withdrawn from this activity.
9. We appreciate the exhaustive review of this project
prepared by headquarters. It is our desire to keep headquarters
promptly informed of all minor details as well as major developments.
However, we frequently find in the sifting and evaluation of those matters
demanding attention at any given time that either routine reporting or
current operations must suffer.

1. As indicated in references, subject travelled to
Washington in early Novembor, 1952, on personal business and con-
tacted Elmer C. Mercer upon arrival in order to discuss the possi-
bilities of a future assignment in another Latin American country.
After discussion with WHD officers, according to subject, Mercer
indicated that reassignment to another country would be considered.
An assignment in Argentina was tentatively discussed with the
understanding that subject must arrange his cover personally and
his departure from San José must have our concurrence. It was also.

matter as well as information as to what commitments, if any, were

necessary to take his wife and two children to the U.S. with him if

Memo to James K. Russo re Departure Motable for HUMANOID
Certain circumstances surrounding my application for
residence in Argentina through thoir Embassy here in San
Jost have given rise to a suggestion in rolerence to my
timetable for departure. Originally it was agreed by all
concerned that a departure shortly after the local elections
(say 1 August 1953) would be most convenient for the station.
There was some question as to acceptance at the University
of Buenos Aires, but it was letor decided that a moro direct
assurance of entry could be arranged by actual application for
resident status right here at San José. This process was
begun immediately. Subsequent conversations with Russo,
however, have given me the impression that headquarters will
await the approval of the resident permit before arranging
my departure for the U.S.
Actually there have been no unusual obstacles encountered in
the routine proparation of documentation, but nevertheless,
the Argentine Consul assures me that "results will not be
fortheoing in less than three months." Accordingly, this would
place the most optimistic results some time in late September.
Meammile, for rather urgent personal reasons, I as anxious
that my departure for the U.S. be realized as per the
original understanding, that is, shortly after the local elections.
By this plan, correspondence can be maintained with the
Argentine Embassy here at San Josd as concerns the arrival...
of the documentation, and my proposed training period can con-
ceivably be accomplished within this interval of time. If
the resident perit is denied, or the delay unusually great,
an alternate area might then be considered..
I fully comprehend the uncertainties involved in making such
a departure without the residence at the future station
positively established and a prepared to enter and work in any
area selected at the discretion of the organization. What I
am trying to avoid most of all is a possible interia waiting
period of several months in a more or less casual status.
If such is inevitable, then let it take place stateside!

1. The attached Revised Project Outline is submitted for rensval
effective 1 March 1953 to 28 February 1954.
2. This project encompasses all the agents presently used by the
Station. The principal agent HUMANOID has demonstrated particular ability
in closely directing sub-agents to realize their full potentialities. He
has also provided the Station with valuable background data on the personali-
ties and political movements with the country, in addition to his assigned
objectives.
3. Reports have been factual, the information can usually be relied
upon, and all information is of operational value. Security practices have
been sound, though hampered by the problem of procuring a safehouse which
is permanently secure.
4. The departure of the principal agent from Costa Rica sometime
after the 26 July 1953 presidential elections will necessitate re-assigning
out-out duties to HUMIST and also to HUMORESQUE when the latter is cleared.
At the present time HUMIST is gradually assuming full responsibility as
cut-out for HUMANOID_1 and HUMANOID-2. The two agents who will assume
EHMANOID's present cut-out and debriefing functions will be thoroughly familiar
with their duties by the time HUMANOID leaves.
5. It is anticipated that at about mid-year this project will be re-
submitted as two separate projects. In the meantime, however, it seems
advisable to request rensval for a full year.
6. Attached is a list of the dispatches and disseminations based on

10. Timetable: HUMANOID was engaged by the San Jose Station in
June 1949 and has been a most satisfactory agent since inception. Ho
is presently planning to leave San Jose, having completed his studies at
the university, but has agreed to remain until after the presidential
elections on 26 July 1953. When he leaves, his cut-out duties for
HUMANOID_1 and 2, which are presently being gradually turned over to
HUMIST, will be taken over by HUMIST, who will then have direct contact
with the case officer on much the same basis as HUMANOID. By that time,
HUMORESQUE should have operation clearance to act as an American out-out
for HUMANOID-3.

of 1952, he talked with the former chief of the San Jose Station, now at
Headquarters, and was told that in the event of his removal to Argentina
for further schooling, he would be continued on his present salary as a
minimm. He was also advised to request covert training in the United
States preparatory to going to Argentin, and was told that at the time of
that request it would be up to leadquarters to determine the advisability
of paying any part of transportation for himself and family to the United
States and from there to Argentina.

SUBJECT
Humanoid
21 January 1953
1. At the request of Mr. Caldwell, I met with Humanoid on the
occasion of his visit to Washington last November and made certain oral
commitments on behalf of the Division. No commitment,' however, was very
specific and all were cleared with the Division in advance. My partici-
pation in the matter was, of course, owing to the fact that I had
recruited Humanoid originally and enjoy his confidence.
2. Humanoid in the past has pursued his activities on behalf of
this organization as somewhat of a profitable avocation.

3. I advised Humanoid to continue with his plans as outlined above,
stipulating only that he remain in his present location until after the
forthcoming elections and assured him that as a consequence of his past
satisfactory service he would be picked up in Buenos Aires at a compensa-

had, implying that this would be granted, and suggested that a formal
contract, future compensation, travel expense and so forth could best be
negotiated here at that time.
5. I recommend, therefore, that Humanoid be brought to headquarters
for a period of training and that a contract agent relationship contain-
ing the usual travel and allowance provisions be formalized at that time.
Basic compensation should certainly consider his past record and proven
reliability in addition to the initiative he has shown in laying on his
own cover. Although his future assignment is none of my business, I
would point out that he has proven adept at spotting, recruiting airi
agent handling and suggest that his talents would be greatly circumscribed
if assigned to direct exploitation of a specific target.

Excellent and of major importance

Of considerable value with reference
to. information produced through sub-
agents. During the period under
review, agent has done independent
reporting and has produced several
reports of value on political
matters and has contributed useful
operational background data.
The removal of operational restric-
tions on agent's activities during
this period has permitted fuller
use of his capabilities, i.e.,
increased spotting and recruiting
activities...
Operation of this project was greatly
enhanced by the salary raise which
was effective in March, 1952. Subject
has resigned his position with the
School of Agronomy and is now able to
devote more time to our interests as
as result of the betterment of his
financial status. In November Agent
travelled to the United States and
contacted Elmer C. Mercer, former
Chief of Station, San José, at which
time the possibilities of reassign-
ment to another Latin American country
were discussed. After discussion with
WHD officers, Mercer advised HUMANOID
A REASSIGNMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED.

SEGRET
Security Infurination:
(1) HUMANOID-1 and 2: Mail intercepts by these two agents
are deposited in an envelope and placed in a post office
box. It is removed by HUMANOID who transmits it to the
ease officer, the material being returned to HUMANOID
for replacing in the post office box after being photo-
graphed in the office of the Chief of Station.
(2) HUMANOID-3: A safehouse in use since May 1952 is presently
being used. Due to certain security weaknesses in exit
and entry, it will be terminated at the end of January 1953.
Another safehouse is presently under development, as well
as a two-way dead drop and post office box to minimize live
contacts.
(3) HUMIST: Normal social contact between Americans.
c. A safehouse is indispensable to debrief HUMANOID-3, who has to
☐ report on Commist meetings which are often over 3 hours long. Three
safehouses have had to be abandoned due to demonstrated weaknesses, but the
new safehouse should prove satisfactory..
7. Centrals:
&.
The control of HUMANOID is based upon his past service record
with the U.S. Government, demonstrated loyalty, and judgment of the present
and former Chiefs of Station. In addition UMANOID is a U.S. citizen, and
at present depends almost wholy on the financial assistance he receives for
the performance of his duties.
b. The control of HUMANOID_1 and 2 is based upon the threat of
exposure to the goverment. Motivation is the generally anti-Communist.
nature of their work and the financial gain from their duties.
Control over HUMANOID-3 consists of signed receipts, reports,
etc., which could be used as a threat. However, the egent's high regard
for his salary and developing personal friendship with HUMANOID are
motivating factors.
8. Special Equirments
No special equipment is involved at the present time.
9. Coordination: This project was originally initiated with the
co-operation of the Panama Station. Contimed coordination with Panama,
or any other station, is not considered necessary or desirable..

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, BRANCH III
SUBJECT: HUMANOID
13 October 1952
?
i
1. Attached here to is a letter received from HUMANOID by Mr.
Edward A. Harelius, now at Headquarters and the former Chief of Station
at Costa Rica, who recruited HUMANOID.
2.
Particular reference is made to Paragraph 6 regarding a change
in assignment. Mr. Marelius thinks that when subject finishes his
school year in 1953 he should be brought to Headquarters for training,
and that be should be converted to Staff Agent for possible reassign-
ment in Latin America under deep cover. Mr. Marelius thinks that
HUMANOID will go stale in San Jose and that a change should be made to
better utilize his services. Although subject is the principal source
in Costa Rica, he feels that arrangements could be made for an orderly
turn-over and departure..
3. While I was assigned in Panama I met subject, at which time
he was contemplating moving to Panama, attending the University, and
working for the Panama station. He impressed me very well and would
have been quite an asset, but the deal fell through due to the higher
cost of living in Panama and the fact that he would lose considerable
credits in transferring.
4. I do not know whether it can be worked out but I certainly
would go along with recommending that he be afforded training in the
U.S. and that he be reassigned, preferably to Argentina or one of the
other countries where the " is Argent needed for additional unofficial
cover. The question of his converting to Staff Agent might be worked
out also.

Dear Ed,
The interval has been long enough for me to wonder if you are
still around! We'll just go ahead with this and hope for a decent
forwarding service at that end.
How are you and Betty these days ? 1'11 bet you miss the old
days in LA at times...but just remember this, things are not what
they used to be 1 This place, (in spite of increasing political pulse)
is deader than Hell. Take it from me.
This is our beloved winter now...you remember; dreamy, sunny
mornings...until about 1100...then swoosh | Your walking around thru
another dark, clammy and moldy rainy season. Well, I guess bitter
cold waves are not so pleasant eigher.
-
Marco seems to be getting prematurely old. He's healthy enough,
but 1 guess the country is just as boring for him as it is for me.
He still cannot pass up a chance to jump in carfor a ride now and then
and seems to be just about his No 1 thrill.
As for the family here, everyone is fine. I believe I had told
you that Lilliam Caridad was born June 1951 so now we are quite satisfied
with the pair. They are both fat, dumb and happy (and how 1 envy them
for that). Ross A. is now over three years and quite the boy..
As for me, same old stuff. Fourth year at the U. with passing
grades and possibilities of the degree next year whereever it may be
undertaken. I am pretty well fed up with the environment. (again) and
this time am sure to be gone sometime within the first quarter of 53.
I have very little idea where...Fanama U. is once again encouragėng.
I would like Cuba in spite of the high standard of living there. Even
Mexico would get me close enough to the continental US for more frequent
visits which is what I need at the moment. (That is actually Doctors
advice now.) At any rate, I feel that I might be able to do more somewhere
else. Do you have any ideas ? They would certainly be welcomed.
All the ald acquaintances are still around. Mary is well and
apparently happy. Judy is fine. 1 like Dave's new friend very much
and am reminded of the old Marelius touch. We haven't many new
friends these days and its my impression that we had better be getting
a little more social minded.
.
Well, going to clip this short and head for the U. There's a petty
strike on and one must keep up with the current at least. Best wishes
to you folks and hope to hear from you soon.
As ever,

REFERENCE:
FI Memo of 13 December 1955
1. Referenced memorandum requested that WH Division forward
to Chief, FI, on or about 29 May 1956, a report concerning plans
for improving VAIVADA's cover (Habana University student on notional
scholarship from WHD proprietary).
2. Negotiations are currently underway for the establishment
of VAIVADA as a representative in Cuba for one of several U. S.
polling agencies. Such an arrangement would afford certain opera-
tional-contact advantages as well as a logical cover employment and
apparent source of income for the agent. Efforts are being made to
implement the proposed new cover arrangement prior to the 31 July
1956 renewal date of Project AMPHODARCH.

Contract Amendment, Arthur G. VAIVADA
1. It is requested that the contract of Arthur 0. VAIVADA ba
amended to provide for an increase in salary from 85060.00 to $5915.00,
effective 1 April 1956. It is further requested that allowances
be appr
popriately adjusted¬
VAIVADA entered on duty with this organisation on 1 June 1949
as a contract agent. From June 1949 through August 1953 he was
stationed in Costa Rica, where his record was outstanding and included
the successful handling of a high level Communist Party penetration.
He was subsequently given leadquarters training for several months
and participated in PBSUCCESS.
3. VAIVADA has been in Cuba in his present capacity (P/A,
AMPHODARCH Project) since July 1954. His performance there has con-
tinued to be outstanding. He has proved to be particularly adept at
spotting and recruiting of agents and his work has been highly praised
by the Chief of Station, Habana. In recommending renewal of the
AMPHODARCH project recently, FI/Plans/Projects stated, with reference
to VAIVADA, that he "has obviously been a valuable, deep cover agent
handler during six years of service for WH." He had been qualified
previously as the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.

4. There are sufficient funds in the AMPHODARCH project (approved
13 December 1955 for the period 1 August 1955 through 31 July 1956) to
provide for the above-requested increase in-salary. Such an increase
will be specifically provided for in the next project renewal request.
VAIVADA has been at his present salary level since July 1954.

It is requested that an operational clearance de obtained for VAIVADA

student field. We realize that VAIVADA is fully occupied with hispresent
duties, and it is not intended to place any responsibility on hin for KUCAGE
operations. It would be of great assistance to the Station, however, if the
writer could be permitted to obtain VAIVADA's views on the type of KUCAGE
activity in the student field which might be most likely to succeed, and
capitalize on his knowledge of the field by using him as a spotter. (we
have in mind the organization of a student political action team similar
to the one operating in Brazil under project ALKALINE-C.)

COVER PREPARATION
-
(Arthur G. Vaivada)
In compliance with Station and Headquarters requests,
I am submitting an outline of my efforts and plans for establish-
ing a legitimate (and permanent) cover cooupation that will ba
suitable for movement and operation almost anywhere in this
hemisphere. It is my understanding that there are two (local)
cover proposals up for consideration and these will not conflict
in any way the plan outlined herein, but actually will contribute
to the realization of it. That is, during my tour at this station
I can ostensibly develope and strangthen a career in writing to
the extent that it may stand alone as cover occupation. It is
also pertinent to make it clear at this time, that my aspirations
for a career in fiction writing are personal, sincere, and not in
any way based on a desire to establish a particular type of cover.
For this reason, I have divided this outline in two parts, the
first partaining to my personal efforts and activities; the second
being in the form of a proposal, available to me as a method of
providing a writing career with a very legitimate appearance.
PALMER INSTITUTE OF AUTHORSHIP:
I
-
'
When in the early part of 1955 it became obvious
that my University cover was not only weak but also identified
with my targets and thereby creating a security dilemma, I began
exploring the possibilities of utilizing my secondary cover which
was "street photography". Financially this started out well but
soon became bogged down with labor and/or immigration technicalities.
At this time I had simultaneously enrolled in the Palmer Institute
of Authorship at 1680 N. Sycamore, Hollywood 28, California. Frankly,
in the beginning, I had little incentive or interest other than
taking a "orack" at something I had always desired, but as time
and lessons have gone by, there is a very positive indication that
I can make the grade. It is a one year course, considered quite
competent and provides stepping stones into the publishing world.
I am nearing completion of this course, have two 5000 word short
stories submitted to publishers, one-short-story-analyzed by the
Institute and recommended for re-write and probable sale. My
intentions are to try and "break the ice" in the fiction adventure
at teen-age level. (Boy's Life, New Brunswick, N.J.)
II & CONFACTS IN PAPERBACK BOOK PUBLISHING INDUSTRY:
When I realized that with very little "padding"
such as contacts with paperback book publishers in addition to my
legitimate correspondence with magazines, this writing career
could be very adequate cover, I made the recommendation to the
station some time in middle 1955.

COVER PREPARATION
-
2
(Arthur G. Vaivada) (Cont'd)
Along these same lines, I took advantage of the
opportunity presented when an old friend and AAF companion
came down on a visit in July 1955. Warrant Officer Francis
Williams has been in the AIS (Air Intelligence) since 1940,
actually one of the founders of the service and has written
AISS technical bulletins for 15 years. Williams was practically
present upon my entry into this organization (if not actually.
instrumental in my recruitment. I discussed the plan in general
terms with Williams and learned that one of his section AI
Officers is currently in the publishing business. William s assures
me that when the right time approaches, he can "arrange"
substantial contact with this company, with practically no
security hazarde. We have left this pending. ((His address;
5846 Access Road, Page Manor, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton,
Ohio.))
.
While on a visit to San Jose, Costa Rica, I met
and discussed this cover aspect with Arthur Gregor, ourrently
a civilian employee of the Naval Air Station at Coco 5010,
Panama Canal Zone. Art Gregor was considered by the station at
San Jose (our station, that is) for recruitment in 1952. I
submitted the complete Section I of the PRQ on him and we had
@ tentative arrangement that sometime in the future, whereever
he might be, if approached by the organisation, he would work
or cooperate with a temporary project, what ever the case be..
(Gregor is specializing in minerology at MIT, and shooting for
8 Masters at the Colorado School of Mining.) Gregor has an uncle
who is in the paperback book business (publishing) and according
to his appraisal, would not object to cooperating unwittingly
to the proposal of such a contact. ((Gregor's address: Box 2655,
Cristobal, Canal Zone.))
In conclusion: It is realized that all this wordage
may look very nice, etc., but actually the accomplishment of
such cover will depend on whether I can-get-into-publication
however minor in may be. The efforts to "pad" the-existing
minor-in-may-be
authentic cover with the two projects above may sound "nebulous!
but after all, outside of a tight professional league of staff
writers (or immortals) writing is a nebulous undertaking. Finally,
all of Part II here 18 submitted as a proposal, awaiting approval
and dependent upon the success of Part I.

amended.

✓✓
Effective 1 January 1956, said contract, as amended, is further
amended by deleting paragraphs one (1) and two (2) and all reference to
Federal taxes and substituting in lieu there of the following:
1. Compensation. In full consideration for the purchase of certain
information and services, you will receive from the Government, payable in
such an approved manner as you may direct in writing, the following:
(a) Compensation calculated at the rate of $5060 per annum; and
(b) Additional compensation for quarters procurement for you
and your dependents presently calculated at the rate of $2575 per annum
and applicable only to your initial permanent post of assignment ovar-
seas. As this additional compensation is based upon quarters coats
at said post, it is subject to unilateral adjustment by the Government
whenever warranted by a change in the factors affecting its initial
establishment. Quarters will not be furnished you by the Government
nor will you accept quarters provided by your cover facility without
prior amendment of this agreement; and
(c) Additional compensation for cost of living expenses (other
than quarters) for you and your dependents presently calculated at
the-rate-of-$1920-per-annum and applicable only to your initial per-
manent post of assignment overseas. As this additional compensation
is predicated upon the comparative cost of living between Washington,
D. C. and your overseas post, your cover, family status and basic
compensation, it is subject to unilateral adjustment by the Government
whenever warranted by a change in the factors affecting its original:
establishment.
2. Taxes. (a) As your legal relationship to the Government is that
of an independent contractor, all amounts-paid directly or guaranteed by the
Government under Paragraph one supra, are reportable as income under
existing Federal income tax laws and regulations.
(b) In view of the security considerations involved, the
Government agrees, at your request, to withhold Federal income taxes from
the monies due you under this agreement in an amount equivalent to the United
States income tax withholding schedule based upon your taxable income here-
under and
present exemption(s). Sums so withheld will be paid over to

1. Operational clearance has been obtained for Arthur G. VAIVADA on 22 July
1954 as a replacement for Wallace C. RIKON in Project AMPHODARCH.
2. VAIVADA has been a KUBARK contract agent since July 1949. His initial
assignment was in Project HUMANOID in Costa Rica, where under a student
cover he achieved a high-level penetration of the local BGGYPSY organi-
sation. He was recalled to Headquarters in the fall of 1953 to par-
ticipate in a similar project in Argentina, which could not be carried -
\ out because of refusal of the Argentine Government to grant him a visa.
Recently he was in PBSUCCESS with additional duties as a cutout under
Project ESCROW. He has completed three years of work at the University
of Costa Rica and has one more year to finish for his B. A. degree in
economica. His previous work as a contract agent has been excellent.
tr
3. VAIVADA's new contract becomes effective on 1 August 1954 and runs for
* two years.
His salary will be $5060.00 annually (GS-9) and will be en-
titled to an equivalent quarters allowance. Transportation for VAIVADA,
his dependents, and household effects, together with por diem in lieu of
subsistence-in-the-course-of-the-travel to Cuba is authorized. He is
entitled to death and disability benefits under the Federal Employees
Compensation Act, to continuance of pay and allowances under the Missing
Persons Act, and to 14 days of annual leave per calendar year. Although
VAIVADA is expected to get his B. A. degree in one year at the University
of Habana, it is expected that the second year of his contract will be
spent in some type of graduate work at the same institution.

Dear Mr. Valvada
Reference is made to your contract (asement) effective
1 August 1954
with the United States Government, as
represented by the Contracting Officer, for the (purchase) conte
of information and services of a confidential nature.
1
Effective January 1955, said contract (and is

ment of Federal taxes and substituting in lieu there of the following:

erations involved agrees to withhold from the monthly taxable
income due you under this contract which is payable on and after
1 January 1955 amounts equivalent to the United States income
tax withholding schedule based upon + 11/0/2) present
exemption(s). Sums so withheld will be paid over to the
Internal Revenue Service. You acknowledge that this is an
accommodation on the part of the Government and does not
relieve you from fulfilling your obligations under existing
Federal income tax law, and regulations. You will be
instructed as to the method to be followed in making timely
filing of returns, estimates and payments in order to pre-
serve security."
All other terms and conditions of the contract (sedendad

Angel BOAM ACOSTA
DESEITLED
1. On about 20 November 1954, Arthur G. VAIVADA (Identity A) met Subject
by chance on the street in Habana. Vaivada states that he knew Subject from
February to May of 1954 in Guatemala City where they lived in the same apart-
mant building. Apparently Vaivada's wife was of considerable assistance to
Sra. BOAN ACOSTA when the latter was sick and by the time Vaivada left Guste-
mala, a fairly good friendship had arisen between the two families. Sr.
Boen Acosta was cultivated by Vaivada because of Boan Acosta's known high
level CP contacts in Guatemala. Apparently Ecan Acosta was of some assistance
to Vaivada at the University of Guatemala.
2. Angel Boan Acosta is a Cuban, born in April 1925 at Camaguey, Cuba.
He is currently a political writer for the weekly "Semanario", an anti-
Batists magazine. He is married to Iraida MONTALVO of Las Villas, Cuba and
has one child six months of age. They are currently residing with a sister-
in-las in Santos Suares, Habana. Subject was more or less an exile after
10 March 1952 because of his opposition to Batista. He went to Mexico firet,
and then received a fairly well paid job in the Government communist radio
headquarters in Guatemala, where he was a political commentator and radio
script writer.
3. Vaivada plans to continue here in Cuba his friendship with Subject
with the idea of obtaining some local leftist youth contacts of value. Vaivada
does not believe subject is aware of Vaivada's employment by KUBARK or PEPRIME.
4. This Mission's files indicate subject and a member of communists and
communist sympathisers signed an anti-Batista declaration-in-1952, according
to the communist newspaper, Hoy.
5. The Mission would appreciate any information tending to confirm
subject's s communist affiliations, or indicating that Subject is aware of
Vaivada's employment by PRPRIME.

REFS: (a) HKH-W-1607, 30 March 1956
(b) HKH-W-1505, 28 December 1955
Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion
of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the attention
of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada staff status either
concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.
The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,
for a number of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been
entitled to the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS employees
Moreover he has not had the benefit of recent legislative increases in basic
salary rates, such that his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 at the then
GS-9 level, is still $5060.00 per annum. Perhaps of more importance than
the foregoing considerations is the fact that this agent has been and is
losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and other more long-
term advantages available to staff personnel. The agent has several times
expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family man, over the fact that
he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivada's
expressed career interests lie in continued employment by KU BARK, more
especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments in the field, and in
view of his qualities of character and high level of performance for KU BARK
the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headquarters that he be
awarded the desired change in status.
•
In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the
promotion from his present grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per
anmum salary_of_35,915.00. If Headquarters concurs in the recommendation-
that the agent be granted staff officer status, the agent would move up to
the GS-11 grade at that time.

1. It is requested that an amendment to the Subject Project be approved
wherein contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA (P) will replace contract agent Wallace C.
RIKON (P). Operational Clearance for the use of VAIVADA in Project APHODARCH was
granted 21 July 1954 (0.C. #25507).
2. Project AMPHODARCH is already approved for $5400 for the year ending 31
August 1954. This amandment will increase the cost of APHODARCH during the remaining
$1232.74
month of this approved period by 3247. RIMON'S compensation, allowances, and expenses
for the same period is figured to be $450.00. A breakdown of VAIVADA's expenses for the
period 1 August through 31 August 1954 is as follows:

3. For a successful substitution of VAIVADA in place of RIKON in Project AFHODARCH
in Hatana
I is necessary that the two contract agents be in contact/during the period 1-31 August
1954. Immediately following the submission of this amendment covering that period, a
project renewal will be drawn up contemplating the use of VAIVADA in the project on a
yearly basis with at least a two-year tour in view.
4. The general objectives, targets, and cover will remain the same in the project.
As a part of the cover backstopping, a notional scholarship grant of $120 per month
will be "awarded" VAIVADA by the DTEMBARGO mechanism. Complete correspondence and docu-
mentation on this grant will be carried by VAIVADA when he goes to Cuba.
_
5. Arthur G. VAIVADA has been a contract agent in the employ of XUEAPK since July
1949, working in the HINAHOM Project in Costa Rica, and more recently in Project
PBSUCCESS with additional duties as cutout under Project ESCROW. VAIVADA has one more
year of academic work to finish in order to receive an A.B. degree in Econoies. This
furnishes a logical and natural reason for him to matriculate at Habana University, with
which are associated the main tasks, targets, and objectives of Project AMPHODA RCH. His
previous work as a contract agent has been excellent and it is felt that with the subs-
Zitution of VAIVADA for RIKON, a big improvement in the production of the project may
be expected during the coming year. VAIVADA, a U. S. citizen married to a Costa Rican

agents. His most important single activity has been
debriefing the high-level penetration agent whom he has
been able to develop to a point where he and this ons
agent constituted the most important assets to the
station.

proved himself to be very security conscious and to
possess a degree of initiative which has impressed the
station chief on more then one occasion. He has
participated in setting up safehouses, was responsible
for recruiting the two mail intercept agents, and has
provided the facilities for photographing the material

proficient in sending Morse code, is trained in the use of
firearms and has studied and worked with charts and maps.

Dear Mr. Crozier,
I have just received with interest your letter of May 31 in which you requested
information about the scholarships granted by the Pan-American Foundation to continue
your studies in economics at the University of Habana for the school year 1954–1955.
The information which you submitted in your letter indicates that you are
qualified to be considered for a scholarship. But before any action can be taken,
you must complete the enclosed application form and also submit a transcript of
credits from the university previously attended.
For your information the scholarship can be extended to cover graduate work.
The scholarships granted by the Foundation make provision for food and housing
sufficient for both you and your family, though not necessarily for the same
amount as you have indicated. You are advised to submit the information requested
by June 30, which the final date for applicants for the coming school year.

Dear Mr. Wilgus,
As a student of economics with special emphasis on the Latin American areas, I
wrote you in the letter dated 17 May for information about obtaining a scholarship
through your organization for continuing my studies in economics at the University
of Habana in Cuba. I should like to begin work there for. the school year 1954-1955.
As to my qualifications, I have attended the School of Economics Sciences at the
University of Costa Rica from 1949 through 1953. In all my previous courses I
have done above average, as can be attested by the schools concerned...
My present desire is to continue my study of economics at the University
of Habana for one year, or as lon as it may be deemed necessary to obtain a
Bachelor of Science degree in economics. I am also interested in the possibility
of having the scholarship renewed at the end of the period, so that I may be
able to begin graduate work in economics. Because I am a married man with two
small children, I would like to know whether the scholarship granted would be
sufficient to cover the cost of good and housing in addition to tuition, books, and
the normal academic expenses, which I estimate to be about $3000.00 annually.
As to my personal history, I am a United States citizen and shall be 32 years
old in June. I have served in the United States Army and Air Force between 1940
and 1949, with the exception of an eight month period in 1945 and 1946. The areas in
which I served are India and Burma in World War II, and Panama after 1946. Because
of my long residence in Panama and Costa Rica I speak Spanish fluently, as does my
wife who is of Costa Rican nationality. As mentioned before, I have two young
children born in 1949 and 1951 respectively.
I realize the above information-may-be-insufficient-in-order to-determine whether
I qualify for a scholarship, and I should be glad to provide any additional-information.
that you may require. Please also send me whatever forms necessary for making formal
application for a scholarship.
Sincerely yours,
Ross L. Crozier

Dear Mr. Crozier,
The Foundation has received your letter dated May 17 in which you
inquired about the granting of scholarships. The Foundation grants a limited
number of scholarships to students wishing to study at Latin American Universities,
either for graduate or undergraduate work. These grants are usually for
one year only.
Before the Foundation could take any action on your case, it would have
to know what your field of interest is and something as to the nature of your
personal qualifications and academic background. If you could supply this
to me, even in a brief form, I would be better able to further advise you.
Sincerely yours,

1. Reference is made to your memoranium dated 26 Febru-
ary 1954 concerning the necessity of deducting Subject's GI
allowances (not tuition payments) from salary due and payable
by CIA.
2. Pursuant to the provisions of 38 C. S. Code 1952,
Focket Supplement 267, par. 6a regarding the payment of
education and training allowances, the following limitation
on such payments is imposed:
"That in no event shall the rate of allowance plus.
compensation received exceed $210.00 per month for a
veteran without a dependent, or $270.00 per month for
a veteran with one dependent, or $290.00 per month for
a veteran with two or more dependents: Provided fur-
ther, that only so much of the compensation as is de-
rived from productive labor based on the standard work
week for the particular trade or industry, exclusive of
overtime shall be considered in computing the rate of
all allowances payable under this paragraph."
.
3. It is further provided by 36 U. 5. Code 1952, Puc-
ket Supplement 336 that:
"No eligible veteran shall be paid an education and
training allowance for any period during which ***
the payment of such allowance would constitute a dupli-
cation of the veteran from the Federal Treasury."
4. In view of the above quoted provisions of the U. S.
Code restricting the entitlement to allowances under the GI
Bill, Subject's contract will have to be amended to reflect
an offset clause for such sums received under the GI Bill
since he cannot reject such compensation from Veterans Adzin-
istration for security reasons.

Subject currently is exploring the possibilities of having his
wife open a small photographer's shop in her name. According
to the attorney handling his wife's papers this is possible and
Bubject would be able to attend classes and at the same time earn
more money. Due to the fact he is known as an ex-G.I. and a
married man with two children, the fact that he does commercial
photographic work while attending university would appear only
logical. However, this point will be discussed with headquarters
if and when subject believes the time is right to branch out.
5. The following question was brought up by subject which we feel
should be answered by headquarters: Subject is receiving a
regular salary from our organization which is deposited in his
bank in the U.S. In addition and commencing within the near.
future subject will be receiving $130.00 per month from the
Veterans' Administration which will be sent by regular U.S.

question as to whether or not at some future date he may be em-
barrassed for accepting two checks from our government, or whether
headquarters will deduct from his stipulated salary that additional
salary which he will receive from the Veterans' Administration.
Any advice which headquarters can furnish will be appreciated by
subject.
6. It was decided here that subject will in the future be the go-
between in the ESCROW project. Accordingly, on the night of
22 January 1954, subject met ESCROW in a secure meeting place for
the purpose of arranging danger signals, future meeting places
and for the purpose of insuring correct recognition in the future.
Henceforth, subject will meet subject twice or three times each
week in order that ESCROW's potential may be exploited to the
fullest extent. Subject is now scouting the used car lots in a
search for a small used car. Once he has purchased a vehicle
future meetings with him and between him and ESCROW will be held
with a better degree of safety.

1. In answer to reference, it has been determined by the appropriate
office at lieadquarters that VAIVADA is not entitled to receive compensation
from both this organization and the Veterans Administration. The enclosed
contract mordnent has been written to provide for an offset between sub-
ject's salary from this organization and the Veterans Administration.
2. VAIVADA should be informed that leadquarters is appreciative of
his alertness to this situation since it will be easier to adjust his
financial situation now rather than have to turn back a fairly large sum
of money in the future. It is to be noted that the mendment is written
in such a way that when he stops receiving the Veteran's payments at the
end of his eligibility period, the full mount of his salary due from
this organisation will again be deposited as heretofore,

As has already been reported, Arthur C. VAIVADA and dependents
arrived in Guatemala City on 2 January 1954. The first of
several contacts with him was successfully accomplished on the
night of 4 January 1954. Subject currently is living temporarily
in an apartment hotel; however, he has already rented a small,
inconspicuous apartment located in a middle-class neighborhood.
He has purchased a few pieces of inexpensive furniture for the
apartment and intends moving his family to the premises within
the immediate future. Subject's choice of neighborhoods in which
to reside is believed excellent. The apartment is located in a
fairly busy section of town, is on a busy street served by public
buses which travel to all parts of the city and is of such modest
appearance that it will attract no attention.
Subject has registered with the local university and is in the
process of developing contacts which may prove valuable in the
future. Concerning subject's entry into the University he has
pointed out that this type of cover is noir hare and that at an
undetermined date in the future he may request authorization to
discontinue this cover for one of a more lorical nature. However,
until this matter is discussed at greater length with headquarters.
in the future, subject will continue to attend his classes to put
in an appearance.
3. Subject's wife is a native-born Costa Rican national. According
to Guatemalan law she automatically ecomes a uatemalan citizen
at the time she establishes a residence here. because she doos
not wish to accept Guatemalan nationality but desires to retain
her own nationality, subject has_through_a_local_attorney-arranged
to have his wife granted the states of a Fermanent Resident but
not_a_naturalized citizen. In this way-she-will-enjoy all the
privileges of a Guatemalan citizen except the right to vote. She
will be able to work or engage in priate business of her own.
Subject will have all the necessary details completed in this
connection within the next few days.

PROJECT BIRADIAL
1. BIRADIAL, who was to have been dispatched to Buenos Aires, has been denied
proper documentation from the Argentine authorities for entrance and
residence in Buenos Aires.

3.
There is attached hereto a copy of a letter dated 6 October 1953 at San
Jose, Costa Rica, which BIRADIAL received from the Argentine Embassy,
Consular Section setting forth pertinent data regarding subject's entry.
denial. (This letter, received on 24 November 1953 had previously been
sent to a mailing address in Dayton Chio, namely % Francis Williams,
.5846 Access Road, Page Manor, Dayton. Since the letter was unclaimed at
this address (BIRADIAL having learned later that Williams, an Army Officer
friend of his had been shipped out), the letter was returned to the
Argentine Embassy, Costa Rica and was subsequently forwarded to BIR/DIAL's
former address at Presidential Gardens, Alexandria, Va. The letter had
been postmarked at Dayton, Ohio, 19 October 1953.
On 25 November 1953 while in contact with the Agent he indicated the possibility
of writing his wife's relatives, Alicia De Cruz and family, in Kar De Plata,
Argentina, with whom contact is maintained, for the purpose of attempting to
assist agent at that end in having the proper entry permit issued. He also
indicated the possibility of returning to Costa Rica and while in that area
being plausibly and legitimately employed while awaiting another Agency
assignment. Inasmuch as a combination of factors lead to the conclusion
that it would be unwise to attempt to exert other influence in an attempt
to have BIRADIAL granted an Argentine visa, and for other cover considerations
as well as the time element which may be involved, the matter was discussed
with other representatives of H who desired to take the Agent over in
connection with PB Success.
"
4. Arrangements were set up for Agent to meet the Chief of the Guatamalan
Station. Subsequently, on 8 December 1953 Agent SIRADIAL was introduced
in a secure manner, to Kr. E. Hobbing, by the writer. Hobbing will in the
immediate future be handling EIRADIAL in connection with certain operational
matters and as of 1 December 1953 BIRADIAL will be chargeable to PB Success.
5. In accordance with the provisions of the project, BIRADIAL was paid $350.00
for his November salary; $93.00 for his tuition fee at American University
and $468.00 for his per diem to cover his period of time while in Covert
training.
6. Proper receipts have been forwarded_to_Cedric Holcott, Finance Division..

7. It should be noted, that Agent over a period of several contacts appeared
to be very cooperative and his attitude was comendable. When he first
learned that he had been denied entry to Buenos Aires, he was somewhat
chagrined since he appeared to be set on an attempt to do a good job in
a "tight" area. He had not given up hope to obtain proper authorization
and was willing to pursue the matter further since he felt over a period
of time he would be allowed proper entry authority. He suggested several
possibilities.
8. Agent also expressed a desire to go to Cuba or anywhere else the Agency
felt he could be of best service to the Agency regardless of the difficulties
within reason, which may have been imposed on him and his family.
9.
918
In view of Agent's past successful record with this Agency, in view of his
attitude, his future possibilities and his comparatively limited salary
it was suggested to Mr. Hobbing that he might consider a raise in Agent's
salary.
0. The Buenos Aires Mission was on 7 December 1953 advised that Agent was
denied entry to Argentina.
11. It should be noted that Agent has indicated that his wife has been maintaining
contact with her distant relative in Mar De Plata who is expecting Agent and
his wife to go to Argentina. In this connection, Agent on 11 December 1953
informed his wife had received a letter from her cousin. The letter
indicated that difficulty should be anticipated in obtaining an entry
resident permit to Euenos Aires but that it nevertheless is possible. Agent
states the letter points out a plan for Agent and his wife to work out.
Agent informed the letter was received a little too late since he is now on
the other operation. He stated however, he and his wife will be in contact
with Alicia De Cruz and family with a view toward the possibility of entering
Argentina at some future date. (EIRADIAL is forwarding the above mentioned
letter through Hr. Hobbing).
12. FI/Plans Staff is being informed to cancel Project BIRADIAL as of 1 December
1953.
13. Attached-hereto-and-for-retention in Agent's file are the following:
(a) Copy of receipt # P-3283 for Agent's salary ($350.00) for the period
1-30 November 1953.
(b) Receipt F-556 dated 25 November 1953 for the amount of $93.00.
(c) Copy of claim for reimbursement dated 25 November 1953 in the amount
of $93.00.
(d) Copy of a receipt dated 11 December 1953_for_the_amount of $468.00.

1. The above-named individual is Chief of the
Commercial Department of the Ministry of Finance on a full time
basis. However, he is also the code and cipher specialist within
the Costa Rican Government and personally provided the codes now
being used by the Foreign Office and Seguridad Pública. This
latter responsibility apparently stems from his hobby of working with
codes and ciphers and the absence of any better-qualified expert.
on this subject. He is a member of the American Cryptogram Association,
is a "ham" radio operator, an expert photographer, and an amateur
chemist, among other things. During the 1948 revolution, he pro-
vided the rebel forces with code systems and broke a code being used
by the government forces. On other occasions he has furnished codes
to the incumbent administration during times of emergency, such as
the abortive invasion of Costa Rica from Nicaragua during 1949.
2. Officers of the Commercial Section of the Embassy.
have had cordial and cooperative relations with subject on commercial
and economic matters for some time. Recently one of these officers
advised us that subject had made tentative, informal inquiries con-
cerning the possibility of obtaining technical advice and assistance
from the Embassy or the Department of State with a view to improving
the cipher system of the Foreign Office. It was suggested to subject
that an official request to the Embassy for such information would
probably result in a polite refusal, but that one of the Embassy
officers, RUSSO, had had experience in codes and ciphers while
serving in the Army, and that perhaps an unofficial discussion-would-
be helpful.
3. On this basis, a luncheon date was arranged at which
time subject stated that the Foreign Minister had recently questioned
him for several hours on the security of the Foreign Office codes and
possible means of improving them, and had instructed subject to study
the problem. According to subject, the Foreign Minister then indicated
serious concern over the threat presented by local and international
Communist activities-and-speculated-on-various possibilities of cover-
ing their activities.

9. Accordingly, RUSSO described a personal friend in the
Division of Communications and Records of the Department who had had
considerable experience in censorship work and offered to make in-
quiries of this individual for any available material. It was also
indicated that this person would be asked to comment on the probable
reaction of the Department to an official confidential request from
the Costa Rican Government for assistance. It was suggested to subject.
that he not discuss this matter with any other individuals pending
a reply to our inquiries, to which he agreed. He also agreed that
the best approach to this whole project would be to proceed only with
training and planning activities at this time and not attempt to
initiate actual censorship until an emergency arises, such as a
Communist armed uprising or a third world war. However, on this
latter point it is believed probable that subject would prefer to
begin the activity regardless of whether an emergency arises, in order
to obtain coverage of current Communist activities.
10. As is obvious from the above conversations, a number
of operational possibilities (and hazards) are presented to us and
headquarters comments and guidance are respectfully requested.
Depending on headquarters desires and policies, we could possibly
gradually discourage subject from ever initiating his project prior
to an emergency while at the same time assisting him with pertinent
written material provided by headquarters for his planning and train-
ing purposes. This would have the advantage of facilitating the
organization of a competent crew on a stand-by basis who could be put
to work if a world war were to break out. We could tap this govern-
ment censorship activity. However, in view of our presently only
limited post office coverage, a more attractive opportunity might be
sincerely to assist subject, insure his development of a secure project,
and substitute our present coverage by an all-Costa Rican operation.
It appears that we could control such an operation either by working
through subject or by dealing directly with Colonel SEGARES. In
this latter situation, we could probably expand the activity to provide
coverage of cable traffic, and possibly international telephone calls.
A danger here is the traditional lack of security consciousness of
Costa Ricans.
11. In any event we are faced with a situation which
presents a potential security threat to our current post office
censorship activity. Headquarters comments are requested as soon as
possible on at least the following points:
a. Will headquarters provide technical data on
censorship methods for passing to POVEDANO as though it
were obtained from a friend of RUSSO? In this connection
we have in mind possibly unclassified Army instructional
manuals, etc.
b. Will headquarters approve our accepting POVEDANO's

1. The verarks contained in TRS-A-1076 and TRS-A-1034, the besin
for your recommendation that UMANOID be tranferred to career 8503d status
as well as all information in Headquarters files, which is relevant to
ACID's compsction with er organisation, have been thoroughly studied
by the individuals of your Headquarters organisation authorised to remier

2. It is regretted that in spite of HUMABOI)'s outstanding performDACO
ced his valuable contribution to the Station's activities, his qualifications
are not these which properly fit him for consideration and appointment as a
CATEUR LEENT. Headquarters is very much more of HUGO's desires in this
matter of career agent status, and it is hoped that the above decision will
have no effect on the present high standard of efficiency which is being
maintained by the San Jose station.
3. Paragraph 3 of M9-V-766 refers to a dispatch which will be forthcoming
on Heniquarters. We regret the confusion conveyed by the original dispatch.

4. Subject then digressed from code and cipher talk to the
subject of secret inks, their use, and potentialities and possible
methods of detection. He indicated that he was interested in establish-
ing a secret censorship of suspect mail coming into the country,
particularly the mail of known Communists, and inquired whether any
assistance could be offered in this field of secret writing detection
and clandestine censorship techniques.
:
5. In view of the fact that this sudden turn in the con-
versation struck uncomfortably close to the HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2
operation, we attempted to discourage subject by pointing out that
such a proposal was illegal and would have drastically dangerous
political and legal repercussions if it were attempted and leaked out.
We asked if Foreign Minister LARA had approved this censorship
proposition and also inquired how the Foreign Office could possibly
interest itself in a matter which would seem to come under the
jurisdiction of Seguridad Pública. POVEDANO replied that it had not
been discussed in plain words with LARA, but that he would discuss it
with him in order to determine whether the matter should be dropped
or explored further. He was cautioned not to tell LARA of his
conversations with the Embassy officers.
6. Several days later subject advised that he had discussed
the matter fully with Foreign Minister LARA and that the latter had
been extremely interested in the proposal. However, LARA pointed
out that the Foreign Office had no jurisdiction in this regard and
told POVEDANO to discuss the proposition with Lt. Col. Gonzalo SEGARES,
Oficial Mayor of Seguridad Pública..
"
7. According to POVEDANO, SEGARES became very enthusiastic
about the idea and authorized subject to carry out further study and
collect the necessary technical data and equipment. SEGARES offered
to provide funds for purchase of required chemicals, etc., for ex-
perimentation in secret ink detection and instructed subject to make
plans for the training of several additional persons in the procedure.
Subject indicated to SEGARES that he would use his home darkroom and
laboratory for this training and possibly even for the eventual
processing of suspect correspondence.
8. With this official authorization and support, subject
again inquired whether it would be possible for us to assist him in
obtaining pertinent manuals, background literature, reference material,
and technical advice on mail censorship procedures and secret writing
detection. In view of subject's apparent official backlog and
-personal-determination_to_continue_his_inquiries,_we_decided_to_make
a gesture of assistance on a confidential, unofficial basis with a
view-to-controlling-and-possibly directing his activities.

invitation to work with him on an unofficial basis in
his planning and experimentation activities, thus keeping
ourselves informed of his progress?
C. Is headquarters interested in the possibility
of replacing our presently incomplete post office coverage
with an all-Costa Rican operation which we could tap either
through POVEDANO or directly through SEGARES?
d. Unless advised to the contrary, we will continue
our present HUMANOID-1 and HUMANOID-2 activities during
this period despite POVEDANO's project. HUMANOID will be
alerted, however.
e. Is headquarters interested in our casually
returning discussion to the subject of codes and ciphers
with a possible view to assisting Costa Rica obtain systems
to which we might retain a key?
f. Could headquarters provide an opinion as to whât
the reaction of the Department of State would be to a formal
request from the Costa Rican Government for assistance on
either codes and ciphers or clandestine censorship?
12. It is to be noted that POVEDANO knows RUSSO as just
another Embassy officer. In all our discussion with him we have
stressed that this is a subject which RUSSO cannot discuss in his
official capacity, but would like to help on a personal basis because
the activity would be directed against the Communists. POVEDANO has
apparently accepted this relationship and assures that he has not
indicated to LARA or SEGARES that he has talked with RUSSO, merely
informing them that he, POVEDANO, would attempt to obtain reference
material through friends in the American Cryptographic Society and
elsewhere.
-
13. One last comment. If headquarters decision is to stay
clear of this whole proposition, it is earnestly requested that some
few-items-of-background-material on secret writing, or book titles of
overt publications_on_the_subject_be_furnished us to pass to POVEDANO
for the purpose of indicating a reply has been received to our inquiries.
The continued good will of POVEDANO is deemed of operational value as
he appears to be well connected in high government circles.
.
14.
Also, in view of the fact subject will be questioning
us continually as to what we have learned, and will be suspending
other action pending our advice, we ask that an immediate answer,
preliminary-if-necessary, be-made-to-this_dispatch.
