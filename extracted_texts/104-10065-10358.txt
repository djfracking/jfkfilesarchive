1. NO TRUST HAS RESPONDED ORALLY TO OUR NOTE CONCERNING
PASSAGE OF (NIGALE INFORMATION ON THE VLAAMSE MILITANTENORDE
(VMO) TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS. GIST OF HIS
COMMENT: HE WILL NOT PASS US INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE VMD-
AMCIT CONTACTS, BECAUSE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WILL
PLACE SUCH INFORMATION AT RISK; AND IN GENERAL HE WILL NOT
APPROVE PASSAGE OF NIGALE INFORMATION ON THE VMO TO CONGRESS
BECAUSE HE HAS INSUFFICIENT ASSURANCE THAT THE MATERIAL WILL
NOT LEAK, DESPITE OUR ASSURANCES THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD BE
HANDLED AS CLASSIFIED AND SENSITIVE.
2.
WE ARE AWAITING WRITTEN REPLY TO LEARN WHETHER THERE
ANY GIVE IN NITRUST ATTITUDE. RE AMCIT ASPECT, WE SUSPECT
THERE IS MEASURE OF POSTURING ON NITRUST'S SIDE. IN REF B
ACOS/NIGALE-75 DISCUSSION, LATTER REMARKED THAT TO BEST HIS
KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY KNOWN VMO CONNECTION WITH AMERICAN WAS
INCIDENT IN ABOUT EARLY 1977 WHEN ORGANIZATION MET BRIEFLY
WITH AN AMERICAN NAZI PARTY MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM
UK AND PASSED THROUGH BELGIUM. HE DISCUSSED THE CASE WITH US
AT THE TIME (NAME OF TRAVELLER NOT RECALLED BY (N-75 OR ACOS).
.
3. THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN DISLODGE NITRUST'S OBVIOUS
MIND SET ON THE CONGRESSIONAL SITUATION. QUESTION OF CONGRESS
ASIDE, IF HEADQUARTERS CAN PROVIDE SPECIFICS ON FOIA MECHANICS
WHICH WE CAN USE TO COUNTER NITRUST'S ASSERTION THAT RTACTION
CANNOT PROTECT LIAISON SOURCES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON
AMERICANS, WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE SUCH POINTS WITH NITRUST.
