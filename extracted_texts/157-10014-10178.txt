with O'Donnell a plan to snatch Lumumba from "protective custody."
But he does not specifically remember this.
COS said that "O'Donnell did not seem to do anything most of
the time, and I didn't take him very seriously. He spent a lot of
time drinking." COS said that he was not aware of any action
O'Donnell took to carry out an assassination or a "snatch" of
Lumumba.
COS said that the assassination plan had struck him from the
beginning as a bad idea, so he moved slowly on it. "I showed some
action to Headquarters by sending cables, but never pushed it."
COS said that he asked O'Donnell to clear with him any major
actions he was contemplating in the Congo. COS believes that
O'Donnell was in the Congo from September until approximately
Christmas.
LUMUMBA's ESCAPE
COS said that Lumumba's escape from "protective custody" was
a surprise to him. He said that the CIA Station had nothing to do
with it, although they investigated the incident.
COS said "I was in touch with many official Congolese about
where Lumumba was and how he got out. But I did not get much good
information. It was assumed that Lumumba was going to Stanleyville.
The Congolese flew troops to points that he would have to pass on
this route. I remember reviewing maps of these routes with the
Congolese."
COS added, "I left the Congo for Rome because of the prospect
that Lumumba might start an uprising against 'white devils.' But

Mr. Baron. Do you have any independent recolleciton of
being made aware of this meeting?
Mr. Dillon. No, I do not.
Mr. Baron. Is this consonant with your understanding of
the policy at the highest levels of the American Government
toward Lumumba at this time?
Mr. Dillon. It fits inis with what I understood was the
general policy that we were very concerned with.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall that at this period of time, in
early September, Lumumba had just been deposed, and there was
a struggle going on between Lumumba and Kasavubu for power
which culminated in a coup on September 14th by Mobutu and
on the 13th of September Lumumba entered the protective
custody of the United Nations forces in Leopoldville, do you
recall that chain of events?
Mr. Dillon. No. I knew that at some point there was a

Mr. Baron. The last paragraph of those minutes quote
Mr. Dulles as saying: "The Soviet ships off the African
Coast were apparently awaiting a clarification of the situation.

Did Mr. Dulles make those remarks?
Mr. Dillon. I don't recall those particular remarks.
But he could have. But again, there my own interpretation,
"disposed of" wouldn't necessarily only be assassinated, it
would be gotten out of the Congo to some place where he was
neutralized and couldn't come back in, and you could be sure
he was done with.
Mr. Baron. But assassination would have been one of the
means of disposing of Lumumba, that would have been acceptable?
Mr. Dillon. I guess the word "disposed" could mean that.
But that strikes me as rather surprising, because I would
think once he was out of office, our concern would have been
deescalated to some extent, it would have been more to find
some way, which should have been perfectly possible, of
getting him out, or locking him up, or anything.
Mr. Baron. Let me represent to you that the report of
the United Nations investigation of the circumstances
surrounding Lumumba's death, which was not reported until
February of 1961, indicated that at this time, in late

Mr. Dillon. Yes, I see now that I attended this as Acting

Mr. Baron. And do you recall the discussion reported in
those minutes of affairs in the Congo, that there was the
fear of Egyptian influence on the Congo situation on the part
of Lumumba, and that there was some pressure being brought to
reconcile Kasavutu and Lumumba?

Whether he cared much whether we recognized
him as the legitimate representative or not I would doubt.
I don't think he had much interest in what we recognized.
But I think it does show that he wanted to get out. And this
was a way of getting out.
And he also probably wanted to go to the UN and make a big
complaint there.

where the CIA officer's expectation was that Lumumba would
receive a trial, and probably capital punishment at the hands
of the Congolese Army. Does this mission of the CIA officer
seem to conform to your own idea of US policy at that time
toward Lumumba?
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I think very much so.
Mr. Baron. Now, we also have testimony that the CIA
Chief of Station in the Congo was visited by a representative
from CIA Headquarters who supplied him with lethal biological
agents and the equipment with which to administer these
substances for the purpose of assassinating Lumumba, and that
he, the Chief of Station, was charged with such a mission,
which obviously he never carried out successfully.
Have you
ever heard any mention or even a hint of such an operation?
Mr. Dillon. No, I never have.

Mr. Dillon. No, I wasn't aware of that.
Mr. Dawson. Mr. Secretary, Mr. Baron has asked a lot of
questions about some of the factual parts of this. And I
would like to follow up on some of your statements about
Director Dulles' willingness to protect the President. I
think you made a very interesting and forthright observation,
that he was very interested in keeping the President protected
from things which may cause embarassment to him.
Mr. Dillon. Not personally, but that he though would
cause great embarrassment to the nation as well as to just
the Presidency, whereas if it was some individual, it is just
because it is the terrible Mr. Dulles and the terrible CIA,
it is not the nation. And the President is the nation. So
that it was a fairly deep feeling which went beyond
personality institutionally to the Presidency, which should
not be involved in this sort of thing.
Mr. Dawson. Did you investigate what may have been the
basis for your feeling, which is your current feeling, that
that was his way of operation?
Mr. Dillon. I think that it was primarily I had known

about that and heard about it in the Rockefeller Commission
with Castro, but not about this.
Mr. Dawson. Would you expect to be told about the
operational detail?
Mr. Dillon. Not in detail. But I am rather surprised
that it went this far and in my position I didn't know some-
thing about it. It may be that they felt that it was so tight
that there was no need to tell anyone except the Secretary of
State. I assume Secretary Herter would have known about it.
Mr. Baron. Would it be possible that the CIA would feel
that the "plausible deniability" would have covered someone
in your position?

September of 1960, Lumumba was in the custody of the United
Nations troops, who were actually protecting him at his
residence in Leopoldville, not restraining him from leaving,
but there was a Congolese guard surrounding the UN troops
who were prepared to arrest Lumumba if he did leave his
residence.
Mr. Dillon. I think I recall that now, because it is
rather unusual circumstances.
Mr. Baron. And then apparently in the middle of October
the UN had refused to surrender Lumumba to the Congolese Army;
Is it your
understanding that during this period of time, even after.
Lumumba was in the protective custody of the United Nations,

Mr. Dillon. I would imagine so. And I would not be at
all surprised if the then rulers or officials of the
Congolese Government that succeeded Lumumba were concerned
about it, because he had this tremendous ability to stir up a
crowd or a group. And if he could have gotten out and started
to talk to the battalion of the Congolese Army, he probably
would have had them in the palm of his hand in five minutes.
Mr. Baron. We had testimony from a CIA officer, who said
he had been dispatched to the Congo by CIA Headquarters for
the purpose of trying to secure Lumumba's escape from UN

both, but not to accept the responsibility himself if nothing

Mr. Herter had just gotten back from a NATO meeting in
Turkey, and he made a special trip out to Camp David to urge
this on him, to warn him before he did assume responsibility
himself. But to no avail. Hagerty was very strong for the
President taking responsibility, because I think he had a

when I arrived in Rome I read that Lumumba was captured. I learned
from Mobutu and Casavubu that Lumumba would be imprisoned in Thys-
ville.
COS MEETS WITH BISSELL, TWEEDY, AND KARAMESSINES IN ROME
In November 1960, while Lumumba was at large, COS flew to Rome
to meet with Richard Bissell, Bronson Tweedy and Thomas Karamessines
(then Chief of Station in Rome) for a briefing session on events
in the Congo. The meeting took place at Karamessines' house. COS
remembers a general discussion of events surrounding Lumumba's
escape and of the situation in the Congo, but he does not recall
any specific discussion of assassination. He said, "Perhaps we
did discuss assassination, I simply don't recall. I was tired. I
had flown all day. And I wasn't in favor of assassination."
BRONSON TWEEDY
COS assumed that Tweedy was knowledgeable of the assassination
plan. However, he does not recall specifically discussing the plan
with Tweedy prior to the delivery of the poison or while he was in
possession of the poison. COS said, "I did talk with Bronson
Tweedy much later about it to the effect that 'thank God nothing
was ever done.
COS did not remember whether Tweedy came to the Congo before
Lumumba's death. COS thought that he must have come later. COS
said, however, that if Tweedy had come earlier he probably would
have asked Tweedy about the assassination mission.

And the next thing we knew suddenly the President told
Colonel Goodpastor to say that this was descended from the

And the next thing we knew the statement came out from
the US from NASA which made no sense at all.
And of course what had happened was that Hagerty
that
had been the routine thing, and when it came up Hagerty was
to refer the press to NASA, and NASA, if they were referred,

little different view of this. I think he had a view that
the press looked on the President as someone who was not in
full charge of the State Department at time, and he thought
this would contribute to that, which would be very bad for
the President. So we were thinking of it more from the
international aspect. We had the contrary feeling.
Mr. Baron. Did the President's trust in Allen Dulles
diminish significantly after the U-2 affair.
Mr. Dillon. No, because there was nothing wrong with the
U-2 affair, except that the President had authorized it
specifically, it was flying on the day after he authorized it.
The only bolix that came was in the after events, where this
silly press release announcement was put out by NASA, I guess
it was, that this plane had just been sort of flying around and
got lost, or something like that. And we really had a very
difficult time about that at the morning meeting where the
news came to us, which was out in the Virginia hills. The
President had a meeting of a restricted nature afterwards,
including me and Allen Dulles, the Secretary of Defense, and
Colonel Goodpastor.
And he put me in charge of handling the whole thing, and
gave me the responsibility. And he wasn't fully briefed on

to the President, although he was a relatively junior officer
at that time, he was a young colonel
I think he may have
even been a major when he started there in the White House.
But he was sort of Staff Secretary to the President on all
those relations with the Pentagon and the CIA and the State
Department. If you wanted to see the President on something
important, it was generally through General Goodpastor rather
than through Gordon Gray. And Gordon Gray handled most of
the detailed mechanics of setting up meetings, and that sort
of thing. He was not as much a personal assistant to the
President.
And that job was held by General Goodpastor.
Mr. Dawson. But in circumstances where the President was
going to be made aware of attempts to overthrow a government,
in front of a number of people like the Special Group of the
National Security Council, were you privy to some of those
occurances?
Mr. Dillon. I don't ever recall one.
Mr. Dawson.
You don't recall instances where an attempt
or discussion to overthrow a government or anything more
sinister than an assassination was brought up?
Mr. Dillon. No, except the discussion of preparing a
capacity to invade Cuba. That was considered. And we have
the minutes on that. That was considered a number of times

Mr. Dillon. We still felt strongly that that had been a
mistake, because it put Khrushchev in a position where he
felt he had to break off the talks in Paris with the President)
and so forth, which we felt would not have been the case
otherwise.
So this didn't change Mr. Dulles at all, it made him even
stronger in wanting to protect the President, because he knew
the President was difficult to protect.
Mr. Dawson. During the period following the U-2 crisis
you saw Director Dulles brief the Government on intelligence
operations?
Mr. Dillon. He did this at every National Security
Council meeting. The format of the meetings were that the
meeting would be called to order by the President, and then
he would turn to Mr. Dulles for the intelligence briefing,
which was the first item of business in all those meetings.
Mr. Dawson. On those occasions did Mr. Dulles attempt to
tell the President enough where he would have some idea of
what was going on, but not tell him directly what was
happening?
Mr. Dillon. Most of the briefings were about intelligence
what other people were doing and what was happening. And it

would only be exceptional when they would deal with what we
were doing ourselves.
Mr. Dawson. Dealing with the latter, when Mr. Dulles
wanted Presidential approval to mount an operation, how did he
go about achieving that or gaining that approval?
Mr. Dillon. I don't really know. I do know in regard,
to the U-2 flights, which had a very special procedure set up
whereby a piece of paper had to be signed in each case by the
Director of Central Intelligence, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of Defense, or Acting Secretary of Defense, and then
taken to the President and approved by him before the flight
could take place. And that was handled by General Goodpastor
rather than through Mr. Gray.

After an intelligence operation blows, in
the sense that it is uncovered in connection with the Govern-

routine order goes out to estand down intelligence, to take
positiveactions in that area, are you aware of that standard
operating procedure?
Mr. Dillon. I don't quite understand what your question
is there.

After the U-2 crisis did we for a period of

Mr. Dillon. That was a natural thing. Obviously we

to shoot them down, and so it was no use doing it again.
And I would imagine we probably eased off on the electronic
flights along the coasts of the Soviet Union, and kept them
further away, or disconinued them for awhile.
Mr. Dawson. Are you aware of a similar stand down order
having been issued after Lumumba was captured?
Mr. Dillon. No..

this Special Group meeting took place on August 25th, is that
correct?
Mr. Dillon. Yes, there is a possibility, because August
was the month, if one was going to take any time off in the
summer, it was likely to be in August.
Mr. Dawson. It was best to take it off during August
because of the miserable summers?
Mr. Dillon. Yes. And my family had a summer place where
I had gone since childhood in Maine, and it was easy to get to.
I do have enough recollection to know I was there a couple of
times when I had to get back for a Security Council meeting
and there were certain weather problems from the Coast of
Maine. I recall one time, it could have been this year, or it
could have been a year earlier. But I know I was there those
summers for a few days. And it could have been in August.
Mr. Baron. In reference to the meeting at the Pentagon
that was the subject of your affidavit, you mentioned to me
before we began this testimony today that from what you have
read recently, it is your impression that the remark of the
CIA representative at that meeting which, as you have said,
in effect turned off the suggestion of an assassination
attempt against Lumumba, might have been made simply because
the group was too large for such a discussion?
I said that because of
Mr. Dillon. It might have been
what I have learned since, and I have learned more today

your experience in the State Department and the Treasury
Department, and also your recent service on the Rockefeller
Commission. But I wondered specifically, in reference to the
assassination area, where we faced the need to tie up our
investigations as soon as possible, and perhaps make some
recommendations as soon as possible, do you have any specific
suggestions?
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't think so. I think that the record
has shown that this is the type of thing that the US
Government or any of its branches cannot and should not engage
in. And I doubt very much that there will be any repitition
of this sort of thing that took place in the early sixties,
which I guess was predicated on the belief that something like
that could be done in exceptional circumstances without its
being surfaced and being connected with the US. And I think
even those who believed that such action was morally proper
and might have been in the best intersts of both the US and
the world would think that the costs were too heavy if it was

of foreign policy?
Mr. Dillon. The only thing is,
I don't know just what
institutional changes are really necessary, but there should
be the clarification that the Special Group, or whatever
name it is given for the Committee, would have to approve any
action by the CIA, whether it is assassination or military
action or anything else, in writing. I think that would be
fine. I think it is naivete to have the idea that the
President has to approve anything like that.
I tend to agree
with Mr. Dulles that you should not get the President
personally involved in details of operations that might be
on the edge of what is right. I am not judging just about
assassinations, but in any covert operation. The law now is
that the President has to approve any covert operation. I
think that the result now will be that there wouldn't be
15
any. I think there may be times when we will need them, but
16
not violent ones. I have in mind such things as financial

help and such things as that. But I don't think the President

ought personally to sign the checks.

3. Congo
Gen. Cabell mentioned briefly the fact of the election of Joseph Ileo
to the Presidency of the Congo Senate, and the fact that we had assisted
him financially. He indicated that we in no way intend to claim full
credit for his election but, particularly in view of the very close
contest, we might have had some effect; and in any case we may have
secured some influence with this potentially useful individual.
7. Cuba
In an informal conversation after Gen. Cabell's departure,
Mr. Gray expressed the opinion that the U.S. has taken publicly about
all that it can afford to take from the Castro government; that public
opinion both here and abroad is probably beginning to feel that there is
no limit as to how far this country can be pushed around; that this may
encourage other small countries to take a similar tack; and that the
longer we delay with effective economic and other action the harder we
may make it for ourselves.
Mr. Merchant and Mr. Irwin agreed, with the stipulation that
the United States should not take affirmative action until it is prepared
to follow through on a substantial scale.

COS INFORMS DCI SCHLESINGER OF ASSASSINATION PLAN
COS said that in response to Schlesinger's request for reports
on "questionable activities" within the Agency, COS met with him.
COS said that he informed Schlesinger verbally that he had received
instructions to try to assassinate Lumumba. COS said that he did
not mention a poison virus to Schlesinger. COS said that Schlesinger
did not make a response to this information. COS was unaware of
any follow-up that was taken due to his briefing of Schlesinger.
OTHERS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE ASSASSINATION PLAN
COS said that he assumed that TWEEDY, BISSELL, and DULLES were
witting of the assassination plan. COS said that he did have
occasion to see ALLEN DULLES from time to time, but he does not
remember discussing assassination in any form with DULLES.
COS said, "I might have mentioned the assassination plan to
COLBY when he became Director. However, COS does not have any
specific recollection of a conversation with COLBY.
COS does not think he informed RICHARD HELMS of the assassina-
tion plan.
COS said that he was never interviewed by the INSPECTOR GENERAL
in 1967 in the preparation of the IG Report on Assassinations.
COS said that he never discussed the assassination plan with
ARNOLD SILVER.
PROJECT ZRRIFLE AND AGENT QJWIN
COS said he never discussed the assassination plan with William
Harvey (the Director of Project ZRRIFLE). COS said he never discussed
assassination capabilities or assets with Harvey.

but they did try to develop such a capacity versus Castro.
But as
I have thought about it since we talked, I think that
is less likely.
I think it is more likely that it might have
been the beginning of this whole idea on the CIA's part that
they should develop such a capacity. And maybe they didn't
have it then and went to work to develop it beginning in
August.

AFFIDAVIT
Dillon
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SS:
I, C. Douglas Dillon, being first duly sworn, do upon oath
depose and state:
From June 1959 until early January 1961, I served as Under
Secretary of State. During approximately 35-40 percent of
that time, I served as Acting Secretary of State because of
Secretary Herter's absence from Washington.
Secretary Herter, who preceded me as Under Secretary of State,
had served as the State Department representative on the 54/12
Committee, a predecessor of the present Forty Committee. When
I became Under Secretary, the President asked me to retain my
earlier responsibilities for foreign economic policy. Accord-
ingly, the Number 3 position in the Department of State was
designated as Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Robert
Murphy was appointed to this position and took over the State
Department's responsibilities on the 54/12 Committee.
Because of the frequency of my service as Acting Secretary of
State, I was kept regularly informed of important 54/12 Com-
mittee decisions. On occasion I met with the 54/12 Committee
and participated in its deliberations.
During this entire period I have no recollection of any dis-
cussions or decisions looking toward the assassination of
either Generalissimo Trujillo or Prime Minister Castro.
On one occasion in late July or early August of 1960, shortly
after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington, I attended a meet-
ing in the Pentagon at which the overall Congo problem was dis-
cussed. During the discussion, which covered a great variety
of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding the
possibility of an assassination attempt against Lumumba was
briefly raised. The CIA representative indicated that the Agency
did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended considera-
tion of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any
discussion of assassination attempts against anyone.
Dated this 21 day of May, 1975.

to insist on a more precise spelling out of individual or group

Mr. Parrott also said that Mr. Macy had raised a related
point which Mr. Barnes and he had agreed had validity, and that
Mr. Barnes had undertaken to assure Macy that it would be given
adequate attention by the interagency planning group. This was a
concern expressed as to planning for the support fiscal and otherwise -
of a new Cuban government immediately after a successful overturn
of the present one. Mr. Merchant said that he agreed fully with the
necessity for making contingency plans of this sort, and had in fact
directed three weeks ago that State officials begin to draw them up.

√4. Cuba
· The DCI summarized the progress we have made in establishing
contact with certain dissident groups within Cuba. In this connection
he also noted the apparent fulfillment of a sabotage requirement which
had been levied on one of these groups as a test of its capabilities
(after this action had been cleared with the Special Group).
He also said that we hope to have a paramilitary force of
approximately 500 people ready to operate by November. In answer
to Mr. Irwin's question, he outlined two possible ways of initiating
the tactical combat phase.
Mr. Gray then told the Group of a talk he had had with the
Director of the Bureau of the Budget. The latter had told Mr. Gray
that he had discussed the Cuban project with Mr. Macy and that as
a result of this discussion he, Mr. Stans, had two reservations that
he would like Gray to look into.
One of these had to do with the statement by Macy that in his
discussion with CIA representatives in connection with the latest
withdrawal from the Reserve, he had received "no evidence" that any
effective resistance had been identified within Cuba. (Mr. Gray had
answered that in the formal presentation last week, Mr. Dulles and
Mr. Bissell had mentioned a number of such groups.)
The second point had to do with a feeling that we might not

outstanding intelligence, ability or drive, but that he is obviously
well motivated. Mr. Irwin asked whether there might be other
individuals of similar, although naturally lesser, stature in the church
hierarchy who could be useful.
Mr. Merchant commented that the Catholic Church in Black
Africa is not a very substantial force. Mr. Dulles concurred in this,
but added that this would be something to keep in mind as appropriate.

Mr. Dulles inquired whether Mr. Merchant wanted to discuss
the proposal to dispatch a letter to Trujillo suggesting that the latter
retire from office. At Mr. Merchant's request, the DCI stated his
opinion, which was to the effect that he had considerable reservation
as to the efficacy or wisdom of such a letter. He said that it seemed
to him much more useful to make a personal approach, which not only
stood a chance of being more effective, but also could be denied.
He pointed out that a personal approach had been attempted some time.
ago, but that the individual in question had not been able to carry it
off. He suggested that the approach might best be made by an
unofficial American, and that Mr. Pawley would be a better bet than
the previous individual.
-
Mr. Merchant said that he realized his own name had been
suggested, and that he was far from enthusiastic about the idea. He
said further that he has a visceral feeling against asking a Chief of
State to get out of office either through the medium of a letter or
personal contact - particularly when we do not know who might succeed
him. Mr. Merchant conceded with good humor the validity of Mr.
Gray's wry comment that Mr. Merchant's ethics and his pragmatism'
might be somewhat intertwined.
Mr. Gray said that he was entirely opposed to having any U.S.
official sign such a letter. He thought that an unofficial letter might
be a different matter.
The conclusion of the Group was that it would be worth the
effort to get Mr. Pawley to attempt a direct approach to the Benefactor;
it was noted that the chances of success are perhaps less than even,
but that no great harm could result.
5. Congo
There was a brief discussion of developments in the Congo and
the possibilities of effective action there. Mr. Gray said that he
hoped that Agency people in the field are fully aware of the top-level
feeling in Washington that vigorous action would not be amiss.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 25 August 1960
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant, Gray, Irwin, Dulles
1. Congo
Mr. Parrott outlined broadly three (or as Mr. Dulles later
described them "2 1/2") operational lines that we are following in
mounting an anti-Lumumba campaign in the Congo. These included:
operations through the chief advisor of the Christian Trade Unions;
the planned attempt of a Socialist labor Senator to arrange a vote of
no confidence in Lumumba; and a brand new contact with an alleged
leader of certain independent labor groups. He emphasized that the
latter had just come up and that we are now in the process of assessing
the bona fides and capabilities of the individual.
The Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much.
in order. Mr. Gray commented, however, that his associates had
expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very
straightforward action in this situation, and he wondered whether
the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this. Mr. Dulles
replied that he had taken the comments referred to seriously and had
every intention of proceeding as vigorously as the situation permits
or requires, but added that he must necessarily put himself in a
position of interpreting instructions of this kind within the bounds of
necessity and capability. It was finally agreed that, planning for the
Congo would not necessarily rule out "consideration" of any particular
kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.
Mr. Irwin commented that certain individuals in Defense have
given thought to the possibility of using high officials of the Catholic
Church in Africa to promote the general objectives of the West. In
this connection, he cited a preliminary assessment which had been
made of the Negro Cardinal recently appointed by the Pope the
assessment being that the individual in question is a man of not

Mr. Dulles said he believed a warrant had been issued
for the arrest of Lumumba. Aside from Lumumba, Mobutu appears
to be the only man in the Congo able to act with firmness. A
recent attempt to assassinate Mobutu had failed. Mr. Dulles
then reported that we had attempted to provide Mobutu with
funds but that the guards protecting Mobutu had relieved our
messenger of the funds. We cannot get funds to Mobutu because
he does not have complete control over his guards. A new
development has been Mobutu's creation of a council of advisers,
most of whom are graduate students. The old ministers have
been turned out of office and their offices have been taken
over for the council, which is intended to carry on for a temp-
orary period. Mr. Dulles reported that the USSR had suffered
a severe blow to its prestige in the Congo. However, he had
been surprised at the ease with which the Soviets were forced
out of the Congo. He believed that the Soviet diplomats, after
departing from the Congo, went to Accra but he did not know
whether they had moved on toward the USSR. Mr. Gray asked
whether the Soviets were really quitting the Congo. Secretary
Dillon said the Soviet press has not yet admitted that the
Soviets have quit the Congo. Mr. Dulles said the Soviet diplo-
mats indicated to the press before leaving that they would be
back. Secretary Dillon believed it was clear that the Soviets
had not given up in the Congo. Mr. Dulles reported that the
Soviet diplomats left the Congo so hurriedly that the Soviet
markings which they painted over the Congo markings on their
planes were still wet when they left. Mr. Dulles said the
Soviet ships off the African coast were apparently awaiting
a clarification of the situation. Mobutu appeared to be the
effective power in the Congo for the moment but Lumumba was
not yet disposed of and remained a grave danger as long as
he was not disposed of.
[
Mr. Dulles observed that the situation in Laos was still
confusing and that little progress had been made toward the
settlement of the crisis during the past week. The threatening
situation in Sam Neua Province, however, had been quieted as
a result of the dispatch of Laotian parachute troops to that
area. The situation remains troublesome because Pathet Lao
and Viet Minh forces could intervene at any time. The problem
of the conflicting governments in Laos is no nearer a settle-
ment. The King has requested that General Ouane and General
Phoumi call upon him. A skirmish between Phoumi's forces and
Vientiane forces has been reported at Pak Sane, but little
bloodshed resulted. Apparently, Phoumi has adopted tactics
of carrying on a war of nerves against Vientiane. There has
been firing across the Mekong River into the city and Phoumi
apparently intends to starve out the government.
Meanwhile,

kept under continuing scrutiny by all interested
departments and agencies to ensure that it serves
the purposes of retarding the growth of the war
potential of the Sino-Soviet Bloc and reducing its
unity. Noted that, with respect to paragraph 11 of

not only to achieve a worthwhile adverse impact on

also to serve other U.S. policy objectives, especially
with regard to technology and services.
NOTE: The action in b above, as approved by the President,
subsequently transmitted to all holders of NSC 5704/3.
SIGNIFICANT WORLD DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING U.S. SECURITY
Mr. Dulles said he would first summarize developments in
the Congo.
Several African states were making frantic efforts
to save Lumumba. An intercepted message between Egypt and Ghana
indicates that Nasser is urging the UAR, Ghana, and Guinea to
concentrate their forces in Leopoldville and bring pressure to
bear for the maintenance of Lumumba as Prime Minister. Mr.Dulles
remarked that the bulk of the UAR forces now in the Congo had
been placed advisedly in north Equateur Province, while the
Guinea forces were in the northern part of Leopoldville Province.
Intercepted messages also indicated that Nasser had asked that
a council be formed in Leopoldville consisting of the diplomatic
representatives of the UAR, Ghana, and Guinea in that city. The
UAR Ambassador to the Congo had been directed, in concert with
the Ambassadors of Ghana, Guinea and Morocco to attempt to per-
suade Kasavubu to effect a reconciliation with Lumumba. On Sep-
tember 20 Kasavubu had announced that he had reached no agreement
with Lumumba but the latter had later displayed a piece of paper
purporting to be an agreement with Kasavubu.
Secretary Dillon reported that Lumumba had requested a visa
for travel to New York as the representative of the Congo to
the UN and had also requested a visa as an official of the Govern-
ment of the Congo. We had denied both requests for visas. How-
ever, if Lumumba asked for a visa to visit the U.S. as a private
citizen, we would have difficulty in turning him down.Mr.Dillon
added that the Congo Government declares it will arrest Lumumba
if he attempts to leave the country.

know enough about the political attitudes of the members of the Frente,
particularly as to basic freedoms, their attitude toward restoration
of seized American property, etc. (In answer to this, Mr. Gray had
pointed out that the Frente is composed of people who have broken
with Castro, at least on the basic philosophies.)
www
In an attempt to clarify the situation with respect to the first
point, Mr. Parrott told the Group about last Monday's meeting with
Mr. Macy, at which Mr. Barnes had covered in considerable detail
all aspects of the Cuban project. He said that he was at a loss to
understand how Macy could have received the impression that CIA
is not aware of dissident groups. He went on to say that in answer
to Mr. Macy's question as to the outlook, Mr. Barnes had stated -
and had developed at considerable length the thesis that our view
was one of limited optimism, and that he had explained in detail just
why this is so; this explanation had included specific comments on the
steps that have been, and are being, taken to identify such groups and
to assess their apparent leaders. Mr. Parrott said further that the
point had been made forcibly to Macy that it would be out of the question
for CIA to attempt to mount an invasion of Cuba by itself, without the
participation of large numbers of disaffected individuals within the
country.
On the second point, Mr. Dulles said that we do know a good
deal about the basic political sympathies of Frente members, and
cited as an example the position that had been taken as to the inclusion
of certain ultra-conservative groups. He said that the Frente had
issued a statement of its aims, which he summarized very broadly
as being to preserve the principles of the revolution. He said that as
to specific stands on restoration of U.S. property rights, etc., this
was thought to be unwise because it would give the Frente the appearance
of being a tool of the Americans. He agreed, however, that Mr. Stans'
point was a valid one to bear in mind and said we would certainly do
60. He added that he expects to lunch with Mr. Stans in the near future
and would take that opportunity to discuss these matters further, as
appropriate.
Mr. Parrott said that there was no disagreement that the political
ideas of these individuals must be constantly assessed and must be
clearly established before the operation actually comes off. He
added, however, that it should be borne in mind that once these
politically-screened individuals had issued their general statement
of objectives, our primary operational task has been to hold the FRD
together, and that at this particular stage it would not be practical

SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 8 September 1960
PRESENT: Messrs. Merchant, Douglas, Gray, Dulles
1. Supply Drop to Cuban Dissidents
Mr. Parrott outlined the proposed supply drop to Cuban
dissidents in the Escambray. After brief discussion, the Group
approved the project as presented. Mr. Parrott asked whether
approval could be granted at this time for continuing missions of
a similar nature to this group or other bodies of dissidents. The
Special Group agreed to this, with Mr. Dulles stating that the other
members could be notified by telephone, without the necessity of
convening a meeting.

COS did not recall agent QJWIN. He did recall that O'Donnell
may have brought an asset into the Congo to help him. He said,
however, that based on our representation that QJWIN was in the
Congo in the fall of 1960, he must have known of QJWIN's activities.
WIROGUE
COS does not remember the true name of agent WIROGUE nor why
or how he came to the Congo. When his recollection was refreshed
by seeing cable traffic, COS said that WIROGUE was a difficult man.
to handle. For a short time, WIROGUE became a major in the Congolese
Army. COS said that he had wanted ROGUE to pull together a sur-
veillance team. COS did not recall discussing WIROGUE with O'Donnell.
COS's only specific recollection is of being in WIROGUE's
apartment and discussing an assassination squad. COS does not
think that he mentioned the use of QJWIN in connection with this
"execution squad." COS said that it was conceivable that he had
approached WIROGUE with the idea of using him against Lumumba.
But COS remembers he came to mistrust WIROGUE and felt that WIROGUE
did not know what he was doing. COS also said it was unlikely
that he would have sent the cable about WIROGUE's approach to
QJWIN in ordinary CIA channels as he did if he thought this related
to the actual assassination mission. Instead, it was merely
evidence that WIROGUE was out of control.

was being held there. COS was in contact with various Congolese

"But no one can be absolutely certain," he said.
Raised Eyebrows
What Fidel Castro sald while seated on the Swedish Embassy sofa will cause some
eyebrows to be raised in many countries which Cuba has accepted as international
allies.
"
One of the key phrases of Olof Palme's Latin American trip has been "a new economic
world order. It is a term which embraces small countries' rights to control their
natural resources, and in both the oil power, Venezuela, and the potential oil power,
Mexico, Olof Palme's hosts have adopted the concept with enthusiasm.
When Fidel Castro explained his own skepticism concerning talk of "a new economic
world order" after dinner at the Swedish Embassy, he did so in a violent attack on
the world's oil-producing countries.
He believed that a new world order could not be created by the introduction of new
privileges for a new group of countries.

it is not the industrialized countries which are affected by the oil countries'
profits but the poor countries which do not have oil.

Someone asked if it is true that Cuba is receiving economic aid from the USSR in

(9) In early 1962, with CIA instructions through Guantanamo, Jorge Luis Cuervo
Calvo reorganized several groups into the "Union de Unidades Revolucionarias"
(UDUR). A meeting was held to plan an uprising and discuss arrangements which
had been made to receive equipment through Guantanamo. CIA was pressing
both attempts against Castro and staged acts of agression against Guantanamo.
Calvo outlined "Plan Z" a scheme to kill Foreign Minister Raul Roa, and
then attack other Cuban leaders who would attend the burial. "The authors"
of the plan are listed as Cay Hernandez and Cay Gispert and members of the
DRE organization headed by Julio Hernandez Rojo, listed as a CIA agent
infiltrated into Cuba. Weaponry included a double-barreled shotgun,
explosives, grenades, and demolition timing devices, one labeled "Block
Demolition, M5 A1."
In 1963 another consolidation of groups was carried out with CIA direction from
abroad through agent Nino Diaz. The umbrella group was "Resistencia Civica
Anticomunista" (RCA), and it incorporated the "Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional"
(ELN), "Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria" (MRR), and "Agrupacion
Montecristi," among others. The overall objective, as instructed by the CIA,
was to create the impression of a strong internal resistance to Castro, and to
inspire a decision for armed intervention at the meeting of OAS presidents. Again,
instructions came through Guantanamo.
(10) March 13, 1963, the RCA initiated a plan to assassinate Castro from a house
near the Univeristy of Havana, by firing a mortar. People arrested included
Samuel Carballo Moreno, identified as a CIA agent. Attacks were to be made
simultaneously on the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and on
National Revolutionary Militia sites. Bazookas, mortars and machine guns
were taken.
(11) April 7, 1963, the RCA developed a plan involving sixteen men armed with
pistols and fragmentation grenades, who were to attack Castro at the Latin
American Stadium. Those arrested were Enrique Rodriguez Valdes (known as
"Mulgado"), Ricardo Lopez Cabrera, Onorio Torres Perdomo, and Jorge Carlos
Espinosa Escarles.
(12) July 26, 1963, the RCA grouping planned to assassinate the Minister of the
Armed Forces, Raul Castro, at Revolution Square during the 26th of July
celebration. Leading those groups involved in the plot was Ibrahim Machin
Hernandez.
(13) September 28, 1963, another group was formed through a relationship with
CIA agent Pierre Owen Diez de Ure, who was a French citizen living in
Cuba. Their plan was to dynamite sewage pipes under the presidential palace.
de Ure confessed that he had been working for and giving information to the
CIA for a period of two years.
(14) March, 1964, a plan to assassinate Castro by Mario Salabarria Aguiar, a
"gangster," who had contacts with the CIA through its agent Dr. Bernardo
Milanes Lopez, who sought support in Spain from Tony Varona and Juan Bosch,
listed as friends of Salabarria. The CIA gave Salabarria weapons and "great
sums of money" for a scheme which involved installing a 30 or 50 caliber
machine gun fh a vehicle and waiting for Castro to pass by.
(15) Mid-1964, another plan to assassinate Castro was formulated by members of
"Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional," part of the RCA block controlled by the
CIA. The effort involved CIA agents Alberto and Ramon Grau Sierra, members
of a network headed by Ramon and Maria Leopoldina Grau Alsina, who attempted
to poison Castro in 1965. The mid-1964 plan called for throwing grenades
at Castro at the Latin American Stadium. Nine men were involved.
i
September, 1964, members of "Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional" (ELN) and "Frente
Interno de Liberacion" (FIL), who had been engaged in intelligence for the CIA,
began, under CIA instructions, to seek unification.

CLOSING STATEMENT FROM CUBA DOCUMENT
We consider that the analysis of the informations we offer,
the publicly known, and the ones that the American authorities
possess and have not been published, allows us to affirm that
the physical elimination of Cuban Revolutionary leaders,
especially the Prime Minister Fidel Castro Ruz, has been
a reiterated policy of the United States through its subver-
sive agencies, making use of Cuban counterrevolutionaries,
U.S. citizen and all kind of corrupted individuals, inside
the country as well as abroad, without taking into considera-
tion the victims that would result from these actions.
With this purpose, they have provided the participants with
a great number of weapons, explosives, technical means of
transportation and communication for the accomplishment
of their plans.
These are some of the connoted and proved facts of the
numerous subversive activities that the CIA has carried out
aimed to the assassination of the leaders of the Revolutionary
Government of Cuba.

THE CIA IN CUBA:
CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY
OF CUBAN ALLEGATIONS
-
(1) Mid-1960, "La Cruz" counterrevolutionary group, Tauler Sague, a "ganster,'
and Cubria Ramos were infiltrated through Punta Hicacos zone in Matanzas
Province for a plot against Castro and other terrorism and sabotage. TNT,
revolvers, and automatic pistols, a high-powered rifle, and large quantities
of ammunition were supplied by the CIA.
(2) March, 1961, various counterrevolutionary groups were trained and armed by
the CIA, and infiltrated through the north of Havana, to assassinate Castro
and support the Bay of Pigs invasion. Humberto Sori Marin and four other
individuals were infiltrated to coordinate the activities of various
counterrevolutionary groups directed by the CIA inside Cuba. Weaponry
included automatic weapons, high-powered rifles with scopes, ammunition,
and explosives.
(3) June, 1961, the "Frente Revolucionario Democratico" (FRD) met with individual
infiltrated into Cuba with instructions for a plot against Castro. Jeeps
with bazookas were placed in a garage at an intersection in Havana and a
truck with grenades was placed in sports city. Plan was to ambush Castro
and other leaders. Two participants Guillermo Caula Ferrer and Higinio
Menendez -- said when arrested that the CIA was in charge, and that contact
was maintained through Guantanamo and the Swiss Embassy.
In July, 1961, after Bay of Pigs, CIA worked to consolidate counterrevolutionary
groups into the "Unidad Resistencia" (United Resistance) organization. Jose
Pujals Mederos made an undercover visit to the United States to meet with CIA
officers Jim Bender (or Boulding). Harold Bishop and Carl Hitch. There Mederos
was appointed head of CIA operations in Cuba in place of the arrested Aldredo
Izaguirre. Programs included "selfaggression" against Guantanimo to justify
counter-attacks on other countries to provoke war against Cuba.
(4) July 26, 1961, through the infiltration of CIA agents Emilio Adolfo Rivero
Caro (Brand). Adolfo Mendoza (Raul) and Jorge Garcia Rubio (Tony), and others,
the United Resistance group developed a plot against Castro during the
26th of July celebration in Oriente Province.
(5) July 26, 1961, the same group planned another plot the same day against
Castro during a rally at Revolution Square. Meetings were held at the
Guantanamo Naval Base, where war material, including large quantities
of small arms, was supplied by base commander Captain Carl E. Schenweias.
(6) Also in July, 1961, plotting against Castro was undertaken by representatives
of "30 de Noviembre," "Movimento Revolucionario del Pueblo," and "Frente
Revolucionario Democratico." The assassination attempt was to be carried.
out near the home of Celiz Sanchez Manduley in Vedado. CIA instructions
came through contacts abroad with Tony Varona, Manuel Ray and Aureliano .
Sanchez Arango, and through Admiral Burke and CIA agents on Guantanamo.
Weapons included explosives, mortars, high-powered rifles, and 30-caliber
machine guns.
(7) September 13, 1961. the same groups listed in (6) above, in contact with the
"Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria" (MER), led by Juan Jose Martore
Silva, made an attempt on the life of Dr. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez when he
was returning from Matanzas to Havana. They worked with a CIA agent in
Matanzas and a counterrevolutionary band there.. Weapons included automatic
handguns, machine guns, and a high-powered rifle with telescopic site.
(8) October 4, 1961, the MRR and "II Frente del Escambray," under CIA direction,
agreed upon a plan for sabotage in Havana, timed to coincide with the return
of Cuban President Osvaldo Torrado from Punta del Este. A bazooka was to be
fired toward the President at the former presidential palace from a nearby
apartment building, with the withdrawal covered by launching grenades against
the public. Weapons recovered included automatic rifles and grenade launchers.

(24) In 1971, a plan was prepared to assassinate Castro on a visit to Chile.
The main protagonist was Jesus Dominquez Benitez, known as "The Islander,"
who had been arrested by the FBI in 1968 for promoting terrorist actions
inside the United States. In 1970 he had participated in an unsuccessful
attempt to infiltrate Cuba through Oriente Province and had sought refuge
at Guantanamo, where he was arrested for bond violation. Nonetheless, he
was free in 1971, to participate with the CIA, Chilean fascists, and Cuban
counterrevolutionaries in a scheme to assassinate Castro using a gun concealed
in a television camera. He obtained Venezuelan press credentials from Cuban
exiles in that country. The plan was aborted. Those involved in the plot
feared for their lives because the plan did not insure their escape.

(16) One of the members of this group, Memesto Cubillas Porez, told Angel Miguel
Arencibia Viran, Rolando Galdos Renzola and others of a plot against Castro
to occur at 11 St. Vedado.
(17) In early 1965, counterrevolutionaries Julio Omar Cruz Cecilia, Fermin Gonzalez
Carballo and Giraldo Reynaldo Diego Solanc members of an RCA sub-group
known as "Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional" were working on a plot against
Castro in Santiago de las Vegas. This plan was dropped in favor of a plan
to hit Castro at the Latin American Stadium, with another group in a nearby
building set up to fire machine guns into the crowd to create panic and
facilitate the escape.
(18) In June, 1965, there was an arrest of the group beaded by Ramon and Maria
Leopoldina Grau Alsina (see (15) above), which was part of the "Rescate"
and "Movimiento Anticommuniste Revolucionario" (MAR) groups sponsored by the
CIA. Maria Leopoldina Grau had received CIA instructions for poisoning
Castro at the Havana Libre Hotel. Jesus Companioni Souza and Santos de la
Caridad Perez Nunez, members of MAR, were to carry out the poisoning. When
this attempt failed, another 500 capsule bottle of poison was sent by Tony
Varona. Maria Alsina, also known as "Polita," also received weapons with
silencers and special assassination projectiles from the CIA.
(19) In July of 1965, there was an arrest of a group which represented another
CIA attempt to organize counterrevolutionaries, this time under the name
"Unidad Resistencia." This group developed a plan to assassinate Castro
with a Thompson submachine gun at Vita Nouva's restaurant, firing also at
the Ministry of Interior across the street to create confusion and permit the
escape. Equipment included weapons and communications year.
(20) Also in 1965, there was an arrest of former Cuban commander Rolando Cubela
Secades. Cubela was recruited during a trip to Madrid by CIA agents Manuel
Artime, Jorge Robreno ("The Magician"), Luis Enrique Trasancos, and Carlos
Tepedino. The planning also involved an official at the Cuban Embassy in
Madrid, Jose Luis Gonzales Gallarreta, and Alberto Blanco (or "El Loco").
In Madrid, Artime promised boats, weapons and men for an invasion of Cuba
within 72 hours to support the assassination of Castro. Before returning
to Cuba, Cubela received from Gallarreta a rifle with a telescopic site and
silencer.
(21) In mid-1965, two groups with CIA connections and contacts in the United
States, the "Commandos L" and the "Movimiento 30 de Noviembre," planned
to infiltrate Cuba. That effort was given up, and instead they fired from
gunboats at the "scholarship zone" in Miramar and at the Riveria Hotel. in
the direction of the presidential residence.
(22) In May, 1966, these same groups were infiltrated into the Monte Barreto
zone in Havana with the mission of assassinating Castro. In the action
Armando Romero Martinez and Sandallo Herminio Diaz Garcia were killed, and
Antônio Cuesta Valle -- head of "Comandos L", and Eugenio Enrique Zaldivar
Cardenas were arrested. These men had been trained in Puerto Rico by the
CIA, and some had been involved in the bombardment of the "San Pascual," .
a merchant vessel anchored at the Cafbarien Port in Las Villas Province.
(23) On March 17, 1967, three Infiltrators from the United States . Felix
Asencio Crespo, Wilfredo Martinez Diaz, and Gustavo Areces Alvarez -- were
arrested while attempting to land by Cayo Fragoso. Their planned activity
was to assassinate Castro and conduct systematic sabotage to create the image
of a popular uprising, to help counterrevolutionary groups in the United
States get official backing. These people had been trained by the CIA
through "M-30-31," "RECE," "Los Pinos Nuevos," "Comandos L," "Alpha-66," and
other organizations. They had automatic rifles, boats, plastic explosives,
and communications equipment.

officials and discovered that Casavubu and Mobutu had decided to
fly to Thysville to put down the munity. COS attempted to con-
vince them not to go together. They did succeed in putting down
the mutiny.
COS did not learn that Lumumba was to be moved to Katanga
until after it happened. COS said his discussions with Mobutu
about Mobutu's intentions for Lumumba left COS with the impression
that Lumumba might be executed.
COS said that Jack Hasey was the Acting Base Chief in
Elizabethville, and was succeeded by David Whipple, who became
Base Chief in Katanga. COS also said that Ambassador Clare H.
Timberlake worked closely with COS, but they never discussed with
him the general question of assassination.
:
TESTIMONY UNDER ALIAS
At the outset of the interview, the Committee staff agreed
to honor COS's request to testify under alias. COS, who is still
in private enterprise in Zaire, said he would be in personal
danger there if he were linked to this story. He said, "They
might make me take the big high jump. I've been on the 'zap list'
before."

bringing about a breakdown of a substantial amount of

2. Attached is a copy of a memo which I believe you drafted
for a meeting with the President on April 7, 1964. Item 5
would appear to cover the type of operation which Fitzgerald
is now conducting.
I have not come across any minutes of the April 7 meeting.
(As I recall it, you intentionally kept the attendance restricted
and were the sole attendee from the NSC staff.) While. I do
not recognize the handwriting or the doodles on the attached
memo, they indicate that Item 5 was approved. My own
strong recollection of the follup from the meeting was

3. I assume that you still want to hear a status report on the
Fitzgerald operation at the Special Group meeting today and I
will pass this word to both Des and Peter Jessup.
I think this operation is probably too far down the road to stop,
if indeed we do want to stop it. In any event, you will be able
to find this out, by some gentle questioning, when Des gives

Memorandum for Discussion of Covert Program Against Cuba
U. S. covert operations against the Castro regime have recently
been reviewed in the Special Group (54/12), and a number of
issues are presented which require discussion and decision at a
higher level.
The present covert program is designed in support of a general
policy of intense economic and political isolation of Castro,
accompanied by methods short of war to get rid of the Castro
regime. Parts of the program authorized in July 1963 have in
fact been held up for various reasons, and it is now important to
decide whether or not certain substantial and expensive activities
should be (a) actively continued; (b) held in readiness; (c) reduced,
or (d) abandoned.
Covert programs against Cuba fall into the following categories:
1. Collection of intelligence, to include the infiltration and ex-
filtration of agents and covert supply of agent operations.
Recommendation: It is unanimously recommended that this pro-
> what we gugram be continued.
yis

yes
20
Covert propaganda aimed to encourage low-risk forms of
active and passive resistance and to stimulate tension within the
regime and between Cuba and the Soviet bloc.
Recommendation: It is recommended that these programs be
continued with regular review of their operational guidelines.
3. Cooperation with other agencies in economic denial by selec-
tive economic action with respect to products critical to the Cuban
economy.
Recommendation:

5. Indirect economic sabotage with a low level of visibility and
detection. Programs of this sort involve possible overseas
sabotage of Cuban ships and possible addition of contaminating
elements to sensitive Cuban imports (not food).
Recommendation: It is recommended that these programs be
continued.
6. CIA-controlled sabotage raiding apparatus in Florida which
conducted five raids in the summer and fall of 1963, before
authority for such raids was suspended for political reasons. .
Recommendation: Opinion is divided on this issue and it is recom-
mended that higher authority hear the arguments of different parties.
7.
CIA-supported (but not directly controlled) autonomous Cuban
exile groups operating from Central America. These groups will
begin operations soon unless action is taken to try to stop them.
Recommendation: Again opinion is divided and it is recommended
that higher authority hear the arguments.

attached memo on the subject. Another reason State does not want to com-
promise its position on Artime (i. e., If you give aid to RECE, how can you stop
aid to Artime?).
State and DOD will probably propose that, in turning down RECE, we give
them $17,000. The RECE people apparently had to tap a program fund of
its small contributors to keep going administratively over the last couple
months when Bosch cut them off; they want to return this money to the
small contributors. Arguments in favor of giving them the money are:
(a) it will lessen the shock of giving RECE a negative reply, (b) they will
not look bad among the exiles (we don't want them to look bad because they
are "good guys"), and (c) part of RECE's problem has not been their fault.
We have not been able to give RECE as prompt an answer as we would have
liked.
I continue to be in favor of not getting involved with RECE; I agree that
$17,000 is a small price to pay for a kiss-off.
SEAD
4. Keating Gimmick Both DOD and State are cold to the idea of having
Keating (I understand this now may be changed to Donovan) stir up trouble
between the Soviets and the Cubans. DOD feels that such goings-on might
be interpreted as some sort of Vietnam play. State feels that such a man
wouldn't get received at a high level; also, there are other ways to do the
job if it needs doing.
While I admire CIA's ingenuity and I sincerely think we should keep them
invention-minded, I must say that this one sounds like a Rube Goldberg con-
traption. I am against it.
9000
5. CIA's Paramilitary Capability Both DOD and State will probably oppose
CIA's proposal to drop its paramilitary capability. I agree with State and DOD
that, with the present world situation as it stands, this is a good capability
to keep on hand if we possibly can. I would agree to an abandonment of this
capability only if it were demonstrated that we could crank it up again in a
very short space of time.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY
SUBJECT: Special Group Meeting - Cuba
111
Here is some miscellaneous information with regard to your Special Group
meeting this afternoon on Cuba.
1. Artime Cut-off As you know, State is pressing to cut off Artime, largely
because of his recent irresponsible activity. CIA opposes State on this one
for the usual reasons. DOD, reportedly, will also take a somewhat reluc-
tant line on cutting off Artime. Vance may express the view that a cutoff
will drive Artime up the wall and that he will go off and do something that
could cause us real trouble vis-a-vis our present conflict with the East.
For example, he might go off and sink a Soviet ship. DOD would probably
prefer that we phase him out slowly and keep a dialogue going over the course
of the next few months. The advantage of this would be twofold - First, it
would keep Artime quiet; second, his residual power to hurt us, when we
finally do cut him off, will be reduced.
On this one, I am inclined towards the DOD view.
2.
Pesticides The CIA will probably propose a deal whereby we arrange
to have diluted Cuban pesticides. State and DOD are both likely to oppose this
one for such reasons as the following: First, it will mean going to the Dutch
Government; it is questionable whether we want to bring up such a proposal
with that government, especially if we think the odds are high that we will be
turned down. Second, there is the moral issue of whether or not we should
dilute pesticides which were given to the Cubans during the prisoner exchange.
Third, it would be highly embarrassing if this one ever leaked out from one of
the many bases that would have to be touched.
I don't like this one either.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY
SUBJECT: Policy Toward Cuba
fil
12 November 1964
In the attached paper the JCS recommended to the SecDef that
he forward the Army study entitled, "Square Dance" to the Inter-
departmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairs for appropriate
interagency coordination as a basis for further consideration by the
JCS.
-
In the course of preparing a Chairman's position on "Square
Dance," I pointed out that the covert operations proposed would involve
serious injury to Cuban civilians, and probably should not be elected
without very serious provocation perhaps greater than that required
to justify invasion. In addition, even if consistent with US values on
"just" international behavior, it is highly unlikely that we could under-
take such operations without having our role discovered and resulting
in serious international liabilities. Finally, even if "Square Dance"
were successfully implemented, there would be no guarantee that the
Cuban government would change its position. More likely, Soviet aid
and control would be increased.
As you are aware, Bill Smith participated in this study, though I
understand he did not subscribe to all of its contents. I recommend,
however, that the White House remain aloof from formal consideration
of "Square Dance" at this stage. Then if the Coordinating Committee
and the JCS should recommend action in accordance with study proposals,
we can consider their recommendations without any precommitment.

Subject:
Cuban Actions (U)
1. On 21 March 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in respond-
ing to a Presidential request for new ideas relative to Cuba,
stated that the President would be advised of any new and
promising courses of action which could possibly bring
pressure upon the Castro regime.
2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have completed a review of a
study which examines world sugar economics and the vulner-
abilities of Cuba's sugar industry. The study proposes an
outline program which would undermine Castro's economy,
deprive him of convertible currency, and cause political
instability in Cuba through covert attacks against Cuba's
sugar industry coupled with US stabilization actions on the
world sugar market. Basically, the proposal envisions a
three- to six-year program, beginning with a 30 per cent
reduction of anticipated 1966 Cuban sugar production, by
introducing aerially from off-shore, a sugar cane plant
parasite, Bunga. Subsequently, the economic and political
disturbances caused by this attack could be exacerbated and
exploited by such measures as spreading hoof-and-mouth disease
among draft animals, controlling rainfall by cloud seeding,
mining canefields, burning cane, and directing other acts
of conventional sabotage against the cane milling and
transportation systems.

ultimate US objective toward Cuba must be to establish a
government in Cuba that is acceptable to the United States.
The concept of attacking the Cuban sugar industry by covert
means would furnish another option to the United States in
bringing about the collapse of the Castro regime.
4. Although the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize the
possible political consequences from proof of the US involve-
ment in such a program, they believe that proposals related
to the expansion of US influence over the world sugar market,
the stabilization of the free market, and the covert intro-
duction of Bunga into Cuba, merit serious consideration.
Other forms of attack proposed in the study might be taken
subsequently to exploit resulting economic and political
turbulence.

9. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that there are
possible political consequences which could result from
proof of US involvement in a program such as that proposed.
10. The Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee for
Cuban Affairs is the proper agency to accomplish the inter-

I, C. Douglas Dillon, being first duly sworn, do upon oath
depose and state:
From June 1959 until early January 1961, I served as Under
Secretary of State. During approximately 35-40 percent of
that time, I served as Acting Secretary of State because of
Secretary Herter's absence from Washington.
Secretary Herter, who preceded me as Under Secretary of State,
had served as the State Department representative on the 54/12
Committee, a predecessor of the present Forty Committee. When
I became Under Secretary, the President asked me to retain my
earlier responsibilities for foreign economic policy. Accord-
ingly, the Number 3 position in the Department of State was
designated as Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Robert
Murphy was appointed to this position and took over the State
Department's responsibilities on the 54/12 Committee.
Because of the frequency of my service as Acting Secretary of
State, I was kept regularly informed of important 54/12 Com-
mittee decisions. On occasion I met with the 54/12 Committee
and participated in its deliberations..
1
During this entire period I have no recollection of any dis-
cussions or decisions looking toward the assassination of
either Generalissimo Trujillo or Prime Minister Castro.
On one occasion in late July or early August of 1960, shortly
after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington, I attended a meet-
ing in the Pentagon at which the overall Congo problem was dis-
cussed. During the discussion, which covered a great variety
of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding the
possibility of an assassination attempt against Lumumba was
briefly raised. The CIA representative indicated that the Agency
did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended considera-
tion of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any
discussion of assassination attempts against anyone.

TOP SECRET
CONSIDERATIONS OF A PROPOSAL TO ATTACK
COVERTLY THE CUBAN SUGAR INDUSTRY
1. The ultimate success of the proposed program would
depend, in part, upon the effectiveness of the economic
controls for the stabilization of world sugar prices.
It would serve no purpose to reduce Cuba's total annual
production of sugar if a subsequent rise in the price of
sugar could net the Castro regime the same amount of
convertible currency as it had before the program was
undertaken. The arguments and rationale in favor of the
economic proposals in the study appear to have validity.
However, world economics is a most complex subject and
involves many variable factors.
economic controls should be coordinated with appropriate
agencies in the government having responsibility for such
matters.

2. Assuming that success of the actions of the outline
program can be achieved, it must be acknowledged that this
would not assure the downfall of the Castro Government, or
that if it did fall, a government friendly to the United
States would be installed. Russia has too much at stake,
politically, to allow an overthrow of a communist regime
for economic reasons alone. Success of the proposed actions
would, however, create serious difficulties for the Castro
Government and would be an additional means of exerting
pressure against that government.

6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have a responsibility to
provide military advice to the Commander in Chief and the
Secretary of Defense. It is appropriate, therefore, that
a matter such as the proposals under consideration, bo
sent to the Secretary of Defense with the recommendation
that the study be forwarded to the Interdepartmental
Coordinating Committee for coordination and comment as o
basis for consideration of further recommendations by the
Joint Chiefs of Steff.

3. There are disadvantages to the program proposed by
the study. The approval for implementation of such a
concept would introduce a new dimension into cold war
methods and would require a major change in national
policy. There is the possibility of retaliation in the
event of discovery. There is also an obvious political
risk associated with this proposal.

Should any credible

evidence of US involvement ever be obtained, the political
loss to the United States would be great. Quite apart
from the propaganda impact of such discovery, the influence
of the United States in international organizations such
as the United Nations and the Organization of American
States would be impaired seriously.
4. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to keep the Secretary of Defense and the
President apprised of the capabilities of the military
establishment. The subject study presents measures which
should be considered, and if found to be acceptable after
coordination with appropriate government agencies it would
represent another option for positive actions against the
Castro regime.
5. NSAM 213* dated 8 January 1963, established a
committee to coordinate the management of all aspects
of US policy toward Cuba. The President looks to the
Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee for Cuban Affairs
for the effective coordination of the execution of policy
decisions and for timely recommendations on new courses
of action. The subject study should be referred to this
committee for the necessary coordination preliminary to
reporting to the President.

1. On 21 March 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff informed
the President that they would continue to review the problem
of putting additional pressures on Castro and that the
President would be advised if any new and promising courses

a. Initially reduce Cuban sugar production by

3. Apart from economic measures, the proposals made in
the study are within existing or attainable military capa-
bilities. Several actions are proposed. Key among these
is the introduction into Cuba of Bunga, a plant parasite
against sugar cane. It appears feasible to introduce
gradually Bunga into Cuba and maintain a basis for plausibly

FROM:
RE:
Douglas Dillon Interview
DATE:
August 28, 1975
-ECRET
I spoke today by phone with Douglas Dillon, who was on vacation
-
in Maine, concerning a paragraph in an affidavit he supplied to the
Rockefeller Commission on May 21, 1975. The paragraph records Dillon's
recollection that
"On one occasion in late July or early August of 1960, shortly
after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington, I attended a meet-
ing in the Pentagon at which the overall Congo problem was dis-
cussed. During the discussion, which covered a great variety of
matters, my recollection is that a question regarding the possi-
bility of an assassination attempt against Lumumba was briefly
raised. The CIA representative indicated that the Agency did
not undertake this sort of operation. This ended consideration
of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any
discussion of assassination attempts against anyone.
I explored the subject of this meeting generally with Mr. Dillon on the
phone and set an appointment for him to review documents and testify on
Tuesday, September 2, at 3:00 p.m. in Room G 308.'
On the phone Dillon gave the following background information
on the meeting at the Pentagon:
1.
This was not a small meeting%3B eight or ten people attended.
He did not think it was a meeting of a small body. He said it was
not a Special Group meeting or NSC meeting. But he was clear that

4. Mindful of the risks attending such actions, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the proposals of the study and
believe that they offer an option for exerting new pressures
against Castro. They believe that proposals related to the
expansion of US influence over the world sugar market, the
stabilization of the free market, and the covert introduction
of Bunga into Cuba, merit serious consideration.
Other forms
of attack proposed in the study might be taken subsequently
to exploit resulting economic and political turbulence.
5. The study is forwarded herewith with a request that
the concept and actions proposed in the outline program of
the study be coordinated by your committee with other govern-
mental departments and agencies. Upon completion of your
review and coordination, it is further requested that your
comments be made available to the Secretary of Defense and
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

the mere writing of this kind of proposal is a reprehensible first step
toward the worst kind of foreign policy mischief. I find it even more
repugnant than contingency plans for assassination. These are not the
kinds of recommendations which should filter up to the White House from
the intelligence community. The agencies must have a better sense of
what is acceptable policy, legally and morally. As in the Huston Plan,
the White House was confronted here with a series of illegal and un-
ethical options. The result of SQUARE DANCE would have been parasitic
death for the major plant and animal life in Cuba. The feeble efforts
of the CIA to direct assassination attempts against Castro pale by
comparison with this Army proposal for covert action.
I believe SQUARE DANCE deserves our attention. If assassination
is unacceptable, surely too is the widespread destruction of plant
and animal life through covert germ warfare. Somehow (probably through
hearings and restrictive legislation) the Congress must drive home the
point that there are legal and moral limits to American foreign policy.
These limits may not be easy to define, but we must try.
Note: On the third page of the second attachment (a "Memorandum for
Discussion of Covert Program Against Cuba" written by Bundy) reference
is made to "possible addition of contaminating elements to sensitive
Cuban imports (not food)." The cover memo from Gordon Chase (NSC
staffer) indicates that this proposal received Presidential backing.

MEMORANDUM FOR SENIOR STAFF
ON
BY.
SUBJECT: Inspection of Classified Documents at LBJ Library Related to
Covert Actions Against Cuba
FROM: Loch Johnson
BC
Among the many documents which I examined at the Johnson Library in
Texas this past week is one that I find particularly alarming. I wish
to draw it to your attention.
The document in question is from the JCS to the Secretary of
Defense, dated 30 October 1964. The subject is a proposed covert
action against Cuba, with the code name SQUARE DANCE.
On 21 March 1964, the JCS responded to a Presidential request for
new ideas relative to Cuba by advising the White House that any new
promising courses of action to undermine the Castro regime would be
brought to the President's attention. Apparently their first bright
new idea was SQUARE DANCE, outlined in the 30 October document (attached).
The proposal envisioned the destruction of the Cuban economy by intro-
ducing aerially from off-shore a sugar cane plant parasite called
Bunga. The program would begin with a 30 per cent reduction of antici-
pated Cuban sugar production (see page 6) and within three-to-six
years the ruination of the sugar industry would be achieved.
economic and political disturbances caused by this attack could be
exacerbated and exploited," continues the JCS memo, "by such measures
as spreading hoof-and-mouth disease among draft animals, controlling
rainfall by cloud seeding, mining canefields, burning cane, and direct-
ing other acts of conventional sabotage against the cane milling and
transportation systems" (6, emphasis added). In sum, SQUARE DANCE
"would furnish another option to the United States in bringing about
the collapse of the Castro regime" (7).
"The
In Appendix A of the SQUARE DANCE proposal, the memo notes that
the approval for implementation of the program "would introduce a new
dimension into cold war methods and would require a major change in
national policy." Indeed it would—or at least one hopes we have not
used such methods before! The proposal is nothing less then a variant
of germ warfare which would have had serious consequences for the
civilian population.
At this point we do not know what happened to the SQUARE DANCE
concept. It may never have been implemented at all, even partially.
(The covering memo written by Bowman, an NSC. staffer, to Bundy suggests
that the White House was skeptical toward the idea.) To me, though,

A
Newspaper accounts report that prior to the
April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, the CIA either directly
ough
or thr/ Robert Maheu inlisted the aid of Sam Giancana and
Johnny Roselli in organizing assassination attempts against
Castro. The first attempt on Castro's life was on or
about 3/13/61. The first attempt used poison and it was
hoped that with Castro dead, the invasion planned and
executed 3/17/61 would have a greater chance for success.
There were five more attempts made on Castro's life after
3/17/61. The last was in late February or early March of
1963.
Allegations (from Newspaper sources):
1)
The CIA either directly or through Robert Maheu
enlisted Sam Giancana who enlisted Johnny Roselli to
organize an assassination team directed at Fidel Castro.
2)
Johnny Roselli headed several missions against
through
Castro from late March or April 1961 / late February or
March 1963.

ollection by giving him more background on Robert Johnson.
did not mention on the phone the nature of Robert Johnson's
imony before the Committee%; I simply asked if Johnson was
sent at the meeting.)
3. The mention of the subject of assassinating Lumumba was
in the general context, Dillon said, of Lumumba's visit to
United States, which had "convinced us that Lumumba was
_hopathic, not in a well-balanced mental state. After his

Interview with James Douglas on Lumumba Assassination Case.
I spoke by phone today with James Douglas, who was
Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration
from early December 1959 until January 21, 1961.
Mr. Douglas served under DOD Secretary Thomas Gates.
I interviewed Mr. Douglas because of a reference to him
in Douglas Dillon's testimony (Dillon, p.19). Dillon said that
in a phone conversation with Gates about the Pentagon meeting
(at which Dillon said someone raised the question of assassi-
nating Lumumba) Gates named James Douglas as a person likely
to have attended such a meeting.
Never Heard Suggestion of Assassination
Mr. Douglas said that during his tenure in office, he
never heard a suggestion of the assassination of Lumumba raised
in his presence. "I never heard speculation that it was even
on anyone's mind," he said.
Pentagon Meeting
Mr. Douglas does not recall a meeting at the Pentagon
in the summer of 1960 (as recounted by Douglas Dillon) where
the question of assassinating Lumumba was raised. Mr. Douglas
says that it was possible that he attended such a meeting, but
he has no recollection of it.
Special Group Meetings
Mr. Douglas attended Special Group meetings with some
regularity. Frequently, however, these meetings were attended
by Mr. Irwin, who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-
national Security Affairs during that period. Douglas said
that Irwin was "more actively in contact with the State Depart-
ment and the CIA during this time." (Irwin is now practicing
law in New York.)
Mr. Douglas said that the question of assassination of
Lumumba was not raised in his presence at a Special Group meeting.

2.
The documents shown to me do not in any way refresh my
recollection beyond the statements contained therein as to events related to the
Congo in the summer and early fall of 1960. I still do not have an independent
recollection of any specific conversation regarding the assassination of Patrice
Lumumba other than that described in my affidavit to the Rockefeller Commission
and in my testimony before the Select Committee on September 2.
3.
I was informed by Mr. Dawson that Mr. Robert Johnson has testified
that he recollected a statement by President Eisenhower at an NSC meeting which
he construed as being an order for the assassination of Lumumba. After seeing
the documents listed above I am of the opinion that it is most likely that the NSC
meeting of August 18, 1960 is the meeting referred to by Mr. Johnson. Although
the record shows that I was present at that meeting I have no personal recollection
of any such statement or order by the President.
4. I note that as to the Memorandum of Discussion at the 456th Meeting
of the National Security Council, Thursday, August 18, 1960 (reference C, above)
a page or pages immediately before the second page of the exhibit seem to be missing.
5. It is my understanding that the six exhibits noted above, will be
appended to this affidavit for filing by the Select Committee.
Prepared by me on this 23rd day of September, 1975.

Re:
Interview with James Douglas on Lumumba Assassination Case.
I spoke by phone today with James Douglas, who was
Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration
from early December 1959 until January 21, 1961.
Mr. Douglas served under DOD Secretary Thomas Gates.
I interviewed Mr. Douglas because of a reference to him
in Douglas Dillon's testimony (Dillon, p.19). Dillon said that
in a phone conversation with Gates about the Pentagon meeting
(at which Dillon said someone raised the question of assassi-
nating Lumumba) Gates named James Douglas as a person likely
to have attended such a meeting.
Never Heard Suggestion of Assassination
Mr. Douglas said that during his tenure in office, he
never heard a suggestion of the assassination of Lumumba raised
in his presence. "I never heard speculation that it was even
on anyone's mind, he said.
Pentagon Meeting
Mr. Douglas does not recall a meeting at the Pentagon
in the summer of 1960 (as recounted by Douglas Dillon) where
the question of assassinating Lumumba was raised. Mr. Douglas
says that it was possible that he attended such a meeting, but
he has no recollection of it.
Special Group Meetings
Mr. Douglas attended Special Group meetings with some
regularity. Frequently, however, these meetings were attended
by Mr. Irwin, who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-
national Security Affairs during that period. Douglas said
that Irwin was "more actively in contact with the State Depart-
ment and the CIA during this time." (Irwin is now practicing
law in New York.)
Mr. Douglas said that the question of assassination of
Lumumba was not raised in his presence at a Special Group meeting.

I do not recall any discussion of any assassination plan
connected to the United States Government during the entire
course of my government service. I do not recall ever
hearing of the CIA adopting any assassination plan, nor do I
recall ever hearing the President make a statement that
could be construed as an order for the assassination of
Patrice Lumumba.
3. In answer to a question from Mr. Baron I said that
in my opinion the language used in the Memorandum for the
Record of the Special Group Meeting of August 25, 1960 is
sufficiently broad so it could be interpreted to cover a
discussion of assassination:
It was finally agreed that planning for the
Congo would not necessarily rule out "con-
sideration" of any particular kind of activity
which might contribute to getting rid of
Lumumba.
However, I do not remember any such discussion, nor do I have
any direct recollection of the substance of that meeting.

Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, it would be
appreciated if you will not retain a copy of the affidavit. A

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
WITH ROBERT JOHNSON
SUBJECT:
PARTICIPANTS:
ASSASSINATION OF LUMUMBA
MR. JOHNSON AND MR. WILLIAM G. MILLER
DATE:
JUNE 10, 1975
::
T
Mr. Robert Johnson who is now at the Overseas Development Council
for the summer, telephone 234-8701, was a member of the National Security
Council staff working on Asian affairs in the last two years of the
Eisenhower Administration and the first year of the Kennedy Administration.
He said that on occasion, when people were on vacation, he was assigned
the task of taking notes at NSC meetings. In July or August of 1960,
Mr. Johnson had the task of note taking. After a review of world events,
by Director of CIA Dulles, which included a description of Mr. Lumumba's
activities in Africa, Eisenhower turned to Dulles during the meeting in
the full hearing of all those in attendance, and said something to the effect
that Lumumba should be eliminated. According to Mr. Johnson, there was
a stunned silence for about 15 seconds and the meeting continued. He
said he wrote the notes and that if they still exist, they are probably
in the Eisenhower Presidential papers. He said that notes generally in
presidential papers, official documents of the NSC, remain with the NSC.
He said that the impression at the time was one of great shock. He said
he had heard of nothing like that since. He said &t was uncharacheristic
of Eisenhower to speak of anything of substance during NSC meetings,
reserving judgment to private meetings. He does not remember exactly
who was at the meeting beyond Herter and Dulles, and possibly James Lay,
Gordon Gray and Robert Mory.

I asked if he would be willing to say this under sworn testimony.
He said that having gone this far he would, but he cautioned that 15
years had passed and he could not vouch for the exact wording, although
his memory of the impact of the meeting is firm.
Mr. Johnson called one hour after the meeting saying that upon
reflection, he would prefer not to testify if at all possible unless it
was absolutely essential. He fears retribution, saying that such
testimonies in the past have blackballed people who were interested in

statement in reference to Lumumba. Based on Mr.
Baron's representation that I am not listed (either
by name or position) among the participants in the
memorandum of record, I am convinced that I heard
the President's statement at a different meeting.
5. After hearing Mr. Baron read portions of the minutes
of the NSC meeting of September 21, 1961 to me, I
do have a recollection of some of the subject matter
that was discussed at that meeting. This would not
be unusual, however, because as a member of the NSC
Planning Board I received a debriefing on the sub-
ject matter of each NSC meeting. I do not, however,
have a recollection of the statement by Mr. Dulles
as related in the minutes of the meeting: "Lumumba
was not yet disposed of and remained a grave danger
as long as he was not disposed of."

Interview with Robert Johnson regarding the Lumumba Case.
I interviewed Robert Johnson by phone this afternoon
to supplement the earlier interview (June 10, 1975) and
examination (June 18, 1975) that the Committee conducted
with him. At the beginning of the conversation I explained
there were a number of questions raised by his interview
and examination that needed to be answered on the record.
Because it was inconvenient for him to make a trip to Washington
in the near future and because of the limited amount of addi-
tional information he was able to provide, we agreed that I
would memorialize the important points of our interview in the
form of an affidavit to which Mr. Johnson would swear.
The following points are related as faithfully as
possible in the manner in which Mr. Johnson made them:
1.
2.
3.
I never heard of a CIA plot assassinate Lumumba
with lethal biological substances.
To the best of my recollection, President Eisen-
hower turned toward Allen Dulles when he made
the statement relating to Lumumba about which I
have testified.
After the meeting at which I heard the statement
by President Eisenhower which I described in my
testimony on June 18, 1975, I must have consulted
James Lay (Executive Secretary of the NSC) for
advice on how to treat the President's statement
in my memorandum of the meeting. Mr. Lay was
meticulous about including in the record some form
of reference to every major subject that was dis-
cussed at NSC meetings. So we probably included
the President's statement in some form, but in
what form I do not know. In general, these memo
randa would be as complete as we could make them.
Nevertheless, on something as sensitive as this,
we may have decided to handle it with euphemism.

not the meeting at which I heard the President's

6. If extremely sensitive matters were discussed at an NSC
meeting, it was sometimes the practice that the official NSC
minutes would record only the general subject discussed without
identifying the specially sensitive subject or the discussion.
In highly sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would be
made in the NSC minutes.
According to my recollection at this time, there was no
fixed procedure for recording the discussions of these sensitive
matters which were usually discussed in a very limited attendance.
Some of these discussions were of a general nature which did not
need to be recorded. Others were of such importance that a full
if
record was drafted by me and my deputy, as he attended, and circu-
lated by highly classified memorandum to each of the NSC members
for approval. In some cases, only a record of the conclusions and
decisions, if any, were similarly drafted and approved. As approved
by the NSC members and finally the President, the record of these
extremely sensitive matters were circulated on a very strictly con-
trolled distribution.

The following is a summary of the contents of an interview
conducted with a former CIA officer concerning a period (1960-1961)
in which he was Chief of Station in the Congo. The interview was
conducted from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. today in Room 608 of the
Carroll Arms Hotel.
At the request of the Chief of Station (COS), we agreed to
take his testimony under alias. He will be referred to hereinafter
as "COS".
COS GOES TO CONGO AND RECEIVES MESSENGER FROM HEADQUARTERS
COS said that he arrived in the Congo as Chief of Station in
early July (probably the 10th or 11th) 1960. COS said that before
he left Headquarters for the Congo he did not talk with either
Richard Bissell (DDP) or Bronson Tweedy (Chief, Africa Division)
about the prospect of assassinating Patrice Lumumba. Soon after
arriving in the Congo, COS was asked to return to Headquarters in
late July for briefings. He said there was no talk of assassination
at those meetings, either.

revision for circulation to the NSC members for approval.
6. If extremely sensitive matters were discussed at an NSC:
meeting, it was sometimes the practice that the official NSC
minutes would record only the general subject discussed without
identifying the specially sensitive subject or the discussion.
In highly sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would be
made in the NSC minutes.
According to my recollection at this time, there was no
fixed procedure for recording the discussions of these sensitive
matters which were usually discussed in a very limited attendance.
Some of these discussions were of a general nature which did not
'need to be recorded. Others were of such importance that a full
record was drafted by me and my deputy, as he attended, and circu-
lated by highly classified memorandum to each of the NSC members
for approval. In some cases, only a record of the conclusions and
decisions, if any, were similarly drafted and approved. As approved
by the NSC members and finally the President, the record of these
extremely sensitive matters were circulated on a very strictly con-
trolled distribution.
Prepared by me on this 8th day of September, 1975.

BC
BY
I am a current employee of the Central Intelligence
Agency. My current address is c/o Review Staff, Central In-
telligence Agency, Langley, Virginia.
1. In 1960, I was employed by the CIA and one of my
responsibilities in the course of my employment was to serve as
the case officer at Headquarters for an agent who operated under
the cryptonym "WIROGUE." I read most of the cable traffic re-
lating to WIROGUE until the point of the termination of his re-
lationship with the Agency.
2. To the best of my knowledge, I participated in all
training that WIROGUE received in preparation for his assignment
to the Congo in 1960.
3. WIROGUE was not trained in medical immunization in
my presence. I am not aware that he was provided with any such
training.
4.
I have no knowledge of any CIA plot to assassinate
Patrice Lumumba.
I have no knowledge that WIROGUE was ever
connected to a plot to assassinate Lumumba, nor have I heard
any hint or suggestion of such a connection.

I hereby affirm that "Robert Marana" is an alias which
is registered at the CIA along with my true identity. My true
signature is affixed to this affidavit. The Senate Select

After his return to the Congo, probably in early September,
COS received a cable from Headquarters that said, in his words,
"someone I would recognize would appear to give me instructions for
a mission I would carry out." Soon thereafter Sidney Gottlieb
arrived in the Congo to meet with COS. COS recognized Gottlieb
from the Technical Services Division at the CIA, and it was made
clear that Gottlieb was the messenger referred to in the cable.
COS dated this

meeting by the fact that he had moved into this apartment in early
September, 1960. COS said that Gottlieb informed him that lethal
biological agents had been developed for the assassination of
Lumumba. COS believes that Gottlieb brought a poison virus and
probably two other lethal biological agents with him in his bag.
But COS said it was possible that the biological weapons arrived
shortly thereafter. COS said that Gottlieb also provided rubber
gloves, a gauze mask, and probably a hypodermic syringe -- equipment
for administering the poisonous substances. The poisonous substances
were to be injected into food, drink, toothpaste, or anything else
that Lumumba might ingest. COS did not remember the appearance of
the biological agents themselves, but he did recall that there were
approximately three different types of lethal substances provided
to him.
COS said that he was "taken aback" by Gottlieb's assignment
to him of the assassination of Lumumba. COS said that he was a
junior Chief of Station, and he wanted to make sure to "pin down"
the chain of authority for this assignment because "I had never

MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILES
From:
Gregory Treverton
G.F. Twaton
INVENTORIED:
ON
3/31/77
August # 29, 1975 BC
Subject: Kennedy Library Tape Recording of March 13, 1963
National Security Council Meeting
On this date, I listened to a portion of the tape
of the March 13, 1963 meeting of the National Security
Council (President present). I listened to it several
times in order to check it against the Library trans-
cript of that meeting.
The relevant portion of the statement by John McCone
reads as follows:
"With respect to Cuba, the thinking in the Agency is...
we have to first get rid of the Soviets'...troops, and
as stated ((several words garbled)) and use every resource we
have available--political, diplomatic, otherwise--to accom-
plish that. Once that is done, then we believe that the
monolithic structure of the Castro regime can be broken up.
Maybe we'll have to catalyze it a little bit. But we think
that there are enough indicators of distress within the
military and within his political organization so that
once the Soviets are out some...military coup can be..
will be brought about which will remove the Castro
government, and with a strong possibility of replacing
that government with a government more favorable to our
interests in the Western Hemisphere. Now, this is...
there's a lot of ifs connected with that, but it seems
to use, after having thought about this a good deal, that
some such action as that is a more probably course of
action that would be successful than to try to out..to
envisage an uprising on the part of the population in the
absence of the military...With the military and security
forces on behalf of Castro, they can very easily frustrate
and defeat any civilian uprising. I think, as time goes
on, that our principal problem is going to be dealing
with the future of Cuba and the future of Latin America.
I think the problems of the Bay of Pigs and the October
incident and the missiles will disappear, and more and
more attention is going to be brought on the part of the
people on the Hill...is going to be...is how we're going
to dispose of this problem.
Then the President speaks.

And are you aware that you may cease answering
questions at any point to seek advice of counsel?
Mr. Dillon. I am glad you have so notified me.
Mr. Baron. And are you vuluntarily appearing here today
without counsel?
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I am.
Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that you have all of your
constitutional rights intact here before the Committee,
including your Fifth Amentment rights?
Mr. Dillon. I am glad to know that.
Mr. Baron. Mr. Dillon, could you please give the
Committee a general idea of your position in the Government
from, say, late 1959 until March of 1961?
Mr. Dillon. In late 1959 I was Under Secretary of State,
which was the number two position in the State Department.
And I continued in that position until 1961.
My duties as such were two-fold. One was the position as
the First Deputy to the Secretary of State, and Acting
Secretary in his absence from time to time, in which capacity
I had to be fully aware at all times of moreorless everything
that was in the ken of the State Department, so I could fill
in for the Secretary of State as necessary. And in those

My other duty, which was a more particular duty, was to be
in charge of the economic side of our foreign policy, which
included economic areas of the State Department, and also
included oversight and general direction of the ICA, which
was the name at that time of the Foreign Aid Agency. And I
had the responsibility for Congressional relations of the
Foreign Aid Program, and for getting the legislation passed
each year, for not the detailed operation, there was a director
of the ICA but I had the general oversight of it. And also a
military program, which was not under the ICA, but which was
run through the Defense Department, and I was the senior State
Department official involved in that area.
So I had those two different functions. And for that
reason the setup in this area of working with the CIA and on
intelligence matters was somewhat different than it had been
prior to that. Prior to my advent as Under Secretary thë
Under Secretary had always ahndled that. Mr. Herter, who was
my immediate predecessor, handled it, and Mr. Hoover before.
When I became Under Secretary I became so under a new law that
had been passed in 1953, at which time I was promoted to
Deputy Under Secretary to the new position, which was called
Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, which was the
number three job in the Department. That legislation provided
that this third Under Secretary could either be an Under
Secretary for Economic Affairs, as I was, or an Under Secretary

I was notified, because I had to know about them if an
emergency came up whilte the Secretary was out of town. But
that was not my particular problem.

Council, or they at least knew about them at that time, because
the major activity that was just getting underway at that time
was very much aware of the development of the capability to
move against Cuba.
Mr. Baron. And what was the nature of your awareness of
that development?
Mr. Dillon. We discussed it quite frequently. And it was
the setting up of camps in Central America that trained Cuban
exiles, and the development of plans for their use. They were
rather general in nature, but of which I was aware of in some
detail. But at that time we all knew that those plans would
not be ready and the capability wouldn't be ready until
sometime next year. So if a decision was to be made to use th
them, it would have come in the following Administration.

had the following interchange with Sidney Gottlieb:
Where did this brilliant idea come from?

Gottlieb:
The top.

Gottlieb:
Who at the top?
The Director has instructions from President
Eisenhower.
COS said it was possible
COS said that he could not recall the exact language of the
interchange, although this was his best recollection. He said
Gottlieb made it clear that the President wanted to find a way to
remove Lumumba from the scene. He said that when Gottlieb explained
the source of authorization for the assassination plot, he made it
clear that the President was the source.
that Gottlieb used a euphemism, but it was more likely that he
mentioned either "President Eisenhower" or "the President."
response to a question from the staff to paraphrase again the import
of Gottlieb's instruction to him, COS said that Gottlieb told him
something to the effect that "I am giving you instructions on highest
authority to assassinate Lumumba any way you can. COS said that
Gottlieb did not insist that the assassination had to take place by
means of the biological agents he was supplying.

Mr. Baron. Turning back to your position in the
Government, isn't it true that shortly before the change of
Administraţions you resigned from the State Department in
contemplation of resuming Government service in the Kennedy
Administration as Secretary of the Treasury?

Yes.
I might as well explain that in some detail, because it
an unusual situation.
That fall, I think it was in October, just prior to the
election in early October, due to some mishap in London, the
Bank of England failed to support the price of gold at a
given moment, and it shot up from the support price of $35 an
aounce to maybe $49 or $50. And there was great perturbation
in the financial markets over this, the first time that it
had happened since the thirties when the price had been set.
And there began to be an outflow of gold from the US at the
rate of over a $100 million a week, which seemed very big in
those days. And it was very disturbing.
That continued through the election. And if anything, it
intendsified after the election.
During the election, of course, as a member of the
Republic Administration while the State Department was not
involved in the election campaign, it was specifically exempt
from having anything to do with it - I was obviously a

supporter of Vice President Nixon, who was seeking election at
that time. Nevertheless, about two or three weeks after the
election, about three weeks after the election, I received a
telephone call one day in my office from Pierre Salinger, whom
I did not know. And he told me on the telephon that Senator
whom I knew slightly, because he was on the Foreign
Relations Committee would like to come and see me that
Kennedy
night.
And I said, that was very foolish. I am at his disposal,
I will go see him.
He said, that is not what the Senator said. He wants to
come to see you.
And I said, very good. I will be home all night.
So Senator Kennedy did show up at 9 o'clock. And he told
me that he was very concerned about this loss of gold and the
lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US and

And so what he wanted was to appoint someone whom he
thought would carry weight around the world, and yet who was
sympathetic to his idea of keeping the economy moving. And
he had read some speeches I had made at one time or another
in my economic capacity with the State Department which

including Bob Anderson, who was then Secretary of the Treasury
And he said I should do this. And quite a few people did.
And also the President-elect was good enough to say if I did
do this he would work with me, and I would be his top economic
advisor, and if there were any differences in economic advice
that he would side with the Treasury unless the thing was
serious enought to lead to a parting of the ways. And one
commitment that he wanted from me was that if there was that
it would not be a silent parting of the ways. And that was a
very easy thing for me to agree to.
And on or after I had come back from a final meeting of
the OACD in Paris at which the Convention was signed, at
which I had been a leading negotiator, early in December I
had a call from him when I got back that morning saying that
he wanted me to come over to his place, that he wanted to do
this if I would agree.
So I went to President Eisenhower and told him of my
meeting abroad and told him I was going to see Senator

And we talked about certain financial things that might be a
problem, which I told him about, which they turned out not to
be.
And he then right away, that morning, much to my surprise,
went out on the front stoop of the house in Georgetown and took
me out there with Robert Kennedy, whom I had never met before

untile that day, and announced both of us at once. So I was
announced as of the middle of December as the future Secretary
of the Treasury.
That rather limited my capacity in the State Department.
But I did continue for two or three more weeks to wind things
up and make a proper turnover.
And then I resigned from the State Department in January
and continued that preparation for the new job.
And that is how that happened.

ör five or six days. And after that one thing I ought to
make clear is that President Kennedy had a great interest in
the authority of the Presidency in foreign policy. And I
think he was under the impression that Secretary Dulles had
probably dominated President Eisenhower in some asptects;
which I don't think was an accuare description of what
happened at all, but it was a generally held one at that time.
So he wanted to take over this very much himself. And so he
put in some new people there.
And we came to be very close, and worked very well
together.
And I had the greatest admiration for him.
He never at that time or later ever asked me anything about
my experience at the State Department or any foreign policy

pretty much paralleled his thinking. And I had been quite
contrary to Vice President Nixon's campaign on that issue
where he talked about growthmanship and the path to push our
growh. And I mentioned, I believe, in the Rockefeller Report
that at that time that we had to grow at five percent a year
if we wanted to produce and not have unemployment, and so
forth.
And I had seen Kennedy's economic speech which he made in
Philadelphia at the end of October, and I thought it was just
great, there was nothing I could find wrong with it.
of
course, nobody had read it and nobody paid any attention to
it. And I don't think he had ever given it, but it had been
released, he had been there and made a speech and said some of
it. And it was very carefully prepared, and was quite dull
an dry as a result. It was written largely or suggested
largely, I found out later, by Professor Samuels, who was the
Dean of all economists at that time. And I couldn't find
anything wrong with that.
And he said he could not make any offer of this, and wasn't
doing that, but he wanted me to think about this because he
thought it was absolutely essential to safegard the currency
and all that.
Well, this came as a great surprise to me. I had made
all my plans to go back home.
To make a long story short, I talked to various people,

Mr. Gray introduced the subject to the Council. (A copy of
Mr. Gray's Briefing Note is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting
and another copy is attached to this Memorandum).
At the conclusion of Mr. Gray's presentation, the President
said he had received the most glowing reports on the prospects
for petroleum production in Libya. He had been told that the
Libyan reserves exceeded even the Sabara reserves. He asked

those things and talk with Allen Dulles about them.
And so
from time to time there were those moreorless informal
contacts. But they were not routine and regular. They were
generally on this basis of when I was Acting Secretary and
they needed something from the State Department.
Senator Hart. I don't want to interrupt the flow of
questions by the Staff on this sequence, but we may want to
get some questions on your experience during the US situation
on the Doctrine of "Plausible Deniability".
Mr. Dillon. That is something I feel I have a good deal
to say about.

Mr. Baron. Just one other question before we turn to your
affidavit. And that is, you were indicating that when you
joined the Kennedy Administration you were not consulted for
advice on your State Department experience.
Mr. Dillon. Until the time of the missile crisis, when
they got together a new, what we called an EXCOM, Executive
Committee. At that time, whether it was the result of the Bay
of Pigs thing, or just the fact that the President knew me
better, and we had been working together for a longer time, he
called me in right at the beginning, and I had a very active
role in this period.
Mr. Baron. But at the beginning of the Kennedy Admini-
stration I take it you were not asked for advice on Congo

thing, I was not used in any transitional sense at all.
Mr. Dawson. To include the Bay of Pigs plan?
Mr. Dillon.
Totally. That was rather a surprise to me.
And I think I might have been of some help to him if he had,
because I had been aware of it right up through January, and in
particular I was aware, at least that is my understanding at
the time, that there was always an ultimate background in the
use of our naval air if those people got in trouble. And I
don't think that was ever made clear to President Kennedy.
And that was too bad. And when it was made clear to him he
reacted violently against it, and I rather doubt if he would
have allowed the thing to be unleashed if he had known this
much about it.
Senator Hart. Aside from the regular 54-12 meetings, did
you have contact with the CIA in any other capacity on a
routine basis?
Mr. Dillon. No, not on a routine basis.
Senator Hart Occasional basis?
Mr. Dillon. Yes. Because, for instance, I went back
when we were flying earlier, when we were flying US missions,
for instance, they had to be cleared by the State Department,
or the Defense Department, or by the CIA, and finally by
the President. And that was all handled through Goodpastor,
he was then a colonel, at the White House. So I did in that
capacity a couple of times, as Acting Secretary, have to clear

he was not awaiting any further "go signal" in order to proceed
with the assassination operation.
COS said that Gottlieb told him that there was to be no connec-
tion with the United States if the biological agents were to be
employed. COS had an asset in the Congo that he considered for
use as an intermediary in this project, although he never moved
forward to make the asset knowledgeable of the project. COS said
that, whether or not he used an intermediary to accomplish the
assassination, Gottlieb made it clear that "I was to do it or find
a way to do it."
COS asked Gottlieb when the lethal biological agents would
lose their potency. Gottlieb said this would happen over a long
period of time. COS said that he did not remember exactly what
the substances looked like, nor whether Gottlieb brought it in his
bag, and this would not be surprising because "in those days there
were no customs checks in the Congo."

COS locked the virus in a safe at the Station to which only
he had access. He remembers taking the virus from the safe sometime
probably after the arrest or death of Lumumba to dispose
of it by burying it near the Congo River. COS said that he had no
training in chemistry and felt ill-equipped to deal with poisons.
COS asked Gottlieb if the poison left traces. Gottlieb told him
that it left the traces of a normal disease.
COS said he was never subjected to great pressure to use the
COS added that, when he spoke with Gottlieb, "I don't

affairs nor kept abreast of developments in the Congo?
Mr. Dillon. No, nor any other foreign policy, except as
it fell under the monetary area, with one exception. And this
was economic entirely. That is, the President, because of
my past experience in the handling of this matter, asked me,
moreorless as a favor, because he didn't believe the Treasury
should really handle this, but he asked me if I would head the

so I did do thta. And that was the only foreign policy job
I did.
And that was economic in nature.
Mr. Baron. Let me show you now a copy of your affidavit
to the Rockefeller Commission which concerns among other
things a meeting that was held in the Pentagon where the
Congo was discussed. First, let me ask you if that is a true
copy of your affidavit?
Mr. Dillon. It so appears.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall this meeting where, as you have
affirmed: "On one occasion in late July or early August of
1960, shortly after Patrice Lumumba's visit to Washington,
I attended a meeting in the Pentagon at which the overall
Congo problem was discussed. During the discussion, which
covered a great variety of matters, my recollection is that
a question regarding the possibility of assassination attempt
against Lumumba was briefly raised. The CIA representative
indicated that the Agency did not undertake this sort of

operation.
This ended consideration of this subject.
With
this one exception I never heard any discussion of assassina-
tion attempts against anyone."
Do you recall this meeting now?
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I recall just what I said there. And I
think probably should expand on that a little bit, because
in looking at it it is not as clear as I would like it to be.
When I mentioned the assassination attempt it was not
necessarily limited to

or it might have been CIA personnel.
It also included encouraging one of the many factions that
might not like him there to take action on their own, with
CIA encouragement.
Senator Hart. What kind of encouragement, material
support, financial support?
Mr. Dillon. That, or moral support, if they did the US
would recognize them if they became the head, and would help
them.
Senator Hart. Was there any discussion that you can

Mr. Dillon. No, no detail like that. This was very brief,
very general, and just turned off by the CIA people at that
time.
Mr. Baron. So this mention of assassination could have
included a CIA sponsored assassination attempt?

And it was a more general reference
Mr. Dillon. It was a very general way of getting some-
where. In one of those other papers something was said about
getting rid of Lumumba. That was really moreorless the
objective, not necessarily to have him leave the earth, but
just to get him out of the Congo and away.
Mr. Baron. Your clear impression that the suggestion
contemplated assassination as one means of getting rid of
Lumumba?

meeting. And he says he did not. But I do think it took

it was in his own office that it took place.
Mr. Baron. When we spoke before you said that you thought
he probably was in attendance. Is that still your feeling?
Mr. Dillon. Well, because it was in his office. I don't

remember him being there or saying anything. All I remember
is the location, and the fact that the subject came up, and
the fact that there were a number of people there I don't
and the fact that the CIA people,
remember who they were
date com
whoever they were, were negative to any such action.
Mr. Baron. About how many people were in attendance?
Mr. Dillon. I would say five or six, because I saw them
sitting around the desk, I would say five or six, or it
could have been seven or eight, no more.
Mr. Baron. Was this the meeting of any official body?
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't think so. It was not a mating
note-taking type of meeting. It was not sitting around the
table with somebody as the Chairman.
Senator Hart. It was ad hoc, in other words?
Mr. Dillon. It was ad hoc.
Senator Hart. Would you be able to characterize the

saying, no, it is not a possible thing.

than a moral objection, as you have just said, it might have

Force, and maybe still was at that time.
Mr. Baron. Was it a regular occurance to convene such
meetings at the Pentagon?
Mr. Dillon. We had a very close relationship between the
State Department and the Pentagon at that time. And it was
not unusual, because of the fact that generally there would
be a representative of the Joint Chiefs present, and they were
both over there, and if for any reason it seemed reasonable, we
would do that. Now, usually I think the man who was responsible
would be this number three person in the State Department, he

Mr. Dillon. It might also have had something to do with
the thing that I was talking with them about all the time, a
totally different subject, which was military aid. That could
well have been.

been an objection on the grounds that the CIA did not have the
capability to perform such an operation?
Mr. Dillon. It could have been, it may have been just
something that they couldn't do, and therefore there is no
use talking about it.
Mr. Dawson. The subject matter of the meeting was probably
something which the Secretary of Defense had a leading role
in designing a policy for, right?
Mr. Dillon. I don't recall the details of what was
ahppening at that time in the Congo. But I do have a basic
recollection that over this period of time it was a pretty
difficult situation, with UN forces in there, and all sorts
of troubles down in the southeastern part where the copper
mines were, and trying to get people out so they wouldn't get
killed. There was always contingency planning, whether we
would have to use any of our forces for another evacuation
or something else. So it was a very mixed up and sort of a
hot situation at that time.
So certainly various people in the Defense Departmen would
be interested. Mr. Gates, when I spoke to him, said that he
personally had not given primary attention at any time to the
Congo. He said it might have been Jim Douglas, who, as I
mentioned to you there, was listed as attending one of those
meetings. And I don't recall exactly what his title was at
that time, but he had been, I think, Secretary of the Air

Mr. Baron. And I believe you had said to me before that
despite your absence of a clear recolleciton as to which CIA
people were there, it was clear to you that some top level
CIA people were there?
Mr. Dillon. Top enough, so that something like this could
be raised and moreorless disposed of without even thinking
of it any further.
Senator Hart. Let me insert a question, if I might.
This
is a philosophical question.
First of all, factually, in any of the dealings, formal or
informal, that you ever had with President Eisenhower or
President Kennedy, did the subject of assassination ever
arise?
Mr. Dillon. As far as I know, as I recall, in dealing
directly with either of them, no.
Senator Hart. I would invite your speculation at this
point as a sub-Cabinet officer under President Eisenhower,
and as
a Cabinet Officer under President Kennedy, I think
the Committee would be interested in your view as to the
attitude of each of them toward this subject,
that is to say,
the elimination, violent elimination of foreign leaders?
Mr. Dillon. Well, that is a difficult thing to speculate
on in a totally different atmosphere. But I think probably
both of them would have approached it in a very pragmatic way,
most likely, simply weighed the process and consequence

(Off the record discussion)
Mr. Baron. To return to the setting at the meeting at the
Pentagon, I wonder if you could fill in the nature of the
discussion that was taking place on the Congo before this
prospect of assassination was raised at the meeting?
Mr. Dillon. I don't recally recall it, except that it
was bemoaning the general presence of Lumumba and the
difficulty of working anything out with him, or the impossi-
bility of working anything out with him, and the exploration
of other possibilities.
Mr. Baron. Did you date this meeting by any particular
event which took place?
Mr. Dillon. Yes. I dated it only because it must have
taken place after, and presumably shortly after, Lumumba's
visit to Washington, because the impression that was left was
that it was very bad, that this was an individual whom it was
impossible to deal with. And the feelings of the Government
as
a result of this sharpened very considerably at that time.

earlier. The dates that were given in this affidavit were
supplied to me on the basis that it was shortly after his
visit. So they looked up when his visit was, and that is why
they put this in. All I recall of the place and date is that
when I saw him off at the airport it was very hot. So it must
have been the summer, July or August.
Mr. Baron. Let me fill you in on a few other events that
were happening from mid to late July, and ask you if this
refreshes your recollection as to the sense of urgency that
might have existed at a meeting such as the one you attended
in reference to getting rid of Lumumba. It appears that on
the 12th of July the US had sent a carrier, the Wasp, to the
Congo, although we had refrained from sending troops to the
Congo. Then on the 20th of July Ambassador Lodge indicated
that it was the US position that the UN would be urged to do
everything possible to keep Soviet troops out of the Congo.

Then on the 22nd of July Lumumba signed a 50-year
contract with CINCO, a large American resources company.
But

Congo the following day, on the 26th of July I am sorry, it

think I agreed to use it." Although he also said that he did not
tell Gottlieb that he would refuse to use it.
COS said that even though Gottlieb had told him that clearance
for the assassination of Lumumba had come from the President and
the DCI, he wanted verification from Headquarters of an assignment
of such magnitude. COS said: "I responded to Headquarters with a
double-talk message, saying that I had met the messenger and re-
questing confirmation. I then received a cable containing double-
talk confirmation, something like 'your assumption confirmed.
COS said "I never knew who was sending me these cables. They
also said 'Director' and I sent my cables with a special slug. My
cables were probably marked to 'Director" which is never actually
seen by the DCI. COS thought that he destroyed his copy of cables
on this subject on instructions contained in those cables. He said
that only a single copy of the cables had existed at the Congo
Station. COS said that he was instructed by Gottlieb that he was
not to discuss this assassination mission even with his own deputy.
COS said that he did not discuss the operation with Glenn Fields.
He also said that he would not have discussed the operation with
Dr. Lester Houck because Houck was removed as Branch Chief in early
fall due to dissatisfaction with his performance.

may not have expressed his grave concern to Gottlieb because he was
so taken aback at receiving the assignment. COS thought that he
told Gottlieb that he did not have a good means of access to Lumumba.

Mr. Dillon. I don't. It very likely could have come from
somewhere, either from the State Department or possibly from
the Defense Department in the international affairs areas,
someone just throwing out this question. Now, I said the
State Department. There was probably someone there besides
myself. Because it wasn't usual to just be alone talking
about this.

It would be shortly after Lumumba's visit.

getting at that time from the CIA Chief of Station and the US
Ambassador?
Mr. Dillon. Well, we would have been getting whatever
reports the US Ambassador sent, the reports from the Chief of
Station would go to the CIA, and we would not get those except
in the edited form that the CIA would give them to us.
Mr. Baron. Did you receive urgings from the US Ambassador
from the CIA as a result of their briefings from the Chief of
Station in the Congo to undertake political action in the
Congo toward removing Lumumba from a position of power due to
reports that Lumumba was heavily influenced by the Soviets?
Mr. Dillon. I do know that he was supposedly influenced
by the Soviets. But my impression of seeing him was that he
certainly wasn't controlled by them or anyone else, he was
so far gone himself that nobody could rely on him as an
individual. I don't recall any paticular urgins from the
Ambassador, although I think they would have been natural,
because this was a very difficult situation, and he was there,
and if he had been not warning against something, that would
have been very unusual.

development of a generalized assassination capability at the

that such a capability could be developed without
specific authorization from authority outside the CIA?
Mr. Dillon. Yes, I would think so.
Mr. Baron. But it is clear to you that the discussion at
the meeting at the Pentagon that you attended would not in
itself have served as an authorization for an actual assassi-

Johnson participated in this meeting at the Pentagon?

this meeting in the summer of 1960, and said that it happened
at some point before the coup in which Mobutu took power on
September 14th of 1960. Were you present at such a meeting?
Mr. Dillon. If you mean was I present at a meeting where
I recall the President ordering the assassination of Lumumba,
I don't remember such a thing. But I think that I was probably
present at most of the Security Council meetings at that time.
It being in August I might have been away for a week possibly
for a vacation, and I might have missed one. But otherwise
I would have been there. It could have been in view of this
feeling of everybody that Lumumba was very difficult if not
impossible person to deal with, and was dangerous to the peace
and safety of the world, that the President expressed himself,
we will have to do whatever is necessary to get rid of him.

But there were those problems down around the

that time.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall anything else about the language
that was used in raising the question of assassination at the
meeting?
Mr. Dillon. No, I am sorry, I don't recall really anything
but what is in the affidavit, but just the subject came up
generally as a question, and it was turned off by the CIA.
Mr. Baron. Would the manner in which the question of
assassinating Lumumba was raised at that meeting have served
as sufficient authorization for the CIA to proceed to develop
the capability to assassinate Lumumba after that meeting?
Mr. Dillon. Well, I don't think they really needed any
authorization to develop the capabilities if they didn't use
them. And certainly it would not have been enough authoriza-
tion by a long shot for them to start doing that. But I think
they could have decided they wanted to develop the capability
in this area irrespective of this, just by knowing the concern
that everyone had about Lumumba in the area. That they could
have done. They wouldn't have to tell anyone about that.
That is just developing their own internal capability, and
then they would have to come and get permission.

along the lines of the various memoranda you have shown me.
Mr. Baron. Did you ever hear the President make such a
remark about Lumumba, let's get rid of him, or let's take
action right away on this?
Mr. Dillon. I don't remember that. But certainly this
was the general feeling of Government at that time, and it
wouldn't have been if the President hadn't agreed with it.
Mr. Baron. So although you have no recollection of being
present at the meeting that Robert Johnson recounts, you
would find his testimony at least plausible?

COS recalls raising the subject of assassination with
Gottlieb on subsequent occasions outside the Congo only in the
context of his (COS's) feeling: "Thank God I never had to use
it."
COS did not remember if Gottlieb mentioned Richard Bissell as
a source of authority or approval for the assassination operation.
COS does not recall that anyone other than the President and the
DCI were indicated as the source of authority for the assassination
operation.
O'DONNELL IS DISPATCHED FROM HEADQUARTERS TO THE CONGO
COS recalled the fact that Justin O'Donnell arrived in the
Congo from CIA Headquarters approximately in October of 1960. COS
said that O'Donnell "came to eliminate Lumumba." COS did not re-
call whether O'Donnell recalled a conversation with Richard Bissell.
COS said that, in anticipating O'Donnell's arrival, he had
the impression that O'Donnell was coming to aid in the removal of
Lumumba.
COS said, "I wondered if Headquarters thought I was drag-
ging my feet and that I might be relieved.'
COS said he did not remember discussing his meeting with
Sidney Gottlieb with O'Donnell but he simply does not have a
specific recollection. COS said he would not dispute O'Donnell's
testimony that COS had made O'Donnell aware that a poison virus
was in his safe. COS said that assassination was "not excluded"
as one of the means of removing Lumumba that O'Donnell might use.
But COS said that he was not certain that assassination was included
as one of O'Donnell's tools. COS said that he may have discussed

area, or particularly in this area to run it down, because
the people aren't here anymore. But the person who really made
that decision for the CIA was Allen Dulles.
Mr. Dawson. I guess I was asking for your expert opinion
on the command and control structure as to what adequate,
implicit authorization would have been?
Mr. Dillon. I think that Allen Dulles would have been
quite responsive to what he considered implicit authorization,
because he felt very strongly that we should not involved the
President directly in things of this nature. And he was
perfectly willing to take the responsibility personally that
maybe some of his successors wouldn't have been.
And so I
think that this is a perfectly plausible thing, knowing Allen
Dulles.
Mr. Dawson. And you were aware that that was the way the
system worked at that time?
Mr. Dillon. It was the way he worked; because he had a
very strong feeling of protecting the President from getting
too closely involved with anything that was unpleasant and
of this nature.
Mr. Baron. So from your knowledge of Allen Dulles it is
conceivable that he would have taken Presidential language
such as, get rid of Lumumba, and translate it into an

Mr. Baron. And this document refers to the election of
Joseph Ileo to the Presidency of the Senate of the Congo, and
recounts a report by General Cabell that the US assisted Ileo
financially and "may have secured some influence with this
potentially useful individual."
Did you ever see these minutes at the time they were made?
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't think I ever did.
Mr. Baron. Do you recall having a report of this meeting
from Mr. Merchant who would have been State Department
representative at the meeting?
Mr. Dillon. No, I don't recall. I don't think I would
have, because this wouldn't have seemed to me to be important
enough to necessarily have been brought to my attention.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware that Joseph Ileo was a signi-
ficant figure in Congo politics?
Mr. Dillon. I don't recall him at all now.

For the record, these minutes refer to a
report by Thomas Parrott, who was the Secretary of the Special
Group on CIA activity in relation to the Congo. Mr. Parrott
outlines three CIA operations in the Congo which make use of
trade unions in the Congo and include the prospect that a

vote of no confidence in Lumumba would be arranged.

Following that report by Mr. Parrott there is a paragraph

Mr. Gray commented, however, that his associate had
expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessity for very
straightforward action in this situation, and wondered whether
the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this.
Mr. Dulles replied that he had taken the comments referred
to seriously and had every intention of proceeding as
vigorously as the situation permits or requires, but added
that he must necessarily put himself in a position of inter-
preting instructions of this kind within the bounds of
necessity and capability.

"Mr. Gray's associate or Mr. Gray's friend," he was referring
euphemistically to the President.
Mr. Dillon. That is what I would moreorless have assumed.
But as long as you have that testimony, my assumption is
probably correct.
And it follows the same way, that Mr.
Dulles said he would take any comments referred to seriously.
And then he talks about those as instructions and the same
thing. And it would seem to be that. And that must refer to
the same meeting that your friend Mr. Johnson testified to,
which I presume took place before this. They are talking
about something that happened before this day, where he had
said his associate had expressed strong feelings about the
matter, and Mr. Dulles said he would take the comments
referred to seriously.
Mr. Baron. So it is your impression that Mr. Dulles had
heard comments by the President previous to this meeting?
Mr. Dillon. Certainly.
Mr. Baron. Comments which called for "very straight-
forward action?"
Mr. Dillion. Yes, I think that is certainly what this

next week if I have your permission, sir. He wouldn't have
done that. Because where I particularly remember this, or
get the feeling particularly strong, is dating back to
something that Senator Hart mentioned, the U-2 incident.
Allen Dulles' strong desire was to take the whole responsi-
bility for that, and resign, and be fired in disgrace,
publically, in order to protect the President. But the
President totally refused to accept any such way of handling
it.
Mr. Baron. So that says something not only about the
character of Allen Dulles, but the character of the President?

that Mr. Johnson took the notes of just prior to that, that
is probably the meeting.
Mr. Baron. So you would assume that the language used
by the President, heard by Mr. Johnson, which indicated to
Mr. Johnson that an assassination was at the least acceptable
means of getting rid of Lumumba, is probably the language
referred to here by Mr. Dulles?
Mr. Dillon. It would sound so, seems so.
Mr. Baron. And would you also assume, from your knowledge
of Special Group meetings and the way the minutes were written
up, that very straightforward action could be a euphemism for
assassination?
Mr. Dillon. No, I wouldn't necessarily think that. It
wculd just mean strong action to do something to get rid of
Lumumba, it could be a revolution, it could be anything. I
think it comes here that they would not necessarily rule out
consideration of any particular activity. I would think, if
they were really going to mount something, they probably would
have come back to the Group. But they might not have. And
again, getting back to Mr. Dulles, I do not think he would
have gone back to the President and said, now, I have got the
capability to assassinate Lumumba, and I am going to do it

to return to the Special Group if an assassination were being
mounted?
Mr. Dillon. Not only that, but anything being mounted,
I mean whatever action to get rid of Lumumba, I think he would
probably come back and say what we are doing.
Mr. Baron. But it is also your statement that, due to
the mode of operating of Allen Dulles, and his character,
it is quite conceivable that he wouldn't have returned to the
Special Group with such an operation?
Mr. Dillon. That might be, although it is more likely
that what he really said was that he wouldn't return to the
President.
Mr. Baron. In order to protect the President?
Mr. Dillon. In order to protect the President. I think
he had looked on other officials in the Government as quite
different from the President, all of the, in other words, as
i
expendable, and he probably would be less likely to go and
do things totally on his own. And his whole idea was to
protect the President as the public representative of the US
