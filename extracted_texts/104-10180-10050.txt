MEMORANDUM FOR:
Director
27 APR 1970
Federal Bureau of Investigation
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
:
Mr. D. J. Brennan
: Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, Cuban
Intelligence Officer
1. Reference is made to your previous correspondence
concerning Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, First Secretary of the
Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CMUN) and an officer
of the Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI).
Rodriguez is
a South Af the CUIS Case Officer for Jennifer Enid Miles,
national
vational, now under investigation by the
Bureau. Your most recent memorandum on Rodriguez and Miles
was dated 26 January 1970.
'
On 30 January 1970, there was a liaison discussion
about Miles and Rodriguez at which time your representatives
advised that your Bureau planned to interview Niles, on an
appropriate pretext, and that there were signs that she
might be susceptible to "doubling". We recognize that the
Miles Rodriguez case is an internal security responsibility
of the Bureau but, to assist us in our efforts to assess
Rodriguez as a DGI officer, it would be appreciated if
you would provide us with the regults of your interview
with Miles as well as personality information about him
that she may acquire in the future.
3. We would also like to have your comments about
considering Rodriguez as a potential penetration of the
DGI in Cuba. There is the possibility that Miles might
be used to assist in approaching Rodriguez if, for
example, she has refused to cooperate as a double agent
or later if internal security considerations warrant an
approach to Rodriguez.

It was reported in Reference that a man identifying
himself as "Roberto" from Costa Rica phoned the Cuban Embassy.
Mexico City, on 23 April 1965 in an attempt to get in touch
with the successor of Regello odriquez Lopez, Cuban
intelligence officer. The man Turther stated that he was
the doctor friend of Manuel, presumably Manuel Mora, head
of the Costa Rican Communist Party.
"
2. An interceptegsletter, dated 2 May 1965, to Judith
Ferrata from Dr. Jorge Wena Rodriguez, Apartado 1212, San
Jose. refers to his recent quick trip to Mexico. Vega
Kwrote to Judith using her Party pseudo of Juanita Saenz, .
and at the end of the typewritten letter he wrote by hand
"Greetings to Cafula and Engle (7)". Cafula is one of the
pseudos used by Costa Rican Communist leader Carlos Fallas
Sibaja. Headquarters has been interested in Vega's fre-
quent trips to Mexico and his intimate friendship with
Judith, as revealed by their telephone conversations, but
no derogatory information on Vega, has been developed.
However, the fact that he is familiar with the Party
pseudos of Judith and Pallas suggests that he may be more
Involved than he appears to be.
3.
It is requested that Station San Jose determine if
Dr. Vega was in Mexico on 23
in Mexico on 23 April 1965, the date of the
call to the Cuban Embassy. The Station is again asked to
try to uncover any indication of subversive activity on
the part of Vega. Is he friendly with the Mora brothers?

called the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City to speak to the Ambassador,
who was not in. The man refused to give his name but said he was the
person, who used to be seen with the young blond man" from the Embassy.
Subject asked the Embassy secretary to tell the Ambassador that he had
received a cable from the Embassy asking him to come to Kexico from Costa
Rica and that now he was here, but could not stay long. Subject also said
that he had seen the Ambassador frequently but had been told not to use
the telephone, that he had received the cable at the beginning of
Holy Week but could not get a plane reservation then; that they had known
him in the Embassy by the name of Roberto"; that since the young bland
man had now gone to Cuba, Subject was supposed to make the acquaintance
of the person who had taken the young place; and that the cable had
illuded to some business they were going to take care of. Finally, Subject
said to tell the Ambassador that he was the doctor friend of Manuel.
2. The Station is unable to identify Subject. However, the Blond man
is probably Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, Second Secretary and identified Cuban
intelligence officer, who left Pes for Cuba on 5 March 1965. The Station
would be interested to know the identity of Subject if it can be determined
by the San Jose Station.

EVALUATION
2. Production:WUSLIB/1 said that Jose Raul Viera Linares
had phoned him at his home at about 1100 on 8 April. Viera said-
that a friend had described to him an acquaintance who had had
Can eye problem similar to WUSLAB/1 (or words to that effect),
and that Viera now realized the seriousness of the case and
that WUSLAB/1 would not be able to travel. Vicra said that
the chances were now remote that he would be returning to New
York. A friend of his named "Rogelio" would contact WUSLAB/1.
He did not say when or where, but it would be when circumstances
permit. WUSLAB/1 asked if Viera might be assigned to another
foreign country. Viera did not deign to answer this question.
-

I asked WUSLAB/1 what he considered the possibilities
of recruiting Viera were. He thought an important factor would
be Viera's liking of comfort and security. He would not be
motivated by money, but he did like good living.
He also pro-
bably did not like living in Havana, and would not like to stay
there for a very long period. W/1 thought that if Viera came
out to a country such as Spain that contact with him could
casily be developed. In the United States Viera was on his
guard. Also in the United States Viera did not have high level
contacts with the local government, whereas in other countries
he would be expected to have such contacts. Some of those con-
tacts might then be also in contact with U.S. officials and you
could get a cross-check on Viera. I told WUSLAB/1 that we would
finish the PCQ form on Viera the next time we get together.

It has been reliably reported to this office that
captioned vehicle, not otherwise described, was observed on
the grounds of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City at 11:30 A.M.
on October 29, 1964.
Investigation to date to identify the owner has
developed that captioned vehicle is a 1961 Ford Falcon two-
door with Vehicle Identification Number 1R11S123981.
Investigation in California has disclosed that the captioned
vehicle was last sold to one ROGELIO RODRIGUEZ who gave a
false address in the Los Angeles area to the seller of the
vehicle. At the time of the sale, RODRIGUEZ indicated that
he was buying the automobile for someone else in Mexico, and
would allegedly go to Mexico in the automobile.
1
RODRIGUEZ was described at the time of the purchase
of the vehicle as a man between 35 and 40 years of age,
apparently a Mexican (judging from his Spanish, dress, etc.)
and was allegedly staying with relatives in Los Angeles,
California.

presentable house, capable of making persons, who you receive, feel comfortable

Now, you should have analyzed your economic possibilities before incurring
those debts. If you had done so you would have realized that these were not

the purpose of finding a solution to that problem.
We are instructing comrade Bulogio to make you a reasonable loan with

In the future you should consult us and in particular present a plan to
comrade Eulogio, ou any problem of that nature, with the confidence that it

You should make us a report justifying the loan that you will get to

In s/w communications, the agent is given a name, separate

the use of the name "JULIO" meant that the letter was for "EDUARDO"
that is Kogello RODRIGUEZ, who had that as one of his pseudonyms
and used it in August 1962 when he was in the A Section at
DGI (Cuban Intelligence service) Headquarters. The Valladares

comprensión, una cosa menos emotiva. AGUILAR así lo crec y
manifiesta que ahora ya tiene una base que deberá servirle
para la reapreciación de muchas cosas. SOL dice que además
tiene pensado regresar muy pronto, y por tal motivo quisiera
que AGUILAR y señora fueron el sábado a cenar a su casa.
AGUILAR agradece la invitación pero no puede aceptar en vista
de que precisamente ese día deberá estar en Ciudad Obregón,
pues tiene: el compromiso de hacer un recorrido rápido por el
Estado de Sonora, pero promete que a su regreso de pondrán do
acuerdo y se reunirán.

7. Recruitment Targets. Subjectively, Source considers that
the most vulnerable of the CMUN personnel are Rogelio RODRIGUEZ
Lopez, Ambassador ALARCON, and Pedro Amado MORALES Carballo..
RODRIGUEZ because he likes the ladies and the material things in
life; ALARCON because of his strained relationship-with- PRENDES;
and MORALES because he is basically a good sort and a realistic
person. As stated, this is subjective reasoning on Source's part.

8. Replacement Personnel. With VIERA and PINERO leaving soon,
there is talk in Havana about assigning one Teofilo ACOSTA here as
a replacement for one or the other. ACOSTA is a negro in his early
30s and has served in several African posts for the DGI (including
Tanzania and Mozambique). ACOSTA has been protected by Manuel
PINEIRO Losada, former DGI chief, but is disliked by most MINREX
types who know him. Source described ACOSTA as a sly and suspicious
person who would not hesitate to report on anyone, including his
friends and neighbors. ACOSTA is believed to have been deeply in-
volved in various "wars of liberation" in Africa. ACOSTA was
originally under consideration as a replacement for Francisco
PORTELA, the Prensa Latina chief in New York, but it was finally
decided to leave PORTELA here as there were advantages to his being
à U.S. citizen.
+
"
Source also mentioned that one "AGEO" (a war name; real name not
known to Source) was under consideration for assignment here. Source
said that "AGEO", was a member of the Cuban Delegation to the 22nd
UN General Assembly in 1967 (date possibly not correct). This "AGEO"
was in charge of the purge within MINREX in 1967 which resulted in
the ouster of some 300 persons regarded as homosexuals, counter-
révolutionaries, or incompetents.

INFORMATION OFTAINED FROM SODICE "GALGOR" ON SE JANUARY
AND_1_FEBRUARY 1970
.
Orlando PĤEXPES Cutierrez, First Secretary and DC1 Center Chief.
PRENDES is a highly intelligent and capable DG) officer who
has some nine years experience in his trade. He is well-liked
and respected by Hanuel PINEÍRO Losada ("Barba Rojā")',' former
Chief of the DGI, and Ramon OROŽA Naveran ("Donutrio"),
currently Chief of U.S. operations in DG1 Headquarters,
particularly by the latter. PRENDES appears to be a
fanatical revolutionary. He also is well-liked and respected
by the staff of the DG1 Center here, and he in turn is quick
to single out each for praise--with the notable exception of
Orlando PEREIRA Gonzales, DGI officer and First Secretary.)
PRENDES seldom mentions PEREIRA, and Source concludes that he
does not like or have much use for PEREIRA.‹
F
v
PRENDES' dislike for both Permanent Representative Ricardo
ALARCON Quesada and Mrs. ALARCON is growing daily, and
ALARCON's recall has become a fixation with PRENDES. While
PRENDES is basically modest, his vanity emerges when discussing
his own professional ability and accomplishments. Outwardly,
he is anti-American, referring to Americans frequently as
"nuestros enemigos". However, he is enjoying his tour in
New York and obviously admires certain aspects of U.S. life.
He has a large collection of American records, likes American
clothes, etc.
PRENDES' wife, Teresita FERNANDEZ Arango, is scheduled to return
home to Cuba permanently in June 1970. PRENDES plans to do the
same in December 1970, after the next UN General Assembly ends.
His two year tour will be up in September 1970. Torosita
FERNANDEZ is popular with the CMUN personnel.
Source stated that PRENDES' father was uneducated (believed
to be a fisherman), and his mother is a directress of a school
in Matanzas. Source considers PRENDES a much more likeable
type than the average Cuban intelligence officer. PRENDES is
interested in the CMUN and its job as a whole, unlike his
predecessor as Chief of the DGI Center, Chafik Homero SAKER
Zenni ("an animal", according to Source).

Kir.
Pócéo Laís: PINCHO MÁYin, Third Secretmy PIÑERO is the
avorite or PC1 Cei Ciël Oediaido PSMS Gutierrez,
First Speveinry, bonuso PINERO is hard-working and, "audacious"
Source believes that PIX¼ÃO is the DGI Center officer
specializing in the handling of Cuban exile agent operations;
PINERO. "disappears" from the CHUN for 2 to 3 days at a time,
and Source speculated that PINERO might be traveling to Miami
to contact DGI agents. \PINERO also continues to be active
at night in lower Manhattan, and Source thought that he
might be either making new contacts amongst youth/student
circles in Greenwich and East Villages, or seeing existing
contacts in those locations; this, of course, is only
speculation on Source's part.
"
2. PINERO is currently in a state of mental depression. Not only
has he been working too hard, he also received a "Dear John"
letter from Lohania Josefina ARUCA Alomo, who had been a
member of the Cuban UNGA Delegation in Fall 1969. This letter.
was hand-carried from Cuba to New York City in Janúáry 1970
by Esperanza BALLESTER Fernandez, a Cuban delegate to the Ninth
Governing Council Session of the UN Development Programme:
(PINERO is divorced from his wife in Cuba, and has two children
by her; he and ARUCA had been planning marriage). Source
thought that PINERO might return to Cuba soon for these reasons,
as he has been here already for a little over two years.
3.
According to comments made by Ramon OROZA Naveran, Chief of
U.S. operations, DGI Headquarters, PINERO and Jose Raul VIERA
Linares are considered by OROZA to be the two DGI officers
here in the most danger of being declared persona non grata
by the U. S. Government.

Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, First Secretary. Source could offer
little new information on RODRIGUEZ; the latter has always
been very reserved with Source and seldom talks with him.
Source is aware that RODRIGUEZ serves as the "official"
--CMUN/DGI contact with Jose Maria QUIMPER, a leftist Peruvian
national employed in the Department of Political and
Security Council Affairs, UN Secretariat. RODRIGUEZ also
appears to handle much of the CMUN business with the local
Prensa Latina office. As far as contacts go, RODRIGUEZ
concentrates--at the UN at least--on Latin Americans.
Orlando PEREIRA Gonzalez, First Secretary. PEREIRA is not
overly liked within the CMUN. He is servile to and afraid
of DGI Center Chief Orlando PRENDES Gutierrez. Whereas PRENDES
has remarked to Source in favorable terms about all his other
Center staff personnel, PRENDES has seldom mentioned PEREIRA
at all. Source concludes that PRENDES does not like or have
much use for PEREIRA.

#
At the present time BALLESTER is Chief, Technical Assistance
Section, Directorate of International Organizations, Cuban
Foreign Ministry. In January 1967 BALLESTER, as an Observer,
attended the Third Session of the UNDP Governing Council in
New York City; in January, 1969. she attended the Seventh Session.
She is not known to have any intelligence/security affiliation..
On 26 January 1970 Source "ELGIN" commented on BALLESTER aș
follows.
-
1
While ostensibly an ardent revolutionary, BALLESTER
does not really understand revolution and appears to be
confused. Among other things, she is disturbed by the
fact that her mother and brother loſt Cuba. The
former is in Miami, but BALLESTER is reluctant to have
any contact with her at this time because she fears the
Cúban Government would misunderstand. Instead,
BALLESTER is considering making a request for official
Cuban Government authorization to meet her mother outside
the U.S. at a later date.
}
BALLESTER is a hard-working "bureaucrat" who attacks her
work conscientiously. Her husband, Rafael MARTEL, is
a well-known Cuban radiologist who currently is serving
an 18 month tour in North Vietnam with a Cuban technical
aid group.
BALLESTER and MARTEL are quite wealthy, by
'Cuban standards, and both are undertaking their current
jobs out of loyalty to Fidel.

INFORISATION, OFTA ÍNED JAROM SOUREY "ELIX"" OR 1_190My 1970
•
Mrs. Victoria FERNÁNDEZ Pagilla, newly angived Attache at the
CHUN, was the subject of a squib passed' to your offied 23
January 1970. Source "ELGIN" provided the following information
on FERNANDEZ on 1 February 1970.
FERNANDEZ will stay in New York City for probably about a
three month period; while here she will be working on dọcuments
and files at the CMUN. In Hayána
In Hayana, she is employed in the
documents section of the International Organizations
Directorate of MINREX. She had been scheduled to come here
for three months for the same purpose in Fall 1969 during the
XXIV UN General Assembly, but Cuban Permanent Representative
ALARCON had objected so her travel was postponed. FERNANDEZ
is billeted in the apartment (5 M, 220 East 63rd Street)
previously occupied by Justo Cesar GELBERT Martinez, Attache;
GELABERT is staying temporarily with Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez,
First Secretary, in his apartment in Oucens, 15 M, 61-15 97th
Street, Elmhurst. Neither GELABERT nor RODRIGUEZ is happy over
this turn of events. FERNANDEZ is married, but Source does
not know anything about her husband.
•
FERNANDEZ is fat and ugly; she does not dress well. She is
a mulatto. She is not known for her intelligence quotient.
She has a somewhat rigid personality and does not get along
well with peoplo, male or female.. She is convinced that sho
is discriminated against because she is part negro. FERNANDEZ
considers herself as a revolutionary but does not seem to
understand politics and ideologies. She takes herself extremely
seriously. Within MINREX she is a "loner"; older than most
of her female professional associates, she has nothing in
common with them and her overbearing attitude is offensive to
them. Source believes that it is almost a foregone conclusion
that FERNANDEZ and Permanent Representative ALARCON will have a
run-in, based on their respective personalities.
FERNANDEZ' brother, Oscar FERNANDEZ Padilla, is Vice-Minister
for Labor Justice, Ministry of Labor. He is an "old guard"
Communist, and Victoria FERNANDEZ is thus linked in some minds
to the out-of-favor old guard herself.
In previous years Victoria FERNANDEZ has served as an instructress...
in the civil defense program. She has enjoyed being in a
position of authority over those normally, outside the training
program, her superiors in position and ability.

Attached herewith for C/WH/COG and COS/WII/MIAMI
are two copies cach of three memoranda concerning results
of an 11 October 1969 debriefing of AMCLOCK/1 by Howard G.
FIGALAN on CHUN and Delegation personalities. The meeting
with AMCLOCK/1 was necessarily brief, and thus the results
are not as extensive as those forwarded by the two referenced
dispatches (from a 6 October meeting with ANCLOCK/1).
2. A copy of each of the memoranda has been passed by
FIGALAN to the local LNERGO Cuban Squad, per our existing
informal arrangement. "ELGIN" is the code name for AMCLOCK/1
as used between the Base and LNERGO here.
3. Items should be extracted for the appropriate 201 files

ELGIN was shown the two photographs (a: Turnisiled by your
office) the individual believed to be Rogelio RODRIGUEZ
Lopez, (OMUN First Secretary, and DGI officer, who was engaged
in an intelligence activity in Queens on Saturday nigh,
1 October 1909%. ELGIN identified the better of the two
photographs as RODRIGUEZ; his identification was unlcsitation.
In questioning EIGIN further to be sure that he was positively
convinced that the individual in question was RODRIGUEZ,
ELGIN state the RODRIGUEZ had recently hid his hate cut and
that it was now lying flatter on his head and that he was
Keeping It "slicked down" with water or oil. There was no
doubt, all in ELGIN'S mind that the individual was RODRIGUEZ.
LEGIN is known RODRIGUEZ for several years and has sech him
here this past month fairly frequently.
ELGIN could not furnish any information as to where RODRIGUEZ
might have been over the week-end of 4/5 October. medid
not see him on either of those two days.
ELGIN commented that RODRIGUEZ has been spending quite a bit
of time lately with Maria de los Angeles FLORES Pridi, an
Alternate Representative of the Cuban UNGA Delegation. Their
companionship is assumed by ELGIN to be more in the social
line than in the professional line. RODRIGUEZ is a bachelor;
FLORES is a divorcee.

Jose Osvaldo GARCIA Calvo, Attache-designate. GARCIA had been
Osva
scheduled to come here in July 1969 as an aïde to António DE
SOUZA, CMUN Advisor. His wife, Nydya Irene ARROYO Martinez, was
to have been a secretary to Ambassador Ricardo ALARCON Quesada.
ELGIN said that GARCIA and ARROYO will not be coming to New York;
their assignment has been cancelled. ARROYO currently is working
in the Cuban Foreign Ministry (MINREX), but GARCIA has been sacked
from MINREX and is now somewhere in the interior of Cuba. GARCIA
fell into official disfavor because a girl friend of his denounceḍ
him to the DSE, either because GARCIA would not divorce his wife
and marry her, or because she just became disenchanted with him
for some reason. Norcover, GARCIA in his MINREX capacity had
accompanied the British Ambassador in Cuba on a provincial tour
several months ago. During the tour, the Ambassador, apparently
favorably impressed by GARCIA, invited him to visit the United
Kingdom. GARCIA neglected to report this invitation to the
proper Cuban authorities, and when the fact of the invitation
leaked out, GARCIA was suspended from MINREX.

MISCELLANEOUS. Although he naturally would not be aware of the
specifics, ELGIN commented that it appears to him that the DGI
Center here is extremely active operationally and seems to have
more than enough funds at its disposal to pursue such activities.

Although AMBEDEW/1/Was "surfacos" on 16 July, the Base was
not advised of the vehiclo by Headquarters until 23 July, after
the Baso bad queried via DO BASE NEW YORK 6372. Fortunately,
AMBED/3 advised the Base of the media of surfacing prior to
23 July. The curfacing had minimal impact locally, as the
vohiclo chosen for the surfacing does not reach the local obser-

1.
On 14 December 1970, the undersigned visited WUSHARP
at the latter's request and had the following discussion,
WUSHARP asked whether we could use WUSLAB/1 as a means of
contacting Cuban officials for the purpose of establishing
1ties which could later be exploited by WUSHARP assets. :
I explained to WUSHARP that WUSLAB/1 had been instructed.
to adopt a passive role in relationship to his Cuban
contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the
Cubans. WUSHARP stated that they understand our point of view
thoroughly.
-
2. At this meeting I briefed WUSHARP on the telephone
call from a DGI representative cited in reference.. I told
WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as well
as a copy of the PCQ on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez (201-332665)
in which they expressed definite interest.

CMUN Counsellor, were romantically involved; ARUCA expected
RODRIGUEZ to divorce his wife and marry her -- he didn't).

(A) Source continues to regard Orlando PRENDES
Gutierrez, First Secretary and Chief of the
local DGI Center, as a very "simpatico" person.
He also thinks well of Teresita FERNANDEZ Arango,
PRENDES' wife, as a person. PRENDES spends little
timo outside of the CMUN. As Chief of the DGI
Center he concerns himself principally with
administration of the Center's personnel and
operational activities, leaving conduct of actual
operations to his subordinates
ZR 201-328953
(B): Source thinks that Jose Raul VIERA Linares, Coun-
sellor, may be acting as the deputy to PRENDES.
At any rate, after PRENDES, the three ranking DGI
personnel are VIERA, Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, and
Orlando PEREIRA Gonzalez (not necessarily in that
order).

He is close to Fidor CASTRO RUZ. He is "very frivolous",
not a serious type of person. Although MORALES is an
Alternate Representative on the II Committee of the
UNGA, he knows little about the issues or the work of
the Committee. He has intellectual pretenses, but in
actuality is of somewhat limited intellectual capacity.

QATED DESK
Reference your telephone request of 24 June 1969
requesting a photograph of Eugelio RODRIGUEZ which is better
than the one appearing in the Cuban Hugbook, it is believed
that Subject of your request is Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez
whose photograph is included in the Hugbook. There is no
photograph of Eugelio RODRIGUEZ.
Forwarded herewith for your retention is a photo-
graph of Rogelio RODRIQUEZ Lopes, recently designated First
Secretary, CMUN, who was scheduled to travel to New York via
Mexico in early June, 1969 Unfortunately, this photograph
litt
e, if any, better than the one in the Cuban Mugbook."
is the only other photograph available at Headquarters
S..
It
AMBEDEW-1 has been shown and has positively identified
the tached photo as Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, a DGI officer in
Section III who was known to AMBEDEW-1 as "Rogelio." A-1 last
saw Rogelio in Paris on 21 November 1968, at which time Rogelio
was enroute to Conakry on what A-1 thought to be an important
mission. It appeared that someone in Conakry could not leave
until Rogelio arrived. A-1 understood that Rogelio had been in
the UN Mission in New York, or in Canada, in 1964–65.
The above information may be passed to LNERGO.

Nicolas RODRIGUEZ Astiazayain, Former CMN Counsellor.
stated that RODRIGUEZ is now the head of the Czech (and
possibly the Hungarian) Desk, Directorate of "Socialist
Countries", Foreign Ministry. He is now divorced from his
wife, Nagaly NESTRE Pintado, and reportedly will marry Lohania
Josefin ARUCA Alonso, who was a member of the Cuban Delegation
to the 22nd UN General Assembly in the Fall of 1967.
RODRIGUEZ was not in any known difficulties or trouble when
he returned to Cuba in early March 1968; he did do a short
stint of "voluntary" cane-cutting after his return, but this
is particularly required of members of the Cuban CP (of which
he has been a member for some years).
2012-78206ST
Marta ALMENEZ Martinez. Member of Cuban 22nd UNGA Delegation.
Source does not believe that JIMENEZ will attend any portion of
the 23rd UNGA this year. She is the Deputy Chief of the
Directorate of International Organizations of the Foreign
Ministry; since the Chief of that Directorate is in New York for
the 23rd UNCA, Jose FERNANDEZ COSSIO Rodriguez, Source believes
that JIMENEZ could not be absent from Cuba at the same time.
Source stated that JIMENEZ is very close to Fidel CASTRO, and
at times has by-passed Foreign Minister Raul ROA to go directly
to Fidel on certain questions.

of the Technical Assistants of the Delegation are members of
the DGI, the external intelligence service. All have now de-
parted New York. During their stay, Source observed that all
spent their time with DGI officers assigned to the CMUM.
only Technical Assistants personally known by Source are Ramon
SANCHEZ-PARODI Montoto, Alvaro TAMAYO Fonseca, Rene VALENZUELA
Acebal, and Eduardo ARAOZ Agero. Source did not know of any
specific duties or missions of any of the Technical Assistants.
He commented that TAMAYO was a close friend of Alberto BOZA
Hidalgo-Gato, First Secretary of the CMUN, who specializes in
"Black Power" matters in New York. Source does not know if any
more Technical Assistants will come to New York during the 23rd
UNGA.

INFORMATION: OBTAINED FROM SOURCE "ELGIN" ON 19 OCTOBER 6S
MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION ON OFFICIAL CUBAN COMMUNITY
001-773-77
Alfonso VILLACORTA, Prensa Latina. Source stated that VILLACORTA
is disgusted with the Cuban regime, but has stayed on with Prensa
Latina here because his brother is in prison in Cuba. Source
believes that VILLACORTA would defect were his brother ever able
to get out of Cuba. VILLACORTA cordially dislikes the CYUN and
its personnel. VILLACORTA, who has been reportedly pro-Chinese
in the past, has no deep political convictions, according to
Source. Jose Antonio RARAZA. Vasquez, a member of the Cuban
Delegation to the 23rd UN General Assembly this year, has spent
quite a bit of time with VILJACORTA in the past month.
thinks that VILLACORTA may be homosexual..
Source
Relations between the CMUN and the local Prensa Latina Office.
Source said that relations between the two offices continue to be
marked with ill-feeling on both sides. The CMUN personnel look
down on the two Prensa Latina employees, and the latter are well ·
aware of this condescending attitude.
3.
-
CMUN Morale. Source claimed that morale is high within the
CMUN regarding Cuba's current status in the world. In response to
4.
a question as to whether VIERA and JIMENEZ resented the arrival of
PRENDES and BOZA, and the consequent "demotion" of the first two
within the DGI hierarchy here, Source indicated that he had seen
no manifestations of resentment on the part of either VIERA or
JIMENEZ. Source believed that this was mainly because both PRENDES
and POZA have long been senior to VIERA and JIMENEZ.
Proportion of Intel/Security Personnel within the CMUN. Of the 16
officers of the CMUN, 12 are believed to be affiliated with either
the DGI, DSE, or DIER (the affiliation now thought for the code
clerks). PRENDES, BOZA, VIERA, JIMENEZ, MORALES, and REYES are
known to be DGI officers. PINERO is a presumed DGI officer.
SANTANA is either DCI or DSE. ESPINOSA and GELABERT are known DSE.
AGUILERA is known to be either DSE or DIER (Investigations Depart-
ment of the Rebel M) PEREZ is suspect DSE or DIER. Only four
CMUN personnel are without any intelligence or security affiliation:
Ambassador ALARCON, DE SOUZA, PLAZA, and CONDE.

INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM SOURCE "ELGIN" ON 19 OCTOBER 6S
CUBAN PERSONALITIES. 23rd UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATION
2012 7669x1
"
Jose FERNANDEZ COSSTO Rodriguez. Director of International
Organizations, Cuban Foreign Ministry. Now gets along well
with Foreign Minister Raul ROA, but at one time he led the
"anti-ROA Mafia" within the Ministry. Major ambition at
this time is to become an Ambassador in one of the more
prestigious posts abroad. Interestingly, he is a distant
relative of Raul ROA. Has been a member of the Cuban CP
for 1/5 years.
Source said that FERNANDEZ COSSIO is
"making a career of Communism", meaning that he makes the
system work for him but is not ideologically oriented. He
is a "loner", and his only real friend is the head of
Directorate of Socialist Countries of the Cuban Foreign
Ministry, who once saved the life of FERNANDEZ COSSIO during
BATISTA days. Source terms FERNANDEZ COSSIO a superficial
person, not an intellectual type, and interested in living
comfortably and having money to spend.
Del 357128
.
Fernando ALVAREZ Tabio. Not pro-Communist and not really pro-
CASTRO. A political rationalizer who is happy with the regime
that allows him to lead his own life. Would not consider
defection unless the regime changed its attitude toward him,
which is not likely, according to Source.
+1.333971
Jose Antonio RABAZA Vasquez.. RABAZA is, in Source's belief, a
homosexual (consistent with other reporting on RABAZA). Hẹ
works in International Organizations of the Foreign Ministry.
under Marta JIMENEZ Martinez, Deputy Chief. While in New York;
RABAZA has been very friendly with Alfonso VILLACORTA of the
local Prensa Latina office. Source believes that VILLACORTA
at least has tendencies toward homosexuality himself. (RABAZA
is very close to Osmani CIENFUEGOS in Cuba, and the latter has
protected him in the Foreign Ministry (other reporting has
indicated that RABAZA found himself in difficulties with the
[regime after an assignment in Rome; he spent close to a year
in prison). According to Source, CIENFUEGOS spoke up for
RABAZA and this is why he still is in the Foreign Ministry.
RABAZA does not associate with others in the Delegation or in
the CMUN; he spends little time in the UN Delegates Lounge,
contrary to others in the Delegation. Source characterized
his behavior as "mysterious", and suspects that RABAZA may be
practicing his sexual proclivities here. He is well-educated
and speaks several languages. He considers himself to be a
good poet.

2. In recent months visas have been requested for the following officers,
but they have not arrived as yet, and presumably some of them may not now be
coming for one reason or another.
A. Jorge BOLANOS Suarez (201-787157), Counsellor-designate,
was due to arrive in late August but presence has not been confirmed;
* B. Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez (201-332665), First Secretary-
designate, DG1 officer, visa requested in April 1968 with no further
information available as to whether he will come (presumably he will
not);
C.✓ Cecilia ANDRE Sardain (201- ? ), Second Secretary-
designate, same ETA status as Rogelio RODRIGUEZ above.
3. VIERA Linares serves as Charge d'Affaires in the absence of
Ambassador ALARCON Quesada. Up to this point, neither the Base nor LNERGO
have been able to state evidentially as to whether VIERA or JIMENEZ Escobar
is the sucessor to Chafik Homero SAKER Zénni (left PCS October 1967) as the
DGI Station Chief. We both, however, tend to regard JIMENEZ as carrying the
most weight in terms of operational activity and in terms of effectiveness. Now,
with the arrival of BOZA Hidalgo-Gato (who reportedly has been the deputy to
Ramon OROZA Naveran, head of U.S. operations for the DGI, per our last
information), it remains to be seen if BOZA figures higher in the local hierarchy
than VIERA or JIMENEZ. With JIMENEZ, VIERA, BOZA, and PRENDES
Gutierrez, the local DGI station has more ranking talent than has been the norm.
The Cubans do not necessarily slot their intelligence officers in Mission titles
equivalent to their true ranks and responsibilities.

The following is a current listing (as of 13 September 1968) of the
officers assigned PCS to the Cuban Permanent Mission to the United Nations
(CMUN) in New York City. Intelligence or security affiliation is also shown
where applicable. The listing is in the probable order of real (as opposed
to UN listing) precedence. As can be seen, the CMUN continues to upgrade
both legitimate diplomatic personnel and intelligence/security personnel both
in terms of quantity as well as quality.

Permanent Representative;

4. In terms of Vulnerability from the LNHARP standpoint, the
intelligence/security personnel at this point appear to offer little in the
way of approach potential. Jorge BOLANOS Suarez (if he comes) and
Gustavo Adolfo PLAZA Peterssen, on the basis of known information,
seem the likeliest targets for us as of now. Both the Base and LNERGO,
however, continue to look at all of them in this regard,
5. It will be noted from the above that of the 16 CMUN personnel
now here, 8 are identified DGI/DSE, 2 are presumed DG1, and 1 (GELABERT)
may be DSE or DIER. The percentage of personnel involved with intelligence/
security thus ranges from a minimum of 50% up to 69% of the total CMUN
personnel strength.
6. The number of official Cubans in New York will, of course, be
swelled by the arrival of the Cuban Delegation to the 23rd UN General
Assembly this month. We have requested, via DO BASE/NEW YORK 4844,
traces on the 8 of the 12 man delegation on whom we hold no information.
