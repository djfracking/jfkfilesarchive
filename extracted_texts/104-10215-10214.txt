1. Subject is identified in reference which also gives his personal
data and is forwarded in a separate pouch. Paragraph 4 of that dispatch
outlines the cover activities of Subject for the grib: 1949 to the present,
during which he has been actually employed by KUBARK, (irst as a contract
agent then, since May 1967, as a career agent. He currectly receives a
salary approximately equivalent to that of a 15-11.
2. Subject's current, extended tour with the Havana station comes to
an end in May 1958; due to his operational experience and performance with
KUBARK in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Havana, Subject appears to be a good
prospect as a replacement for Floyd PORTARY IN CP operations..
'
3. Originally scheduled to be used by KUBARK in Fanaaa, Subject was
instead assigned to Costa ica in 1948 under the HUMANOID project. While
the operational files of this project have not yet been reviewed by this
desk, entries in his personal file show that while in Costa Rica he handled
a successful high level penetration of the local party. At the end of
1953, after a period of training at Headquarters, he was assigned to
PBSUCCESS where he apparently also performed creditably. In July 1954 he
was re-assigned to the Harana station as the principal agent of project
AMPHODARCH which involves the recruitment and handling of CF penetrations
in that country. The AMIODARCH and Subject's personal files have been
reviewed by this desky together with the training and the assessments of
the case officers for whom he has worked, the files show that Subject is
eminently qualified as a recruiter and agent handler in CP operations.
The records show that Subject possesses a great deal of integrity, resource-
fullness and intelligence: he was highly rated both by Headquarters
training officers and throughout his operational work in the field. He is
particularly evaluated highly as to judgment and common sense.

1. Public Surveys Institute of Dallas, Texas, has placed a US
representative in Cuba for the purpose of conducting public surveys,
by polling, which will provide the home office with the requisite
data for periodic market analyses. These periodic reports will be
made available upon subscription to US investment and/or distribution
agencies, and will contain comprehensive studies of market potentials
and limitations, including the role of government as affected by
current political developments.
2. PSI of Dallas will first compile reports of broad scope, from
which subscribers may select their fields of special interest and place
thier orders accordingly. These initial reports will cover such
factors as:
3.
a) The three P's - Population and Purchasing Power.
b) Productive Opportunities.
c) Improved Distribution Patterns.
d) Factors Affecting Demand.
e) A Study of Marketing Areas.
f) General Estimate of the Economic Situation.
;
The PSI representative will not require an office installation
or local employees during the initial studies, but will prepare these
at his residence until special requests are forthcoming from subscribers.
At that time, all materials and installations as well as employment
will be of temporary contractual nature, entirely dependent upon the
scope of the survey.

Training Report on Arthur G. VAIVADA, (P)
Training Alias: "VICKS".
1. Arthur G. VAIVADA was trained covertly by instructors of
this office in Washington, D.C. from 25 March 1957 through
7 May 1957. The original Training
The original Training Request form dated 4 December
1955 reveals the following information concerning his background,
experience and proposed assignment:
"VAIVADA is thirty-four years of age, married and a U.S.
citizen by birth. He attended high school in De Kalb,
Illinois and entered the U.S. Army in 1940, later trans-
ferring to the U.S. Air Force. The trainee served as an
operations and intelligence specialist, first in the
China/Burma theatre and later in Panama. He, was discharged
from the service in 1945. Following his discharge, VAIVADA
worked for a short period as a laboratory technician in
the Sterling Silica-Gel Corporation, Illinois and then
returned to the Fanama Canal Zone to work as a stevedor
and a labor foreman. He reenlisted in the U.S. Air Force
in April 1946 and was honorably discharged in 1949. On
1 June 1949, VAIVADA became a contract agent for this
Agency. He served in this capacity in Costa Rica,
handling a high level penetration of the Communist Party
until 1953. In July 1954, the trainee became principal
agent of Project AMPHODARCH. He has been operating under
a student cover, working for his A.B. degree at the
University of Havana. It is planned that VAIVADA will
return to Havana, Cuba under cover of a representative
of a well known U.S. polling agency. He will perform
the duties of principal agent, handling a large net of
sub-agent informants in Cuban university youth circles
to provide coverage of Communist, leftist, revolutionary
and other political activities among these groups."
2.
The instructors who participated in VAIVADA's training
indicate that his overall performance was above average. He is
a highly intelligent, practical and realistic young man possessing
excellent judgment and common sense. His motivation is strong
and his interest in clandestine activity as a profession appears
to be genuine. VAIVADA should continue to develop as a skilled
and competent agent.
SERAL
The official to whom this report is entrusted. is per-
sonally responsible for it. Although he may, within
his discretion. Now it to other members of his staff.
the report should never be shown to the student
whom it concerns.

1. Subject and his wife arrived in Habana on 14 May 1957 and have taken
permanent quarters here; their children rejoined them the following weekend.
2. As outlined in the reference, and after conversation with VAIVADA
himself, the national polling cover arrangement set up for the approximate
three-month trial period appears adequate. At present Subject and the case
officer are engaged in working out a suitable area or areas for his polling
activities and will shortly notify Headquarters of the results.
3. There is being forwarded as a separate cover attachment an administrative
memorandum from Subject, informing Headquarters that he established a tank
account in Kiami, Florida, and his wishes respecting amounts of his salary and
allowances to be deposited there following 1 June 1957. Subject's initial
opening deposit in the Miami bank account was in the amount of $20.00; the
"copy of check with true name and present balance" mentioned in the attached
Remorandum is being retained in Station files. It is requested that the Station
be notified by cable of the amount of total salary and allowances to be paid
direct to Subject each month in the field after 1 June.

INSTRUCTOR'S COMMENTS
Arthur G. VAIVADA impressed this instructor most favorably. The trainee is
highly intelligent, practical and realistic. He possesses excellent judgment and
common sense. VAIVADA is mature, well-balanced, resourceful and positive. He
appears to be open-minded and objective, possessing a questioning mind and a strong
sense of curiosity. VAIVADA approached training with a strong desire to add to his
knowledge and to refine his own methods and techniques. He was highly receptive and
amenable to constructive criticism. The trainee has a feeling for detail and is
observant and careful in the collection of facts. It was necessary for VAIVADA
to spend considerable time on administrative matters during the training. However,
he completed all outside assignments punctually and completely.
VAIVADA's performance was excellent. He is above average in every aspect.
His motivation is strong and his interest in clandestine activity as a profession
appears to be genuine. If properly supervised, he should be a valuable asset to
this organization. The trainee appears to be industrious, possessing initiative
with leadership qualities.

possibilities can be considered in the fields of photography and athletic
training which are among Subject's specialtics. Ho lists hisself as a
"pistol expert" and a clarification of this term will be requested if, in
the Station's opinion, it may enlarge cover possibilities, perhaps under
LIMERMY. Subject's wife is still a Costa Rican citizen at present, while
his two children are U.S. citisens.
5. Station's comments on this proposed assignment and possible caver
suggestions will be welcome.

presently covered by another agency, so as to minimize the possibility of
instigating inquiries about his employer by the competitors in the area.
Should Subject remain at his post, and it is hoped he will, the cover
originally planned can be amazed later if Subject or the Station feels
that the present cover is not adequate enough ; or, on the other hand, ho
can continue to use the present arrangement.
3. With respect to the payment of his salary and allowances, Subject
was instructed to open a tank account here before he returned to the field.
Headquarters requests he submit the name of the bank and the amount of his
salary and allowances (preferably in round figures) he wishes to be palà
by the Station. The balance vill be paid monthly to his bank by Headquar
ters. Headquartera requires that this arrangement be set up to simplify
and expedite his payments in the event of any changes in salary or allow
acces. Subject said he would give the information to the Station for
transmittal to Headquarters.

4. It is regretted that Subject's wife war not able to become na-
turalized at this time, since she entered this country on a temporary
visitor's visa, and it would have taken too long to change her status to
that of a permanent resident and become naturalized. Since the conversion
of Subject's status to that of a Career Agent is not affected by his wife's
citizenship, it was suggested to Subject that he plan to have his vife
become a citizen when he returns to this country in two years upon becoming i
Religible for statutory homo leave.
5. Subject still has an outstanding travel voucher being processed
at Headquarters, and the Station will be notified as soon as it is con-
pleted. Subject has been paid in full for his salary and allowances for
the month of April 1957.

2. Defore Subject departed Yes the field, he was interviewed three
times by one of the Beadquarters staffs concerning his cover, and arrange-
marts were made to fulfill the station's requirement for his return. How
over, since the polling cover originally/planned for Subject could not be
arranged at this time, a notional" polling cover, adequately backstopped
by a business mixing address and telephone number (being submitted under
separate cover as Mentity 4) was arranged as the alternative. Since
Subject is returning to his post on a test basis, Readquarters feels that
this notional sover is better than a more permanent arrangement would ba;
at least until it is more certain that Subject's stay will be permanent,
thus avoiding any peasible embarrassment vis-a-vis the employer company in
the event Subject is forced to leave the country shortly after arrival.
Furthermore, this notional cover will allow Subject almost complete fres-
der to pursue his other activity with very little time and effort necessary
to mintain his cover. Appropriate business letterheads and carda to imple-
ment Subject's cover will be poughed to the Station as se ãs Subject is
able to survey the area and notify Headquarters of the type of polling activ-
ity he plans to use. He was instructed to select a polling activity not

contract shall be altered accordingly. Payments will be made hereunder as
directed by you in writing in a manner acceptable to the Government.
3. Taxes. (a) In the event taxes are not withheld by your cover facility

involved, will withhold Federal income taxes from all or the remainder of
taxable monies due you under this contract in an amount equivalent to the
United States income tax withholding schedule based upon your taxable income

ments in order to preserve security..

subject to the same rules and regulations applicable to Goverument staff
employees. Such annual leave may only be teken at times and places approved
in advance by appropriate representatives of the Government. All accrued
but unused leave earned under your contract with the United States Government!
effective 1 August 1954, as amended, will be transferred to your leave account

tract, there shall be deducted the appropriate rate percentage (presently

tributions to the Social Security fund, such contributions shall be at your
expense.

ment in the course of your performance under this agreement. It is expressly
understood and agreed that any and all documents which you may execute in

Federal income taxation. You will report every six (6) months during the
term of this agreement all benefits received from or through your cover
activities and, if such benefits exceed those due you under this contract, the
report will be accompanied by said excess amount, which you hereby agree

as appropriate, excess payments, may result in suspension of any paymenis
due you hereunder. As an alternative to the above, the Government may at
any time exercise its basic right to require payınent over to it of the emolu-
ments received by you from or through your cover activities which would
otherwise be offset as described above. In such cases the Government will
pay directly to you the emoluments called for by this contract.

this contract, you assume the custody of Government funds or take title of
record to property of any nature whatsoever and wherever situate, which

30 April 1957
1. During the morning of 30 April Mr. Millard of Cover tele-
phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508. Mr. Millard said that
he would be meeting with Vaivada at 1600 hours today and proposed
providing him with a temporary rather than permanent cover with
the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range
development. Mr. Millard's reasoning was that he did not wish
to place Vaivada under the new company with the chance that the
trial period approved for the Station might cause Vaivada to be
pulled out from that cover in short order. Mr. Millard said that
the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.
2. I concurred with the above proposal.

Chief, CI/OA
Acting Deputy Director of Security (Investigations
C-25507
#112569
and Support)
1. Reference is made to your memorandum dated 28 February 1957,
wherein a provisional covert security approval and a covert security
approval were requested to enable the Subject's conversion to career
agent status for use as Principal Agent for Project AMPHODARCH in
Cuba, under non-official cover.
2. In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine
Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Field Regulation 10-215, a pro-
visional covert security approval is granted for the use of the
Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph #1,
above.
°
3. It should be noted that the provisional covert security
approval herein granted is based on limited investigative coverage
and should not be in any way construed as a final security deter-
mination relative to a full covert security approval. Upon com-
pletion of additional investigation now pending, you will be ap-
propriately advised as to our decision with regard to the issuance
of a full covert security approval.
4. Subjects of provisional covert security approvals are not
to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as,
employees of CIA.
5. Your attention is called to the fact that a provisional
covert security approval does not constitute complete compliance
with the provisions of CIA Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if you should
desire at a later date to change the status or use of this individual,
a request for approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted
to this office.
6. This approval becomes invalid in the event the Subject's
services are not utilized within 60 days of the date of this memo-
randum.

the U. S. Army in 1940, later transferring to the U. 5. Air Force. Ho
served as an operations and intelligence specialist, first in the China-
Burma theater and later in Panama. He was discharged from the service
in 1945 with the grade of Technical Sergeant. After his discharge, he
worked for a brief period as a laboratory technician in the Sterling
(Illinois) Silica-Cel Corporation and then returned to the Foram Canal
Zone to marry & Costa Rican girl in December 1945. For about four months
he worked as a stevedore and labor foreman in the Caral Zore. In April
1946 he re-enlisted in the Air Force in the Canal Zone and uns discharged
three years later, in 1949.
3. Late in 1948 he was recruited by the Agency, and on 1 June 1919
became a CIA contract agent. Since that date, he has served as a con-
tract agent with continuing high level performace, first in Costa Rica,
later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cuba where he
is utilized as Principal Agent of Project AMPHODARCHl. Subject has worked
principally and successfully so, on Communist Party penetration opera-
tions since his engagement with CIA, and his current work involves the
handling of a net of agents providing coverage of Communist, leftist,
revolutionary and other political activities at the University of Habana,
and the student-youth circles in general in Cuba.
4. Subject has always proven to be loyal and trustworthy. In view
of his outstanding record and strong overall qualifications, and his
expressed desire for a career with CIA, it has been recommended he be
converted from contract to career agent status. He was promoted recently
to the equivalent of a CS-10 rating.

Action Remired: Notify Headquarters if Any Objection to iction Para. 3
1. Readquarters ias no objection to the peatonement of VANADA's
training until the end of the current contmet year august 1957),
and has cancelled immediate training exrangements accordingly. The
Station should nutmit a new request several posthe prior to the desired
new training dates.
2. There has been a change, while, in Headquarters thinking on
the proposed conversion of VIVAM to Staff status. Upon reviewing the
TVADK
case, the responsible Headquarters saft que lested that career agent
maff fquetested
status would be more appropriate and recorded that the requested
personnel action be changed accordingly) The Staff pointed out that
virtually all benefits which would exerpe to VAIVADA under staff status
are also obtainable as a career agent. These include Civil Service:
Retirement, Sick and Annual Leave, Home Leave Travel, Periodic Step
☑Am
Increases, and coverage under the Federal Employment Compensation and
Missing Persons Actes. He would also be eligible for certain KUBARK
insurance plans, subject to security and other special considerations.
The one exception is that VAIVADA would remis on a contract basis,
meaning that his Sob security would be somewhat less than that of staff
personnel. His contract would be for an indefinite period, however, and
his job security would closely approximate that of a staff agent.
3. In discussing. VAIVADA's conversion, the reviewing staff also
noted that VAIVADA. would not necessarily be granted staff status, oven
though his wife ware to become a U.S. citizen, and would definitely not
qualify for same at this time. In view of this development and the
generally favorable benefits accruing to a carcer agent, the Division
bas résul its conversion provide for career rather than

SUBJECT
Request for Conversion of Arthur G. VAIVADA from
Contract to Career Agent Status
REFERENCE
: HKH-A-2577
!
April 1956
1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status and presents a
strong case for such conversion. Upon receiving a formal WHD request
for such action, however, your Plans Staff suggested that career
agent status would be more appropriate in this case, and further
indicated that staff status for VAIVADA is virtually out of the
question at this time. The request is being re-submitted, therefore,
in revised form to provide for conversion to career rather than staff
status:
2. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract capacity since 1949, with
a continuous high level of performance; first in Costa Rica, later in
Guatemala and Cuba. He is currently assigned to Cube and is expected to
remain there indefinitely. VAIVADA is 34 years old and was promoted
recently to the equivalent of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career
interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more especially in the
area of unofficial cover assignments, for which he is highly suited.
3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a
career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted career agent
status. A PHS and a new contract check list (in duplicate) are attached.
4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for
covert training during the latter part of 1957.
5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to
career agent status, as indicated above, is hereby requested.

8. Your cover story for having been engaged by the Public Surveys
Institute is as followe:
During a visit to the United States in May 1957, you became
acquainted with Albert E. Johnson, the Director of Public Burveyo
Institute. Johnson indicated that he was interested in engaging
the services of several people to organize and conduct polls in
various Latin American areas.
"
Since you were already located in Cuba and bed a knowledge or
the language and customs, he expressed an interest in employing
you in Cuba. As you felt this type of work would not conflict
with your photographic efforts, you accepted the position effective
May 1, 1957, in order to have an extra source of income.
Early in 1958, Johnson advised you that he had acquired several
promising accounts who were interested in Mexico and be desired to
transfer you to Mexico City since you had both experience and the
nexessary language qualification. You readily agreed to the
transfer and planned to leave for Mexico during the latter part
of May after a short vacation in the United States.
9. Your cover story for having been engaged by Betwins Traval
Folders is as follows:
While visiting in the United States during April 1958 prior to
your departure for Mexico, you became acquainted with Charles H.
Betwin through Albert Johnson in New York. Betwin had seen some
of your published work and expressed an interest in engaging your
services on a part-time basis in Mexico. Since it meant an
additional source of income as well as an opportunity to utilize
your photographic talents, you readily accepted his offer. You
were to photograph various places which were of interest to
Betwin's clients and also forward information relating to prices,
possible package tours, historical points of interest, etc.
Documentation
10. Correspondence reflecting your progress or difficulties
encountered should be carried on between you and your cover firms.
Buch correspondence should be at intervals which would make your
association with your cover firms appear to be the normal relationship
of employer and employee.

Financial Arrangements
11. It is understood that there actually will be no disbursement
of funds for salary or other purposes to you through your cover firm,
and therefore, arrangements for salary payments are a matter of concern
between you and your division case officer. However, precautions must
be taken to insure that the arrangements made will not conflict with
your cover story.
Taxes
12. Your income tax returns will be filed with the Internal
Revenue Tax Unit stationed at headquarters in accordance with
Agency FN 20-660-4.
Restrictions
13. Should you at any time feel the necessity for a modification
of this cover arrangement, or supplementing the cover outside of the
present arrangement, or if any problems arise affecting your cover,
direct a routine communication to your cover firms outlining the need
or situation and concurrently notify your case officer of the conditions.
so that he may check with headquarters. Subsequently, you will receive
Edvice from your cover concerns as would be normal and also be provided
\ with official compatible instructions from your case officer:
14.
With regard to any persons desiring to apply for a position
with either cover firm, you are instructed to state that to the best
of your knowledge and belief, the firms are adequately staffed. However,
in order the the matter may be treated casually, the inquirer may be
told to submit his application to the New York or Texna address, which
ever applies, where it will receive due consideration.
15. You understand that these cover facilities have been established
through cleared cooperative individuals who are witting, but not actually
a part of the Agency. These persons know that you are actually an employee
of the Agency and, as such, an extremely high standard of conduct will be
expected of you.
16. A copy of this cover story will be retained in the station
files. You may refer to it when necessary.

While there is no reason to believe that NORWAYE has been exposed er
compromised during his years of operating in Costa Rica, uatemale or
Cubs for CIA, the following incidents involving his security are set
forth for your information:
:
8.
30224 was forced to leave uatemala prier to his scheduled
departure when & -oste hicen source informed me that she had
heard from high-level party souress Dual a "9.5. apont,
specialist in Communist matters, hed departed San desa for
Guatemala." This vague reference unfortunately coincided
with mabject'e arrival in Guatemala.
1
b. In 1953 when cubject wes leaving Costa Rice, to made two
cold approaches, one to a roman communist who was a leader
in the Union de majores. ko mbject left har homa the lady
vent immediately to Party headquarters and reported the incid
ent. Novevor, she was unable to describe OTR and so
confused the approach story that it was useless to the Party
and absolutely nothing ever cone of the incident.
While in Cuba, I was working with a municipal committee
youth communist vào ven a translator and did a story for
305UTR in Spanish. they not in each other's homes and
HUIMATE gave the Communist his business card (PSI). Sometime
later, the Cuban military intelligence officer (SI) picked
up the Entaunist and searched his promises. Areng other
things, they found HEMATH's businscs.cani. Phen quoried
about this, the Communist simply told the officials he did
translating for NGEHAIR. Nothing case of this incident and
NORMTR could detect no surveillance of his poreon or his
premises.
d. While the Cuben police will probably have NOVATE's name
registered as having visited the Sierra Maestra region, the
publication of his photographs and perhaps an article at al
later date, should cover subject as a writer thereby minimising
any security hazard in this connection.
D. Operational Information
(1) Type of operations FI. Subject will be ez outsida caso officer
for several station operations directed at the Texican Communist
and Marxist parties.
(2) Lecation: Fexico City and Quadalajara,
(3) Degree of mobility desired Subject will spend most of his time
in Rexico City but he should be free to travel to Guadalajara
and other towns in Kexico.

City. His contributions to such nove sadis should be in the
field of feature, and hemm interest stories, rather than of
current events. Hic salary could, and probably should, be based
on a stringer or piecemeal basis, rather than having a fixed

photographer, he could be expected to make photographic contribu

In addition to the above arrangements, it is sugrested
further that the notional cover (Public Purveys Institute, Ceneral
Polling Service, Dallas, Texas) previously utilised by subject
be continued. Subject maintains that he has developed a very
sound and detailed cover based on this notional arrangement
and that it would be very logical for him to use it in Mexico.
Also, this additional cover arrangement would give subject another

geographic mobility.

Towards the latter part of 1957, as a result of an increasing number

mountains, the Western Hemisphere Division became aware of the urgent need
to mount an operation to acquire first-hand and reliable information and.

volunteered to undertake the precarious mission to contact Fidel Castro
in his mountain retreat in the Sierra Maestras. He arranged for his free

which the Station developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements,
Mr. Crozier left La Habana on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from
where he left for the Sierras under the escort of a rebel guide who
conducted him safely through the Cuban Army lines. During the course
of approximately twenty days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's
headquarters, Mr. Crozier was exposed to many hardships and great personal
risks. On 26 March 1958, Mr. Crozier accompanied Fidel Castro and a force

On 1 May 1953, 12. CRUZIER was in charge of an attempt to physically
T
_penetrate the home of Manuel MORA Valverde, President of the Costa Rican
Communist Party for the purpose of obtaining documents which could be used
to prove the Communist party's control over the partido progresista Independiente,
a front which had been organized to participate in the 1953 elections.
The
sub-agent who was to actually perform the penetration-failed to appear-and-
_
on his own initiative
realizing the urgency of the operation, CROZIER voluntarily made the
penstration. At the time mxkkex (6400) he entered the MORA house,
the
-entire-family-was known to be sleeping in the rear part of the house.
GREAT
Working quietly and quickly under conditions of conible personal risk,
Mr. CROZIER succeeded in carrying away approximately 85 percent of the legal
PPI documentation and other records as well as a large amount of Communist
112
Party documents such as minutes to meetings, code works, etc. A few days
later a high level party penetration reported that the PPI may have been eliminated

from the electoral scene due to the almost impossible task of recronstructing
the legally required recorde. However, the PPI was able to reconstruct
the records and registered by the deadline of 26 May. According to the
Station, "this operation provided the station with a bulk of compromising
documents, seriously hampered-PPI-activities because of missing records, almost
eliminated them from the scene, spread distrust, suspicion, and confusion among
the Political Commission, and, because it was finally attributed to Figuerista
RiEX elements, enraged the Communists against FIGUERES and destroyed any

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT:

11 April 1958
Chief, FI/Staff
Arthur G. VAIVADA
dale
Request for Promotion
L
:
i
:
1. It is requested that Arthur G. Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted
from GS-11 to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a
precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project AMPHODARCH, in
which he is the Principal Agent.
2. In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to
contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains
in south-eastern Cuba. He arranged for his free passage into the Sierras
through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station.
developed earlier. After the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana
on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras
under the escort of rebel guides. In the course of approximately twenty
days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which
time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied
Castro and a force of about 200 rebels on their day attack on the town of
Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with
the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.
3. During his relatively short stay in the Sierra Maestra mountains,
Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational
information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic
coverage of his trip.
4. This exploit is another achievement to be added to the impressive

Naturelly, there are many intangibles involved with
operating over long periods (almost/years in Cuba) in one place, and then
travelling back and forth between areas of previous assignment (Costa Rica),
and lest but not least, cultivating cortuniete in all these places. The
question becomes, How a thorough are these people? Does a Cuban CP
tkraugh
character communicate with a Guatemalan or Costa Rican along lines of
Becurity, of movement of Americans in these areas, and actual approaches
made? Frobably not, at their best, the administration is haphazard. A typical
examples Once, in 1953, when I was leaving Costa Rica, I made a couple of
cold approaches one was with woman communist, a leader in the Union de Mujeres
Carmen Liga. I walked away from her house - she evidently got a taxi right
behind me and she went straight to the headquarters and reported to Manuel
Mora. But she couldn't describe me - had the story so confused (the a roach
story) es to render it useless to them, and absolutely nothing ever came of
the incident. (By the same token, it would have been a different story in
Cuba.)

Although, even in Cuba, there is not pereistence or

times. I gave him my business card (Delles Corporation) and some time later

up my business card. He was queried on it and stated that he was simply

get nothing on him at this time but such en incident/nave provoked at

confirm my company connections and could even be used as a credit reference
if necessary. This arrangement was quite satisfactory..

Assessment (sec)
:
a) Leet assignment; Arrived Havena in August 1954 with a one-year
scholarship at the University of Habena (Fen American Foundation, University
of Florida et Gainesville). This cover adequately set up and well back stopped.
I travelled to Gainesville, met the man (Curt Wilgus) on that end of the line
and the only documentation necessery was a series of letters from the Foundation
that indiceted my efforts to obtain the scholarship sa finally their grant.
After arriving, however, and matriculating at the U of H, it became immediately
obvious that the nature of my target was such that my presence within the
university wee zore a handicap then en asset. After a few months et the
university, I abandoned studies (it was becoming increasingly difficult anyway
due to political disturbences) and turned to freelance photography and writing
for my cover. For several months I had the photography on just enough of a
paying basis that would eatisfy any security surveillance.
Photography and writing was definitely superior to
university es cover, since it then gave the opportunity to work inconspicuous-
ly on penetrations within the university.
Concerning general security expects of that assign-
ment, there was that one incident with the threat to exposure coring out
of the death of an amphodarch key agent and my proximity throughout the entire
incident. However, there has never been any indication that I was exposed
or compromised. The station in Cuba felt that if I could return and operate
as free fron surveillence ee I did, that certainly Cuban security people did
not have anything compromising on me.
--
b) Previous assignments: To the best of my knowledge, I have never
been exposed or compromised during the years of operation in Costa Rica,
Guatemala and Cuba. There was an incident which prompted an early deșerture
from Gustezala for personal and operational security reesons but again,
there was never any further indication as to the validity of the warning.
what occurred the Costa Ricen Bource MARY apparently learned from high
level party sources that a US agent, specialist in communist matters, had
departed San Jose for Guatemala" and of course, this vagery unfortunately
coincided with my arrival at Guatemala. At any rate, I was doing very little
at Guatemala and would have departed any ay in view of the deteriorating
situation of June 1954.

Commendation for Successful Completion of Mission to
Sierra Haestra
At Headcuarters' Discretion
1. The writer wishes to commend Station and Base personnel whose work
contributed to the successful preparation, mounting, and execution of the
clandestine operation that recently placed a NUBAFK Career Agent, Arthur G.
VAIVADA, in the Sierra Maestra headquarters of Dr. Fidel CASTRC Fuz for
sixteen days in March 1958. This mission resulted in acquisition by KUBARK
of considerable important and timely information regarding the CASTRO
revolutionary movement that was being urgently requested by customer agencies.
In the writer's opinion the operation was a team effort. Giving credit to the
staff personnel will in no way detract from the praiseworthy performance of
VAIVADA himself.
ine
2. With regard to VAIVADA the personal courage and professional ability
as an intelligence officer demonstrated on this mission were of the highest
order and should be highly commended. Headquarters is aware, as is the Station,
thất VAIVADA is desirous of acquiring staff agent status with KUBARK.
writer believes that his desires in this respect should be given consideration
as part of any action taken in recognition of VAIVADA's services in the subject.
operation.
3. Station and Base personnel directly concerned with laying on this
operation, arranging for proper briefing and support of VAIVADA, and
recovering him securely when he left the Sierra Maestras, were Humphrey I.
EBERWIN, James R. PALINGER, and Nelson L. RAYNOCK.

b) The security expects of the Dallas corporation were very
good I believe. Since freelance writing at best is considered e weak cover,
this corporation connection gave me a more solid standing with more serious
creditors such as landlords, banks and the larger merchandizing houses.
In addition to the above, this cover was utilized very conveniently in
operational instances where a realistic approach story was needed. Comcunists
were approached on the basis of political polling this could be narrowed
right down to soliciting information on the communists party as a political
party. Again, it was always nice to have a business card with adreзees and
tlephone numbers that could be given as immediate reference to any type of
security interrogation.

Estimate of Journalistic cenobility:
While my contributions in fiction have been prineinelly
juvenile, my writing training he come largely over a period of yeare at
reportorial writing. Since I have some experience as a photographer also,
it is convenient to relate the two, and possibly my best field would be
feature and article writing. However, while on the mission with the Castro
revolutionary movement, I associated with various members of the press end
had no difficulty whatsoever in passing as one of them. Given en adequate
period for femiliarizetion, I feel that I could just about rave into any
press or writing slot that did not require a great deal of copy or
tight dealines.

1. In Havana, Cuba on 5 March 1958, 1 briefed Ross L. Crozier
concerning:
a)
his proposed new assignment in Mexico; and
b)
Headquarters desire that he receive special
briefings from CI/ICD prior to going to Mexico.
2. Crozier stated that he was very glad to receive the briefing

in Mexico involved. He was pleased to find out that it was a pure
penetration assignment. He also responded enthusiastically to the idea
of receiving Headquarters briefings prior to going to the Field. He
stated that he would like to have a short leave in Costa Rica prior to
receiving the Headquarters briefing.
3. On 2 April 1958 in Washington, D.C., the undersigned and Mr.
E. L. Anderson, Chief, CI/ICD-WH, briefed Crosier further concerning ·

and that if securely feasible it would be a good idea for the two men
to meet there. Mr. Crozier stated that he thought that it could be

as an American citizen and he is well acquainted with COS, San Jose.
One of the elements in our plan for intensification of the CPPP in
Mexico is that these two very capable officers should get to know

DU/P 3-8523
Sale of News Photographs by Arthur G. VAIVADA (ps)
i
1.
It is requested that Arthur G. VAIVADA be granted permission
to sell news photographs of Fidel CASTROS! Cuban Revolutionary Group
to an appropriate United States news agency.
2. VAIVADA is a Career Agent who has very recently returned
from a FCS assignment in Cuba. At the direction of the Western
Hemisphere Division, VAIVADA spent the last three weeks of his
Cube assignment in the Sierre Maestra cemn of Fidel CASTRO for, the
purpose of collecting current intelligence information on CASTRO's
activities. As a result of his notional cover as a representative
of a U. S. public opinion polling service, VAIVADA was able to take
numerous photographs of current news interest. This Division con-
siders the sale of these photographs as an integral part of the
cover backstopring necessary to protect the identity of VAIVADA's
actual Sponsor (CIA) from three U. S. news media correspondents
who were with VATVADA during his visit with CASTRO. Also, the sale
of these photographs would supplement a future news media cover
for VAIVADA in his forthcoming PCS assignment in Mexico City.
3. All money resulting from the sale of these photographs
will be retained by the Agency.

MEMORANDUM
Artheir
Vaivada
SUBJECT: Subject of our letter number 4025%;B interest in Assignment
in U. S.
Patinger
Sager
Ha
1. In recent conversations with both JRP and RDS, Subject has
broached the prospect of a possible assignment within the U. S. follow-
ing completion of his Habana assignment. He says he would not want his
statements re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquarters
to be interprated to mean that he is not interested in a U. S. tour.
says that he has been giving much thought to his future career, as well
as to the needs of his family. He points out that he personally has now
spent approximately 16 years, excepting vacations and short training.
periods, living ma working outside the U. S., that his two cnilaren
have never lived there, and that both he and his wife are concerned
that too much time will elapse before they can provide their children
with a period in the U. S. during their formative years.
2. It is the opinion of both RDS and JKP that Subject is at a
point in his career development where a tour at Headquarters would
be extremely beneficial. The Station lacks knowledge concerning the
specific Headquarters jobs to which a person of Subject's status might
be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR sometimes employs
these persons as instructors. We believe that a tour with UTR would
not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Subject's background
caused by lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the same time
afford OTR excellent instructor material.
3. In view of Subject's own interest in such an assignment, and
our estimate of the potential value to him and to the Organization
that would accrue from it, we recommend that Headquarters arrange such
an assignment if at all possible.
4. In view of the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near
future, a prompt decision is requested.

Reference: HAH-W-2380, dated 16 October 1957-
1. The Subject has no objection to submitting to an LCFLUTTER test
at the convenience of Headquarters. This could be easily arranged here
in the event an LCFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;
on the other hand, VAIVADA could just as easily go to any designated place
in Florida in order to take this test. It is undersizod that LCFLUTTER
teams from time to time visit that state.
The Station will take such measures as are feasible to cover the
activities of Subject and his wife while in Habana.
2.
3. While the matter was not referred to in the reference, Subject's
projected one-year tour of duty will end in June, 1958, at which time it
is VAIVADA's desire to leave Cuba for a reassignment in another area in
his present line of operational work and under similar unofficial cover
conditions. A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans-
mitted to Headquarters; it is referred to here so that the Headquarters
desk may be alerted to the need for considering what assignments would
be open to VAIVADA during the Spring or Summer of 1958.

Action Requcated: None
1. During his recent visit to Headquarters, Subject was asked by one
of the Staff meature if he would be interested in, and available for,
recruitmat approaches in variess Latin Azeriam countries. Since Subjest
has a fine record in CP pocetration work (24, his outstanding job in
handling HuanOID-3 operation in Costa Rica and his efforts in the CP pamu-
tration program is Cuba), it is balleged f he would be effective
recruiter of possible CP defectors.

2. Subject stated that he was keenly interested in, and would like to
engage in, such operations and tould yield the opportunity of being asked
te hit a well-chosen target in any Spanish spanking Latin American country.
3. The foregoing discussion with Sabject was informal and without
commitment on either side. However, the Station is being alerted to the
pessibility that Subject may be requested to perform such approaches at
such time when worthile rearuitment in-place CP targets are developed,
or otherdide arise in other countries. Nevertheless, any such action origi
mating at Headquarters or at any other Station, will of course be subject to
Stationery's (consideration and approval beforehand, depending on his

SUBJECT
Request for Conversion of Arthur G. VAIVADA From
Contract to Staff Status
REFERENCE
: HKH-A-2577
!
6-84831
and 6-72
1.
Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract, agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents
a strong case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a con-
tract capacity since 1949, with a continuous high level of perfor-
mance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is cur-
rently assigned to Cuba and is expected to remain there indefinitely.
VAIVADA is 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent'
of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests lie in contimed
employment by CIA, more especially in the area of unofficial cover
assignments, for which he is highly suited.
2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa Rican
citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion some-
what. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, however,
and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next
several months, barring unforeseen developments. She will be required
to spend most of this period in the U.S. and is currently making
plans to do so..
3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a.
career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted staff status
at grade CS-11, contingent upon his wife's first becoming a U.S.
citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.
There is available in WH Division a staff position (BAF-409) to
which VAIVADA can be assigned.
4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for
covert training in the near future.
5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to
staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA; Staff Status
1. The undersigned discussed case this date with Mr. Myers
(2709 "I"; telephone extension 2551-2552) and with Mr. Pennington
(2044 "I") both of Security Division. Mr. Myers was shown the con-
tent of HKH-A-
(recommendation for staff status for VAIVADA)
and apprised of the problem of Mrs. VAIVADA not being a U.S. citi-
zen. Myers stated that, while cases like this were usually very
difficult, he felt this particular one might be justified in view
of VAIVADA's long and excellent record with the Agency and the rela-
tively long time during which he has been married. Myers indicated
that the procedure would be as follows:
Presentation of a formal request for waiver on citizenship
requirements for spouse and granting of staff status to Subject.
The memorandum would be prepared for Personnel, would then go
to Security, and subsequently, with recommendations of both,
to Deputy Director, who would have the final decision in this
. case.
Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of
Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next
step should be.
2. Considering the possibility that such a request might be.
turned down, the undersigned discussed with Pennington the proce-
dures for acquisition of citizenship for Mrs. VAIVADA, and deter-
mined that this should be relatively simple. The requirements were:
presence in the U.S. (vicinity of Washington) for approximately
forty-five days with some additional time to acquire passport. So
long as we have nothing that would make her inadmissable to the U.S.,
☐ the basic requirements would be: ability to speak English and to
pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be given
to her for study. Security would presumably handle her case when
she arrives in the States.
."
This
3. It has occurred to the undersigned that perhaps, if it is
necessary for Mrs. VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA himself
could be brought to the washington vicinity for training purposes
in order to facilitate the visit of his wife, expenses, etc.
would at the same time afford an opportunity to provide VAIVADA
with formal Headquarters or PBPRIME training of which he becam
none to date.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
Proposed Staff Status for Arthur G. VAIVADA
HKH-A-2577, 17 April 1956
1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a
good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract
capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; first
in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is 34 years old and
was promoted recently to the equivalent of a grade GS-10. His ex-
pressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more
especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which
he is highly suited.
2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa
Rican citizen. Preliminary investigation at Headquarters has revealed
that Subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the
question so long as his wife remains an alien. It has also been de-
termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenship within
a span of 45 days if she so desires and is willing to come to the
U.S. for that period of time. This would remove the major stumbling
block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA.
3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca-
reer with CIA, it is recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encouraged
to seek U.S. citizenship under the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA
be granted staff status, contingent upon his wife's first becoming
a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requirements.
C/WH/III has endorsed the recommendation for staff status and a sug-
gestion by C/WH/Admin that BAF-409, a new position currently alloted
to San Jose, be transferred to Habana to be filled by VAIVADA.
4. It is further recommended that WH Division consider bring-
ing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with his wife's
stay (at Headquarters' convenience). This would facilitate acquisi-
tion of citizenship for the wife and at the same time afford VAIVADA
a chance for additional Headquarters training. Subject previously
received covert training at Headquarters from 5 October through 25
November 1953.

1. At the time the request was submitted to convirt Subject, from
Contract Agent to Career Agent status, a provisional covert security clearance
WAG granted for that purpose. KUSODA recently devised that a full covert
security clearence had been granted for the way of subjects Principal agent,
under-official cover, in Project AMD CH, in accordance with the providons
set forth in the remorandum of the Chief, KIBAIK, dated 14 February 1949,
entitled "Security and Operational Nervace."
2.
At the same time, PRUDA reusited the following action to be taken:
a.
That full overseas traces and such actual overseas investigation
as is possible be taken on subject and his wife and her feally;
and,
b. That orrengarents be made to have Subject affronted with a
LCHOTTER test as noon 28 feasible.
as
3. Headquarters has already initiated the action set forth in Para 2 (6)
requesting full traces and investigation of subject and his wife and her
Immily in Pensan City and Son Jose. Todate only San Jose has replied with
ENSA-2938, cops of which was sent to Habene. Station Habana is requested to
take appropriate setion to cover Subject's and his
activities curing
their residence in Habens, and inform Headquarters of the results.
4. With reference to KUSODA's request for a LCFLUTTER test on Subject,
they have expressed their desire to have Subject tested in the field as
soon as possible, or as soon as the appropriate arrangements can be made.
KUÇODA has indicated that they will be happy to assist in arranging this test.

However, Hondqurters would appreciate receiving the Station's views and
comments on the matter ss quickly as possible so that KUSODA may be edvisni
and can make the necessary planning.
5. The station is reminded that subjects of covers escurity clearances
are not to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as,
employees of KUBARK. Your attention is also called to the fact that a covert
essurity clearance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
KUBAFE Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if the station should desire at e lator
date to change the status or use of Subjest, & request for elearance to cover
any proposed change should be submitted to Headquarters.

possibility that subject my la requested to perform such approaches at

or otherwise arise for other countries. Nevertheless, any such action origi-

1. Concurrent with this memorandum a covert security
clearance is being issued to enable the Subject's conversion fran
contract agent to career agent for use as principal agent for
Project AMPODARCH in Cuba under non-official cover.
2. This is to advise that information has been received
from a confidential source of the Office of Security concerning
Argentina CORDERO Calderon and her sister, Counsuelo, who are
believed to be the Subject's wife and sister-in-law respectively.
According to a December 1944 report, the above individuals were
described as Costa Rican citizens then in Paname under
suspicion and members of the Russian Ballet team of Pedro and
Lidia GHUPINE. Armenting is known to speak and understand
German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL, reportedly
a German national and formerly on both British and U. S.
Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-
German remarks and is pro-German in her sympathies.
It was
further reported that both of the above individuals have at
times attempted to secure information from members of the
American Armed Forces.
3. In view of the above information, it is requested that
current overseas traces and investigation be conducted on the
Subject as well as on his wife and sister-in-law, Counsuelo,
and other members of his wife's immediate family and that the
results thereof be furnished this office.
4. The covert security clearance which is being issued
in this case is made contingent upon the faovrable results of
the requested overseas traces and investigation.

La Habana, Cuba
June 10, 1957
Arthur G. Vaivada
1. Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in keeping with the
nature of this notional cover plan of a temporary nature. Careful
consideration has been given to a number of ideas, all of which were
rejected because possible local conflicts. This idea is still general
enough (and I hope convincing) to leave opportunity for changes and/or
improvement at Headquarters. The idea, and the terminology, "was
gleaned from the pages of "Investment in Cuba", a July 1956 study
published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
2. As I understand this cover arrangement, the PSI should mail me
a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information. This
should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly some queries from
me occasionally. Then when our operational picture requires investigation
in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to
request a survey or poll in that field..
3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and
allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration
of this "Agency" and then advise PSI as to the legal requirement.
