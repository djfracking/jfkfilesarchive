CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS
A source advised on May 4, 1960, that the
Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms (CCPAF) was
organized in Los Angeles, California, in January, 1952,
for the announced purpose of supporting a number of
individuals from the medical and legal professions who had
been subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
Since its establishment, the CCPAF, in extending
its scope, has worked for the abolition of all Congressional,
State, and local committees investigating subversive
activities and in the latter part of 1954 became very active
in opposition to State and Federal legislation directed
at the Communist movement.
FRANK WILKINSON, Executive Secretary of the
CCPAF, is described by the source as the "brains and energy"
behind the organization.
Another source advised on September 17, 1952,
that FRANK WILKINSON was a Communist Party member as of
September, 1952.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
LIBERTIES
A source advised on June 11, 1961, that a meeting
of the National Executive Committee (NEC), Communist Party,
USA (CFUSA), was held on June 10, 1961, at CP headquarters,
23 West 26th Street, New York, New York. According to the
source, the main topic of discussion at this meeting was
the CP's plans in regard to combating the June 5, 1961,
decision of the United States Supreme Court, requiring the
CP to register with the Attorney General of the United States
as a communist-action organization pursuant to the provisions
of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 and the
Court's decision of the same date upholding the April 21,
1955, conviction of Junius Scales under the Smith Act
provision covering membership in the CP. This source further
advised that during this discussion a special CP defense
committee was formed and it was decided that this committee
would have an office, which would be managed by Miriam Fried-
lander who, according to the source, is a member of the CPUSA
National Committee.
Another source advised on June 14, 1961, that at a
meeting of the CPUSA National Board and invited guests held on
that date at CF headquarters, New York City, it was announced
that the CP defense committee would have an office at 22 East
17th Street, New York, New York, under the name of the
Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties (CCCL).
A third source advised on July 20, 1961, that at a
meeting of the CP defense committee held on that date at CP
headquarters, New York City, the purpose and scope of the CCCL
was discussed. It was stated that this committee has been set
up to serve as a national coordinator and service center for ..
every effort being made by whatever source to repeal the
McCarran and Smith Acts. In addition, it has been set up to
reverse the Supreme Court's decision of June 5, 1961, or secure
an indefinite stay of any enforcement of the law by the Department
of Justice.
It is to engage in generating a popular defense move-
ment to mobilize legal assistance of any organization or
individual whose "democratic rights are infringed upon by
these laws." This committee wants to encourage the creation of
local organizations or groups to work in support of any one of
the above-stated objectives. The committee will also serve as
an exchange center of material and provide speakers for any
local organization.

COMMUNIST PARTY (CP) AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
San Francisco County CP (SFCCP)
SF T-2, a self-admitted former member of the CP in
the San Francisco area during the period from 1952 to 1957,
advised on November 5, 1962, that she knows IRVING FROMER
and his wife as members of the CP in San Francisco during
that period.
At a meeting of the Sunset Club, SFCCP, which was
held at 1235 42nd Avenue, San Francisco, on May 16, 1962, a
discussion was held regarding IRVING FROMER and his wife.
It was noted that the PROMERS had recently moved to the area
covered by the Sunset Club. HERB NUGENT, Chairman of the
SFCCP and a member of the Sunset Club, remarked that the
FROMERS are in the Lincoln Club, SFCCP, and that they are needed
in the Lincoln Club. He said, however, that the PROMERS do
not contribute much to Club life and this is one of the
problems of the Lincoln Club. He said that the Lincoln Club
had agreed to meet at the FROMERS house, and the FROMERS
didn't even arrive to attend meetings held at their own home.
NUGENT said that both of the FROMERS are active in other
mass organizations.

The Subject attended a public meeting sponsored by
the CP held at 150 Golden Gate Avenue on December 5, 1962.
MICKEY LIMA, Chairman of the Northern District of California
CP, was Muster of Ceremonies at this meeting. He said that
he need not be introduced as everyone knew what his political
views were. He introduced JOHN APT, Legal Council for the CP
and Defense Attorney for CP members victimized by the McCarran
Committee.
JOHN APT spoke of the complexities of the McCarran
Act and how it had been used before in an attempt to convict
MICKEY LIMA and others, and he told how the government had
reversed the conviction on LIMA and the others because they
lacked evidence to prove their charges. Now, the government
is trying to get these people to confess to something that they
had failed to prove the first tine.
APT stated that President TRUMAN vetoed the McCarran
Act on the grounds that it would put the government in the roll
of a dictator.
He also spoke of the concentration camps scattered
throughout the country and noted that anyone could be placed
in them if the government felt they were a danger to the
national war crisis.
He spoke of the flexibility of the McCarran Act,
which he said could be used against any citizen for any given
reason and at any given time.

The Subject attended a May Day meeting held at 150
Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, on May 1, 1902, sponsored
by the San Francisco Free Speech Forum. The Free Speech Forum
was set up by the SFCCP to hold public meetings.
WALTER STACK, a member of the SFCCP, was chairman
of this meeting and spoke on the meeting of May Day as a labor
holiday.
ARCHIE BROWN, a member of the SFCCP, discussed his
conviction under the Landım-Griffith Act. He said it is a test
case to see if the act is constitutional. They noted that he
was elected to the Executive Board of Local 10, International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (IIWU), by members of
the local and it would make no difference if he resigned from
the CP because the Landum-Griffith Act says a person must not
have been a member in the past five years.
RALPH IZARD, a member of the SFCCP, gave a speech
on the subject of government and monopolies . He said the
government should spend money on the unemployed, the sick,
and the ill-housed instead of spending money trying to dominate
former colonial countries trying to establish independence.
ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN, Chairman, CP or the United
States of America (CPUSA), was the featured speaker. She
said that things were different today for Communists under
indictment than when she was indicted under the Smith Act.
She said at that time all doors were shut to them, but now
all doors are open. She said that QUS HALL and BEN DAVIS,
Communist functionaries, have been speaking to students all
over the country. She said that the government lanovo
that she is the Chairman of the CPUSA but so far has not been
able to prove that she is a member of the CP. The said that
the State Department is trying to take away her passport under
the McCarran Act.
She also said that she had visited the Soviet Union
as a fraternal delegate to the Congress or the U.8.S.R. and
gave the Russians the greetings of the American people. She
also visited some of the Social Democracies and found no
unemployment there.

The Subject attended a conference sponsored by the

September 33, 1962. JEAN KRAMER, Chairman of the conference,
opened the meeting by stating that its purpose was to discuss
the WALTER MCCARRAN Act and the California" "Little McCarran
Act" (Proposition 24 on the California Ballot)
KRAMER read a written speech which had been prepared
by LLOYD MC MURRAY Civil Liberties Attorney, who had planned
to attend the meeting but was unable to make it. MC MURRAY's
speech dealt with the Chinese Confession Program which was
set up to give Chinese who were illegally in the country
protection if they came forth and told their real identity.
The main gist of the speech was condemning the Immigration
Service because of their policy of sending illegal
immigrants back to China.
The "San Francisco Call Bulletin" issue of
November 18, 1957, carried an article which stated that
JEAN KRAMER had been ordered deported as an alien who
belonged to the CP. The article stated that she came
to the United States in 1933 and was a CP member from
1933 to 1948.
LLOYD MC MURRAY was an active member of the CP
in San Francisco from 1946 to 1950.

SAUL LANDAU is editor and publisher of Studies on
the Left (See Appendix Page).
(SP T-16, 1962)
JOSEPH P. MORRAY described himself as a former
officer in Naval Intelligence, a lawyer and a former professor
in Havana. He said that when the revolution in Cuba was
started, the CP was against it and told CASTRO it was ill-
advised, 111-timed, however, CASTRO went ahead with the revolution
and when the Communist saw he was accepted as the national
leader, they joined forces and accepted his leadership.
MORRAY said the first president after the revolution
was a conservative who demanded that CASTRO kick out the
Communists and close the Communist papers. He also wanted
appropriate compensation to be paid for land and factories
which were nationalized. MORRAY said that CASTRO agreed only
to pay the value which had been declared for these properties
in their tax returns.
MORRAY said that CASTRO is a Leninist and disagrees
somewhat with Communists. He said that the Cuban people åre
proud of being socialists and that CASTRO is in Cuba to stay.
•
He said he was skeptical about Russian missiles being
in Cuba and decided that the Russians were trying to build a
nuclear wall between Russia and Cuba.

INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY
The 1955 Report of the California Committee on
Un-American Activities, page 46, stated, "The Independent
Progressive Party in California was quickly captured by
the communists, and by the time the Wallace for President
campaign had swung into high gear was being operated lock,
stock, and barrel by the Communist Party of California.
Time after time the committee in questioning witnesses
throughout the State discovered that the leaders of the
Communist Parties in various localities were identical
with the leaders of the Independent Progressive Party in
the same area. It is true, of course, that in the Inde-
pendent Progressive Party there were many sincere liberals
who, because of dissatisfaction with the two major polit-
ical organizations registered as Independent Progressives
and continued their affiliation until the true control of
the I. P. P. became obvious. These people invariably re-
signed, many of them having given the benefit of their ex-
perience to various official agencies interested in the
exposure of subversive activities.

LUMER discussed the employment situation in the
United States, and said unemployment was increasing because
of automation and he said the unions are worried and noted
that recent strikes were for job semmity rather than
increased benefits. He said that if the United States
had a planned economy and traded with Soviet nations,
most of the ills of unemployment could be cured. He also
spoke briefly on repressive government acts and union
busting legislation. He said the government is applying
antitrust provisions to unions and there is a vicious
prosecution of labor leaders. He mid these acts are the
products of the cold war and reaction.
A resolution to the President and the Attorney
General was passed at this meeting which requested the
government take action against the Birmingham Police Depart.
ment for police brutality. At the muggestion of IRVING
FROMER, they had a condemnation of the government for past
inactivity to the resolution.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS
The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 43
concerning "Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":
1. "The (Communist). party's front operations in the
Southern California District today are * * * confined to four
major organizations, " which include the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms.
"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms
* * * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee
on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front
organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time, paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in a similar campaign by another front in New York City,
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
the
"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into
the nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored
a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the
very existence of the committee. Communists subpenaed as wit-
nesses were guests of honor.
"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern
California District were mobilizing Communists in the area for
participation in an intensified campaign to abolish this
committee of Congress. How the Citizens Committee to Preserve
American Freedoms served the party in this effort was revealed
by (Communist Party) District Chairman Dorothy Healey in a
report to the party's Southern California District Council on
September 21, 1958. Mrs. Healey declared that the party preferre
public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms rather than under party auspices because
Communists could attend without danger of being exposed as
members of the party. She also noted that Communists scheduled
as congressional committee witnesses could not appear beforehand
at openly Communist rallies without creating the impression
that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold informa-
tion from the committee."
(Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report
259 on the Southern California District of the
Communist Party, April 3, 1959, pp. 7 and 8.)

revolution and the 75th birthday of the Secretary of the ARI.
One of the speakers at this meeting told of his trip to New
Delhi and the Soviet Union. He said the Soviet Union, Cuba,
and China have been accused of suppressing rights, freedom,
religion and speech. He said that this was not true. These
countries do not want soap box criticisms but they respect the
broader right of the majority and sometimes individual rights
have to give way to the rights of the majority.
The guest speaker at this meeting was DMITRY MURAYEV,
who was introdused as a Cultural Attache with the Soviet
Embassy. He presented the Secretary of the ARI with a gold
watch and read a prepared speech. He said Russia wants peace
and that the U.S. and Russia fought together during the war
and still can be friends but Mazi elements in Germany are
being supported by the U.S. Government. He said Russia would
disarm if disarmament could be agreed upon but now the U.S.
has rearmed (Jermany and they have the second largest army in
Europe with rockets, tanks, and atomic weapons. He said the
Russians are ready to defend their homeland against the Germanın
and felt that they had to do something to dramatize their
readiness to defend themselves so they resumed atomic testing.

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS
The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 43
concerning Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":
71
1. "The (Communist) party's front operations in the
Southern California District today are * * * confined to four
major organizations, which include the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms.
* *
*
11
"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms
specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee
on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front
organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time, paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in a similar campaign by another front in New York City,
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
the
"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into the
nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored
a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very
existence of the committee. Communists subpoenaed as witnesses
were guests of honor.
"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California
District were mobilizing Communists in the area for participation
in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.
How the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms served the
party in this effort was revealed by (Communist Party) District
Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the party's Southern Californi:
District Council on September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY declared that th
party preferred public protest meetings to be held by the Citizens
Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather than under party
auspices because Communists could attend without danger of being
exposed as members of the party. She also noted that Communists
scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not appear
beforehand at openly Communist rallies without creating the im-
pression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold
information from the committee. "
(Committee on Un-American Activities,
House Report 259 on the Southern
California District of the Communist
Party, April 3, 1959, pp. 7 and 8.)

II. COMMUNIST PARTY (CP) AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
A. Communist Activities
The Subject attended a May Day meeting held at
150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, which was sponsored
by the San Francisco Free Speech Forum on May 2, 1964.
The San Francisco Free Speech Forum is
a name used by the CP of San Francisco
to hold public meetings.
STEVE MURDOCK, editor of the "PW" reviewed the
activities of the "PW" for the past year and pointed out
that the "PW" offered its readers news from the view-
point of the working class and Negro people and really had
something to offer and this had enabled it to survive.
ROSCOE PROCTOR also spoke on the problems of
the Negro people in the capitalistic society and noted
that only socialism offered the Negro any chance of solving
his problems. PROCTOR said that the President's War
Against Poverty" was simply a political scheme to attract
votes.

The featured speaker was ROBERT THOMPSON, a men-
ber of the CP Committee, who discussed the split between
the Soviet Union and China and said that it would soon be
healed over. THOMPSON told the audience that they should
support the Democratic Administration while at the same
time put pressure on the Democratic Party to end defacto
segregation in schools throughout the country. THOMPSON
noted that public school systems would have to be integra-
ted in order to survive.

A characterization of the NG is contained

On February 8, 1964, the Subject attended a
public meeting sponsored by the NG held at 625 Polk
Street, San Francisco. The featured speaker at this
meeting was MARK LANE, an attorney for the mother of
LEE HARVEY OSWALD.
LANE discussed the background of the assassi-
nation of President KENNEDY and stressed the fact that
Dallas was a very reactionary city and for that reason
it is easy to understand why Dallas had been selected as
the place for the President to be assassinated. LANE
discussed briefly the background of LEE HARVEY OSWALD
and noted that he was a drifter without any ties who had
spent some time in the Soviet Union. LANE tried to es-
tablish a link between OSWALD and the FBI and indicated
that OSWALD was the victim of a frameup. He said he had
a reputation of being an unstable character and a past
association with left-wing groups. LANE said that in
spite of this he did not believe that OSWALD was the
actual assassin of the President.

On September 25, 1964, the Subject attended a
public meeting sponsored by the San Francisco FSF held
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco. The purpose of
this meeting was to hear HENRY WINSTON, a member of the
CP National Committee, speak.
WINSTON identified himself as a communist and
told of his imprisonment by the Federal Government. He
said that because the government would not treat him for
his illness, he became blind. He said the reason for the
government's refusal to treat him was because he was a
Negro and a communist.
WINSTON pointed out that the Republican Party
must be defeated even though he did not completely approve
of President JOHNSON and the Democratic Party. WINSTON
also discussed the civil rights movement and said that the
Negro must get his rights before everything in this
country would be all right.

DOROTHY HEALEY generally agreed with HALLINAN
but pointed out the Communist Party's specific obligation
to the working class to provide good leadership. She
said the CP had only one chance of acting as a vanguard
of the working class and that was to be right in its sup-
port of political candidates. HEALEY also said the people
should support the Supreme Court and particularly the Court's
recent decision to reapportion state legislature.
JOHN BURTON said this was the first election in
which he felt free to accept support from the left openly
and he attributed this to a determination on the part of
the general public to defeat BARRY GOLDWATER. He praised
the DuBois Club for supporting him and he thanked the per-
sons on the left including the Socialist Workers Party,
the CP and others for their support.

such areas as Cuba, Vietnam, the Soviet Union and Chine.
He said that all of these countries are socialist camps
of one form or another and all are working for peace.
AL RICHMOND, the editor of the "PW", took the
position that peaceful co-existence was a possible way
to make some progress for peace without changing the
economy of the country.
One of the other panel members spoke in support
of peace but not in favor of any kind of violence. He
pointed out that the left wingers comprising the CF, the
Trotskyite Party, and the Progressive Labor Party looked
toward revolution as an alternative for peace; however,
he did not think that peace would ever be won by revolus
tion.

On October 16, 1964, the Subject attended a
panel discussion sponsored by the DuBois Club held at
625 Polk Street, San Francisco. The three panel members
were DOROTHY HEALEY, Chairman of the Southern California
CP, VINCENT HALLINAN, a San Francisco attorney, and JOHN
BURTON, a California State Assemblyman.
The Subject of the discussion was on the forth-
coming election and what part progressive forces should
play in the election.
VINCENT HALLINAN took a strong pro-Democratic
Party attitude and pointed out that he, himself, had cam-
paigned on a national ticket for a minority party and the
result had been disastrous. He said they had wasted their
time and money and energy and polled so few votes that he
did not receive even one electoral vote. He stressed the
fact that the Republican forces represented a step toward
fascism and that at all costs, all decent people and all
good left-wing people must vote the Democratic slate.

On March 1, 1964, the Subject was one of 123
persons arrested picketing the Sheraton-Palace Hotel in
San Francisco for alleged discriminatory practices. The
123 pickets who were arrested were charged with contempt

HOLLAND ROBERTS, President of the ARI, spoke
about the great work being done by the USSR and the
Soviet bloc for peace. ROBERTS said he always is in-
spired when he visits these countries and hears of their
achievements to bring about peace and he is always dis-
appointed on returning to the United States to find the
war mongers holding the upper hand and keeping the people
obsessed with the idea that they have to stay prepared
for war against the communists. ROBERTS said the United
States was constantly on the side of the landlords and
money lenders of small countries throughout the world
such as South Vietnam. He said these people only aspire
justice for themselves and an opportunity to live in
peace and comfort. However, they are ground down ruth-
lessly by native oppressors with the help of American
troops and American support.
CARL BLOICE, a reporter for the "PW", also
told of a recent trip he made to Eastern Europe. He
said he found the East Germans consecrated to the task
of being a socialist nation and cooperating fully with
the Soviet Union. BLOICE said that East Germans now
claim that America has succeeded to the position once
held by fascist Germany of being the most reactionary
and most militant country on earth. BLOICE said that
communist nations now were in a position to defeat any
non-communist countries in the event of military attack
but he said this was the poorest way he could think of
to bring about communism and he would prefer to see non-
communist nations become communist through the means of
logic.

the registration provisions of the McCarran Act. After the
skit, MICKEY LIMA was introduced as Chairman of the Northern
California District of the CP, who would present his views on

the CP in good conscience could not and would not register
because to do so would violate the law of self-incrimination.
If the CP registered, they would admit to being spies,
saboteurs, and agents of a foreign power.
LIMA Baid that the CP is leading the fight for
freedom. If the present trend continues, the Government can
later attack the labor unions and the National Association

party in the Government will be able to get any group they

held at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, on January 24,

of the purpose of the CCCL and the purpose of the meeting.
He mentioned that the Bill of Rights is under attack and that
the military forces are controlling the Government and the
press and that civil rights are being repressed. He said that
these things are of concern to the Committee and they have
asked GUS HALL to present his views of the current situation.
HALL then spoke and said that he is presently on a
lecture tour all over the country presenting the views of the
CP. He mentioned that he had requests to speak at schools all
over the United States. He said that the CP is being prevented
by law and by control of the press from expressing their views
and that they only want the right of free speech which is being
denied them.
HALL said that at a recent press conference he was
asked to give his position in the Party both now and prior to
June 6, 1961. He told the press at that time that he could be
referred to as an authoritative spokesman for communism.

W.E.B. DU BOIS CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO,
aka DuBois Youth Group, San Francisco
DuBois Club, San Francisco DuBois
Youth Group, Student-Labor Alliance
A source advised that on January 31, 1963, the W.E.B.
DuBois Club of San Francisco held its first general meeting
at California Hall, Polk and Turk Streets, San Francisco,
California, at which time the aims of the club were put forth
as follows by TERENCE "KAYO" HALLINAN:

(2)
(3)
Alleviate the Negro problem in the United States.
Promote peaceful co-existence between the United
States and Russia.
Promote and encourage Marxist doctrines and to
bring about a socialistic government in the
United States.
A second source advised in March 1963 that the DuBois
Club was both conceived and originated by TERENCE HALLINAN.
A third source has advised that TERENCE HALLINAN
attended a Communist Party Youth Commission
meeting in San Francisco in October 1963.
Commencing in March 1963, the DuBois Club published
a newsletter entitled "San Francisco News and World Report."
In its first issue a "Proposed Statement of Principles" was set
forth in which the club's aforementioned aims were elaborated
upon. In the same issue the lead editorial in part described the
San Francisco DuBois Club as "...a group of young people who
are convinced that Sociaism is the only answer to the many problems
of our time and so find philosophical rapport with the life nd
thought of Dr. DU BOIS, nevertheless, we are weighed with humility
in comparing our goals and ambitions with the genius of his life
and work. As a source of inspiration, the figure of W.E.B. DU BOIS
is unequaled in American history, but as a standard and example,
we seem miserably lost in his shadow. We can only resolve that
we do his name no dishonor, and whatever we may accomplish should
be recognized as a supplement to his life work."

"People's World," a West Coast communist
newspaper published in San Francisco,

that W.E.B. DU BOIS joined the Communist
Party after applying for admission on
October 1, 1961.
In May 1963, the first source informed that the
"San Francisco News and World Report," although written and
edited by members of the club, was run off on a mimeograph
machine located in the offices of the "People's World%;" however,
in March 1964, this source advised that the newsletter was no
longer mimeographed by the "People's World" because of the
unreliability of the machine and, in addition, the name was
changed to "The Insurgent" upon recommendation of one of the
club officers who felt the new name sounded more militant.
The first source has also stated that commencing in
May 1963, the DuBois Club had no permanent headquarters and
used to hold its meetings at 307 Page Street, Apartment 3,
San Francisco, California. In March 1964, this source advised
that the club is currently active as a membership organization
and has its headquarters at 1007 McAllister Street, San Francisco.

INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY
The 1955 Peport of the California Committee on
Un-American Activities, Page 46, stated, "The Independent
Progressive Party in California was quickly captured by the
communists, and by the time the Wallace for President campaign
had swung into high gear was being operated lock, stock, and
barrel by the Communist Party of California. Time after time
the committee in questioning witnesses throughout the State
discovered that the leaders of the Communist Parties in various
localities were identical with the leaders of the Independent
Progressive Party in the same area. It is true, of course,
that in the Independent Progressive Party there were many
sincere liberals who, because of dissatisfaction with the two
major political organizations registered as Independent
Progressives and continued their affiliation until the true
control of the I.P.P. became obvious. These people invariably
resigned, many of them having given the benefit of their
experience to various official agencies interested in the
exposure of subversive activities.

JOHN THOMAS attended meetings of the DuBois
Club of San Francisco on May 10 and 31, 1964.
When interviewed by Special Agents of the FBI
on October 1, 1964, THOMAS indicated he was
not a member of the W.E.B. DuBois Club and
would not join any group until he found one
that really helped the Negro people.
BEVERLY RADCLIFFE in April, 1964, was a member
of the DuBois Club of San Francisco.
MARGARET DRIGGS, when interviewed by Special
Agents of the FBI on January 25, 1955, said
that her activities in the Communist Party (CP)
began in the middle 1930s during the depression
in Tacoma, Washington. She and her husband
moved to Seattle, Washington, and were members
there of the CP and the Communist Political
Association (CPA). As a result of open criticism
of Party functionaries on her part and on the
part of her husband, she and her husband were
expelled from the CP in 1946 with the proviso
that after six months they would reinstate.
She said that they did not seek reinstatement.
The CPA has been designated by the Attorney General
of the United States pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

supposed to register. He has been indicted already and is
under possible sentence of 500 years in jail and $1,000,000
Pine. HALL went on to say that he went to jail under the
Smith Act and that for thirty years the Government has tried
to prove that the CP has been advocating the violent
overthrow of the Government and that all commmists are agents
of a foreign power and are espionage agents etc. but has failed
to do so.
According to HALL, the McCarran Act came into
being during the McCarthy era when the Administration was
being pressured to prosecute communists. The Attorney General
said the Government couldn't prosecute them as they did not
have the necessary evidence. Congress decided to get around
courts by legislative enactment. They appointed a political
committee and presented a lot of illegal and unconstitutional
evidence and came up with a finding that the communits are
agents of a foreign power and spies and saboteurs.
HALL said that, according to the Attorney General,
the present Act is simply a registration statute similar to
registrations of foreigners, voters, dealers in securities, etc.
However, a recent decision of the Supreme Court held that it
is not necessary to be a card carrying member of the CP or do
an act which is generally attributed to communists but it is
only necessary to have a state of mind and be in sympathy
with any of the objectives of commism and you could be
prosecuted under the law.
HALL said assuming he did register, he would have
to register each official and member of the Party and if he
didn't, they would be required to register or be liable to
$10,000 fine and ten years imprisonment for each day they
failed to register. He would also be required to register any
commmmist organization or any association or organization that
has affiliation with the CP. He must also list every typewriter,
mimeograph machine, photostat machine, and printing press by
serial amber. HALL said that you can begin to see the
diabolical threat of fascism which is begiming to become real.
He said that in addition to these penalties, he can receive
the death penalty in Texas, a life sentence in other states
and sentences of 20 to 50 years in other states. He is also
prohibited from obtaining Veterans or Goverment housing,
employment in the teaching profession, from making movies in

COMMITTEE TO END U. S. FOREIGN INTERVENTION, aka
Committee to End U. S. Foreign Aggression,
Committee to End American Intervention in
Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc),
Committee to End United States Intervention
in Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc),
Committee to End United States Imperialism
This Committee was organized as the Committee to End
American Intervention in Viet-Nam (Ad Hoc), March 29, 1964, in
San Francisco, California, at the instigation of and by members
of the W.E.B. DuBois Club of San Francisco, a Marxist youth group,
which has promoted the organization's activities among the various
groups in the San Francisco area interested in peace and disarma-
ment. Its announced aims have included American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam, self-determination for the South Viet-Namese people and
adherence of the United States to the 1954 Geneva Convention.
Demonstrations along with the distribution of and exhibition of
propaganda comprise its program. A flyer advertising a forum of
September 15, 1964, in San Francisco on "World Wide Movements--
for Freedom" referred to "Cuba Harlem Congo - Viet Nam" and
listed the Committee to End U. S. Foreign Intervention as sponsor.
One of the two sources which provided the information on the
Committee's organization has advised that it is the same committee.
According to this source, on October 9, 1964, this Committee's
proper name is "Committee to End U. S. Foreign Aggression," but it
is a loose-knit organization and exactness of title or name is of
little concern to the officials and members. The other source
advised on June 28, 1964, that an Executive Committee of five
members was elected in June, 1964, but no new officers were other-
wise elected.
-
Another source advised on September 17, 1964, that the
original officers were JOHN W. THOMAS, Chairman; BEVERLY D.
RADCLIFFE, Treasurer, and MARGARET DRIGGS, Secretary. The
signature of two of these are still required for checks written.
One source mentioned above currently advises that no
headquarters is maintained by the Committee; meetings are infrequent
and poorly attended, ranging from eight to twenty members.
reported membership total was approximately twenty in June, 196.4.

A. Communist Party
When contacted in March, 1906, confidential
informants who are conversant with various phases of
activities of the CP in the area of San Francisco in which
Subject resides were unable to furnish any information
reflecting that Subject has been active in the CP during
the past year.
Subject, however, was in attendance at the annual
May Day meeting sponsored by the San Francisco Free Speech
Forum held at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, on
May 1, 1965.
The San Francisco Free Speech Forum is
a name used by the San Francisco County
CP to sponsor public meetings.
The principal speaker at this meeting was GUS
HALL, General Secretary of the CP, USA. HALL accused the
administration of President JOHNSON of being dangerous and
trigger happy, stating that our foreign policy is a cold-
blooded war machine which would turn back history. HALL
stated that Marines had been sent to the Dominican Republic
on the pretext of protecting American lives. He alluded to
the U. S. foreign policy as being imperialistic and said
that the President is not receiving full support for his
invasion of other countries and the U. 8. will never be
successful in these undertakings.

WOMEN FOR PEACE, aka
Women Strike for Peace
:
"
The "Berkeley Daily Gazette,' a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,
evening edition reflecting that in November, 1961,
when concern mounted over radioactive fallout
from nuclear testing, a group of women in
Washington, D. C. started Women Strike for Peace.
The idea spread rapidly throughout the country
and now embraces 900 groups, including Women For
Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.
These groups support programs to achieve goals
such as:
(1)
(2)
(3)
Continued disarmament negotiations.
A strong and flexible United Nations.
Planning now at state and national levels
for conversion to peace-time economy and
positive efforts to ease world tensions.
The women act as individuals and as
a group, with
specific actions suggested by individuals and
groups from all over the world. Decision to
participate jointly on any given suggestion is
democratly arrived at by members of the
Coordinating Committee. Effective cooperation
with other peace groups is encouraged. Monthly
Coordinating Committee meetings and general
meetings, as warranted, are open to all and
announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for
membership.
To stir an awareness of the need for peace,
Women For Peace encourage public education in
peace obiectives at local schools and sponsor
Deace-oriented demonstrations and public meetings,
newspaper ads, billboards, and candidates for
public office. On the national level the group
attempts to influence government officials by
letters and conferences.

VIETNAM DAY COMMITTEE (VDC)
A booklet published by the VDC contained the
following policy statement of the VDC adopted
by the general membership, June, 1965:
The Vietnam Day Committee is a group of students,
faculty and other members of the Bay area
community opposed to American intervention in
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and wherever
else it may occur. Revolutionary struggles
for self-determination are sweeping the world
today. American suppression of these move-
ments, we believe. is immoral and a threat to
the peace of the world. The Vietnam Day
Committee is organizing non-violent direct
actions, teach-ins, door-to-door organizing
and other educational activities to oppose
American intervention. We believe that the
struggle for self-determination in other
countries is related to the struggle for
democracy in America--a democracy in which the
people have the facts and the power to make
decisions for themselves. The struggles in
America against racism, poverty, and bureau-
cratic conformity are part of the same move-
ment as the struggle against American militarism.
We must build a New America and join with those
people in Asia, Africa and Latin America building
a New World.

HAIL said that California has more native right-wing

He said that is how Nazism came about and they won't stop with

such an onslaught is because a different social system
is overtaking capitalism and many of the older people find
it difficult to accept the new philosophy of life and they oppose

CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE AMERICAN FREEDOMS
The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,
revised and published December 1, 1961, prepared and released
by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United States
House of Representatives, contains the following on Page 43
concerning "Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms":
1. "The (Communist) party's front operations in the
Southern California District today are *** confined to four
major organizations, "which include the Citizens Committee to
Preserve American Freedoms.
"The Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms
** * specializes in propaganda aimed at abolishing the Committee
on Un-American Activities and discrediting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. Created in Los Angeles in 1952, the front
organization is run by Frank Wilkinson, an identified Communist
who recently resumed the full-time paid post of executive
secretary after approximately a year's leave of absence to assist
in similar campaign by another front in New York City, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
"When the Committee on Un-American Activities held
hearings in Los Angeles September 2-5, 1958, to inquire into the
nature of the party's recent reorganization in California,
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms sponsored
a series of public meetings to protest the hearings and the very
existence of the committee. Communists subpoenaed as witnesses
were guests of honor.
"At this time, leaders of the party's Southern California
District were mobilizing Communists in the area for participation
in an intensified campaign to abolish this committee of Congress.
How the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms served the
Party in this effort was revealed by (Communist Party) District
Chairman Dorothy Healey in a report to the Party's Southern
California District Council on September 21, 1958. Mrs. HEALEY de-
clared that the party preferred public protest meetings to be held by
the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms rather than
under party auspices because Communists could attend without danger
of being exposed as members of the party. She also noted that
Communists scheduled as congressional committee witnesses could not
appear beforehand at openly Communist rallies without creating the
impression that the party was conspiring with witnesses to withhold
information from the committee. "
