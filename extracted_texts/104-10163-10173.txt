SUBJECT:
Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School
of Business

"

1. On 15 July 1965, with Mr. Andy Croce of CA Staff,
I met Mr. Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss
what he knew about the relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop
McGrath of Panama, and a rural development program they are...
all working on in Panama. Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath
as a real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of
U. S. parents in the Canal Zone but he has taken Panama
citzenship. He graduated from Notre Dame University, did
graduate work in Rome and has taught in several European
_ and Latin American universities, such as in Chile. He is
one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America
and has extremely close ties with the Vatican, e.g., he
on the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group.
has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he
augments from every conceivable source, particularly from the
German bishops. He is politically and operationally minded,
an American completely in his attitude and behavior, a
typical Irish politician, Mr. Lodge submitted somewhat
wryly. His parents are retired and live in Miami where he
visits often. He recently met AMBIDDY-1 there on two occasions.
On this same visit he also met the Papal Nuncio from Santo
Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potato type
assignments in his part of the world).

2. Veraguas Province of Panama is a selected testing
ground for community development programs in rural areas.
It is the poorest and most hopeless province of Panama, a
small armed uprising took place there in 1958 and was put
down. The Communists have their best organization in Panama
In this province. The program there is based on the village
of San Francisco, about 10 miles off the highway, and is an
expansion of the efforts of the parish priest Father VASQUEZ

this one. They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders
in remote areas for future operations in those areas.
Incidental to these major objectives, they are also helping
to develop the economy of Veraguas, to develop production,
transport to markets, credit facilities, and in general to
help alleviate grievances which the Communists have exploited
in the past.

5. Bishop McGrath has arranged with ANBIDDY-1 for about
six of AMBIDDY-1's people to attend the January 1966 training
course, with 3 or 4 to remain on the staff. Hopefully, one
of them will develop into the executive director of the
center. It was agreed that the first man will not be too
closely associated in the public eye with AMBIDDY-1 in order
to try to forestall initial bad publicity from opposition
AMBIDDY-1 and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore,
elements.
that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who is well known as a long-time
adherent of AMBIDDY-1 from 1958-59 Comandos Rurales days
in Oriente) would not be assigned to the Panama center at
this time. AMBIDDY-1 told Bishop McGrath that he would try
to obtain sufficient funds to support the men assigned to the
center. He has not yet brought up this matter with his case

intended that the Cubans would continue to cooperation in the
program, eventually working them into the field wherever they
are needed and acceptable.

Pinto who has been thereabout 10 years. He is a dynamic
young man who has lead the villagers to rebuild their village
and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative
and small credit facilities. The village is only 1,200
people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials
and then built a training center capable of housing, feeding
and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural
development. One of their ideas is to select bright looking
leaders and potential leaders from rural areas, first in
Panama and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries
for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash
them of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and
show them what can actually be done so they can take the
good word with them to their own communities. This is in
addition to the regular formal course of 4 months for
selected young potential leaders from rural communities in
Panama and all over Latin America.
.
3. Another leading light in the program is Father
Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for
organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on
the subject. Father Steele uses Veraguas as a home base
but travels to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting
short training courses on the ground. There are some Dutch
priests on the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited.
Father Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys to
the Antigonish School in Nova Scotia and they are back for
duty. Mr. Lodge describes the group as a highly motivated
and energetic group and Father Vasquez Pinto as a young and
effective Panamanian priest who is a good operator. Mr. Lodge
has two men from Harvard University there to study the
program and assist in any way they can. The Peace Corps has
54 people in the Central Provinces of Panama, about 30 of
them in Veraguas Province. They cooperate with the center,
in fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each of the
Peace Corps volunteers about their work. Mr. Lodge said they
are coming up with some good information and ideas which other-
wise would be lost as there is a good deal of experience
among the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize
its significance or how to organize it into useable form.
The above group is trying to organize the center as a
viable base with an effective staff to continue the training
program even if the present leaders should move on. They
hope it will become a pilot program for Latin America and
that they will be able to seed other similar programa from

1. On 29 July 1965 I discussed Subject with Major Lupton
of Detachment "A" of ACSI Headquarters. In response to my
direct questions Major Lupton stated the following:
ACSI is not using subject but they have been
sidering such use.
Subject is not working in Bolivia or anywhere a
Helse for ACSI or any other Defense Department component that
Major Lupton is aware of.
ACBI was unaware that subject had been designating
himself as sort of public relations representative and press
in behalf of General BARRIENTOS.
3. I stated to Major Lupton that we held a poor opinion
of subject, regarded him as an opportunist, and a posible
candidate for "bus'n" action. Furthermore we were concerned
about his alleged press activities in behalf of BARRIENTOS
and felt if he wore in anyway connected with a United States
Intelligence agency and this became known, it could have an
adverse affect on the extremely delicate political situation
which now exists in that country and very well place the U.B.
Government in an embarrassing position with respect to the
Bolivian Government. Based on our views regarding subject I
told Kajor mmpton that we would not coordinate any operational
proposal ACSI might put forward aimed at using subject's
services.
3. Major Lupton took the above in good grace and asked
if it were possible for us to provide him with any information
concerning subject's background and other details which would

LACS - tend to affect the latters' morale
and confidence in KUBARK because the AMLILACS believe that
anything AMBIDDY-1 does is done with KUBARK support and blessing.
As Headquarters is aware the great fear of the AMLILACS is that
AMBIDDY-1 will get all the action and all the glory. However,
in view of the current KUBARK/AMBIDIT-1 relationship the
AMLILACS have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis is not
expected to arise. On the other hand, if AMBIDDY-l were to
re-activate part of his action force and conduct a raid utilizing
non-KÜBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then
be very difficult to convince the AMLILACS that KUBARK was not
involved and their morale and confidence would be badly shaken.
This situation is brought to your attention simply to show what
effect such AMBIDDY-1 activities would have on this Station's
painstaking efforts to retain a superior and experienced commando
capability under already difficult psychological conditions.

1. In late July 1965 members of the AMLILAC Group re-
ported the following information as a result of their contacts
with various members of AMYUM located in the JMWAVE area..
A. AMBIDDY-1 has a warehouse in the WAVE area in
which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central
American base. The equipment includes UDT gear, boat motors,

last year.
c. AMLILAC-8, a former AMLILAC who was fired a
couple of years ago and who has been with AMBIDDY-1's group
since then, war, in the local area recently and told AMLILAC-6
that A-8 was the caretaker at one of the Bases in Central
America along with 9 other men. He stated that they had all
the weapons from the last effort and were preparing the camp
for re-activation. AMBIDDY-1 told A-8 that $500,000. was
available for the reactivation.
2. The penchant of PBRUMEN exiles for exaggeration,
embellishments, and contortion of information (as can be
seen from para 1 B, and C) continues to plague the remnants
of AMWORLD and as a consequence gives rise to jealous fears
on the part of the AHLILAC Group particularly as to the real
state of AMWORLD. Such reports as those above and others when

ESIRE-1's comment, about a nossibility that the PABONN
brothers may be the persons interested in purchasing the AETORLD
arms, ties in with the AMCRAG-1 information reported in
Reference B that Teofilo BABUN, Luis Pumberto VIDANA Guasch,
EMBARB-1 were acting as go-betweens for General IMBERT's junta
in the Dominican Republic and the recruiting of Cuban exiles in
Kiani.
On 30 July 1965 ANOT-14 reported in DD-1532 that AMLINT-1
had been in a local restaurant where he overheard a conversation
between Alfredo BORGES Caignet (201-347593), now Immigration
Secretary for ANWORLD, and Jose Luis SOSA Sancio (201-746587).
BORGES told SOSA: "Be ready to go back to the place where you
were before, because you will have to leave for there in the
first four or five days of August. AMWORLD will function in
the same manner as previously, but with more independence.'
BORGES also commented to SOSA that AMBIDDY-1 is the current.

to bring un again the case of the the death of her husband,
Roberto TRUJILLO Rodrigues, who died in the AMWORLD training campe
which were under the direction of AMBIDDY-1. According to
ANTAUP-1, TUDELA plans to blame KUBARK for the death of her husband.
TUDELA claims details of her husband's death which she has in ber
session will substantiate this accusation.
3. ANTAUP-1 also says that TUDELA is preparing to make an
attempt on the life of AMBIDDY-1. She is receiving information
from persons close to AMBIDDY-1 on all AMBIDDY-1's movements and
is looking for a silencer to out on the gun she will use in this
attack. ANTAUP-1 reports that he has attempted to calm TUDELA. down
and in trying to persuade her to give up the idea or attacking
AMBIDDY-1.
ANTAUP-2 commented that ANTAUP-1 boasts that he is the
one who obtained the information and proof against AMWORLD and
KUBARK in the death of TRUJILLO and that he has this proof in his
possession. ANTAUP-2 believes that it was ANTAUP-1 who steered
TUDEL accusations from AMWORLD. towards KUBARK.

chickens. AMBIDDY-1 has also purchased an off-set printing press,
for $10,000 according to him, which is set up a few blocks away.
He plans to use it to print the AMYUM magazine, plus hopefully
making some profit for AMYUM from it on commercial printing jobs.
2. ANJAVA-4 and AMBIDOY-1 both laughed heartily at the idea
that the PC of BABUN could be converted to a mothership. This
was considered and rejected several months ago when AMWORLD was
still authorized to operate. They turned down the offer of the
ship as a gift them on grounds that it would be uneconomical even
if given to them free of charge.

3. AMBIDDY-1 said he did have a total of ten men in Nicaragua;,
five at Monkey Point guarding a cache of small arms and teaching the
local Indians to read, write and grow rice; three men at Bluefields
guarding a cache of small arms and working to develop a small boat
yard for repair and maintenance of shrimp boats from which AMBIDDY-1
hopes to build a fishing cooperative; and two men at Managua with
a smaller cache of small arms, one of whom is the AMYUM delegato
to the Nicaraguan Government. AMBIDDY-1 kept about 150 small arms,
with the knowledge and consent of HQS, in return for his giving back:

the small arms from AMWORLD. He clains that all three caches in.

made to seize then. AMBILLY-1 said hehad either plans nor money
to reactivate any bases, except as they might be used for la:al
civic action type programs.
4. AMBIDDT-1 was advised by his case officer in strongest
terms to sell or throw away ever, thing from the Central American
camps, to concentrate on trying to project a new image of himself
as a constructive and progressive leader involved in community
development and civic action type programs in Latin America by
invitation of the local governments, and to stop talking or acting
as a paramilitary operator. He was advised in ever stronger terms
to get out of the NAVE area as soon as possible to remove himself
as a target of constant personal attacks against which he could:
not defend himself. He agreed in principle, subject to waiting
three months for his wife to deliver their first child.
5. VAVE may assure the AHLILAC leader that, to the best
knowledge of KUBARK, the AMWORLD program is dead, that AMBIDDY-1
has no real intention and only limited capability of mounting.
raids, and that anything he might do along the lines of paramilitary
action would certainly be without ODYOKK support or blessing given
the present political climate in HQS area.
6. FYI, HQ8 continues to try to influence AMBIDDY-1 to stay
out of paramilitary matters entirely. To this end, we shall try"
to keep his top operational personnel otherwise occupied in KUBARK
or other employment, to keep him as fully and usefully occupied as
possible away from the WAVE and PBRUMEN area, and to convince him
to sell or lease his two Swift boats to commercial enterprises
to another KUBARK program outside the WAVE area.

7. HQS will welcome continued reporting on AMBIDDY–1's
activities from WAVE sources, which serves a useful purpose as
check and monitor for the case officer to compare and contrast
with AMBIDDY-1's reports to him. In addition, we are recruiting
the former AMWORLD Deputy for Support and Administration, who also
serves as legal and political advisor to AMBIDDY-1. He is now
residing in the HQS area, is back on the staff of a large university
and has agreed to assist in keeping AMBIDDY-1 on the straight and nar
row path following the lines of paragraphs 4 and 6 above.

AMBIDDY/1
-
23 August 1965
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussions with General Anastasio
SOMOZA, President SCHICK and other Nicaraguan
officials, 24 Jul-20 Aug 1965.
1. A/1 first met with General SOMOZA 27/28 July.·
The following points were made in these discussions:
a. General SOMOZA said the State Department is
making an investigation of how much money he is using to control
the government and win the next presidential elections. SOMOZA
told A/1 that he intended to run and fully expected to win the
election, but would not need to buy any votes. He asked A/1 to
please tell "Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they
really want to know anything they should call on the Agency, or
the FBI, either of which is much more effective. SOMOZA said
everybody in Managua knows about State's efforts to block his
"candidacy and are laughing at them.
b. SOMOZA said he was meeting Daniel ODUBER of
Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they would make a "non-
aggression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble for
the other's campaign for election to Presidency. ODUBER had
asked for the interview. SOMOZA told A/1 that he thought
ODUBER had made a "live and let live" agreement with the Com-
munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUBER
a public denunciation of the Communists to be followed by
effective control measures. against them.
0. The MRR will be allowed to build and operate
a mtall boatyard for construction, maintenance and repair of
shrimp boats at Bluefields without SOMOZA or the Nicaraguan
Government to be cut into the proceeds. This is part of A/1's
community development program, aimed at developing a large
fishing cooperative based on Bluefields which will be self-
sustaining and profitable for the members and the local economy.
SOMOZA also approved continuation of the basic education
program being conducted by Al's five man contingent at the old
Monkey Point base and eventual development of that area as a rice-
growing cooperative for the benefit of the local Indians.

to talk directly with VAUGHN and other U. S. officials to get
the picture cleared up. A/1 said, "Let's try to get along
with the Norteamericans, it's better to have them with us
than against us." SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his
brother, Luis SOMOZA, ahead.
}
h. The following day, 19 Aug, General SOMOZA
called A/1 and said Luis had called him, reporting he had
talked to Vaughn in Miami. Said Vaughn had denied talking to
Sydney ROSS or of passing such information to the Ambassador
in Panama. Luis said he dropped the subject at that point and
talked about other things. (A/1 believes Luis could be
fabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview if
it did take place.) A/1 again strongly recommended that General
SOMOZA make his own visit to Washington and talk to Vaughn and
others in person.
4. On 19 August, A/1 interviewed President SCHICK
for the Tridente (MRR news magazine). He had previously
interviewed General SOMOZA. The interview reports will be
relatively innocuous coverage of some of the major events of
the day. The agenda of points for each interview is attached.
A/1 intends to dedicate an issue of Tridente to each country
which has helped the MRR, e.g. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, a
Venezuela, and Colombia.

d. General SOMOZA, at A/1's strong recommendation,
agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National
Guard in an effort to enhance his personal image preparatory to
the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked A/1 to assist and
advise in this effort.
3.
The next meeting with General SOMOZA by A/1 was
on 4 August, with following points:
a. SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel
CASTRO is targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.
Part of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of
the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften
them up.
He said that in Panama, particularly, President
Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting
a recent turn against him by the National Guard because he has
cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges. If
ROBLES is eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief
of the National Guard will take over and they thinking they.
can handle him more easily than they can ROBLES.
b. Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a
close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the top
Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu) FONSECA,
a Nicaraguan now living in Mexico. FONSECA is a bastard son of
one of SOMOZA's foremen, a Communist, and an agent working.
directly under order of Fidel CASTRO.
;
0. A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic
Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would
support it. He will assign Father LUGO, a Cuban priest who
served with the Bay of Pigs forces, to a position similar to a
chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the program.
SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with
whatever authorizations are required and with whatever official
or personal prestige he may offer.
3..
A/1 next returned to Managua on 17 August and met
with Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service, a personal aide
to the General. PEREZ said SOMOZA was very angry (not at A/1 or
his people) and difficult to see. He said 3 Colonels were under
Arrest for 3 days each for disobeying orders. PEREZ was afraid
to see SOMOZA for fear he might be arrested also. However, A/1
called SOMOZA by phone and was invited to visit him next day
at Tipitapa. A/1 met him the next day (18 Aug) and had lunch
with SOMOZA and (fnu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician
there who is now in business but remains in contact with and
working for the U. S. Government. After lunch, BENITEZ left

and A/1 went with SOMOZA in his car. While they were riding,
SOMOZA told A/1 why he was so angry.
.
d. A message had recently come to General
SOMOZA from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that he
had it from authoritative sources that the U. S. not only
would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would
strongly oppose it. In addition, SONOZA had word that Sydney
ROSS, Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in
New York), after a recent Interview with Asst. Secretary Jack
Vaughn of the State Department, had an off-the-record talk
with VAUGHN after the interview. VAUGHN had said that, so far
as he was concerned, SOMOZA was no different from the other
Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER,
STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or Gen. CASTELL Branco, and that he
could certainly not support installing another military dictator
in Nicaragua. The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA's
mind and made him feel extremely bad as he said he has always
talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them
at every chance.
.
e. SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador in
Nicaragua (whether in person or by sending Pres. SCHICK was
not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State
Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal
affairs and would take no action about the elections.
Ambassador said he could not believe VAUGHN could have made
such statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in
Nicaraguan affairs.
The
f. SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to
Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard
about themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc. they
might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell
Washington to go to hell.
8. He said he was going ahend with his plans
regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/1 of
Mr. J. C. KING's talk with him (SOMOZA) at the airport in
Washington to let him know after the mistimo attack on the
SIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would understand if SOMOZA .

this as an example of an attempt from Washington to dictate

A/1 made another strong suggestion that SOMOZA take off his.

Guatemala
1. On 24 July 1965, A/1 met with the son of Col.

The meeting was arranged by General MONTIEL, chief of the
Nicaraguan security service.

the Agency, and neither did he. They still think the Agency
put Luis SIERRA to work with Roberto ALEJOS to overthrow

8.3. policy or wishes are in connection with Guatemala. Col.
PERALTA is willing to do whatever he is able to do, within
reason, to neet U.S. expectations, if he only knows what they
are, but he is tired of hearing how bad things are without
concrete and constructive suggestions about how to improve
then.

A/1 tried to reassure him, telling him that he
(A/1) knew the Agency people in Guatemala very well (not true,
of course) and could guarantee it was not true that they had
supported ALEJOS or any other coup attempt. A/1 also asked
Gen. MONTIEL to try to soothe young PERALTA.
A/1 said young PERALTA Was in Managua to attend

FRON : AMBIDDY/1
SUBJECT: AMRIDDY/1 discussion with President ORLICH,
Foreign Minister ODUZER and other Costa Rican
officials, late July to mid-August 1965.
"
1. In late July, A/1 went to Costa Rica and met with
President ORLICH, telling him the MRR was out of business so far
as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer
needs bases, mone", or other support for such paramilitary
activities. A/1 described the latest MRR program to combat
CASTROFCommunist efforts in Latin America by engaging in.
community development and counter-insurgency activities. He
asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive
image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself. To
that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of them know
full well that in the whiskey smuggling scandals and coup.
attempts for which A/1 had taken the rap, not only was he not
guilty, but had been, in fact, the first one to give the warning
in both cases. In return for those past favors, he now wants
Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN
candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected)
in order to counteract the bad-mouth put on 4/1 to ODUBER by
Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGULS, and Teodore "Yo-yo" QUIROZ.
A/1
proposed to meet QDUBER: parmonally, and let him make up his
own mind. Pres. ORLICH called DUBER's office, but he was off
politickier on the coast. ORLICH then sent A/1 with Colonel
LIPPA (a good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary,
who also is a good friend of Col. LIPPA. The secretary (actually
male excistant) said everybody talks about A/1 but nobody really
knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona
ries say he in a good man, othem say he is a S. O. B. A/1
replied that was the reason he had then the trouble to come to
Bee ODUBER, that he would make his position clear` himself and
would be glad to confront any accusers if ODUBER so desired.
The secretary said they were conserned about the campaign
because the oppostion was uniting and was getting plenty of
money from big businessmen. A/1 offered to help by printing
posters, leaflets, and other campaign material if they needed
it, free of charge at his "Quality Off-Set Printing Shop". in

Miami. He also offered to help Pres. ORLICH's secretary,
Roberto MADRIZ, who may run for Deputy if he can be
convinced to ignore his shyness and reluctance to make
political si·eches.
On 8 and 9 August, A/1 was again in Costa Rica
and met with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by Roberto
MADRIX. ODURKR admitted that he knew the Cubans were not
guilty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against
them. He also appreciated A/l's previous refusals to assist
coup plotters and his help in squelching their efforts. A/1
said he told ODUBER, "I know you have been told I am a 8. O. B.
and I want you to see for yourself what I am and make up your
mind. I know the people who have so described me and would
like to meet you together with them so you can make your own
gddgement." A/1 said these opening remarks brought on
l's replies about the smuggling and coup reports.
A/1 said he gave ODUBER a quick history of th
what it has done, and what it stands for. He told
ODUPER he realized they had not been close before, but he
felt COUBER and the PLN were the best choice for Costa Rica
and therefore the MRR was prepared to support him in any way
they can, including training, men and equipment. ODUBER
asked for a specialist to do some training of his personal
security group, and to furnish some walkie-talkie radios for
then if possible. A/1. assigned Luis ARRIEURIETA Sardinas
(201-298890), a member of the MRR delegation to Costa Rica,
who is well-known and trusted by ODUBER, to full-time duty as
a security adviser and trainer. A/1 also offered to donate
one issue of Tridente, the MRR news magazine, to Costa Rica
with favorable emphasis on ODUBER, and send free copies to
Costa Rica. ODUBER also took A/1 up on his previous offer to
print posters, etc. A/1 told him that the MRR people had heard
of a Communist plot to trap ODUBER by waiting to the strategie
oment and making a widely publicised declaration that they
are supporting him completely. This would split the PLN and might
lose the election for ODUBER, thus putting in a weak or reactio-
sary group whom the Communists could control or overthnos.
ODUBER Bid he would expose this scheme and get the jump on them
by saying he doesn't want or need anything from the Communists.
A/1 offered to help him with this through Tridente..

ARTINE agreed that it would be in
nobody's interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong
hands. He was asked for ideas on disposition of the
arms and came up with the following suggestion which
appears to be an excellent one. The mothership, MV
BANTA MARIA, is in need of repairs and must go into a
shipyard. Tentative arrangements have been made to
put her in the yards at Galveston, Texas, some time
in March or April. ARTIME can order his security detail
to store the arus aboard the ship for "security" reasons
before she leaves for the yard. They will simply re-
main on board when the ship leaves and we can take
control of the ship and the weapons from that point on.

would be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract
crew supplied by Chester, Blackburn, & Roder, Inc.

One of ARTIME's senior officers would accompany
the ship as his representative, with orders to
turn over control of it and the arms upon its
arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly
documented as Customs officials, would accept
custody and Office of Logistics could recover the
weapons and any other equipment which might be
shipped by this method. The ship would then be
disposed of according to Headquarters wishes at

Vidal ESPINAL Herrero, possible CI suspect
1. Subject is a Spaniard who is believed to we
working now at the Ron Carta Vieja factory in Panama City.
He previously lived in Managua and worked for Colonel
Miguel RUIZ Herrera. (a Costa Rican sometimes employed by
General Anastasio SOMOZA) as a specialist in guerrilla
warfare.
2. About late May or early June, ESPINAL was
drinking in a Managua bar and angaged one of A/l's dele-
gation in conversation, not knowing who he was. He claimed
to have been in Guatemala recently where he had worked with
some "good people of the lower classes" in an attempt to
overthrow the Guatemalan government. He quoted at length,
and accurately, from Che GUEVARA and used examples, also
accurately, for some Fidel CASTRO operations on how to
overthrow a government. A/1's man played the part of a
leftist sympathizer to elicit from subject. Through the
Nicaraguan security service, the MRR people found out
that Col. RUIZ H. claimed subject had come to him and
presented himself as a GW expert saying he was willing to
work for him in an attempt to make a coup against the govern-
ment in Costa Rica. In early July, subject told Col. RUIZ H.
that the Costa Rican operation was taking too long and nothing
much was going on, so he was going to Panama from where he
could be called back immediately when they were ready to go in
Costa Rica. Subject had also been overheard to say in Managua
that he had a special mission to assassinate a Central American
president.
3. A/1 said the Nicaraguan service believes that
Angelini's Restaurant in Panama City is a source of false
passports for Communists. A/1 looked at the place on his
visit in Panama and found it to be in a poor section inhabited
by Communists not far from the International Hotel.

SECRET
27 August 1965
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 meeting with son of Colonel PERALTA of
Guatemala
1. On 24 July 1965, A/1 met with the son of Col.
PERALTA, at his request, at the Lido Palace Hotel in Nicaragua.
The meeting was arranged by General MONTIEL, chief of the
Nicaraguan security service.
2. Young PERALTA said that his father had no faith in
the Agency, and neither did hea. They still think the Agency
put Luis SIERRA to work with Roberto ALEJOS to overthrow
Col. PERALTA. They are not satisfied with their liaison with
the Agency or with the Embassy, and not at all clear on what
U.S. policy or wishes are in connection with Guatemala. Col.
PERALTA is willing to do whatever he is able to do, within
reason, to meet U.S. expectations, if he only knows what they
are, but he is tired of hearing how bad things are without
concrete and constructive suggestions about how to improve
then.
3. A/1 tried to reassure him, telling him that he
(A/1) knew the Agency people in Guatemala very well (not true,
of course) and could guarantee it was not true that they had
supported ALEJOS or any other coup attempt. A/1 also asked
Gen. MONTIEL to try to soothe young PERALTA.
4. A/1 said young PERALTA was in Managua to attend
meeting concerning tourism in Central America.

SUBJECT:
AMBIDDY/1
AMBIDDY/1 discussion with President ORLICH,
Foreign Minister ODUBER and other Costa Rican
officials, late July to mid-August 1965.
To
1. In late July, A/1 went to Costa Rica and met with
President ORLICH, telling him the MRR was out of business so far
as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer
needs bases, money, or other support for such paramilitary
latest MRR program to combat
activities. A/1 described the
CASTRO/Communist efforts in Latin America by engaging in
community development and counter-insurgency activities. He
asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive
image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself.
that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of them knew
full well that in the whiskey smuggling scandals and coup
attempts for which A/1 had taken the rap, not only was he not
guilty, but had been, in fact, the first one to give the warning
in both cases. In return for those past favors, he now wants
Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN
candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected)
in order to counteract the bad-mouth put on A/1 to ODUBER by
Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGULS, and Teodore "Yo-yo" QUIROZ. A/1
proposed to meet ODUBER personally, and let him make up his¨
own mind. Pres. ORLICH called ODUBER's office, but he was off

Miami. He also offered to help Pres. ORLICH's secretary,
Roberto MADRIZ, who may run for Deputy if he can be
convinced to ignore his shyness and reluctance to make
political speeches.

2. On 8 and 9 August, A/1 was again in Costa Rica
and met with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by Roberto
MADRIZ.
ODUBER admitted that he knew the Cubans were not
guilty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against
them. He also appreciated A/l's previous refusals to assist
coup plotters and his help in squelching their efforts. A/1
said he told ODUBER, "I know you have been told I am a S. O. B.
and I want you to see for yourself what I am and make up your
mind. I know the people who have so described me and would
like to meet you together with them so you can make your own
judgement." A/1 said these opening remarks brought on
ODUBER's replies about the smuggling and coup reports.
"
A/1 said he gave ODUBER a quick history of the
MRR, what it has done, and what it stands for. He told
ODUBER he realized they had not been close before, but he
felt ODUBER and the PLN were the best choice for Costa Rica.
and therefore the MRR was prepared to support him in any way

they can, including training, men and equipment.
asked for a specialist to do some training of his personal
security group, and to furnish some walkie-talkie radios for
then if possible. A/1 assigned Luis ARRIZURIETA Sardinas
(201-298890), a member of the MRR delegation to Costa Rica,
who is well-known and trusted by ODUBER, to full-time duty as
security adviser and trainer. A/1 also offered to donate
one issue of Tridente, the MRR news magazine, to Costa Rica
with favorable emphasis on ODUBER, and send free copies to
Costa Rica. ODUBER also took A/1 up on his previous offer to
A/1 told him that the MRR people had heard

of a Communist plot to trap ODUBER by waiting to the strategic
moment and making a widely publicised declaration that they
are supporting him completely. This would split the PLN and might
lose the election for DUBER, thus putting in a weak or reactio-
nary group whom the Communists could control or overthrow.
ODUBER said he would expose this scheme and get the jump on them
by saying he doesn't want or need anything from the Communists.
A/1 offered to help him with this through Tridənte.
ODUBER maid he would be a different president
that was "Chico" ORLICH and will be more independent of the

U. S., dealing directly with other countries on Costa Rican
interests instead of falling in line always with the U.S.
and the OAS. A/1 mentioned Pres. ORLICH's offer to recognize
a Government of Free Cuba if A/1 could manage to seize and
hold a piece of Cuba and declare such a government. ODUBER
agreed to honor the agreement, without committing troops,
but through his good offices in foreign affairs. He agreed to
exert moral pressure on the U.S. in behalf of such an under-
taking, if necessary, by exploiting the favorable press and
public attitude toward him in the U.S.
3. In A/l's opinion, ODUBER is not a Communist
by any stretch of the imagination, nor will he be a later
edition of "Pepe" FIGUERES. If he does take over, there will
be many problems for the U.S. in contrast to the easy-going
relationship with "Chico" ORLICH. ODUBER's personal circle
includes a strong group of violently anti-U.S. people. One
of them, according to A/l's delegation in San Jose, is (fnu)
ZUNIGA, a government official who is the Costa Rican in
charge of Alliance for Progress matters. He has been heard
to say that if ODUBER were president, no Costa Rican troops
would be sent to Santo Domingo nor would Costa Rica support
OAS decisions forced by the U.S.

it could be sticky legally and might antagonize

Aircraft.
J
(1) DC-3. ARTIME is willing to release the
aircraft back to its "owners, TASA, & CIA pro-
prietary company in Panama, However, one month's
charter payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and
another will be due by the time the aircraft can
be returned. ARTINE was reluctant to let the plane
go back without payment, but also reluctant to
squeeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer
voiced his opinion that the owner would probably
be glad to get the plane back and would not likely
think it worth going to court. However, in view
of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
transaction and would actually cost the Government
nothing, it is recommended that a special authoriza-
tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIME for payment
in order to maintain ARTIME's reputation for fiscal
probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture.
(2) 1-20 Beaver and Cessna-180. These
aircraft technically belong to ARTIME's group and
recovery would be a sticky matter, legally.
ARTIES hopes to hold control of these aircraft
for the time being, and it is recommended that
we go along with him, saving disposition arrange-
ments until later.
"
ARTIME again emphasized at the close of the meeting
that he must have soonest the March payments for families
as an absolute minimum, before he could face his people and
maintain control of them in order to insure an orderly phane-
out program.

1. Has AMBIDOY-1, who is the linchpin of AMWORLD,

our expectations? The answer to this question is a quali-
gled "yes.'
3. Not having been selected by CIA as the man most
likely to rally the best elements of the Cuban exile
community round his cause, AMBIDDY-1's disappointing showing
a political figure should come as no shock to anyone.
3. AMBIDDY-1 rever claimed that remments of his move-
inside Cubs were active or could be directed from abroad.
AMBIEDY–1's ability to enlist and organize
good activists has been successfully put to the test. Given
the extent of American help (and our methodical harassment
of competing action groups), to have accomplished less would
have been difficult to excu
help,

AMBIESY-1's personality was formed in the crucible

death and, since July 1963, headship of an unconventional
warfare mechanim supported by the United States. He is a

Telephone Conversation between AMBIDBY-1 and
Martin Ferrer
DATE : 30 June 1964 at 2130
1. I was called at home by the security officer and
informed that AMBIDDY-1 wished to speak to me. When I
returned A-l's call he mentioned that he would be leaving
for Costa Rica on 1 July. AMJAVA-4 would be remaining in
Miami for four or five days to get the new reorganization
under way.
A-1 asked if we could intercede with INS in
facilitating the departure of four or five of his men who
wish to leave for the camps. A-1 was informed that we
would be unable to take any action until the names have
been submitted to us.
A-1 asked that we assist in obtaining a visa for.
Inocencio ALONSO Ramirez who will be sent to Mexico. Alonso
will replace Pineda in the job that he was originally
going to do. A-1 would prefer that Alonso have no contacts
with any other Cuban exile organization while in Mexico.
3. A-1 stated that some of the MRR secretariats would
need at least one or two weeks to wind up their affairs
ir Miami. A-1 was advised that we realize the dismantling
of HRR in Miami could not be done over night. However, any
procrastination would be viewed as an act of bad faith.
I informed A-1 that the ADELAIDA is being insured
for $14,000 per annum. A letter of confirmation from the
Consejo would be sent shortly.

to stress or suffering misfortune, some of the obverse traits
begin to show: Uncontrollable outbursts of fury, inpulsive
reactions, peevish vindictiveness and self-pity (none of
which have been observed by us firsthand).
e. Imbued with a somewhat shallow philosophy, AMBIDDY-1..
is prone to tailor ideas to what he strives to accomplish at
any given moment and to the impression he desires to leave with
his opposites. Since he rightly views his relationship with
the Americans as crucial toward the achievement of main goal,
vis., to overthrow and succeed Castro, his pronounciamentos
usually how close to what he conceives to represent the maia
lines of american thought.
7. AMBIDOY-l's personality feeds on adulation and
face manifestations of loyalty, despite the fact that he
clains to view loyalty to his person as ephemeral and as
under continuing threat of subversion, especially by his
American allies. To the extent possible, we have attempted
to assuage his preoccupations on that score.
4444
8. In the final analysis, AMBIDDY-1 trusts only himself
and views oven his closest associates as mere pawns whose
relative value fluctuates as the chess game progrEGROS.
9. Endowed with an inquisitive and retentive mind,
AMBIDDY-1 has a remarkable knowledge of facts which in any
discussion be ably marshals and articulates.
10. AMBIDDY-1's views of things American is conditioned
his quest for a key position in the struggle to overthrow
Castro Hence, any advice is selectively accepted or (usually
tacitly) rejected, depending on whether it serves to strengthen
that position. There is, of course, nothing reprehensible
about this.
11. AMBIDDY-1 relates to his savironment in essentially
conspiratorial terms. His world is peopled with demons aká
saints, the latter frequently spitomized by CIA, the forner
by the Department of state. All Amrican moves toward him.
self and his organization are interpreted by him in those
terme.
-
19. AMBIDDY-1 probably fancies himself as an adopt
student of human behavior. Applying as a gauge his choion
of intimates and bedmates, he appears to be capable of
committing appalling blunders in his judgements of human
nature.

13. AMBIDOT-1 has permitted himself to get snared in
web finely spun by a squad of hardened veterans of Havana's
halfworld. This can be analyzed as manifestation of rank
immaturity. More difficult to explain is that AIUT-1
relinquished control over this affair to an extent where it
now threatens his life's work. In AMBIDDY-1's PRQ II w
predicted, more boldly than visel;, that he would not get
caught up in female entanglements. While we did not under-
rate the power of sex, we probably overrated AMBIDOY-1's
character and motivation.
14. In a project which may have vast consequence as
regards the security of the United States (transcending by
far its intrinsic value as an unconventional warfare
instrument) wo, of course, have to take into consideratios
the possibility that AMBIDDY-1 could be working for the
other side--either now or later. Ho view this possibility
as most unlikely, yet feel somewhat remiss in not having
paid much attention to what transpired between the landing.
at Playa Giron and the Rose Bowl ceremony. There has been
some talk about his having undergone marked personality.
shanges during that period in his life, but we actually
not know whether and, if so, to what extent his psyche
suffered damage.
18. ANBIDDY_1'm aged parents live in Cuba. He pro
fesses intense filial devotion toward his mother.
Thus,
Castro has in his power two valuable hostages. We havehad.
frank talks with AMBIDDY-1 about this subject and he
that we are not unmindful of the purpose to which
such hostages can be put. We have received no indications
that pressures have as yet been brought to bear upon AMBIDDY–1,
nor do we have any concrete reason for believing that such i
pressures would be of much avail.
16. ANBIDDT-l's intense love of country strikes se
as unfeigned. In the light of his resistance record and
feats of porenal sacrifice, we doubt whether he could
consciously bring himself to harming Cuba. His hatred of
Castro stems in the main from the latter's betrayal of the
revolution. AMBIDDY–1 frequently mentions Cuba's subvervience
to the USSR as the darkest betrayal of all, but also voices
auception to other aspects of Castro's tyrany.
17. Can we take ANBIDDY-1'm professions of faith in
democratic principles and the Constitution of 1940 at face
value? I submit that we not do me as long as we are unable

GLD Meeting in Panama, 10 July 1964
ANTWORLD
SUBJECT: Photographs of Adelaida Padros y Crus
Al
The subject of photographs' of AMBIDOT-1's mistress
vas not raised by him at this meeting. He made no
reference to Adelaida, and I did not bring up the subject.
I did get the impression on no basis in particular that
he was not concerned about the problem of Adelaida and
apparently she is settled in Managua and not causing
say problems at the moment. As the subject was not
discussed, however, I would like to state that as a
sebulous personal opinion, not as a reporting of fast.

6. After termination of the paramilitary project

The gist of the above points had been passed to
AMBIDDY-1 and AMJAVA-4 previously by Mr. Jenkins, and on
the night of 18 March he confirmed by telephone to AMJAVA-4.

to fathom the bedrock of his political convictions. I as
reluctant to accept his writings and the program of the
as a valid base for judgement in this regard. In the final
analysis, it may turn out that what animates ANBIDDY-1 in
unwavering opposition to Castro is the fact that as long
long as
Castro is "in" AMBIDOT-1 is likely to rentin "out.” That,
for purposes of justifying our support to hin, may suffice.
18. Our methods of handling AMBIDDY-1 will have

cannot be treated as a controlled agent without making
mockery of autonomy.
19. One of the benefits we have reaped from autonomy
is that the American position vis-a-vis ANFORLD and particularly.
the elements of self-interest which animate us in supporting
this project can be clearly spelled out without necessarily
jeopardizing the project.
AMBIDVY-1's manifest dependency upon American
goodwill, while an element of latent control and as such
recognized by AMBIDDY-1, ought not be kept in the forefront
of our dealings with him inasmuch as it injects another.
element of instability which forces AMBIDDY-1 to worry about
his rear whereas he ought be concentrating on his front.
Too frequent harping on the consequences of American dia-
pleasure cannot serve to forward our project.
fewish
81. ANBIDDY-1 has been known to make quite a fough
of his resentment at deceptive promises and broken commit
pents. Our record in this respect, while not unblemished,
is fairly good. We can see no merit in practicing deception
and much to commend candor in dealings with him. ANBIDDY-l's
cun record of living up to commitments is somewhat marred by
his shortemmings as an organizer and administrator. There
have been no instances of demonstrable bad faith. However,
seeming indications of assent on his part are frequently
seant to demete no more than that be comprehende what he
beam said.
83. In providing AMBIDOY-1 with political guidanca,
we should strive to relieve him of all preoccupation with
the vagariom of United States foreign policy and to dia-
courage atarlle demonological speculation.
18. Hopefully, recent realigments within AMWORLD
will serve to usher in a period of political tranquility

1. WAVE has determined that IDEN presently resides at
881 N.E. 71st Street, Miami. The house she lives in has a
"For Sale" sign on it by a real estate broker named Henry
Chamberlain whose office is located at 7768 Biscayne Blvd.
2. WAVE has checked the public records pertaining to
the above property and the following information was obtained;
:
A. "The property is reported being located at
881 N.E. 71st Street, Lot 124, Washington Place, Plot
Book 20, Page 54. The house was built in 1940 and
purchased on 4 May 1951 by Miriam C. Humes for $19,000.
Miss Humes married John C. McCarthy on 4 October 1961.
The couple got a mortgage from First Federal Bank, Miami,
for $12,400, at which time the house was appraised for
$18,475. McCarthy died on 15 August 1962, and the title
is now in the name of Miriam C. McCarthy. She has ap-
proximately $6,000-$7,000 in equity. Present mortgage
is $11,495.57, and she pays $87.00 per month."
3. WAVE was unable to obtain any information regarding
AMBIDDY-1's interest, if any, in the property. It is possi-
ble that he intends to purchase some other property. WAVE
will continue to check all leads regarding houses in Miami of
interost to AMBIDDY-1 and will inform Headquarters of the results.

SUBJECT: Status of ANBIDDY-1's Parents
ANJAVA-4 stated that he and received in Miami
letter from the Spanish Consul in Cubs that AMBIDDY-1's
parents had planned to come out of Cuba before the Pilon
raid. Afterwards they felt that it would be too dangerous
and had stayed in place. Now orders are out to find them
and to pick them up. The Spanish want them to take refuge
in the Mexican Embassy at the earliest moment. The Spanish
say that they can arrange to deliver the aged couple to
the Mexican Embassy. The question is, can we at BQB check
with the Mexican Government to try to arrange that they
guarantee to receive and afford safe travel to Mexico
fer ANBIDDY-1's parenta. I agreed to investigate but gave
no commitment or real hope of any success.

In connection with his parents I told AMBIDOT-1
that my HQS had investigated the possibility of intercess
with Mexico in their behalf. Our considered opinion was
that this would not serve a useful purpose and might be
counter-productive. The relations with Mexico are
strained at present because of their adverse vote in the
048 meeting and my people could see no way in which they
could intercede without directly indicating an official
U. B. Government? interest in AMBIDDY-1 himself. He
agreed that this was probably the situation. He asked only
if in uy opinion we might be able to assist in expediting
their entry into the United States as refugees becking asylum
in case they were able to make their way to Mexico. I

SUBJECT: Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa
DATE : 15 July 1964
FROM : Carlos A. RIVERA
The
A few days ago I was able to read a report on the activities
in large scale of Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa, and the beginning of his
intimate relations with his present mistress.
Of this report I can mention the most outstanding passages as
I had to memorize them.
"Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa takes his first steps in the public
life as Political Sargent of the 'Partido del Pueblo Libre' (Party
of the Free People) whose leader at that time was Dr. Carlos
MARQUEZ Sterling.
·
Later he directed his activities in the fight against General
BATISTA, going in the Sierra Maestra where he was apointed Lieu-
tenant by Major Humberto SORI-MARIN.
He was appointed Lieutenant because of his friendship with
Major SORI-MARIN, because he was catholic, and because of the lack
of trained persons in the Sierra Maestra.
There are more news on Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa when he
published the open letter in the newspaper "Avance" denouncing
the Castro Regime. The letter was published after he left Cuba,
while in Exile in Mexico.
-
In answering, the CASTRO Regime accuses him of having stolen
funds from the Cooperative of which he had charge. This was
certified by his friend Major Humberto SORI-MARIN.
When he arrives in the USA, that is in Miami, Florida, he is
guest of Mr. Ricardo LORIE and Mr. Michael YABOŘ.
An argument begins within the MRR, in which there are two
sides, one includes Ricardo LORIE and Michael YABOR, and the

This argument becomes stronger because of the appointment of
the MRR Delegate to the Democratic Revolutionary Front.
Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa aspires with all his strength and
intrigues to this position.
He seeks the help of Mr. "Macko" BAQUER, who is said to
belong to the CIA and who at the same time supports the FRD (DRF).

He also receives the help of the Catholic Front through
Father GONZALEZ Posada and Father LLORENTE, who refused it at a

which does not alienate him from KUBARK. · Head quarters may be shiẹ to suggest

suspicions which a man of AMJAVA, 4's personality traits might help to dispaż.
8. With regards to the substance of our operations” against: PERUMIN,

Although Adelaida PADRON maintains "intimate" relations with
several of her girl friends in Miami, she has confessed that the
one she likes completely is her "intimate girl friend", the wife
of Dr. Pedro RANOS, well known doctor who resides in Miami, Florida.
Dr. Pedro RAMOS resides at 213 NW 50 St., Miami, Florida.
Victoria PADRON:
She is the sister of Adelaida PADRON. She is tied in this
matter because whe introduced and directs all of her sister's
activities,
Victoria PADRON is married to an Italian-American whose name
is unknown.
Victoria PADRON lives in common-law with Mr. Raul GRANDA
married, ex-chief of the Military G-1 in the era of General
BATISTA.
According to what Aida PEREZ Pozo informed to Mr. Manolin
GARCIA, when the counter-revolution will succeed, Mr. Raul GRANDA
will occupy his post because it is a family affair through ARTIME,
Adelaida, etc.
NOTE: In all this love intrigue around Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa,
there could be the influence of two factors: either the infiltra-
tion of BATISTA elements, as almost all the components of the
groups have some link with him; or else infiltrees of Castroites
who work in the USA, since there are involved the relatives of
Lucia CANO, who are communists and still in Cuba. There is also
the link of Adelaida PADRON's sister with Major William GALVEZ,

ANWORLD Meeting in New York, 6 October 1964.
SUBJECT: ANWORLD Contingency Plans
201
1977
'
1. ANJAVA-4 said that AMBIDDY-1 was very enthusiastic
about the AMEIJEIRAS operation and felt this was the real
key to success of our program to overthrow the Castro
regime. He is prepared to concentrate on this operation
completely for the immediate future.
8. I asked A-4 if they had done any planning on the
besis that the AMEIJEIRAS operation might not pan out.
Be asked me directly whether a decision had been made to
continue or to cut off support to AMWORLD. I told him
that a decision had not been made but that my Headquarters
vas very interested in the outcome of the AMRIJEIRAS
operation on which he was working. He recognized the
importance of this operation and stated that he and A-1
had conjectured that future support to AMWORLD might be
contingent on success or failure of their handling of
that case, I did not confirm or deny this point but told"
him that the organization would surely be happy if they
pere able to handle it with success.
3. A-4 then explained that he and A-1 had spent
considerable time discussing the future of their program
and their prospects vis a vis the Agency. He said
that in their opinion one of two things would happen;
either the AMEIJEIRAS operation would pay off in which
case they would be able to continue to operate with Agency
support but with a diversion of major objectives or the
operation would peter out, in which case they would have
to consider what to do without Agency support. He said
that A-1 was not only prepared to accept a diversion of
primary objective but felt that present circumstances
dictated the wisdom of such a move. However, both of
them feel that their present paramilitary program must
be continued, not because it is crucial to the outcome
of the Cuban situation, but because the strength which
they exhibit through these operations is the only attrac-
tion to AMWORLD that has caused the AMEIJEIRAS group to
contact thon.

meantime, I was, of course, not authorized to discuss possible
future operations but/interested in what AMWORLD was thinking
along these lines. A-4 understood our position with the

In case the AMEIJEIRAS operation fails to develop,
the Agency should decide to cut off support to AMWORLD,
A-4 says they will continue to try to operate as long as
they can. He said that instead of 200 people they might
be operating with 20, but they could do something. So long
as they have the hardware with which to operate they can
"sell" operations each time. For example, he said, they
would go to Cuban exiles, to Venezuela, to American
businessmen, etc. and would tell them, "The October oper-
ation will cost $25,000. If you will underwrite it we
will dedicate it to you and run it in your name. Ho
feels this would carry them for a few months provided they
an run a few successful operations.
8. A-4 said that when the support ran out, the
hardware was all gone, and there was nothing left with
which to operate, A-1 would take 12 or 15 of his hard
core followers and go into the Escambray in Las Villas
to make one last ditch effort. I asked him if A-1 felt
he would have any chance of a success and A-4 stated that
should such a state come to pass, A-1 would definitely
go in with the expectation of being run down eventually
and shot but that he would do this in order to go out in
blane of glory and to continue to serve as a martyr.
said there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that
-1 would follow this course, that he had a hero compulsion
nd a martyr complex and was completely without fear of death.
-4 again mentioned an idea held by A-1 that he will not live
past 29 January 1965 (his birthday) because he is convinced
that he is destined to reach the peak moment of his life
during his 33rd year (as did Jesus Christ) and does not
expect to live beyond that time.
6. I asked A-d where he, personally, stood in such a
future undertaking. He said that he was no herq but he had
dedicated seven years of his life as a schoolboy and young
man to Cuban independence, and he could not stop now. Ho

DATE : 30 October 1964 at 1130 hours
1.
AMBIDDY-1 inquired as to when the organizational
charts he requested from Carl would be ready. A-1 explained
these charts are urgently needed to prepare future plans
concerning the "dissident group. At present Nilo Messer
"
is being groomed to go to Madrid to be the liaison after
"Cuco" de Leon is replaced. "Cuco" de Leon is leaving
shortly for Nicaragua to commence infiltration training.
2. As to A-l's future plans he intends to leave for
Central America on Tuesday or Wednesday, 3 or 4 November.
ANJAVA-4 is leaving for Nicaragua on 2 November.
3. AMBIDDY-1 is sending Rafael Garcia, Luis Grillo,
and Amado Cantillo to the Dominican Republic to survey
the new location which President Reid has offered AMWORLD.
According to A-1 Reid has offered them an operations base
much closer to Cuba than Isla de Beata. At present A-1
is getting cost estimates on the 12 Swifts which President
Reid wishes to buy in the U. S. The different estimates
will be sent to President Roid with the three aforementioned
AMWORLDers. According to A-1 President Reid suggested that
AMWORLD could paint their Swifts the same colors as the
ones which the Dominicans will have.
A-1, Sixto Mesa, and John Monahan intend to meet
a group of wealthy American and Cuban bushessmen on Sunday
to solicit funds for AMWORLD. A-1 was advised to take n
hard look as to the motives of Mr. Monahan before getting

ANA/ told /2 went to

vacation. A/4 sain later that A/2 was starting witness in insin
and wanted him (4/4) to move over there a rage it for hin. 4/2 left
William Eire, the ice-President in charge of maritine Sam in his absence.
A-BIDOY/1 has always had ultimate control of the ARC funds and has
simply been exercising closer personal control of them sirce A/2 is gone.
ANBIDDT/1 told me that he is selling off some of the equipment which is not
suitable for his current program of Community Development/Divic Action in
Latin America in order to raise money to obtain equipment and materials
that will be reeded. for mamle, he has bought 22 acres of farm land near
West Palm Beach to establish a model farm for training purposes. He has
been conducting evening classes for several werks for about 20 FRR men, who
are working full time at other jobs, in rural Community Development. He
has gotten some training materials and advice from Pro. George Lodge of
Harvard, who, according to letters from hip, appears to be enthusiastic
about his contact with 1/1 and his organization.
A/1 says his only political plans at this time are to try to continue holding
his movement (HRK) together while he charges its emphasis and direction
toward the constructive activity of help in Community Development for
friendly Latin American countries and away from the Pr. emphasis for which
we supported him in the AWORLD program. The farm in Nicaragua to cultivate
rice is a planned cooperative on the east coast (Bluefields - Monkey Point).
to complement a shrimp fishing cooperative and boat yard at Bluefields
which he has already discussed with President Schick, who requested him to
go ahead. A/1 and the NRR part in these enterprises is purely advisory in
training local residents and helping them to organize and build facilities.
1/4 reports, and A/1 himself admits, that he is simply feeling around now
trying to get all the information and ideas he can about this new field of
endeavor. (For example, A/1 just bought 300 baby chicks to work with in
order to find out they can best fit into a rural development program.)
2.d. Of course, AMWORLD is finished and all members of the orgmisation know it.
1/1 and 1/4 have both told me they have made it clear to all hands and have
advised them to get jobs immediately in order to support their dependents.
Most of them have done so, several going back to work for WAVE, for instance.
The death of AMWORLD and the reorganization necessary to go into a new
phase (Community Development) is no doubt causing a crisis in the MRR, but
both leaders believe the movement will weather the crisis and survive. Mr.
Tom Clines, who talked with other members of the ERR, believes the same
thing, and is certain it will survive with enough support from Washington
to pay for publicity, travel, and administrative costs.
3.a
There are 5 men at Monkey Point where one cache (a platoon) of weapons is
stored. The other two are located at Bluefields and at Managua, under
control of the Nicaraguan National Guard. The MRR delegate at Managua is
the only person who can authorize their release, and this must be on
written authority of A/'1 and approved by General Somoza. The 5 mon at
Monkey Point are simply station-keepers who, in addition to guarding the
camp and weapons, are teaching the local Indians to read and write, to
operate and maintain basic machinery, and to plant crops to raise their

1. AMBIDDY-1 stated that he, ANWORLD-2 and John Monahan
net some wealthy, American businessmen on 1 November. One of
the Americans was the President of the American Medical Asso-.
ciation in Miami who promised AMWORLD medical supplies. A-1
mentioned that John Monahan spoke eloquently before the group
on behalf of AMWORLD. The undersigned mentioned to A-1 that
unlike Cuban businessmen, one has to take a more direct approach
with American businessmen as far as money is concerned. A-1
said the reason he has not made a direct pitch for money is
because he does not want to take the same approach other exile
organizations do. A-1 felt he would have better success in
getting a little from alot of people instead of alot from a few.
2. According to A-1, AMJAVA-4 will be leaving Thursday
for Nicaragua.
3.
A-1 advised that Nilo Messer and Antonio Sanz are now
in Spain. Antonio Sanz will return after placing Nilo in contact
with appropriate people in Spain. A-1 expects to meet with a
representative of the dissident group within the next two weeks.
A-1 did not elaborate as to the reason for his expectation.
A-1 again asked if the charts he requested would be turned
over to him when he meets Carl. A-1 was assured that Carl would
bring the charts to the meeting.

1. After several unsuccessful attempts I was finally
able to contact AMBIDDY-1 and advise him that Carl wald
be unable to meet him at the agreed time. I informed
A-1 that Carl would contact him at 0900 on 4 November and
make arrangements for their meeting.
2. A-1 said he had received confirmation that the
Philco school had started on 2 November.
3. During this non-operational period A-1 is having
all his vessels checked out to see that they will be in
good operational condition. A-1 specifically alluded to
the LCM's that are presently being overhauled. The Swift
GITANA is also undergoing maintenance repairs.
4. Besides setting up Nilo Messe as AMWORLD's liaison
to the dissident group, Antonio Sanz is inquiring as to
the departure date of the RIO CAONAO. A-1 intends to
broach the topic of attacking the CAONA with Carl.
A-1
stated that he hopes that Carl will have a final decision
for him on the CAONAO
5. Feeling that A-1 was probing for a sign as to what
decision has been made on the CAONAO, I changed the subject

It is not clear what this source is trying to report, but presumably he is
trying to indicate that A/1 is hoarding the LD money he has been
issued for his personal use. Anyone who knows 1/1 knows that the last
thing he will over give up is his magazine and radio broadcasts. The
ability to make speeches and have them printed and see his picture
reprodused is the top requirement in his makeup. The next most impor-
tart requirement is the capability to travel and hob-nob with Heads of
State and other in which he excels. These two attributes are
of considerable to, as witness the fact that br. Fitzgerald.
has insisted on retaining these capabilities for A/1 to use in behalf
of the Agency. They are certainly more important to him than money,
as such, concerning which he is incredibly naive and disinterested. He
is notorious for having to have somebody else go around with him to be
sure he has necessary documents and money, otherwise he would never have
a dime in his pocket. I checked further on this point with 1/4 at our
last meeting on 27 June and he said there was no evidence of 1/2
pilfering the till, the problem if any was simply honest mismanagement.
We should remember that 1/1 has been paid a salary, with Hqs agreement
and at our suggestion for that matter, of £1,000 a month. AlORLD/2
made it a point to deposit the check in A/1's personal account every
month, and A/2 maintained de facto control of the account. A/1 told
me this incident because he was amazed to find when A/2 left for Spain
and turned the records of the account over toA/1, he found that he had
4 or 5 thousand dollars in the bank, the most he had ever owned in his
life. In addition to this salvary, it should be remembered that A/1
is a co-author of the "Bay of Pigs" boold, which was worth several
thousand dollars to each of the 4 co-authors.
Note: This line of reporting has been going on for at least the past 2 years in
the case of A/1 and is typical of the incessant gossip and character
assassination within the Cuban exile community in Miami that has been
going on for the last 5 years. While certainly no paragon of virtue or
of efficiency, it will take more than this to convince me A/1 is a
crook. In the first place, AMJAVA/4 would be the first one to put the
finger on him if he started misappropriating MRR funds or otherwise
playing games that would hurt the movement. In the second place, 1/1 is
too disorganized to be an effective crook, even if he tried, and it
would show up in more concrete form then this report.

6. A-1 commented that there is a possibility that ANWORLD
may get a free ship from Babun. A-1 feels that by acting as
an intermediary for the JOANNE, Babun will give AMWORLD another
ship after obtaining possession of the JOANNE.
7.
A-1 expects to leave within the next few days for
Central America. He will see ANJAVA-4 and get up-to-date
reading on the situation at the camps and obtain the inventory
from A-4. A-1 would like to see Carl in the U. S. rather
than in Panama.
8. A-1 claimed that the $18,000 balance due on the
JOANNE repairs had been sent to Ramsey Scarlett.
9. A-1 was advised that Carl would meet him tonight
(12 Nov) in West Palm Beach. A-1 should make reservations
at a motel in that city and call Headquarters at 1600 hours
today with the name of the motel.

Telephone Conversation Between AMBIDDY-1,
Norman Santell and Martin Ferrer
DATE : 21 November 1964, 1030 hours
1. The undersigned telephoned AMBIDDY-1 to see if he
had an opportunity to speak with President Orlich. A-1 stated
he was unable to reach the President but did speak to the
President's secretary. The secretary advised A-1 that he was
unaware of the Hendrix story but he assured A-1 the entire story'
would be denied. A-1 informed Headquarters that he has sent
Manolin Hernandez with a copy of the story to see President
Orlich. A-1 commented that the initial reaction in Miami to
the story was one of indignation toward Hendrix.
2. When we called A-1, he was on his way to see Al Burt.
A-1 had already talked to Burt by phone and they had made an
appointment to discuss the entire matter this morning. Burt
told A-1 on the phone that rumors concerning A-l's activity
had reached him. A-1 said he would tell Burt that President
Orlich would issue a complete denial of the Hendrix allegations.
A-1 was cautioned not to forget that Burt is primarily a
newspaperman and therefore to be on guard as to what he tells
Burt.
A-1 was advised to take a firt stand against Philco
concerning Jim Lee. Lee should be sent back to the U. S. as
soon as possible. A-1 was requested to reject any proposals
by Philco for consultations in Miami or Central America con-
cerning Lee, A-1 should tell King to telephone Philco ou
Monday (23 Nov) and make it quite clear AMWORLD cannot afford
to pay needless travelling expenses of Philco representatives.
King should also ask for a price list for the spare parts.
If Philco cannot comply, A-1 was advised to them he will buy
This spare parts elsewhere.

1.
AMBIDDY-1 called to say he had just returned from
Costa Rica where he spoke to President Orlich and his brother.
The Orlichs made no mention of expelling A-1, but, to the
contrary, are willing to continue to support AMWORLD. The
only request made by President Orlich was that the arms barge
be taken out of Costa Rica for fear the Communists would
learn of its existence. A-1 said he will comply.
2. The topic of conversation quickly changed to the
newspaper article by Hal Hendrix which greeted A-1 upon his
arrival from Costa Rica about A-1 involvement in smuggling
activities in Costa Rica. We informed A-1 that Al Burt had
intended to publish a similar story but was scooped by Hendrix.
We asked A-1 what he thought of the idea of having President
Orlich issue a complete denial as soon as possible of A-l's
smuggling activities in Costa Rica. A-1 felt a presidential
denial was essential in counteracting this damaging publicity.
A-1 stated he would call President Orlich the first thing in
☐ the morning on this matter. Another suggestion to neutralize
Hendrix's story was for A-1 to see Al Burt as soon as possible
and categorically deny the story. If need be A-¡ might want
to invite Burt to Costa Rica to speak to President Orlich and
confirm A-l's side of the story.

and Dick
L
DATE:
21 November 1964, 1600 hours
1. At 1600 hours, 21 November 1964, I complied with
AMBIDDY-1's request relayed through the Security Office
that he be called on Franklin 3-1568 in Miami.
2. AMBIDDY-1' described reports reaching him of
mysterious phone calls being received by various Cubans
in Miami, mostly MRR personnel or wives of MRR members.
These calls started during the morning of 21 November.
The caller was a North American who spoke Spanish and gave
his name as "Bill Jones." The caller sought in each case
to solicit derogatory information about AMBIDDY-1, with
particular emphasis on A-l's alleged participation in
Smuggling activities. The caller offered money (A-1 did
not know how much) for derogatory information.
3. A-1 mentioned two persons who received calls:
AMYUM-19 and the wife of Manolin Hernandez. In addition
to smuggling, A-19 was also asked if the reason he broke
with A-1 was because of the marriages of AMJAVA-4 or A-1.
A-19 denied these allegations to the caller.
--
4. A-1 said that the story spreading through Miami
as a result of these calls is that the U.S. Government.
and probably CIA specifically -- was attempting to discredit
A-1 as a basis for denouncing him. A-1 was obviously
distressed by these speculations, and in reporting them
he was in reality asking the question. I gave him my
unequivocal assurance that the U.S. Government was not
responsible for the calls..
.

B. I asked A-1 who he thought was responsible and
he said "maybe the Miami Herald. A-1 said that he had
seen Al Burt earlier in the day (Saturday, 21 November)
and that Burt was angry because he felt that the recent

TV coverage of the AMWORLD camps and activities in Central
America was a scoop to which he was rightfully entitled
because of a prior agreement with AMBIDDY-1.
A-1 gave
Burt his side of the stories being circulated about
ANWORLD's contraband activities. A-1 felt that he
made an impression. Burt was particularly interested
in a denial of these charges which A-l told Burt would
be issued very soon by the President of Costa Rica (see
following paragraph). A-l said he thought that he may.
have mollified Burt somewhat by having the meeting and
by promising him scoops in the future, but that Burt
still holds a grudge against him.
6. AMBIDDY-1 said he was expecting momentarily
a call from Manolin Hernandez in San Jose. Hopefully,
Hernandez' call would be to read a public letter from
President Orlich officially denying the presence of
AMWORLD training camps in Costa Rica and disavowing
charges that A-1 or his people were involved in smuggling.
Orlich promised A-1 to issue such a letter. When he gets
a copy of this letter A-1 intends to hold a press
conference and use it as the heart of his effort to set
the record straight about charges that AMWORLD is involved.
in running contraband.
7.
I told A-1 that we would look into his report on
the mysterious phone calls and that we would let him know
what we find out.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Juan Antonio CANCELA Gomes (201-758689)
Possible Connection with Cuban 0–2
$
1. On 7 December 1904 during the course of
telephone conversation with ANBIDDY-1, he indicated that
it was possible that Subject was connected with the Cuban
0-2. AMBIDDY-1 suspects that CANCELA was sent by the 0-2
to penetrate the ANYUN training camps.
8. Subject spent one month at the training camps
and then asked to return to Miami. Upon his return to
Miami he then made plans to travel to Nassau alleging
that he had to go to Nassau in order to obtain & permanent
visa to enter the U.S. AMBIDDY-1 had this story checked
out with the U.S. I&NB and discovered that this was not
Recessary to enter the country on a permanent basis.
AMBIDDY-1 therefore concluded that Subject was attempting
to go to Nassau and eventually work his way back to Cuba.
3. No further information was obtained on this
matter.

machine guns and artillery pieces, as well as other
miscellaneous items such as communications vans and
th-moving equipment. The small arms not recovered
from Artime are sufficient to equip an infantry company
Future Plans:
During the same period Artine has attempted
to gain support for a plan by which he, and a small
nucleus of his paramilitary fores; would conduct
counterinsurgency-type operations against Castro-
supported rebel bands operating in several latin
Americas sountries. Artime has outlined these propo-
sals to Presidents Leen Valencia of Colombia and
Marcos Robles of Famama, and endeavored to obtain an
interview with Ravi Leoni of Venezuela, but has been
able to conduct conversations on this proposal only

To implement such a scheme Artine envisions
using a small group of highly-trained individuals plus

the coasts of one or the other of the aforementioned
countries to prevent the muggling of arms and/or general

Za addition, he would be allowed to maintain bases of

So far none of these governments has made any commitment
to Artine. Ho claims, however, that both Presidents
Valencia and Robles have expressed interest in his pro

Artime has requested an interview with this

it is expected that he will bring up his scheme as

coup plotting or the former MRR Cubans who had been involved
with it. He had also outlined his proposal for Peralta to
consider whereby A-1 and the HR would undertake, at the
invitation of the local government, to assist in countering
Castro/Communist infiltration and subversion, and to help
devolop rural civic action programs as a positive counter-
insurgency program. A-1 clained that Peralta seemed very

broke with it due to Castro's shift to Harxism-Leninism.
It was at this point that Artime formed the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (HRB, Hovement for the Recovery
of the Revolution), a political organization which he heada
to date. The degree of Artime's activities in the civic
action program was reflected by the fact that Artime, prior
to his break with Castro, had been appointed a deputy in
the Instituto Nacional de la Referaa Agregaria (TRA) for..
Oriente Province. Artime's first contact with the Agency
took place just prior to his open break with Castro and he
was exfiltrated from the island by the Agency. Artime
dedicated himself to the continued development of the NRR
until called upon by the Agency to be the political repre-
sentative for the Cuban Brigade 2506 which landed at th
Bay of Pigs. Artime was captured and sentenced to be
exsented. This was later commuted by Castro to life
imprisonment. In 1962 Artime was among those repatriated
to this country under the prisoner exchange.

up a series of training camps in Central America. Using
the political banner of the NRR Artime's group conducted
several paramilitary operations against the island of Cuba
with varying degrees of success. In early 1965 by order
of the 303 Committee it was decided to phase out the Agency'
support to Artime since it was felt that paramilitary opera-
tions against Cuba were futile and ineffective. Although he
disagreed with this decision, Artime has been fully coopers–
tive in disbanding his organization. The paramilitary ving
of the MRR is now completely disbanded, and a few political
representatives remain in Central America and Florida.

Agency's support in order to keep his political organization
intact. If approved by the 303 Committee, Artine's MRR
vill receive a small subsidy. Artine also plans to establish
a civic action program along the lines of the Comandos Rurale
in various Central and South American countries. In such
endoavor Artime would be strictly on his own without any
support from the Agency.

:
Deputy Chief, WHD/C
Support for Manuel Artime and the
MRR for the month of June 1965
1. On the basis of the discussion on 27 May between
Chief, WH and Manuel Artime, we are currently in the process
of submitting a recommendation to the 303 Committee that we
maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a
modest basis. His monthly operating budget, which he sub-
mitted to us, would enable him to keep the MRR alive as a
recognized exile political organization, and would allow him,
personally, to maintain his status as an important exile
leader. This would, in turn, continue his access to heads of
state and other leading political figures in Latin America.
2. Pending action by the 303 Committee, it is recommended
that you grant approval to fund Artime and the MRR for the
month of June 1965, on the basis of the following budget
estimate:
MRR delegates

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Contact of Manuel Artime with Professor George
Lodge and with Col. Barrientos of Bolivia
1. I talked with Manuel Artime by phone the night
of 4 June. He said he had received a call from Professor
Lodge that afternoon but was not at home to talk with him.
(This was obviously a follow-up from the offer made to
Artime by Chief, WH to put him and Lodge together on his
proposed civic action activities.) I told him there was
no reason he should not return the call and arrange for
meeting with Lodge at their mutual convenience.
3. Artime said that was his first reaction, but
before he could make the call another message had come in
from Col. Barrientos of Bolivia asking if he could visit
the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and
offering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick him up.
and bring him to La Paz. I asked if he were acquainted
with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he knew
no more about either of them than what he had read in the
papers. He had no idea of the reason for the invitation,
but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any
requirements for him in case we wanted him to make the visit.
I told him I would check with Chief, WH next morning and
call him back.
3. On the morning of 5 June I called Artime. He said
Professor Lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told
him he was interested in getting together with him. Lodge
said he would be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he
planned to be travelling in that area at that time and could
easily meet him there. Artime told Lodge he was willing to
make a trip to Boston to see him earlier and that after such
a preliminary meeting, the next meeting in Panama would probably
be more useful. Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime

to lunch with him on 9 June.
I suggested to Artime that
he plan to meet Lodge on 9 June, stop in Washington on the
way home where I could meet with him (and furnish him a
I
briefing on Bolivia which he desperately requested).
suggested he send a message to Barrientos saying he could
be in Panama on 11 June and could see Barrientos as soon
thereafter as transportation could be arranged. (Artime has
a visit with President Robles of Panama scheduled about that
time and can work it in, together with the meeting with
Lodge on 14 June in Panama.)
Artime said he had found out the background of the
invitation from Barrientos. One of Barrientos' trusted
aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing
through Miami enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast
about countering subversion, civic action, etc. that
attracted his attention. There was also a brief analysis
of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the
best-balanced hehad heard. He thereupon started asking
questions about the MRR and Artime and was referred to one
of Artime's people who turned over some copies of "Tridente".
(magazine of the MRR). The aide remarked that he was going
to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile
group that seemed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist
subversion operations and had some useful ideas of how to..
counter them. Two days later Artime received the invitation
from Barrientos.

„ABYERS DESK
KXU
The AMOTS have recently submitted two short reports
providing some information about AMWORLD and AMBIDDY-1 activities.
2. ANOT-84 reported the following in Report DD-1414, 19 May
1965, which he had acquired from Iden A, whose ultimate source of
information was AMWORLD-2:
.a. AMWORLD-2 left for New York with his family on 15
May 1965, this being his first step towards disconnecting
himself from AMWORLD. Before he left, he handed over to
AMBIDDY-1 the AMWORLD money which he had in the bank.
b. AMWORLD-2 said that AMBIDDY-1 was devoting all his
attention to obtaining money by the sale of military equipment
which he had at the camps. AMBIDDY-1 had already realized
U.S. $30,000 in this manner and hoped to raise still another
$30,000. AMBIDDY-1 currently had all the AMWORLD money under
his absolute control and said he intended to act as treasurer
of the organization.
'
C. AKBIDDY-1 gave the impression of not being involved
with any political plan. Occasionally he talked to friends
about interviews with his "contacts" and about a budget for
propaganda. Other times he gave consideration to propositions
of friends, such as the Spaniard who acts as his chauffeur
and secretary, concerning various business deals. He also talks
of buying a farm in Nicaragua to cultivate rice, etc.
d. The general opinion within AMWORLD is that the
organization is entering a crisis and, with the separation of
AMWORLD-2 from the organisation, AMWORLD members would no
longer continue to receive their salaries.

In general, Artine impressed me greatly and we got along very well. He is
energetic, idealistic, enthusiastic, highly motivated and in my judgement
wil suited in every way to the task he intends to faux perform. As you
know, he is 33 years old, tough-minded and filled with ideological fire.
His weakness would appear to be a certain lack of focus and conceptualization,
He does not really have a plan but appears to be reacting to immediate crises
and opportunities like a fire fighter. He and his group, therefore, need careful
and thoughtful leadership and guidance to get the most out of them and to
deal with problems in the proper order of priority and urgency.
..
He arrived late at the Business School because the taxi driver got lost.
We had a quick lunch together atvinnut which I had to leave early in order
to be in class at 1:30. At my request he joined me in the classroom. I was
giving a lecture on the role of the manager in the midst of radical change to a
group of alumni who are at the School for a short seminar on international business.

an excellent impression.

He told me of his work with the Indians on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
where he has 5 men working on community development problems including health,

In AMOT Report EE-1438, 4 June 1964, AMOT-84 further
reported information he had received from Iden A, as follows:
a: Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 was only concerned
with maintaining the small ANWORLD camp in Nicaragua, where
there were weapons, ammunition, and seven men, who were there
without the knowledge of the ODYOKERS. Iden B said that
ANBIDDY-1 was awaiting an opportune moment to arm as many
friends as possible and leave for PBRUMEN.
b. Iden C said that there really were arms and
ammunition cached in the camp in Nicaragua, but that the seven
men there spent all their time looking for persons to buy
the arms and ammunition.
c.
Iden C also said he believed that if AMBIDDY-1 was
keeping up his radio transmissions and payments to some
journalists it was because they served as a cover for his
commercial operations and that all the propaganda would
disappear when AMBIDDY-1 had to use AMWORLD money to keep up
the propaganda.

He discussed his civic action training program in Miami which has
just started and in which he said he has 32 men enrolled. This is a 3-
nonth program to prepare men for rural organization work of various kinds.
Be apple of his need for help in with respective to cooperative training and
especially cooperatáre leadership selection and preparation.
He spoke of his conversation with the Col. Peralta in Guatemala and said
that after a four-day field trip he reported to the President that:
8. The Army was old fashioned, had poor ideas and as ill equipped
to fight guerilla warfare or to carry out the civic action program which were
urgently necessary.
b. He said he found serious subversion among the Indians largely
through small radios which Cuban trained Guatemalans were giving to the Indians
and which were tuned in on Radio Cuba only. He knew specifically of 5
Guatemalans engaged in this work..
c. He spoke of the danger of Sosa in the mountains and said that
Peralta showed his ignorance by brushing Bosa off as a small-time operator with
only a handful of men around him. Artime said he had about 25 men with him and
added that this was enough to start a lot of trouble. He said he would like to
begin something in Quatemala but had no specific suggestions.
He said he had 3 people working in San Jose, Costa Rica, inside what he
referred to as "the Cuban community."
He has one man in Colombia organising three cooperatives in the Call area
the request of a local Senator who owns a sugar mill and the Cali newspaper
and who Artime described as a very good man. He is deeply concerned abont
the pompex situation in Colombia.
He is leaving shortly for Bolivia where kun he has been invited to spend
four days by the President.
During the scures of the conversation I made the following suggestions
which met with his enthusiastic approvals

I believe his key contribution may be in the area of rural organization and
notivation. He and his men (he said he has 220 available for immediate action)
need rural organisation training. Only a few know much about it. I suggested
therefore he investigate the cooperative training school at Antigonish,
Nova Scotia, which from everything I have been able to find out in Parama and
elsewhere is the best thing of its kind in the world. He said he had heared of
it very favorably and mentioned he would talk with a Bishop friend of his and
see if he could get some of his men enrolled in the school immediately.
I told him in some detail of our work in Veraguas Province and of Bishop
McGrath's general development plans and also of the Bishop's intention to
establish a cooperative training center in Veraguas. I mentioned the possibility
of one or two of his men working in Veraguas alongside my men who will be there
this summer and thereafter. He was extremely enthusiastic about this and suggested
Mestor Izquierdo, a 29-year-old Cuban Negro whom he said had done rural organization
work with him in Cuba. He spoke very highly of him. My thought was that perhaps
* Izquierdo might join my men during the summer with Bishop McGrath's approval,
work on our corperative project there and perhaps remain to help the Bishop
set up his training center and carry on such other activities as might be useful.
Isquierdo is apparently very versatile in his talents. He might go to Antigonish.
somewhere along the way if that asemed wise. We left it that I would see how
the Veraguas projeci goes, would talk informally to the Bishop and would meet
Artime and possibly Taquierdo in San Salvador on August 5. At that time we would
decide whether it would be wise for Artime and/or Izquierdo to come with me to
Veraguas.
He asked me to send him some books about chicken raising in Central
America. Could you take care of this?
He gave me his address as 1270 NE 85th Street, Miami, and telephone as
754-8144.
him
All in all, I was deeply impressed by Artime and would like to work with..

Meetings with AMJAVA-4 in Washington, 27-28 June 1965
Subject: Proposed Agency Programs
1. Following the demise of AMWORLD, AMJAVA-4 has become
familiar with three other Agency programs, or proposed programs,
and he asked if he could have some clarification as to just
what we wanted from him and his people. I explained that there vere
three different functions which needed to be done and that the
Agency was trying to develop programs to meet each need. The
three functions concerning Cuba are:
+
(a) to maintain the MRR as a respected resistance.
organization with a political posture which is acceptable to most
Cubans and not inimical to U.S. interests. We are asking approval of
a minimum budget for subsidy of the MRR which will pay for its
published and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of
MRR killed, disabled, or captured, and travel expenses for AMBIDDY-1
as the leader of the movement outside Cuba. We are trying to
guide A-l into a program of Community Development/Civic Action
projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an image of the
MRR and of A-1 as constructive, forward-looking people instead of
simply exile counterrevolutionaries. We would hope that such
activities would keep the movement together, give the members
practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cuba, and
in the meantime, would render useful results in countering
problems of insurgency in Latin America.
'
'(b) to prepare a managerial and executive team of
specially selected Cuban exiles who would be ready to move into Cuba
should relations be resumed with the United States in order to
furnish effective direction of necessary governmental functions and
assist the United States in denying the island to Communist
control. Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young
as well as intelligent and capable of profiting from extensive
training programs which would be designed for each to prepare him
to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regime. The
program would be apolitical, each person being considered as an
individual and not as representative of any organization. This
is the program for which A-4 is being considered for training, in
the field of internal security for work with the Agency in a pos*
Castro Cuban régime,
2. (c) to select and maintain a small cadre of Cuban exile
paramilitary people who would be ready for emergency contingency

with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing each of
them, to the maximum of his ability. He will be happy to spot and
recruit for us in each program, and will try to influence AMBIDDY-1
along the lines we want him to follow. A-4 appreciated our
explanations and stated that he could be much more helpful to us
now that he understood what we were trying to accomplish.

Activities of AMBIDDY-1, 1-10 July 1965
1.
I talked to AMBIDDY-1 by telephone on 2, 8 and 10 July
with the gist of the conversations outlined below:
"
AMBIDDY-1 had two long conversations with Bishop
McGrath of Panama on 30 June and 2 July. They discussed
the center for studies of rural cooperatives at San
Francisco village in Veraguas Province, Panama, that is
being developed under the Bishop's auspices with support
from Harvard University and which has two men there at
present. Prof. George Lodge is the Harvard representative
and has been visiting the center. A-1 received a letter
from Prof. Lodge asking for assignment of an experienced

the request, saying he would like to have two men as soon
as possible, with a total of six by January when he plans
to increase the program. The two men selected were Silvano
POZO Carrillo (201-73977; and Nestor IZQUIERDO Diaz
(201-281933) both Negroes from Oriente Province and former
Comandos Rurales. A-1 asked the Bishop what part the Panama

continues to teach the local Indians in reading, writing,
basic operation and maintenance of machinery, and rice

This report is part of the preliminary study which
INTERNICA has effected in regard to an investment program for
centration of repair yards and shipyards in the Bluff-Bluefields area,
These facilities will provide complete service to the fishing fleets and
other boats which operate on the Atlantic coast of Ficaragua. The initial
cost of building these facilities, with their necessary complex opera-

As will be seen in this preliminary report, the necessity of
modern shipyards and repair yards on the Atlantic coast is of vital
portance to the survival of the fishing fleets. These fleets suffer se-
such

services
which are common to the NorthAmerican and Mexican flkets. We have the
necessary equipment and technical personnel, and, moreover, the full con-

class is now studying organization of rural cooperatives.
Silvano POZO is chief instructor for this phase and will
be sent to Panama as soon as the classes in Miami are
completed.
d. A-1 has bought a small farm (22 acres) near West
Palm Beach to develop as a model farm for his training
program. He is installing generators, water pumps, and
starting to raise chickens, etc. He hopes eventually to
bring a few students at a time from Latin America as his
program progresses to show them what can be done with
small plots if proper farming techniques are used.
A-1 received another message from Bolivia saying
in effect that the situation was still about the same and
again asking if he were able to visit there. He stalled
them again (at our request) and agreed to be out of town
or otherwise scheduled until the matter dies a natural
death.
2.
The West German Government has issued scholarships
paying all tuition plus $100 per month subsistence in German
universities to three of A-l's people who have been living in
Spain. They will go to Germany in August to study the language
for six months then begin their studies. They are Angel LAVANDERA
economics; Carlos MAYO, engineering; and Luis CAVADA, engineering.
This is follow-up to the meeting A-1 had in Rome with the German
Ambassador that was arranged for him by the Vatican Secretary ɗf
State last December.
3. A-1 is leaving 13 or 14 July for about 10 to 15 days
visiting Central America. He will go to Nicaragua first to talk
with President Schick and General Somoza, then to Monkey Point
to check on the condition of the base, security of the arms he
has cached there, and to observe the civic action training his
men there are conducting for the local Indians. He will then
go to Costa Rica to talk with President Orlich and Foreign
Minister Oduber who have sent word they would like to meet with
him as soon as convenient for him. From there he will go to
Panama to see President Marcos Robles, who has been expecting
him for several weeks. A-1 will describe the project he is
about to enter with Bishop McGrath and Professor Lodge and
confirm President Robles' attitude toward it. A-1 will also
visit Veraguas Province and look over the training center.
4. I also informed A-1 that his proposal to maintain

been prepared to stock the shipyard warehouses with spare parts.
External or Internal Competition: As regards the shipyard, there is
neither external nor internal competition in Central America. The only com-

Construction from wood will be advantageous because of the procurement

Another advantage of construction from wood is a plan for production
in which prefabricated sections of boats will be constructed. It
is possible to visualize in the near future not only the dale of fully-

the Balance of Payments: The shrimpbeat fleets in Ficaragua have
Ly
expanded is
10 to 15 boats annually., These boats are bought
Mexico and the United States. Their total value within a
riod of three years extfinds from a minimum of US$ 900,000 to a maxisus of
US$ 2,025,000. Our production during this period will be 14 shrimpbeats at
a value of US$ 560, 000 which will remin in the country.
Consumer Benefits and Economic Development: At present, most of the shring
beats in the area have no facilities for mechanical repairs, and, in most
pe acr
the shallow draft of
cases, no facilities for going. This is due in part to the ins
the marine railways
es in the local repair yards, as well as to antiquated equip-
ment. Because of these difficulties, many shrimpboats are forced to put into
Honduras, Mexico and at times the United States for repairs,
It is difficult to estimate with certainty the total loss-
through
es which these boats incur qu
negotiatiêns for entry to and de-
parture from other countries, fuel and personnel expenses, and, of more in
portance, the incalculable losses in fishing time. Inasmuch as our repair
yards will possess a greater capability than normally required, those boats
with emergency and other types of damages will guaranteed service. In this
we will attract to our repair yards thōse boats which ordinarily would
seek repairs outside of the country with the sequent loss in fansign pro-
fits and valuable tim fishing time in the waters of Nicaragua,

At present, however, the sandbar of Bluff limits access to the
port to boats in with 13 feet of draught or less ( a maximum of 800 tons).
This greatly limits the commercial traffic to Bluefields. Possibly in
the near future, the sandbar may be dredged, and we will then be suf-
