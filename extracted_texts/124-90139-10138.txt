Roa also commented that it would have been much better if the
Cuban situation had been handled by the United Nations Security Council.
Among other things, this would have limited the ability of the OAS.
When it was suggested that time was working in Cuba's favor, Roa
agreed, saying it permitted internal consolidation, and economic and
organizational endeavors. He also mentioned the differences within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the hope for settlement of
differences in the Soviet Bloc and prospects for general relaxing of
strained relations between all countries.
Although Roa did not mention the Soviet Union at any time, it
appeared that he does not now agree with the Soviet Union's placing
missiles in Cuba in 1962. Roa's comments during the entire conversation
left one with the feeling that he was pessimistic, according to the informant.

FOREIGN POLITICAL MATTERS - CUBASE OF CIA INFORMATION
IN THIS DOCUMENT. EXCEPT
KP. 5-26-98 BRACKETS
A highly confidential informant who has furnished reliable
information in the past recently advised that on about February 20, 1963,](s)
Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign Minister, commented that the Sino-Indian
conflict continually bothers Cuba and this conflict worked in the favor
of the United States in the Fall of 1962.
Roa's evaluation of the situation in Cuba was highly pessimistic.
Roa stated that the situation has deteriorated; that this was the only thing
that could have happened because talks at the United Nations, New York,
did not find an answer to the problem. Roa also observed that conditions
as of February, 1963, were similar to those just before the crisis in the
Fall of 1962, mentioning pirate boat activities, a campaign in the United
States and a statement by President Kennedy which Roa described as
meaningless.
Roa commented that the United States was the only nation which
benefited from the crisis. The informant understood that it was Roa's
contention that by excluding the Security Council of the United Nations
from considering the Cuban situation and permitting the Organization of
American States (OAS) to take up the matter freely, the United States
is now enjoying a very favorable position in the OAS, the best it has enjoyed
at any time in the Organization. In still referring to what the informant
believed was the OAS, Roa said that the report of the Antisubversive
Committee, now under study by the OAS, contains some definite proposals,
such as a collective breakoff and a breakoff in relations with Cuba including
postal contacts. Roa said it is known officially that Mexico will accept
such resolutions with reservations; Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay will accept
everything; and it is believed that only Brazil will oppose such resolutions.
Cuba, according to Roa, believes that talks between President Kennedy and
President Romulo Betancourt, Venezuela, will establish the action by the
OAS.
