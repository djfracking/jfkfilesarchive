the following chirie

some of the information previously reported by the Station which
undoubtedly has led Headquarters to the conclusion contained in
the second paragraph immediately below.
When told that Subject (Mikhail Vasilyevich MURACHOV 201-
205159) Has been posted to Finland, Bourer (a Foviet defector)
commented that Subject (NURASHCV) probably be resnonsible
for penetrating the police.

Activities in Helsinki at first eared to be those of a NG3
co-optee, and lafor more obviously those of a 233 officer in the
c field. Halter R. CLASTONBURY'a contacts with SAVALNEY teok
place either in press circles or in the presence of Aleksey
SHURAROV (201-203095) whom we suspect of being the deputy rezident
in helsinki. Thus the milieu in which SAVALYIV operated, wo
tend to place him in the KGB category rather than ORU.
and
5. SAVALYEV, who left for home leave on 10 July 1964. never
returned, was replaced by NGS officer Albert AKULOV (201-232590),
first secretary and press attache.
6. Concerning Ivan Yefimovich SERGEYEV (201-259447), SERGEYEV
replaced RGB officer Oneri Ye. GOLD (201-150156), Chief of
the Consular Section. After the defects of AELADLÉ/1, this
Sy
Section was in confusion and the exact slet-for-slot replacements
are not known. In our best judgment, SERGEY was replaced by
Anatoliy PAVLOV (201-331811) who departed 2 March 1963 because of
ill health. PAVLOV was temporarily replaced by HB officer Boria
Vasilyevich PERELETOV ostensibly assigned to the Cultural Section
22-6433, 6 March 1964) who departed 31 March 1964 also because
of ill health. PERELEROV was replaced for consular responsibilities
by KGB officer Feliks Dmitryevich KARASEY (201-736991).
