Personal Affairs Since Entering the KGB
1. Family Life
The Soviet internal passport which NOSENKO carried to
Geneva in 1964 confirms his claim that he married Lyudmila
KOZHEVNIKOVA on 27 June 1953. (They married approximately
six months after he says he first met her at a sanatorium or.
"rest home" outside Moscow and about three months after he
•
says he joined the KGB.) Immediately after their marriage
the couple moved into the home of NOSENKO's new in-laws at
Ulitsa Serafimovich 2, Moscow, where they lived until obtain-
ing their own apartment on Narodnaya Ulitsa in January 1955.*
KOZHEVNIKOVA's father is Yulian Nikolayevich KOZHEVNIKOV,
metallurgical engineer by training, who held the position of
First Deputy Chairman of the State Scientific Research Com-
mittee (GKKNIR) of the RSFSR at the time of NOSENKO's defec-
tion. **
a
NOSENKO said that he has two daughters by this second
marriage. According to his passport, the eldest of these,
Oksana, was born on 21 August 1954' and the other, Tamara, on
13 July 1958.*** NOSENKO in 1962 displayed to his CIA handlers
a photograph of the two girls and their mother and made a par-
ticular point of noting the close physical resemblance between

time of his marriage to TELEGINA until his departure for
his first GRU post in the Far East, he lived in an apart-
ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. He gave up this apartment,
he said, in 1950, when his Navy orders came through.
Having made this statement, NOSENKO was then asked why
the 1951 Moscow telephone directory still listed him at
the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. He replied that he could
not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the
house in 1950. (He later said he moved to the Far East in
1951 - see Section IV.B.) NOSENKO then said that the
previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita
ISHCHENKO. Although the phone then in the apartment was
switched to NOSENKO's name for billing purposes, NOSENKO
never bothered to have the change entered in the Moscow
phone book; he said that this would have required a visit
to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms,
etc.; besides he added, he did not use the telephone any-
way. Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec-
tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed
under the name of ISHCHENKO. He has repeated this story

directory carries no listing for NOSENKO; it does list
ISHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya
Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa.
The GKKNIR of the RSFSR is now the GNTK. PENKOVSKIY worked
under cover in the GKKNIR of the USSR.
NOSENKO has also given his second daughter's year of birth
as 1957. In 1962 he told CIA that the older daughter was
then studying in the first class at school; in 1965, how-
ever, he said she began school in the fall of 1962.

Committee called NOSENKO's father on the phone and told him
the whole story.
NOSENKO's father never told either NOSENKO's
wife or mother of the incident, but did chide NOSENKO about
it. The incident was brought before the Komsomol and discussed.
A written reprimand for immoral conduct-unauthorized use of
official documents was placed in his record. This was also
a final warning meaning that any other infraction would result
in expulsion. He made the statement that he had been punished
for this incident many times. He could not immediately apply
for party membership; the incident was brought up repeatedly
in Komsomol meetings and even in party meetings (after he was
accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being
(The Deputy-
promoted from Senior Lieutenant to Captain.
Director who gave him five days was a member of the promotion
commission.)"
. :
+
Although there have been slight changes and contradictions
in NOSENKO's numerous accounts of this story (the house arrest
was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 days) it remained
basically consistent until the October 1966 interrogations
when he said for the first time that he contracted gonorrhea
from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather than 1954. In 1954,
he said, he again was infected, this time by a prostitute whom
he picked up in the vicinity of the Leningrad Railroad Station
in Moscow. When the KGB required that he reveal the source,
NOSENKO said, he ascribed the latter case to the original girl
from Leningrad. During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO
also told CIA for the first time that he had had venereal
disease on two other occasions while studying at the Institute
of International Affairs.
He later began to "feel more a part of the KGB," and as
a Junior KGB case officer, he personally recruited Richard
BURGI in the first successful recruitment operation carried
out by the newly-created Tourist Department of the Second Chief
Directorate.* "And in 1956," NOSENKO said in 1964, "before
my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in
the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned
the rank of Senior Case Officer. I developed a pride in my-
self, (a feeling) that I can do things. You know how it is.
When a person feels that he can, that he has some support,
then he works much better. He has more initiative and so
forth.
3.
Affiliation with Communist Party Organs
NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Communist
Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he
joined the Komsomol at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku.
This step was a casual one, and he has said that he took it
without much thought, mainly because all his friends were
;
See Part V.D.4.b. for a description of the BURGI recruit-
ment operation. Until 1966 NOSENKO claimed to CIA that
he had received an award for his participation in this
operation. In the October 1966 interrogations he retracted
this and said that he never received any KGB award for the
BURGI or any other operation.

Oksana and himself. He said that he and his wife refer to her
as his "double" (kopiya). His wife, in a letter after the
defection, referred to Oksana as NOSENKO's kopiya.
NOŠENKO's father, the Shipbuilding Minister, died of
stomach cancer in August 1956, three years after NOSENKO says
he entered the KGB Second Chief Directorate. The period of
time surrounding his father's death was, according to NOSENKO,
It was
a turning point in his personal and professional life.
then that he "found himself" after an irresponsible past,
drinking and wenching, and indifference to his work.
2.
Venereal Disease
The incident which NOSENKO has most often cited as an
example of his irresponsibility in the period prior to 1956
involved his illegal use of KGB alias documents to cover treat-
ment for a case of gonorrhea he contracted in 1954, at the time
his wife was pregnant with their first child. The CIA psycho-
logist who questioned NOSENKO in May 1966 submitted the follow-
ing summary of NOSENKO's statements about this incident, which
are about as given earlier (during the April 1964 interroga-
tion):

"A girl friend he had known in Leningrad since 1945 came

had slept with her before, so he thought nothing of it.
he developed what he feared was a venereal disease.
wife was pregnant, he was safe both from discovery and the
danger of infecting her. He searched frantically around Moscow
for a private doctor who treated such diseases, but could not
find one. Some of his friends at the office suggested a central
clinic that would require no documents. He went here but when
confronted with a request for documents, had the choice of
showing his KGB certificate or using a false passport he had
for business. He tried to talk the doctor into letting him
go home to get his documents, but the doctor said he would have
to be accompanied by a member of the militia; otherwise he
might not come back. He was required to take treatment of a
communicable disease. He was forced to give the false document.
He came back for treatment about three times and was ordered
to report back in two weeks for a final check. They also
demanded the name of the girl, but he claimed he had only just
met her and did not know who she was. He forgot to go back
and a nurse visited the safehouse about two times and left
a note for him to report. However, he did not go to the safe-
house so knew nothing of the note. In the false passport was
a listing of where the named person worked, a fictitious
factory. As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request
for information got into the hands of the section which made
the documents. NOSENKO was called before the deputy chief of
the Directorate and severely criticized. He explained what
had happened and was given five days of house arrest.
the chief of his section had also gotten word of the infraction
and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even
talking to him. He told his wife he was going on a trip and
moved into the administrative room near the office to serve
his term. In the meantime, the Secretary of the KGB Party

Soviets' Statements About NOSENKO
NOSENKO told
Portions of the NOSENKO autobiography have been supported
and other portions contradicted by the statements of several
Soviets following the defection. The Soviets' remarks dealing
with NOSENKO's KGB career are reviewed in Part V.I., but with
reference to other aspects of the background of NOSENKO:

Letters to NOSENKO in Geneva from his wife (who
later went to the U.S. Embassy after his defection) in-

and two other personal letters in his possession at the
time of his defection, Yu. I. GUK and G. I. DUCHKOV,
referred to visits to NOSENKO's wife and children.

A KGB officer in Vienna, Vladimir TULAYEV, told
a CIA double agent that NOSENKO, whom he knew well, came
from a wonderful family, loved his wife and children,
and earned a good salary. TULAYEV later told the agent
that he had "friends who knew NOSENKO well. "**

said to a CIA agent that NOSENKO had twice married, had
a good family background, was the son of a Minister in
the government, was notorious for his "adventurous"
nature, and was "famous for his character."

The Soviet Navy defector Nikolay ARTAMONOV said

1944 to 1946. (ARTAMONOV's description of the school

NOSENKO's. • Sensitive source

joining. When NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953,
he transferred routinely to the Komsomol organization there
and became Secretary of the Komsomol Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate. This was a small organization
consisting, NOSENKO thought, of about 17 KGB employees; he
remained its secretary until June or July 1954, when he got
into the trouble over illegal use of operational documents.
According to NOSENKO, "Immediately after this incident the
Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, and I was immediately

mitted to join the Communist Party immediately, however.
NOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows:
"Now I had to prove myself. Not being a candidate for Party
membership, I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness,
to prove myself. I also asked the Party Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate for some 'public service' (obshchest-
#
venniy) assignments. I collected newspapers. For a year,
NOSENKO "made good" by running errands and performing other
such tasks, until it was decided that he was suitable for
Party membership. He applied in January 1956 and was accepted
as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year;
full membership was granted in 1957. For over a year, from
October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had the
distinction of being the only employee of the KGB who was
neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant.
4. Statements to Others by NOSENKO
Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had
talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons
involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this
paper. NOSENKO informed the recruitment target Horst BRAUNS
that he had two daughters.** He advised Ivan Ivanovich PREIS-
FREUND, a Finnish citizen used in the recruitment approach to
a U.S. Army sergeant in Moscow, that he was married, his
father was dead but his mother was living, he had served in
the Navy, and he had two children. PREISFREUND met the
"little girls" and later reported to CIA that, although
NOSENKO was a "woman-chaser," he loved his daughters very
much. *** With one KGB agent in particular, Arsene FRIPPEL,
NOSENKO was especially forthcoming: he told FRIPPEL of his
A'
According to the Statutes (Ustav) of the Komsomol in effect
in 1954, the maximum age for a Komsomol member at that time
was 25. On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded
in October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. When
this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965,
NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomol
in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the
maximum age was 26 at that time, and that no special
exceptions were made in his case.
** See Part V.F.9.
***PREISFREUND is discussed in detail in Part V.E.4.a.

The thumbnail biography of NOSENKO which KOROLEV
and ROSENTAL submitted to the editors of Paris Match in
October 1966 (see Part III.H.) stated that NOSENKO was
"closely acquainted with the country's leaders, families,
and homes" and that his "father who died several years
ago was an important official in the Party and state
organs. The document went on to say that "NOSENKO's
family consists of a wife, 35, two daughters, 10 and 12,

INTRODUCTION
This review presents the facts and observations which bear
on the bona fides of the Soviet defector Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.
"
The highlights of NOSE:KO's biography, as he has given it to
CIA, are as follows: He was born 30 October 1927, the first son
of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, shipyard worker who in 1939 was to
become Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. After graduating in 1951
from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow, where
he specialized in international law and the English language,
NOSENKO entered the Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the
Soviet Navy, serving first as a translator assigned to the intel-
ligence staff of the Seventh (Far Eastern) Fleet and then as a
senior translator and political officer at an intelligence unit
of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet. In mid-March 1953,.. immediately
following STALIN's death, NOSENKO left the Naval GRU to become a
junior case officer in the KGB. He was assigned to the U.S.
Embassy Section of the American- Department, KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from 1953 to mid-1955. During this period he was
initially responsible for operational activity surrounding Am-
erican journalists in Moscow and later for operations against
U.S. Army Attaches at the Embassy. When transferred to the newly
organized Tourist Department of the Second Chief Directorate in
1955, NOSENKO had as his targets vicitors to the Soviet Union
from the United States and the countries of the British Common-
wealth. Having handled a number of successful tourist opera-
tions, NOSENKO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the
section responsible for operations against American, British,
and Canadian nationals. Eighteen months later NOSENKO returned
to the U.S. Embassy Section as its Deputy Chief. Between January
1960 and January 1962 he was second-in-charge of all KGB activ-
ities against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and personally super-
vised operations against the Embassy Security Officer, the
Second Chief Directorate's most important counterintelligence
target at the time, and against American code clerks, collec-
tively the Directorate's most important recruitment targets.
At the end of December 1961 NOSENKO again was transferred to
the Tourist Department, this time as Chief of the American-
British-Canadian Section. Six months later he was made Deputy
Chief of the Tourist Department, and in mid-1963 he became its
First Deputy Chief.
From the time he first contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962,
NOSENKO's status has been under examination. Only now, three
years following his defection in February 1964, is a definitive
study of the bona fides question possible: the voluminous and
diverse reports by NOSENKO, coupled with collateral information,
required that much time for assimilation, correlation, investiga-
tion, and evaluation. NOSENKO'S Own testimony, interspersed with
representative subsidiary cases stemming from or related to his
reports, constitutes a large part of the evidence. This review
also draws upon statements and actions by other Soviets, colla-
tions with materials from other sources, and opinions by special-
ists of various kinds. These factual elements are presented
without comment or interpretation, except in the penultimate
section of the review where the evidence on the bona fides of
NOSENKO is evaluated and analyzed.

officer of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer to
sell two items of information. He said that the need for money
was his immediate motive for contacting CIA, although in the en-
suing discussion he said also that he was dissatisfied with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO emphasized, never-
theless, that he had no intention of becoming an American agent--
this was to be a one-time transaction, and after that he would
have no further contact with CIA,
Despite this original reticence, NOSENKO supplied consider-
able biographic information on himself and also discussed in
general terms certain additional KGB operations as well as KGB
organization and operational methods in Moscow. He understood,
as he had told MARK earlier in the day. that CIA would want more
information than the two items which he originally offered, and
he agreed to meet again two days later.
NOSENKO met CIA representatives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. always in the same safehouse. With the second
meeting on 11 June. his initial reservations disappeared almost
entirely. He answered most questions put to him on KGB organi-
zation and operations. most of his information being concerned
with the Second Chief Directorate. responsible for counterintel-
ligence and security within the USSR. NOSENKO seemed to be what
he claimed to be: a KGB officer in a sensitive position with
knowledge of important KGB operations,
NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised to
do everything within the limits imposed by personal security con-
siderations to collect information of interest; the areas of CIA
interest had been outlined to him. The only restrictions he
placed on his cooperation were his absolute refusal to permit
operational contact with him inside the USSR and his request
that no mention of his collaboration be made in correspondence
to Moscow. He promised to notify CIA. via an address he was
given, when he came to the West again,
C. Second Geneva Phase (January-February 19641
NOSENKO accompanied the Soviet delegation to a later ses-
sion of the Disarmament Conference (one having gone by in the
interim without his participation), arriving in Geneva on
19 January 1964. The next day he sent a cable to his CIA accom-
modation address announcing his presence, At the first of the
new series of meetings on 23 January he announced that he had
decided to defect to the United States citing as reasons his
continuing disaffection with the Soviet regime and the fact that
he probably would not have further opportunities to travel to the
West in the foreseeable future. Although he implied that he
wanted to defect as soon as possible. he agreed to remain in
place in Geneva for at least two or three weeks while arrange-
ments for his reception were being made in Washington. NOSENKO
had brought a large amount of new information, much of it in
scribbled notes, on KGB operational activity collected in the
18 months since his last meeting with CIA. Twelve more meetings
were held in a Geneva safehouse over the next twelve days, yary-
ing in length from one and a half to six hours.
D.
Post-Defection Handling (February 1964-Present)
On 4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO's defection, he reported that a cable had
been received from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate re-
turn to participate in a KGB conference on foreign tourism to

NOSENKO's exact statements and meaning on various specific sub-
jects. The protocols were in no way presented to HOSENKO as
documentary portions of a "confession," but rather as distilled
and final statements of what he did and did not know concerning
particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of each
protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom to indi-
cate that he understood and agreed with its contents; he was
allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to ask any

NOSENKO was asked, after reading each page and after completing
the entire protocol, whether he understood what was written there
and whether there were any more changes he wished to make.
was then asked to sign and date the statement, "I have read and
understood this report and certify it as correct." at the end of
the final page. With one exception, which will be noted later,
he did so calmly and without objections, although on one or two
of them he remarked that his statements were presented in such
a manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do
so, he was not able to suggest any changes of fact or presenta-
tion which would make them more accurate. Commenting on the
use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said on 4 March 1965:
"My life story is absolutely correct. Anytning I have signed
is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand what I am doing
when I am signing any paper.
This is an official document, and
I fully understand what I'm doing when I sign it as being abso-
lutely correct."
In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail
on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he entered the
KGB, in an attempt to gain additional insights into his charac-
ter and personality.

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until 14 August
1965 with the participation of Peter DERYABIN, a former KGB offi-
These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian,
were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience
in the KGB to obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's per-
sonal and professional background.
There were no further debriefings or interrogations until
18 October 1966. On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the
case of Lee Harvey OSWALD.
During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned for
seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his
identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera-
tions. Questioning was in both Russian and English.

II. SUMMARY OF OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
A.
Introduction
From the CIA side, the NOSENKO case can be divided into
three periods: the first Geneva phase of June 1962, the second
Geneva phase of January-February 1964, and the post-defection
handling of NOSENKO from February 1964 to date. The rest of
Part II is separated into these three periods accordingly.
B.
First Geneva Phase (June 1962)
▾
The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of
the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations Dis-
armament Conference. A then-unidentified Soviet, known to him
by sight from conference meetings, approached U.S. Foreign Ser-
vice Officer David MARK with the suggestion that they get to-
gether for a talk the following day. In the late afternoon of
6 June, the same Soviet motioned MARK aside and said that he
would like to talk to him privately as soon as possible. He
told MARK that he was "not going to pump him for information,
'but simply wanted to tell him some things." A luncheon meeting
was arranged for 9 June, although the Soviet clearly preferred
an earlier date. MARK advised CIA of the appointment, explain-
ing that he thought the approach so unusual that it might be
an offer of cooperation or defection. He said he believed the
Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO, a member of the Soviet
delegation to the arms talks.
At the 9 June luncheon with MARK, NOSENKO told MARK that
he, NOSENKO, was a KGB counterintelligence officer sent to
Geneva to ensure the security of the Soviet delegation. He knew
that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he was
connected with American Intelligence.* He needed approximately
900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB operational funds which
he squandered on liquor and a prostitute in Geneva, and he offered
for this amount to sell two pieces of information to American
Intelligence. The first of these was the identity of a former
U.S. Embassy employee in Moscow who was a KGB agent and, as of
1962, was "near ciphers" in the Washington area; the second was
the identity of a Soviet in Moscow who, although ostensibly a
CIA agent, was actually planted on American Intelligence. Al-
though NOSENKO at first told MARK that he would stop at the sale
of these two items, he later stated: "I know you won't let me
alone now.” At another point NOSENKO said: "I will not work in
Moscow, but I come out about once a year." NOSENKO also gave
MARK a brief chronological account of his personal and profes-
sional past. MARK explained that although he was not an intel-
ligence officer, he could place NOSENKO in contact with the
Intelligence Chief in Geneva later that same day.
MARK introduced NOSENKO to a CIA officer at 2000 hours that
evening, and a three-hour meeting followed at a CIA safehouse in
Geneva. Describing himself as a KGB Major experienced in opera-
tions against the American Embassy in Moscow and against tourists
and other travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO told the CIA
Another Soviet source,
has also reported that the
KGB suspected MARK to be an American Intelligence officer;
although he has never served in CIA, MARK did engage in a num-
ber of operational support activities on behalf of CIA while
stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

thing."
The second event bringing NOSENKO to special notice occurred
at about the same time that NOSENKO established contact with
CIA and may, in fact, have been the incident which he said drove
him to contact David MARK. On 15 June 1962 (ten days after

At his first meeting with CIA NOSENKO said that a week
and a half earlier he spent 1500 Swiss francs in a single night
of drinking and women with KISLOV. The necessity of repaying
this money, taken from KGB operational funds, was the immediate
cause of his contact with CIA, according to NOSENKO.

time NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.
Detailed interrogation of NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964
in order to obtain information which he had been reluctant to
give in debriefings, and to clarify contradictions in what he
had already reported. This phase of the interrogations was termi-
nated on 24 April 1964.
Despite the searching nature of the questions and the im-
plicit and explicit doubts of his veracity, NOSENKO proved him-
self willing to answer, or to try to answer, questions put to
him. Because much more information pertinent to the question of
his bona fides had to be obtained, a new phase of interrogation
was begun in mid-May 1964. Different interrogators were intro-
duced and questioning was resumed in a neutral, non-hostile man-
ner. The period of neutral questioning continued until mid-Novem-
ber 1964.
After further consultations with the FBI, a new round of

questioned for a total of about 140 hours by individual interro-
gators and by interrogation teams consisting of two or three
men, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous re-
ports. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements had
been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions in
his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had been
basically truthful, and that he had come to the United States
solely for the reasons he had originally given. This interro-
gation was broken off on 5 March 1965.
Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of 1964
and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated
on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Embassy Section
of the American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, from
January 1960 to January 1962. Among the reasons for selecting
this particular period were the comparatively large amount of
collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state-
ments could be checked; the importance of the U.S. Embassy and
its personnel as the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate
targets; their importance from the standpoint of American
security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti-
vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its
Deputy Chief.
In keeping with Soviet practice, CIA asked NOSENKO in
February 1965 to sign a series of interrogation reports, so-
called "protocols," most of which concern the period of his
claimed service in the American Department. These were written
by the CIA interrogators, and they were designed to incorporate

the Soviet Union. " Exfiltration plans were then implemented,-
and WOSENKO was driven across the border to Germany that same
night. Debriefings resumed in a Frankfurt safehouse. The de-
cision was reached on 11 February to bring. NOSENKO to the
United States, and in the early evening of 12 February he and
his CIA escorts arrived in Washington via commercial aircraft,
thence to a safehouse in the Washington area.
At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSENKO
met on 14 February with representatives of their respective
Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service. He told both that he had defected of
his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no
desire to return to the Soviet Union. In answer to the questions
of the Soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and
rights as a citizen of the USSR.
CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru-
ary, and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of
the FBI for questioning. At about the same time, there was a
marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline: He became evasive and
uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his
debriefers, both CIA and FBI; his nightlife in Washington and
nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude behavior,
and disputes with his security escort. He explained these
actions by saying that he was under great tension as a result of
his defection, abandonment of his wife and children, and the
disgrace that he had brought to his family name. It was against
this background that CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca-
tion. On 12 Marcn, therefore, NOSENKO left Washington with a
CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week
vacation in Hawaii. There his behavior deterioriated still fur-
ther: He drank heavily and almost constantly; he engaged in
sexual acts with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude
in public places; and he spent money extravagently ($800 on
one prostitute) and conspicuously (a $100 bill for a restaurant
tip).
During NOSENKO's absence, consultations were held with
the FBI concerning steps to be taken to restrict his movements
and activities. Both agencies feared that his behavior would
bring about unwanted attention and publicity, perhaps police
arrest, and that doubts about his bona fides, which were be-
coming known to a widening group of people in the U.S. Govern-
ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself. The
FBI on 1 April said it would "not interpose objection" to the
CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's freedom of movement.
The Acting
Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House
were also notified of the CIA plan at this time.

graph examination. At the safehouse NOSENKO was given a rou-

A.
OPERATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Earlier Information on NOSENKO in Geneva
NOSENKO's name first came to the attention of CIA in October
1960 when he applied at the American Embassy in Moscow for a visa
to enter the United States as a member of an automotive delega-
tion. The following month CIA obtained copies of his passport
photograph at two separate points on his TDY route to Cuba.
There was no indication of intelligence affiliation, and when
NOSENKO arrived under true name with the Soviet delegation in
Geneva in March 1962. he was accorded no more than the interest
routinely given by Western intelligence services to Soviets
travelling abroad.* After arriving in Switzerland, however, but
before establishing contact with CIA, NOSENKO was involved in
at least two incidents which brought him to the special notice
of the British, Swiss, American, and possibly the West German
services.
The first of these occurred in April 1962. At a cocktail
party in Geneva, NOSENKO met a female secretary employed by the
British Foreign Office. He saw her several days later in the
corridors of the Palais des Nations and asked her to have dinner
with him, and a date was made for several evenings later. Ac-
cording to the secretary's later account as reported by her
superiors: "They talked about Marxism, the Chinese, Yugoslavia,
and love; NOSENKO was obviously smitten with her, became verbally
amorous, and told her that he would like to take her off to a
desert island." The girl felt that NOSENKO probably was not
interested in her for intelligence purposes, but seemed to be
genuinely attracted by her. From her conversations with NOSENKO
she was able to report that "he had been in submarines during
the war and, according to himself, had risen to the rank of
Commander. He was a member of the Communist Party. His father
was in the Ministry of Shipping. He himself had served in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1948 and 1949 and had apparently
visited England but had not been stationed there." NOSENKO
also told her that he was acquainted with
of the
✓✓ publishing house in London.** When NOSENKO became too
persistent in his attentions, the secretary reported the contact
to her superiors, was withdrawn immediately from Switzerland,
and later resigned from the Foreign Office.
.
This same incident also brought NOSENKO to the attention
of the Swiss service, which later reported it to CIA, without
details, as an attempt on NOSENKO's part to recruit the girl.
*Although NOSENKO was described in reports (held by CIA) con-
cerning recruitment approaches to Americans in Moscow prior to
His first arrival in Geneva, there was no basis in these re-
ports to identify the Soviet described as NOSENKO. The name
NOSENKO did not appear in these earlier reports.
:
was one of NOSENKO's targets during a 1957 trip
to the Soviet Union. NOSENKO used the alias NIKOLAYEV in his
contacts with and, in CIA debriefings, gave this as the
reason he was forced to use the name NIKOLAYEV in the two trips
he made to London in 1957 and 1959. The secretary knew NOSENKO
by true name. (See Parts V.D.3.d. and V.E.8. for discussion of

--- Image 104-10210-10037_page_33.jpeg ---
14-00000
According to this report, Jafter a time it became evident that
NOSENKO's interest in her was not only sexual, but also in
information to which she had access in the course of her duties."
A official in Geneva told CIA that NOSENKO had definitely
tried to recruit the secretary and that he attempted to obtain
"disarmament secrets" from her.
At his second meeting with CIA on 11 June 1962, NOSENKO
described the same incident, in the context of reporting a pos-

'Listen, Yura. Be careful, because we have people even in

as follows:

reception for members of the delegation and at it I saw
a certain English girl. Then RUSK gave a reception and she
was there again. I came to the reception, she saw me,

Reasons for NOSENKO's Presence in Geneva (1962 and 1964)
1. TDY in 1962
•
When NOSENKO arrived in Geneva for the first time on
10 March 1962, he was 1isted officially as a Soviet Ministry of
Foreign Affairs "export" with the Delegation to the disarmament
talks. Early during his second meeting with CIA on 11 June 1962,
NOSENKO was asked to explain precisely why he had been sent out
to Geneva. He replied as follows: "Right now, I came to pro-
vide counterintelligence support to the Disarmament Delegation....
There is a special (KGB) department for delegations, a special
one, recently created. And the chief of this department is
simultaneously a deputy chief of the [Second Chief] Directorate.
He is both chief of the department and deputy chief of the
directorate so that there will be a person who can be held re-
sponsible if anything happens. Understand?
Understand? The chief of the
directorate [0.M. GRIBANOV) hated to sign all sorts of recom-
mendations and so on, when someone can run off in Belgium or
wherever he may be. This happened more than once, and he was
summoned before the [CPSU! Central Committee. Therefore, he
decided to create a new position. The person holding it is
simultaneously chief of the department and deputy chief of the
directorate and personally signs off on all matters concerning
exits (from the USSR). This was in order to avoid being called
on the carpet...so that blame would fall not on the chief of
the directorate, but on his deputy, who is in charge of this
department and who signed off...
"This department," NOSENKO continued, "is concerned with
departures abroad, that is, it checks all Soviet citizens who
intend to travel abroad, both alone and as members of delegations.
Since GOLITSYN [defected] in Finland, we have an order that no
delegation is to be lot out without an operational worker, not
a single delegation... With me it happened as follows: I was
not planning to go. They told me: 'You are going. I said:
'I can't. I have a section. I have 15 people
I have 15 people there, all
operating people. Am I supposed to dump them? What can I do?'
'No, you are going, was the reply. 'And what did the chief
order?' I asked. The chief [NOSENKO was referring to GRIBANOV
when he spoke of the "chief".) said: 'GROMYKO is going this
time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is going, and somebody
on an appropriate level must go with him. Not a case officer.
not a senior case officer, not a deputy, but the chief of a
section, or the deputy chief of a department, or a department
chief.' Well, I was the most junior section chief. I was
called in to my chief, my immediate chief, who is concerned
with the Seventh Department.
Department. They had told him that it would
be for a month and on this basis he gave me permission.
I have been here since 10 March."
And
Later during this second meeting NOSENKO volunteered that
in addition to his security officer functions in Geneva, he had
a special assignment to check on P.F. SHAKHOV, a senior advisor
to the Soviet Delegation.* SHAKHOV had been noted in contact
*CIA records show that SHAKHOV has served in and visited the
United States on numerous occasions since 1942, when he was
assigned at the Soviet Consulate General in New York.

Department was looking for a case officer to make this trip
they wanted to have a chief of section because of the serious-
ness of the SHAKHOV case. When they asked in the Seventh
Department (V.D.) CHELNOKOV agreed that I should take the as-
signment. There was no background or neighborhood investigation
conducted on me in connection with my being approved for this
trip.* My assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department,
by the Personnel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by
the Central Personnel Office of the KGB and by the Central
Committee of the CPSU."

trip immediately after assuming the duties of the Chief of the
American Tourist Section, on the eve of the tourist season,

was not thought that the assignment would last so long, and
CHELNOKOV, his superior and friend, had decided to let him go
as a "treat."
During interrogations of October 1966 NOSENKO was ques-
tioned further about his 1962 assignment to Geneva as a security
officer. He said that in this capacity he would necessarily
know the identity of all other KGB officers serving with the
Soviet Disarmament Delegation in Geneva. There were only,
besides himself, the KGB First Chief Directorate officers M.S.
TSYMBAL and I.S. MAYOROV. (CIA, however, has tentatively
identified three other delegation members as KGB staff officers:
A.K. KISLOV, observed in Washington and in Moscow in what
appears to have been KGB operational activity; V.G. FILATOV, who
served as an alternate handler in the KGB operation with the
NATO officer Georges PAQUES; and Oleg GRINEVSKIY, a member
of the permanent Soviet Delegation who handled a
double agent during this same conference.) NOSENKO included
GRINEVSKIY in the list of his own agents in Geneva in 1962
and said that, in Moscow, GRINEVSKIY was handled by an offi-
cer of the Intelligentsia and Correspondents Department of
the Second Chief Directorate. KISLOV, according to NOSENKO,
was an operational contact in Moscow of the Austria-Germany-
Scandanavia Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate
and was used in operations against the West German Embassy
there. NOSENKO also said that KISLOV had been a KGB operational
contact during his earlier tour in the United States but was

he is "definitely not an intelligence officer."

Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate that the SHAKHOV
investigation was the main reason for his assignment to Geneva
in 1962, NOSENKO later in the day stated: "My main task was to
check the security of the delegation, plus SHAKHOV. You can't
separate these tasks."
In this questioning NOSENKO described the basis for the
suspicions of SHAKHOV, the lack of results from earlier inves-
tigations, and his own preparation for this assignment. He
said that as a representative of the Soviet Delegations De-
partment of the Second Chief Directorate, M.G. SITNIKOV had
conducted investigations of SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but
SITNIKOV was unable to resolve the questions concerning him.
Because of the failure of these early efforts, the KGB decided
to send "a senior guy" to the Disarmament talks in 1962, and
NOSENKO was chosen "to finish things up." Before leaving Mos-
cow in March 1962, NOSENKO therefore discussed the SHAKHOV
case with SITNIKOV and with one (fnu) LYALIN, the Soviet Dele-
gations Department officer in charge of the SHAKHOV case; he
also read various materials on the case, including an investi-
gative plan drawn up by LYALIN. NOSENKO's description of these
preparations provided the basis for the questioning which
followed:
Question: Why was SHAKHOV under suspicion in June 1962?
NOSENKO:

little, little, little things before.
Also,
When did SHAKHOV and MARK first meet? How did
it begin?
In '60 or '61 there was a contact with MARK.
I don't remember who reported it. The report
was maybe from SITNIKOV in Geneva. MARK was
known to the Second Chief Directorate as the
Rezident [CIA Chief of Station) in Moscow.
After Moscow he went to Geneva, and it was con-
sidered he must be the Rezident in Geneva.
All the KGB officers going there were told to
pay attention to him.
Question:
What about the report?
NOSENKO:
Maybe the officers saw the two going to the
toilet. Maybe there was a contact. The file
said "maybe." I was sent to Geneva to carry

had no CIA missions in Geneva in 1962. Within the context of
discussion of NOSENKO's security officer duties during October
1966, NOSENKO was asked to name any CIA officers he knew to be
present in Geneva during the 1962 disarmament talks. MARK was
the only one he cited.

first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications
that he passed it on to American contacts. Next, SHAKHOV was
told to perform countersurveillance tasks during a meeting by
NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, while other KGB officers
checked for signs that SHAKHOV had forewarned the Americans
about the meeting. Finally, NOSENKO revealed to SHAKHOV the
location of a KGB "dead drop" and checked back five days later
to see whether the specially prepared materials which had been
placed in it had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's con-
clusion from all this, he told CIA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-
solutely free of suspicion, and it was his intention to report
this finding when he returned to KGB Headquarters.
On later occasions NOSENKO reported that SHAKHOV had
previously served with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the
United States and that during this period he acted as an agent-
recruiter for the KGB. In 1966 NOSENKO named one person whom
SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in the United States,
SHAKHOV, according to NOSENKO, was not and never
had been a KGB officer. Asked why SHAKHOV was permitted to
travel abroad when he was suspected of being an American agent,
NOSENKO explained that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the KGB could do nothing about his trips
abroad. "There was no proof, only suspicions, and furthermore,
SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the
Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN.
"
NOSENKO was questioned again about his 1962 assignment to
Geneva during the February 1965 interrogations. His answers
were incorporated in a "protocol" which NOSENKO certified as
being correct on 26 February 1965. The protocol states:
"GRIBANOV had nothing at all to do with my assignment to Geneva
in 1962. I think that the fitness report written about me for
this trip was signed by [F.D.] BOBKOV, since he was the Deputy
Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the
Seventh (Tourist] Department. I did not personally discuss
this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow. My
candidacy for this assignment was supported by (S.G.] BANNIKOV,
the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, who super-
vised the work of the Eleventh (Soviet Delegations Department
which had the investigative file on SHAKHOV. BANNIKOV was

Francisco, the 1955 Paris Summit Conference, and many disarmament

in New York as a member of the Soviet Mission to the UN in 1963.

Motivations and Intentions of NOSENKO
1. Introduction
NOSENKO has not indicated that his professional status in
the KGB, his standard of living in the Soviet Union, or his
family life prompted him to volunteer to American Intelligence
in 1962 and to defect to the United States in 1964. He initially
told CIA that he had been unusually successful during his ten-
year carcer as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest
friends and the people whom he admired most were members of the
KGB; he enjoyed his work. The NOSENKO family held a high social
position, and their economic situation was "luxurious by Soviet
standards." NOSENKO described his family life as close and .
harmonious. He spoke with fondness and pride about his two
daughters, of his wife's tolerance and understanding, of the
companionship she gave him. He expressed love and a sense of
responsibility for his widowed mother, who heavily depended
upon him after the death of his father in 1956. The elder
NOSENKO won his son's admiration for having worked his way up
from an apprentice pipefitter in a shipyard to the position of
Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. The NOSENKO name is honored
in the home town of Nikolayevsk, where the shipyard has been
renamed for the former minister and where a statue of him has
been erected in the town square. By his own account, NOSENKO
thus had had a rewarding home life and a successful and enjoy-
able career in the KGB.
'2.
Collaboration in 1962
At the outset in 1962, NOSENKO said he wanted to limit his
reports to two items of information. Before the first meeting
with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de-
tails on the KGB Second Chief Directorate and other operations,
and he offered to meet again. (Four more meetings ensued in
1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB.)
He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety
was endangered by the KGB. Motivations in coming to American
Intelligence, according to NOSENKO, were his financial emergency
in Geneva and his disaffection for the Soviet regime.
a.
Readiness to Report to CIA
During his 9 June meeting with David MARK, NOSENKO said he
realized, even before talking to representatives of American
Intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two
items of information alone--he expected them to insist on more.
He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the same
day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue
took place:
NOSENKO:
Case
You see, I am not planning to be your agent...
and don't think that I am going to work with
you in Moscow. No. No...
As you have said, I am an intelligence officer
Officer: as are you. And I think that we will understand
one another.

but when you decided to meet him in Moscow...
You want more than I came with the intention

I am supposed to become the deputy chief of a

Why are you telling me this?
Because I wanted to come [to CIA] only for a
business deal, to give you these two cases,
to receive money for this, and that's all.
Goodbye. Perhaps, sometime, when I come
abroad, we will meet one another and perhaps
I will give you something. God knows. But

to and I am not prepared within myself for this...

them ("ANDREY"**), I took no part. In the second

I want you to understand that these two matters
that you spoke to Mr. MARK about are of great
importance to us. But I don't have to tell you
that. You know that. But we are not going to
play like children. You know perfectly well
that it is worth every franc... What I want
to tell you is this: of course I will ask you
more, and of course 1 want to know as much as
you know.
If you refuse to answer, that's your
business.
I will tell what I am able to tell. What I
know, I will tell. Of course, you yourself
understand that there are things concerning our
internal system that I cannot report to you.

2. The 1964 TDY
out measures to check.. There were many little,
little things. MARK maybe turned his head a
certain way when SHAKHOV was talking. [S.M.]
GOLUBEV, formerly of the Fourteenth [Counterin-
telligence Department, was in the Soviet Dele-
gation with SHAKHOV.* He noticed little details.
When the officers in the United States decided
to terminate SHAKHOV (as an agent], they wrote
a report on him which said he was liking life
in the U.S.--American products, money. He was.
pictured as not good and, in addition, he was
not wanting to work as an agent.
NOSENKO's 1964 trip to Geneva, commencing on 19 January, was
also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis-
armament Delegation. He said he was the only security officer
for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again
he was officially listed as an "expert." NOSENKO reported that
he had three or four agents within the delegation and an equal
number of operational contacts. The only person whom he was
instructed to watch in particular was A.A. TKACHEV, an inter-
preter, who had travelled to Austria in 1960 and 1961 and who,
the KGB had noted, was in the habit of going about by himself.
Other than this, according to NOSENKO, his responsibilities
were general in nature.
NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 interrogations
how he was selected for this TDY. The protocol he signed on
26 February 1965 states: "GRIBANOV had absolutely nothing to
do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964. The fitness report
on me for this trip was signed by [F.D.) BOBKOV. For the 1964
trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of the
CPSU was required for me or for any other members of the dele-
gation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. It was my own
personal wish to make this trip in 1964 and I had discussed the
question with [V.D.] CHELNOKOV even in 1963 and had received
his agreement. I had also talked about this with [M.V.]
KHLOBUSTOV and [G.) PANCHENKO [both of the Soviet Delegations
Department]. After it had been decided that I would go, in
about the beginning of January 1964, [N.T.] ZHARIKOV, the Chief
of the Department, suggested that a case officer might not be
required with this delegation. KHLOBUSTROV, PANCHENKO, and
[A.G.] KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO's
immediate supervisor] supported me for the assignment as a
personal favor to me." With regard to GRIBANOV's knowledge of
his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSENKO said that he
feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TDY he would have said,
It was
"What, again?" and would not have permitted him to go.
for this reason that NOSENKO did not discuss the trip with GRI-
BANOV, he said, and he did not believe that GRIBANOV, in fact,
knew anything about it.

been in the KGB since shortly after the war, NOSENKO, without
further prompting, gave a detailed statement of his own personal

· and generally the functions and operating techniques of the
various components of the KGB Second Chief Directorate in which
he had served, along with the inclusive dates of his service
in each. This account was very similar to that given MARK
earlier in the day. Still without prompting, he discussed
several specific KGB operations against Americans inside the
Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University
professor on the basis of homosexual compromise and the other
an unsuccessful attempt to recruit an American code clerk.
NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.
The question of his further assistance was then raised
again: The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the
Yale professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree-
ment involved only two pieces of information and ignoring the
fact that he had already given considerably more:

11 June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself
raised the issue of motivation. His case officer had just said
that CIA would respect his wishes in connection with a particu-
lar request when NOSENKO said: "Speaking of respect, how can
there be respect? I don't even respect myself for what I have
done. But, but, take the press bulletin, the communique of
the Summit Conference in Moscow on various questions. Again
lies, lies, lies, to show that we have had great successes.
can't see them (the successes). No, excuse me, I know somewhat
more than the rank and file Soviet man because I work under this
system. I can see what is being done and what is not being done.
Lies, more lies. This was my mood. I say, 'How much is it pos-
sible to deceive the people, the Soviet people? How far can
you go?' Our people are very poor. It is somewhat difficult
to arouse a people such as this. If we stir ourselves up we
will know how to stand up for ourselves. But I feel for my
people. How often can you say that things will be good; how
often can you say that we have achieved big successes? Where
are they? Show me them. I can see no trace of them. This is
what I say...that there is resentment in my soul. Do you under-
stand? A terrible resentment. I love my country. You may say
that this is nothing. But I tell you that I cannot act like
GOLITSYN, like KHOKLOV, like PETROV, because I want to be there.
I want to be with my family. That's all. But I feel that not
only the government is making mistakes. I feel that there are
faults throughout the entire system of socialism. What I mean
is that things are bad in Czechoslovakia, things are bad in Po-
land, things are bad with KADAR (in Hungary), they are starving
in China. This means that there are great mistakes. Well,
that's all. What did you want to ask me, please?"
At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money
was unimportant as a motive for a continuing relationship: "My
name must not be used anywhere, even in your offices. Understand?
It would be the end of me. I am not afraid of this. The devil
with them. Because I have had such a life. I lost my father,
everything. Why do I say this? I did not come to you simply
because I needed money. I don't need it. I came because I am
resentful inside. Do you understand this internal resentment?
I do not believe in what is being done. I do not believe in
this. Listen to me. Let me speak honestly. Have I not had the
chance to live as a person should? My father was a big man. He
had a dacha and a state-owned automobile. I have my own Volga
[automobile]. My mother was given a dacha for life. It's.

America this is nothing, but for Moscow this is enormous. We

This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two
leads which NOSENKO had come to sell; the BELITSKIY and the
"ANDREY" cases.
As NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case
officer asked when they might meet again. NOSENKO suggested
that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as
it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime.
He then said that the case officer was probably trying to get
everything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because
of the risk to his security resulting from such a permanent re-
cord of their conversations. NOSENKO said: "I will not tell
you anything particularly interesting. But I can tell you some-
thing. But not today. I can tell how LANGELLE blew POPOV--not
LANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him--for your
future use, so that you will know how to operate. But LANGELLE
was not guilty. It was not LANGELLE who was guilty. Another
person was responsible for the compromise. Next time.”

14 June 1962: The subject of motivation was not discussed
during the third and fourth meetings with NOSENKO. As he was
about to leave the Geneva safehouse after the fifth and final
session, however, NOSENKO again touched on the economic inequi-
ties existing inside the Soviet Union and raised a new reason for
cooperating with CIA, his basic sympathy for the American people.
NOSENKO said that he realized that the reason he had given for
coming to us, his need for money, was "not good.

explained that it was not the technical progress of the United
States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of
living of the American people. It was rather the openness and
directness with which the Americans whom he had met and seen
handled themselves. As examples he cited his American targets
in Moscow and Secretary of State Dean RUSK, whom he had seen in
Geneva.
He
Although NOSENKO did mention the difficult economic situa-
tion in the USSR on a few other occasions, he did not relate
these remarks specifically to his motives for volunteering to
CIA. The above excerpts are representative of his total state-
ment on motivation during the 1962 meetings.
3.
Decision to Defect (January 1964)
On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the second
Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that after long
and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting series, he had
decided to defect. He once again criticized the Communist regime
along the same lines as during earlier meetings, but his immedi-
ate motivation seemed to have nothing to do with this. NOSENKO
explained that he had recently been promoted to the position of
First Deputy Chief of the Seventh (Tourist) Department of the KGB
Second Chief Directorate, and that because of the stature and
responsibilities of his new job, there would be few opportunities,
if any, for him to visit the West in the future. Therefore, he
had decided to seize the opportunity at hand and to flee to the
United States at once, leaving his family behind. He foresaw no
possibility of his wife and children being permitted to leave the
USSR for the "next twenty years." NOSENKO told CIA that "the
hardest thing is to part with my family." He had, however, care-
fully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector,
and he knew that, because of his mother's position in Soviet somi
ciety, no harm would come to them.
Whereas NOSENKO declared his intent to defect immediately,
the CIA case officers at this first meeting in 1964 persuaded
him to remain in place for at least two or three weeks on the
grounds that, first, CIA would benefit much from this; and
second, arrangements for his transfer to and reception in the
United States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA
Headquarters.

During this first meeting NOSENKO made no monetary request
of CIA and asked only for reasonable assurance of a secure future
in the United States. In this connection, he said, he would
prefer to act as a CIA consultant, particularly on counterintel-
ligence matters because he was a specialist in this field; he
would be able to give CIA leads and assistance in spotting and
recruiting other Soviets.
The next five meetings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively
to debriefings on the activities of the KGB Second Chief Direc-
torate. Although his impending defection was mentioned, his
reasons for taking this step were not discussed. In the mean-
time, NOSENKO's first CIA handler flew to Washington for dis-
cussions regarding the defection and, on his return, told
NOSENKO that the CIA leadership had asked why, specifically,
NOSENKO had decided to come to the United States at that time.
The answer was that NOSENKO, "after coming back and seeing that
there was no more chance to come to the West, or little more
chance,'
felt that this was his one opportunity to come and make
his life with the Americans. Therefore, he was going to seize
the opportunity while he had it. Asked about this, NOSENKO con-
firmed that this was his reason; and added: "I may never have
another chance, and in addition, I've had sufficient time since
our last meeting here in Geneva [1962] to weigh everything and to
consider everything.' Later in this same meeting, NOSENKO again
mentioned his lack of interest in money and his feelings about
deserting his family: "I understand [that it will be difficult
to adjust to a new life in America] and know that for some time
I will be sick within. And I know that a certain period of
time must elapse before this can heal. I even spoke to you
bluntly about my (financial) security. I am absolutely un-
mercenary and have never had any appreciation for money or
wealth... My most difficult and sorest spot of all is my family.
This is the most basic and most difficult spot of all. And I
know perfectly well that I must go through an illness over
this. For this the only and the best doctor is time. I don't
expect to have a new family there. Of course, I don't know--
but at least I'm speaking from the way I feel now. I have a
strong liking for children--not only for my own, but for all
children and, losing my own, I am fully conscious how I must
suffer through this. In time I will get used to it. I know
one can get used to almost anything."
At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to remain in place for
approximately another week, and the tentative date of 8 Febru-
ary was selected for the defection.
NOSENKO's motives for the defection were not- mentioned
for five more meetings. Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned
the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once. Ar-
riving shortly thereafter, he announced that he had been or-
dered to return to Moscow the following day and, therefore, had
to leave Switzerland before morning. He stated his reasons
formally in an asylum request, written at the time:
"This decision was made by me, not now, at the
moment I write this request, but several years ago.
Having worked for many years in the KGB and knowing
more than the average Soviet citizen about the policy of
the Soviet government, about the direction which this
government has chosen to take, and about the law and
order in the USSR, I have come to the decision that
i

:
or of the degree of this cooperation was never raise aga n.
At the very start of the second meeting, on 11 June, he said's
"I am tortured all the time by a single thought. Everything
now depends upon you, only on you. The slightest careless move
by your people and it will be the end of me." Although he
sometimes voiced moral compunctions, from this point on NOSENKO
expressed his primary personal concern as being his own secu-
rity vis-a-vis the KGB.
b. Attitude Toward Defection
While willing to meet with CIA representatives during
future trips outside the Soviet Union, which he estimated would
occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused to consider
defection except in circumstances where his personal security
would be endangered. His devotion to his wife and children and
the probability that the KGB would take reprisals against them
if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations behind this
refusal. (Without elaborating on the reasons, NOSENKO said on
another occasion that he would not want to leave the USSR even
on a permanent KGB assignment and accompanied by his family.)
Other considerations included his widowed mother's dependence
on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed
to the regime. For these reasons, NOSENKO said, he could not
defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KHOKLOV had done.
•
c. Motivation
NOSENKO told David MARK on 9 June 1962 that he wanted to
contact American Intelligence because he was in trouble over
the loss of KGB operational funds, for which he had to account
prior to his imminent departure for the Soviet Union. His KGB
career would be ruined if he was caught misusing this money,
NOSENKO added, and because he had nowhere else to turn, he was
willing to sell two items of information to MARK. The amount
needed to cover the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210,
and this was the price asked for the information.
NOSENKO's statements of motivation to his CIA case officers
during subsequent meetings are given below:
9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO-
SENKO asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted
to meet with American Intelligence. He then very briefly re-
peated what he had told MARK concerning the loss of his opera-
tional funds. The case officer remarked that there must be
something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not,
in fact, his main motivation: "I have been working in this
business for a long time and I know what I am doing. I have
heard more than is written (in the newspapers]. A reorganization
has been started in the USSR. In short, they have begun to do
away with the ministries and the sovnarkhozy. But this is pre-
mature. Right now our agriculture is falling apart at the seams
and our industry is at the point of collapse because this re-
organization, this innovation, is too early. And this is not
just me, a young man, talking. I mingle with ministers, with my
father's friends, and I hear what they are saying. And how much
does a worker earn? 600-800 rubles in old money, now 60-80.
And he doesn't sense any improvement (in his position] within the
total population. These are empty words only. We have exceeded
the United States in per capita production of butter and milk.
But how can it be said that we have surpassed you when they are

4. The Letter of July 1964
The most complete explanation given by NOSENKO of his
motives for first contacting CIA and later defecting to the
United States is contained in a letter to his CIA case officer
in July 1964. He described this letter as "an exposition of
all those reasons and root causes which led to the decision
to leave the Soviet Union" and further explained that "every-
thing put down here is lacking in a whole series of lesser
details which to a greater or lesser degree played their
role."
Nevertheless, he said, he had tried in this letter
"to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the
decision was born, grew, and hardened within me to completely
alter the course of my life." This letter is presented below
in its entirety. Most of the biographical and operational
details mentioned in the letter are covered separately in other
parts of this paper.
"1. My life, my childhood and youth passed in
very comfortable circumstances since the position of
my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking
for anything. And the only difficult periods of my
life (before the death of my father) were:
study in
the naval schools in Kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad;
and the beginning of my working life, the period in
the Far East (1950-1952). The opportunity to be
always well-dressed, to have a sufficient amount
of money, to have my own car, to be able to use the
car given me by my family and also my father's car,
the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca-
tion in the best sanitariums, dachas, and so forth;
all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be-
came something of a habit. After the death of my
father, my successful progress in my work gave me a
higher salary, and although I did not have all that
which I had while my father was alive, still I did not
experience any serious difficulties. But already I
wanted to live still better.
"2. Up to 1953, over the course of my entire
life--at school, in the Institute, at work, at home
in the family--it was always pounded into my head
that STALIN was a great genius, that he was good, keen,
etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question
his words or his deeds because everything that he
said, and everything he did, were completely axiomatic.
The arrests and trials only involved traitors and it
was considered and explained that the people who
suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938,
suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937,
1938, was the betrayor of the people YEZHOV. Not
even the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN.
Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain
document given me by my father. This was a secret
letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the
'case of the doctors;' it was not addressed to all
communists but only to members and candidate members
of the Central Committee. I was deeply shaken by this
letter which described in detail how these people,
TOP SEOPEY

!
unless I entered the Party. But from the very be
ginning of my entry into the Party, I deeply hated
all the Party talmudism and dogmatism. All the
Party meetings were literally a torture. Especially
when I became the deputy chief of the section, the
chief of the section, and the deputy chief of the
department, because then I had to speak at these
meetings. Because this meant to lie, to twist my
soul, and to attempt to show myself as deeply dedi-
cated to the Party and its course.
"11. In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks
became worse. The question of a change of climate
was raised. At that time the SCD needed to send an
officer to Ethiopia for two to three years to conduct
counterintelligence work among the Soviet specialists
there. It cost me a great deal of effort to personally
talk GRIBANOV into letting me go. The Party and work
references had been confirmed, all the questionnaries
were already filled out, the photos had been submitted;
that is, all the formalities had been accomplished.
But at the very last moment the Central Personnel of
the KGB began to protest against my going with my
family to Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from
the house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came home in
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels
with my wife. A tour abroad with my family was neces-
sary because of the health of my daughter (since 1963
the illness has become better) and also it would
have been advantageous from the financial point of
view.
From this time on I understood that Personnel
would not let me go abroad with my family.
"12. Knowing many officers in the FCD, I began
to understand that being sent abroad is entirely
determined, not by knowledge, experience in work and
success, but only by the absolute 'cleanliness' of
the person's autobiography and complete assurance as
to his limitless dedication to the Party and the
government. But not only being sent abroad but the
assignment of personnel in the First and Second Chief
Directorates and the entire KGB depends on the reasons
indicated by me and also on good relations with the
Eadership and good connections with workers in Central
Personnel.
"13. I lived about 11 years with my wife and our
life was not a hell. It is true that there were
quarrels and basically they boiled down to the fact
that she took an extremely unfavorable attitude to-
wards my delays at work and also when I would be de-
layed with some of my friends and acquaintances after
work and would come home with a few drinks under my
belt. Of course, I loved and love my children and only
the fact that they are taken care of financially until
they grow up and have received an education to some
extent consoled me in taking the decision to leave the
USSR. What do I have in mind when I speak of financial
security? After the death of my father, the family
received a large monetary allowance, plus the money

The events in Germany and especially in.
Hungary showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy
of communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was:

emphasize that the life of the people in these coun-
tries was much better than that of the people in the
USSR (I saw for myself how people live in Czecho-
slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live
better than the entire people of the Soviet Union).
"7. The split of the international communist
movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed
my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory
built on sand and that it is practiced according to
the needs of the leadership of the Party at a given
stage of life and that in reality full material wel-
fare would never be enjoyed by the people but only
by the leadership and the Party and the government.
Working in the KGB I came to understand
much and became conscious of the contradiction between

questions as disarmament, the ban on atomic weapons, the
position of the USSR in the United Nations--all these
are used only in the interest of propaganda and as
a screen for carrying out of the policies needed by
the communist party. (I was myself present at the
negotiations in Geneva and saw the 'politics' of the
Soviet delegation.)

My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the
true reality. With my own eyes, I saw how people
live, how much they earn, how they can dress and live
on their wages, and I paid special attention to the
life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,
engineers, etc. And all the propaganda about the
enormous armies of unemployed in the countries of the
West, about the 'heavy exploitation', and the 'un-
believably difficult life' flew immediately out of
my head.
And that which I met with in my work, the
sending of Soviet citizens abroad--who gets sent where
and how, etc.--this finally debunked this propaganda.
Many of my acquaintances--GUK, CHURANOV and others--
think back with great pleasure about life abroad.

continually insisted on this, saying that without the

excluded the possibility of a trip abroad and it
only with great difficulty that I was able to get away
for the trip in January 1964. It was necessary to con-
vince CHELNOKOV and then to ask CHELNOKOV to convince
BOBKOV and in 1963 to convince KOVALENKO. In this I
advanced many reasons: that I had not spent all the
money (in foreign currency); that the medicine which
I bought for my daughter had proven very successful
and that I needed to buy some more medicine to carry
out one more series of treatments; that this trip
would not be a long one and that since I was already
the deputy chief of the Department I would not be able
to travel abroad any more and so, therefore, this trip
would probably be my last. Of course, all this was
said at convenient moments and outside of work.
Things were easier with the Eleventh Department (which
deals with trips abroad) because I was on good terms
with PENCHENKO who covered Switzerland, besides which
when I came back from Geneva in 1962 I had brought him
a number of presents.
#18. The publication in 1963 by the foreign press
of the VASSALL case put me on my guard since in the
newspaper Times it said outright that the English
learned about him thanks to the Americans who learned
about VASSALL in the spring of 1962. Fortunately, the
leadership of the FCD, as I learned from GUK, CHURANOV,
and TARABRIN, came to the conclusion that here the
Americans had been helped by GOLITSYN.
helped by GOLITSYN. But at the
same time the FCD was not completely sure of this.
But the publication in the American press of Alsop's
articles on the CIA alarmed me extremely.
This ar-
ticle in one spot said plainly that as far as is known
the KGB does not have any sources in the CIA while at
the same time the CIA has penetrated the KGB. From
this moment, I do not conceal this fact, I began to
feel afraid that the KGB would somehow learn of my con-
tact with you. This article deeply 'interested' the
KGB.
*19. During the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I
got a pass in the Second Department and went in order
to look at him myself. For sometimes it is enough
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked how
PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked his ap-
pearance and I understood that everything which had
been said in the KGB about him and the sort of person
they were trying to make him out to be (that he was
morally degraded, that he had descended and sunk into
a swamp) that all this was nonsense, bluff, and chatter.

of greater confidence in the correctness of the deci-
sion taken by me to leave the Soviet Union.

important specialists in the field of medicine, were
brought to such a condition that they condemned them-
selves; that is, they confessed to things which had
never happened, to things which they had never done.
They were simply forced to give the evidence which was
needed by the Investigators. The secret letters on
the cult of STALIN and much that I heard in the KGB
about the reign of STALIN, all this left its mark and
forced me to think deeply about the real truth and to
look at everything more critically. Already I no
longer had faith in all those ideas which for years
had been pressed into my head.
"3. The new leaders (KHRUSHCHEV and Company)
used the same methods but already diluted with the
water of democracy, with playing up to the people
and attempts to convince them that a new era would
arise, a new and better life, and that now the Party
was always going to concern itself with the welfare
of the people. In fact, it was a struggle for power
and the use of all means in this struggle, even
microphones (they listened to the conversations of
BERIYA and his friends; later they listened to the
conversations of MOLOTOV, MALENKOV, KAGANOVICH, and
others). KHRUSHCHEV's endless blabbing about suc-
cesses, when in fact they didn't exist, the figures
about how the USSR had passed the USA in the produc-
tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were
available only infrequently. The endless promises
of a better life when in fact nothing of the sort is
taking place. All this similarly forced me to re-
evaluate not only the events which were taking place
in the country, but already the entire ideology of
the Party, its external and internal course.
. #4. The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000
to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with many
casualties. This also made a deep impression on me.
When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev,
from my relatives--my father's brothers--I understood
well the real relation of the workers both to the
leadership and to the Party as a whole. At the same
time I saw how the workers really lived, how they eat,
what they have and what they can buy with their wages.
"5.
I heard a great deal from my father about
the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the
development and the course of construction in industry,
about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno-
logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci-
sions in regard to many industries, and this was not
only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor-
tant leaders in various fields of industry (MALYSHEV,
VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But no one dared to
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci-
sion would be incorrect, he received such a rebuff
from KHRUSHCHEV that he was profoundly shaken and in
the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill-
ness in 1956 and his death in August 1956.

that my mother had saved and valuable property, etc.
My mother many times offered to divide all this in
three parts: for me, my brother, and for her, but I
suggested that we not do this before her death.
And;
of course, my mother will not leave my children without
attention, and my share of the property and the money

DERYABIN passed without evoking any particular
thoughts, the defection to the United States of GOLIṛ-

a capable officer, undoubtedly caused me to think
very deeply. Because to act thus, it is necessary
to have not only boldness and decisiveness, but also
great strength of will. And already I put to myself
the question, will I be able to act thus in view of
the dissatisfactions and disillusionments which had
accumulated inside of me?

would have been unable to accumulate such a sum of
money before my departure and there was nobody to

cial difficulty and at the same time he was already
preparing for his return home). To tell the truth
about the loss of the money would have meant that it
would be necessary to explain where and in what cir-

ROSENKO's Activities in Geneva
Introduction
The extent to which NOSENKO made himself available for
meetings with CIA in Geneva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed here
in connection with his statements about the KGB duties assigned
to him for these trips, his visits to the KGB Legal Residency,
Although
and his personal association with other Soviets.
NOSENKO was not precise about how he spent his days and nights
in Geneva, he did indicate that he was his own boss, disposed
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little to
do. At the first meeting with CIA in 1962 he accounted for his
freedom of movement by saying: "I can come and go as I please
at any time. (Ambassador) ZORIN knows who I am, almost the
entire delegation knows who I am, because I don't need to pre-

to place NOSENKO under surveillance in 1962 and 1964, and there
is no evidence from other sources confirming or disproving
NOSENKO's statements about his activities while away from the
CIA safehouse.
2.
Official Duties in Geneva
11
In 1962 NOSENKO said he was the sole KGB officer in the
94-man Soviet delegation to the Disarmament Conference and as
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the
entire delegation.* To assist him in carrying out these security
officer functions, NOSENKO had the services of a number of
coopted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega-
tion. In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check-
ing on suspicions attached to one of the delegation members,
P. F. SHAKHOV** but by the time he established contact with CIA,
he said, this assignment had already been completed.
In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to
handle the general security responsibilities for the Soviet
delegation, as he had done in 1962. There was no specific
mission such as the one concerning SHAKHOV in 1962.
NOSENKO has described his investigations of SHAKHOV, but
he has never indicated either that he conducted security checks
of other delegation members in 1962 and 1964, or that he re-
ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from
the KGB cooptees who were supposed to be reporting to him.
Likewise, NOSENKO has not said that he prepared communications
for KGB Headquarters regarding his clandestine assignments in
Geneva.
3.
Visits to the KGB Legal Residency
Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV,
would invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.
I.S. MAYOROV and M.S. TSYMBAL also arrived with the delega-
tion in March 1962 but had left Geneva by the time NOSENKO
contacted CIA.
SHAKHOV is discussed further in Part III.3.1.

.
GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,
and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March-1962 –NOSENKO
gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled members
of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV's
request, although it was only after some hesitation on the part
of the Legal Resident that all of his subordinates were brought
together to hear NOSENKO. (In return for helping the Legal
Residency to perform counter-surveillance on several occasions,
NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed by GAVRICHEV to have the
use of an operational car and driver to go shopping and carry
out other private errands.)
Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was making nearly daily
visits to the Legal Residency. During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO
stated that it was his close relationship with M.S. TSYMBAL*
which made it possible for him to have visited the Geneva Legal
Residency so frequently, both in 1962 and 1964. "According to
the strict rules," NOSENKO told CIA, "an officer in a status
such as mine should not even go to the Residency. In this case
it is only because I am deputy chief of a department and GAV-.
RICHEV knows my position perfectly well (it is not lower than
his), and because I have such a sympathetic personal relation-
ship with TSYMBAL. He then went on to say that TSYMBAL "sort
of escorted me to the Residency. They could have simply said:
'You are here on a mission, we have our own mission, and we
have nothing in common. But, NOSENKO indicated, this was
not the case, thanks to TSYMBAL's intervention.
4. Association with TSYMBAL
At the second meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered
information on TSYMBAL's KGB background and his current missions
in Geneva, then alluded to his having spoken with TSYMBAL in
Geneva but without placing any particular emphasis on this
relationship.
In 1964, however, NOSENKO claimed that their relationship
was close, explained that it was TSYMBAL (again in Geneva at
the same time) who gained NOSENKO's admission to the Legal
Residency, and said that he had twice gone to see TSYMBAL off
on train trips, once on 24 January when TSYMBAL went to Bern
and again on 28 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome.
NOSENKO told CIA he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960
or 1961. At that time "We were looking over some candidates
for recruitment and came across some whose background would
have made them suitable for the Special (Illegals) Director-

Conference, I got to know him a little better more from the

-
TSYMBAL appeared in Geneva under the last-name alias
"ROGOV" and was identified by NOSENKO as Chief of the
Illegals Directorate, KGB First Chief Directorate. Since
1956, TSYMBAL was known by CIA to be the true name for
ROGOV, and GOLITSYN reported in 1961 that TSYMBAL was
Chief of the European Department, KGB First Chief
Directorate.

didn't." NOSENKO also said that TSYMBAL had asked him several
times to transfer to the First Chief Directorate and had
suggested that he might be assigned to the United States.
fact, NOSENKO added, he had got into some difficulty with 0. M.
GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, by virtue of
TSYMBAL's efforts in 1962 to have NOSENKO transferred and his
leaving the impression with GRIBANOV that NOSENKO (who was still
in Geneva) had agreed to this action.
Questioned in April 1964 about his association with TSYMBAL,
NOSENKO stated that he met TSYMBAL for the first time several
days before their departure for Geneva. Besides saying again
that he saw TSYMBAL almost daily at the Legal Residency and
that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter the Legal Resi-
dency, NOSENKO reported that in 1962 he went out with TSYMBAL
several times a week to eat lunch or dinner; sometimes they were
joined by I. S. MAYOROV,* sometimes by A. K. KISLOV (see next
section), and sometimes the two ate alone. During the 1966
interrogations, NOSENKO said that, while he had seen TSYMBAL
on a daily basis in 1962, he saw him only twice in 1964. once
when TSYMBAL travelled to Geneva from Bern for one or two days
and later when NOSENKO saw TSYMBAL off for Rome from Lausanne.
5.
Association with Other Soviets
NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most
often were A. K. KISLOV and Yu. I. GUK.** KISLOV, with NOSENKO
was one of the four members of the Soviet delegation staying
at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva, and was said to be head of the
American Section of TASS and a genuine correspondent. During
the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO reported that KISLOV was.
not a KGB officer and made no reference of his having any
affiliation with the KGB. NOSENKO did say, however, that he
had arranged for KISLOV's name to be given the KGB double
agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of
information on Soviet disarmament policy; BELITSKIY was to
pass this information to his CIA contacts. NOSENKO made
numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV,
specifically with regard to a night in early June - when
NOSENKO was robbed of or squandered his operational funds,
which brought him to CIA and on the night of 10 June 1962
when NOSENKO squandered 2000 Swiss francs (the money CIA had
given him) on wine and women.
In giving NOSENKO the
money to defray these personal expenses, the CIA handlers
expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security
arising from KISLOV's knowledge of this inexplicable source of
income. NOSENKO replied that there was no need to be concerned
since KISLOV was "too drunk to know what is going on," and in
any event he constituted no threat.
-
"
MAYOROV, according to NOSENKO, was visiting Geneva in
order to have operational meetings with agents.
Both KISLOV and GUK are mentioned in the discussion of
the "ANDREY" case (see Part VI.D.3.b.). GUK was also
friend of GOLITSYN, who reported extensively on GUK's
* career in the KGB including his service in the United
States.
In October 1966 NOSENKO named all the Soviets living at
the Ariane, without mentioning KISLOV.

Part VI.D.6.

E. Timing of Defection
After telling CIA on 24 January 1964 of his decision to
defect, NOSENKO at the same meeting concurred when CIA gave
operational and administrative reasons for him to stay in
place until the middle of February. During the week that fol-
lowed, the date of the defection was moved up to 8 February
in accordance with NOSENKO's wishes and with his reports in-
dicating that less information of value would be forthcoming
than CIA had at first thought. On 4 February, however,
NOSENKO reported that he was being recalled to Moscow for a
conference on foreign tourism in the USSR, and he therefore
placed himself in CIA custody on that date. * Details on
the timing of NOSENKO's defection are given in the following
paragraphs.
+
At the 24 January meeting the CIA case officers agreed
in principle with NOSENKO's decision to defect. NOSENKO
felt that it would be best for him to disappear from Geneva
without a trace, leaving all his personal possessions be-
hind; he assumed that CIA could exfiltrate him from Switzer-
land to the United States. He wanted to carry out this
plan as soon as possible, but the CIA officers encouraged
him--and NOSENKO agreed--to remain in place for at least
three weeks more. The reasons given NOSENKO for this re-
quest were:
E
-
The desire to get information on the local KGB
Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to the Dis-
armament Conference while he still had access to this
information;
->>
The value of having NOSENKO present when 0.M.
GRIBANOV made a visit to Geneva about 7 February a
visit known to CIA only through NOSENKO;**
-
The potential value to be derived from NOSENKO's
in place spotting of CIA recruitment targets among the
Soviet representation in Geneva;
-
The necessity of making arrangements, accept-
able to NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.
The events which followed NOSENKO's agreement to remain
in place for a short time longer are chronicled below:
* The report of NOSENKO's recall to Moscow for the con-
ference on tourism is discussed further in Part III.F.
** GRIBANOV was in 1964 the Chief of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate and, according to NOSENKO and other sources,
the sponsor of NOSENKO's rapid rise in State Security.
Several
sources, have reported that GRIBANOV
was fired from the KGB as a result of NOSENKO's de-
fection (Part III.I.). NOSENKO's relationship with
GRIBANOV is discussed in Part V.H.
TOP SECRET

14-00000
*In 1964 NOSENKO confirmed that he had spent much time with
KISLOV in Geneva two years before and that they had become
very friendly. For the first time, NCSENKO reported that.
KISLOV had been a KGB operational contact while in the United
States, that he had been introduced to KISLOV by a KGB officer
in Moscow prior to his departure for Geneva in 1962 in order
to be able to exploit him during the Geneva Conference, and
that after returning from Geneva. KISLOV had been recruited as
a KGB agent on the basis of a favorable report NOSENKO had
prepared.
Often during the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his "big,
big friend" GUK, whom he described as the Deputy Legal Resident
in Geneva and the only "strong officer" in the KGB Legal Resi-
dency. He implied that his friendship with GUK, a former member
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, was of longstanding. NOS-
ENKO related that he and GUK were together nearly every day in
Geneva. They often went out together to chat and have a few
drinks, and as a consequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor-
mation about some of GUK's operations there. In 1964 NOSENKO
told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the
activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because he no longer
had a good friend there like GUK, who had been reassigned to
KGB Headquarters. When questioned later in 1964 about his
relationship with GUK, NOSENKO said he had come to know GUK
well only during his 1962 TDY in Geneva.
6.
Availability for Meetings with CIA
In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed
displeasure over MARK's insistence on deferring their luncheon
(at which NOSENKO sought contact with American Intelligence)
until three days later. When the first meeting with CIA did
take place on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO stayed for three hours,
and it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled
for 11 June. This second meeting in 1962 lasted seven hours.
NOSENKO remained in Geneva until 15 June, and in the interim
he met CIA officers three more times for over seven hours
altogether. He offered to meet again on the day of his de-
parture, but this proposal was rejected as needlessly endan-
gering his security.
From the first 1964 meeting on 23 January to his defection
on 4 February, NOSENKO was met a total of 13 times, the sessions
lasting for five or six hours. He was able to come to the CIA
safehouse every day but one, and this opportunity was skipped
at the request of the CIA handlers. By mutual consent, most
of the meetings started in the afternoon, but on two occasions
NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours; several meetings went
on until past midnight. NOSENKO appeared to be totally at
the disposal of CIA, to be the master of his time, and to have
no other demands for his attention except for the visits to
the KGB Legal Residency, "looking in" on an occasional session
of the Disarmament Conference, and attendance at a reception.

authorities would probably be made late on 5 February or early
on the 6th.
NOSENKO was driven to Frankfurt the night of 4 February
and remained in a safehouse there until 11 February, when press
publicity about the defection and Soviet demands for an immedi-
ate interview with NOSENKO prompted the Director of Central In-
telligence to order that he be brought to Washington as soon as
possible. He arrived in the evening of 12 February.

26 January 1964: In a three-and-a-half hour meeting,
NOSENKO emphasized that although he agreed that it was
necessary and useful for him to remain in place until the
GRIBANOV visit to Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as
possible thereafter.
not
28 January 1964: NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might
not be coming to Geneva after all, for KGB Chairman
SEMICHASTNYY was apparently reluctant to permit him to
travel beyond Vienna. NOSENKO said that he would probably
have definite information on GRIBANOV's trip by the end
of the week.
30 January 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series,
NOSENKO said that there now appeared to be little likelihood
that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.* Therefore, he
wanted to defect right away. As reasons he cited the
emotional strain of any further delay and the fact that he
and his case officers were wasting their time working
against the local KGB Legal Residency, which had no worth-
while or promising targets. He also felt that nothing of
value could be obtained from the Soviet delegation because
"TSARAPKIN himself doesn't know what he will say until he
is told by Moscow the day before." The CIA handlers, however,
delayed the defection for one week by obtaining NOSENKO's
agreement to assist in an audio operation: CIA proposed to
install listening devices in the offices of the KGB Legal
Residency, and NOSENKO said he would check certain physical
aspects of the delegation buildings. As the best time for
the defection, he suggested Saturday morning, 8 February,
because he probably would not be missed until the following
Monday. This date was tentatively scheduled, and NOSENKO
again repeated his desire simply to "disappear without a
trace." He also asked about exfiltration plans.
31 January 1964: NOSENKO reported the results of his
reconnaissance of the KGB Legal Residency in connection with
the proposed audio operation, which would involve microphone
transmitters operating on a carrier current. He told CIA he
had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building
used its own batteries and generator, and therefore the
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain
in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers, which
he was told were enroute from Washington. He explained that
he had felt pressure at the previous meeting because of an
imminent move by the delegation from its hotel to the Soviet
villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would
be noticed more quickly. This move, he had now learned, had
been postponed pending the arrival of a housekeeping officer
from Moscow.
From 7 to 10 February 1964 GRIBANOV was in Paris, where
he was seen on the street with a Soviet identified by
NOSENKO as a KGB counterintelligence officer. There is
no evidence that he visited Switzerland.

"
1 February 1964: At NOSENKO's request, it was firmly
agreed that the Jefection would take place in the morning
of 8 February. NOSENKO said that he assumed that exfil-
tration would be by automobile to West Germany and thence
by plane to the United States.* His case officers con-
firmed that this was correct.
3. February 1964: NOSENKO reviewed the CHEREPANOV materials.
The defection was still scheduled for Saturday, S February.

house from his hotel room in the early afternoon and said:

explained that when he dropped by the KGB Legal Residency fol.
-lowing the morning session of the Disarmament Conference,
he read a cable ordering him to return to Moscow immediately
to prepare for a KGB conference on foreign tourism in the
Soviet Union.** The residency was arranging for a ticket for
NOSENKO to fly to Moscow via Paris the following day, and a
replacement was being readied to assume NOSENKO's duties as
security officer for the Soviet Delegation in Geneva; he was
not told who the replacement would be. Before he had left
for Geneva in January, NOSENKO then related, the Soviet Govern-
ment had been deliberating the question of expanding foreign
tourism in the USSR and had agreed to open a number of new
cities and tourist itineraries in this connection. SEMICHASTNYY
had now decided that it was time to call a conference to
discuss new "tactics and strategies" for handling the in-
creased number of tourists expected. Since NOSENKO had been
placed in charge of the entire conference, he was directed
to leave at once to prepare a basic report on the KGB handling
of tourists; the report would be read to the conference either
by himself or by someone from the leadership of the KGB or
the Second Chief Directorate. NOSENKO explained that he was
the only one who could do this job as Lt. Col. A.G. KOVALENKO,
the KGB Headquarters Department senior officer, was a rel-
atively new man in this line of operations, having been

fore the cable arrived, he was being moved to the Soviet
villa on the morning of 5 February. He had arranged for a
Soviet chauffeur to bring a car around at 0930 hours the
next morning for the move. His absence would be noted at
that time, and therefore "the main thing is to cross the Swiss
border before morning." NOSENKO felt, however, that there
would be considerable confusion among the Soviets in Geneva
for a time following his disappearance, and that there would
be no real concern until the evening. To foster Soviet un-
certainty he had left his clothing lying around his hotel
room and had brought no personal effects to the CIA safe-
house. NOSENKO estimated the first Soviet queries to Swiss

F. The Recall Telegram
On arriving at the safehouse at 1515 on 4 February 1964
NOSENKO related that on the preceding day, 3 February, he had
been to the KGB Legal Pesidency during the day and again in
the evening. ("e had met with CIA from 1200 to 1800 hours
on 3 February.) He related that as of that time "everything
was quiet and peaceful," and he received four personal letters
from Moscow. NOSENKO said that on the morning of 4 February
he had again stopped in at the Residency, but "nothing was
going on." Later in the morning, however, after attending
a session of the Disarmament Conference, NOSENKO learned that
the coded telegram described above had arrived from Moscow
ordering him to return ihately to Moscow to participate
in the RGL conference on tourism.
Special intelligence indicates, however, that no cable
traffic at all was seat from Moscow to Geneva from the late
afternoon of 3 February 1964 until the morning of 5 February,
the day after the defection. (Two priority cables of unusual
length, 247 and 207 groups, were transmitted to Geneva at.
1901 and 1915 hours Greenwich time on 3 February; there was
no traffic on 4 February; and the next message passed was a
routine cable originated by Moscow at 0755 hours on 5 February.)
On 26 October 1966, while being questioned about the
circumstances of his defection, NOSENKO was asked about this
telegram which recalled him to Moscow. NOSENKO said that
there was no such telegram, and that he had invented it in
order to defect as soon as possible because he was nervous
and afraid his contacts with American Intelligence in Geneva
might be noticed by Soviet authorities. After detailed
questioning on this point, NOSENKO voluntarily signed a
statement with the following wording.
"On 4 February 1964, I told my CIA contact in
Geneva that a telegram from KGB Headquarters in Moscow

Soviet Official Reactions
The Chief of the Soviet.Delegation to the Dis-
armament Conference notified the Soviet Ambassador in Bern
shortly before noon on 6 February 1964 that NOSENKO had dis-
appeared, correctly placing the date as 4 February; they
speculated that he might have been "poisoned" or injured in
*
a car accident. Two more days passed without Soviet authorities.
making any additional public or private statements on the subject.
Later events showing Soviet official reactions to NOSENKO's de-
fection are presented below in chronological order:
8 February: A Soviet spokesman in Geneva reported to
Swiss police that NOSENKO, an "expert" temporarily assigned to
Geneva, had been missing for four days.
9 February: Evening news broadcasts in Geneva carried
reports attributed to both Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO
had disappeared.
10 February: Unidentified Soviet sources were quoted in
the press as having said it was presumed that he had defected.
A U. S. Department of State press release was issued iden-
tifying NOSENKO as a KGB officer and acknowledging his request
for political asylum in the United States.
11 February: The Department of State was advised informally
by Ambassador DOBRYNIN in Washington that a Soviet note to be
delivered later would ask how NOSENKO had left Switzerland,
request his release, and demand an immediate interview with him.
17 February: S. K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Dele-
gation to the Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press
conference in which he strongly condemned the Swiss authorities
for permitting NOSENKO's "kidnapping" and for hindering efforts
to locate him. TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate steps be taken
to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody.
At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the
Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted
the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappear-
ance and Soviet failure to cooperate with Swiss authorities in
locating NOSENKO.
The Soviet note predicted by DOBRYNIN was delivered to
the State Department, and a noncommittal reply was given to

Apparently no effort was made to notify Moscow immediately.
Special intelligence shows that no cable traffic was passed
from Geneva to Moscow from 1630 hours on 3 February until
1900 hours on 7 February: at 1915 hours on the 7th, the
Geneva Residency transmitted a short top priority cable to
Moscow. Likewise, after one routine cable on 4 February,
the Bern Residency sent no traffic to Moscow on 5 February.
Seven cables, at least four of which were of routine pre-
cedence, were sent to Moscow on 6 February; thereafter there
was no traffic from Bern to Moscow until the early morning
of 10 February.

had been received in the KGB Residency in Geneva
recalling me immediately to Moscow. I said at the
time that this telegram said that I was recalled
to participate in a conference to plan KGB activity
against tourists for the 1964 season. I maintained
this story as fact throughout subsequent interviews
and interrogations by American authorities in 1964
and 1965. No such telegram ever existed. No tele-
gram was received in Geneva. I admit that the story
was a lie. I myself invented this telegram in order
to hasten my defection. I was nervous and afraid
that my contacts with American Intelligence might be
noticed."

Soviet queries concerning the requested interview and the
means of NOSENKO's departure from Switzerland.
The Swiss Embassy asked for a meeting with NOSENKO in
order to obtain assurance that the defection had been volun-
tary. Arrangements were made to have NOSENKO meet with Swiss
and Soviet representatives in Washington as soon as possible.
(NOSENKO arrived in Washington at 2130 hours this same
evening.)
13 February: NOSENKO said he had no objection to talking
to the Swiss, but he would see the Soviets only if necessary.
14 February: In Moscow, Ambassador KOHLER was summoned
to the office of Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO, who read
him a statement deploring the "evasive" reply of the State
Department to Soviet inquiries in Washington and terming the
whole event of NOSENKO's disappearance a "gross provocation
by American Intelligance organs. GROMYKO repeated the demand
for NOSENKO's immediate release from American custody.
The Counselor of the Swiss Embassy, Jean-Louis NATURAL,
interviewed NOSENKO at the Washington offices of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service late in the afternoon.
The Soviet confrontation immediately afterwards was handled
by Minister Counselor G. M. KORNIENKO, second to Ambassador
DOBRYNIN at the Soviet Embassy, and Third Secretary V. F.
ISAKOV, a recent arrival in Washington. (ISAKOV had been a
member of the Soviet Delegation to the 1962 Disarmament
Conference in Geneva, where NOSENKO said he had first met him.)
NOSENKO told both the Swiss and the Soviets that he had defected
of his own free will after careful consideration and that he
had no desire to return to the Soviet Union. In response to
KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced his status and
rights as a Soviet citizen.

like to serve as a stringer for the French journal and proposed
that he begin with a story on the life of the family of a.
"Soviet secret agent." As KOROLEV spoke only broken French
and English, the magazine staff did not seriously pursue the
matter at that time.
On 10 October 1966, however, KOROLEV again appeared at the
Paris Match offices, this time with one Feliks ROSENITAL who acted
as his interpreter. He displayed a photo spread showing NOSENKO's
wife and family going about their daily affairs in Moscow, and
he submitted a one-page document in English which gave a short.
account of NOSENKO's background. The document said in part:
"NOSENKO's family consists of a wife, 35, two daughters, 10 and
12, a mother and a younger brother. The family is not prose-
cuted (sic) but feel very badly about the incident (the defec-
tion). Very soon the wife will apply to the International
Lawyers Organization for a divorce and compensation. It is
possible that this case will be given much publicity. His wife
has not heard from him since he defected, but it is obvious
that he is still in the USA. The document, which was in no way
represented as coming from a Soviet Government source, also said
that additional photographs of NOSENKO's family in Moscow could
be obtained and that an interview with the family and with others
knowing NOSENKO could be arranged for a Paris Match correspon-
dent.*

:
According to information available to CIA, a divorce from
a defector from the Soviet Union, who is legally considered
to be an enemy of the state, is granted automatically upon
the wife's request. There is no known precedent for either
Soviet-inspired publicity or divorce difficulties in any
previous Soviet defection.

H.
Reactions of NOSENKO's Family
Two women who said they were the mother and wife of NOSENKO
called at the American Embassy in Moscow on five occasions
between 24 February and 23 March 1964, * and NOSENKO, who on
the basis of physical descriptions confirmed their identities,
said he had no doubt that the KGB had directed them to do this
in order to pressure him to return. The women expressed dis-
belief that NOSENKO had voluntarily betrayed his family and his
country. They sought a personal meeting with him in the United
States or anywhere else, submitted letters for him, and returned
to the Embassy to ask whether he had replied; the younger Mrs.
NOSENKO explained that she required some definite statement in
writing from her husband so that she could plan her own future
and that of the NOSENKO children.
NOSENKO proposed to respond to his family's letters by
writing two of his own, one which would be intended for KGB
consumption and the other for his wife alone. The first of
these would state NOSENKO's irrevocable decision to remain in
the United States and to sever all ties with his family and
homeland. The second letter would be read by Mrs. NOSENKO in
the Embassy, left there, and not reported to the KGB; in it he
would express hope for a reunion, ask her to wait for him, and
tell her to indicate her willingness to join him in the West
by writing either "yes" or "no" on the letter itself. Although
NOSNEKO prepared both letters, only the first was sent to his
wife; it was mailed from Washington to the NOSENKO home in
Moscow on 7 April 1964.
From March 1964 nothing was heard from NOSENKO's relatives
until mid-1966, when Yuriy Dmitriyevich KOROLEV, a Soviet
journalist, visited Paris and spoke with representatives of the
French magazine Paris Match. KOROLEV indicated that he would
Only once before had members of a defector's family called
at a foreign embassy in Moscow. Following the defection of
Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV in England in September 1963, his
wife appeared at the British Embassy to make inquiries about
him. KROTKOV, an admitted agent of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, is believed by MI-5 and CIA to remain under
KGB control.
** CIA records show that KOROLEV was employed at the Soviet
Pavilion of the Brussels World's Fair in 1958 as a photo-
correspondent for the Soviet publication Sputnik. He visited
Japan in 1963 and the United States in February-March 1965,
at the invitation of Life magazine, as a photographer for
Novosti, a Soviet news agency. On the latter trip he was to
be accompanied by Feliks Avramovich ROSENTAL, an interpreter
but no record of ROSENTAL's arrival is available. KOROLEV
is believed to be identical with Yuriy KOROLEV who, as of
1964, was employed part-time for the United Press Inter-
national correspondent in Moscow, Henry SHAPIRO. Both
NOSENKO and GOLITSYN have identified SHAPIRO as an agent
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate (see Part V.C.).

According to NOSENKO in 1965, it was BANNIKOV who sup-
ported his candidacy for the 1964 trip to Geneva; as
far as he knew, NOSENKO said, GRIBANOV was not involved.
Earlier, however, NOSENKO stated that his 1964 trip had
been approved by GRIBANOV.
Reportedly GRIBANOV continued an operational contact with
a Western Ambassador in Moscow until as recently as the
autumn of 1964. This is a type of activity in which
GRIBANOV was often engaged while serving as Chief of the
Second Chief Directorate.

Under interrogation in April 1964 NOSENKO was asked speci-
fically whether he had ever gone out socially with GRIBANOV
after working hours. He replied that he had done so on one
occasion and that TARABRIN was present at the time.
February 1965 NOSENKO was asked the same question and this
time answered that he had seen GRIBANOV three times socially,
most recently in October or November 1963; TARABRIN, he said,
was the only other person present on these three occasions;
all three outings began as drinking parties in Moscow res-
taurants and the latter two ended at the homes of girls

that TARABRIN was Chief of the British Department at the

established Service No. 2 (Counterintelligence) of the
First Chief Directorate.

A.
*NON-KGB ASPECTS OP NOSENKO'S LIFE
Introduction
The biography of NOSENKO is built largely upon his own atate-
ments to CIA, but certain portions of it have been substantiated
(as well as contradicted) by other Soviet sources. Given first
below is the NOSENKO autobiography for the period preceeding his
entry into the 108, then follows a summary of his statements
about his non-professional life since becoming a KGB officer, and
'Ifinally there is presented a review of what other sources have
said on these subjects. A separate section of this paper, Part V,
discusses NOSENKO's career in the KGB.
:
B. NOSENKO's Pre-KGB Autobiography
Although several other sources have since NOSENKO's defec-
tion furnished fragmentary information concerning NOSENKO's early.
personal history, NOSENKO himself has, of course, been the prin-
cipal source on this topic. He volunteered information during
the 1962 meetings, during debriefings in early 1964, and under
interrogation in April 1964, in 1965, and in 1966. These vari-
ous accounts are arranged in separate columns in the following
table, and they are organized chronologically from NOSENKO's
birth to his alleged entry into the KCB. The first column in
the table contains statements which NOSENKO made during the June
1962 meetings in Geneva; these were taken from the transcripts
of the meetings and, for the most part, are in NOSENKO's own
words. The column headed "1964," derived from the April 1964
interrogation, reflects a number of changes in his story before
and during that interrogation. Most of the information given
in the "1965" column was taken from discussions with NOSENKO,
mainly on his early years, by a CIA psychologist in May of that
year; however, material from the February 1965 interrogation
and from DERYABIN's interrogation in July and August has also
been included when it was not covered in the psychologist's ques-
tioning and when NOSENKO signed protocols certifying his state-
ments to be correct. The "April 1966" column is comprised of
remarks by NOSENKO in a signed autobiography submitted to CIA
at that time. The final column presents the results of the
October 1966 interrogation as they pertain to NOSENKO's early
life. From column to column appear inconsistencies and contra-
dictions with regard to dates and locations furnished by NOSENKO,
although in 1964, again in 1965, and most recently in October
1966 NOSENKO has said that he was "now" telling the truth. The
table shows where he has admitted having previously lied about
certain events and where he seems to have forgotten his earlier
statements to CIA about the occurrence of other events affecting
his life.
This tabulation of NOSENKO's autobiography concludes in
Part V.A., in which are quoted the various dates and circum-
stances concerning his entry into the KGB which NOSENKO has
given in 1962, 1964, 1965, and 1966.

While studying
at the IIR NOSENKO
was dating Augus-
tina Konstantinovna
TELEGINA, the
daughter of a lieu-
tenant general.
With help of tem-
porary documents used
for the trip to Ger-
many, NOSENKO managed
to exempt himself from
compulsory military
training during his
first two years at IIR.
When it was found that
his claims of active
duty were false, he
was commissioned a jun-
ior lieutenant in the
Reserves along with
his classmates. (May)
In third year at
IIR NOSENKO began to
specialize in Inter-
national law. (May)
"I was a friend
and companion of

months before her
father was arrested

of 1947, I married
Augustina Konstanti-
novna TELEGINA, who
was born in 1929"

I married her.
That's all.' [Note:
NOSENKO did not

other than to im-

after the war;
it is included
here to place it

later statements.]

TELEGIN was ar-

afterwards, in about
November 1947.

his wife in flaw
