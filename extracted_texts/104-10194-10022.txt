While an undercover avent for the Federal Bureau of Investigations
from 1946 to 1949 I used the name of Bernard
to members of
the Communist Party of the United States. This information is
already on file in this organization.
I became an American citizen at birth through the citizenship of
my father. This information is already on file in this organization.
Section 3B - My wife is employed by this organization.

->>>
I have many relatives in Spain and Cuba but do not correspond with
them and so do not know names, addresses or present status.
All persons mentioned in this section are employees of this organization.
Not having lived in the USA for over five years I have lost all contact
with old friends, neighbors, etc. I do not know their addresses,
status, etc., at this time.
My past connections with any subversive groups and the reasons for
such connections is already on file in the files of this organization.

Mr Hidalgo is ˜á, man of unusual background even in our unusual
organization. This background undoubtedly affords him qualifications
for our work, but nevertheless, on the professional level he suffers
from disadvantages as well--overcoming some but not others. He is
not well-educated in a formal sense, and in our world of words is not
adequately equipped to prepare finished written correspondence. He
has difficulty in organizing his work systematically thus at times
giving an impression that the preparation has not been thorough--which
might not really have been true.
On the other hand, Mr. Hidalgo has the advantage of native fluency.
in Spanish and an obvious understanding of the Latin thinking process
and culture. He is broadly experienced in operations, not only as a
case officer but as an actual agent himself, having served four years
as Bureau penetration of the CPUSA. He is operationally imaginative
and unquestionably possesses the ingenuity and courage to translate
ideas into action. In this respect, however, his efforts must be
channeled and selectivity exercised. On the Panamà Desk this officer
provides the valuable service of operational history and continuity;
he served six years in the Station and has been on the desk for three.

Mr. Hidalgo is an experienced and well qualified operations
officer, and it is indeed unfortunate that there are medical problems
which do not allow him to be assigned overseas. Since Mr. Hidalgo
cannot be assigned overseas, I too endorse his desire to be assigned
to OTR or to another assignment of his choice.

SECTION C Continued
Hidalgo, Balmes
Mr. Hidalgo is a gregarious uncomplicated person, generally
pleasant, and generous in his instincts--but not entirely without
his quixotic side--and one whose natural Latin emotionality has
been intensified by a life of experiences outside the norm
years as a CP penetration, air
air crashes war wounds, etc.
g
This officer is aware that is intellectual background and
medical debilities are obstructions to his advance. Understandably,
he has developed outside interests, apparently as compensation.
Expectedly, his attitudes at times so reflect.
-
•
In sum, Mr. Hidalgo serves a satisfactory function on the
Panama Desk and no doubt could continue to perform so
indefinitely, but in view of his limitations in a desk-bound
situation and the medical restrictions, both of which will
continue to inhilit his advance in his present component, this
supervisor endorses Mr. Hidalgo's desire to be considered for
transfer to another component, namely OTR (specifically covert
training), where his attributes would likely come more directly
into play. He has the operational experience, competency in a
foreign language, an outgoing personality, and experience in
lecturing and teaching.* Finally, regardless of the shortcomings
reflected in this evaluation, the grading officer finds much to
admire in Mr. Hidalgo personally.
*Should a suitable opening in that field be unavailable, it is
felt there would be morit also in considering Mr. Hidalgo's
other stated interests, i.c., the technical interrogation section-
of the Office of Security or 00 Contacts Division.

Mr. Hidalgo is a very capable case officer who is more suited to
a field position. He is adept at
has a keen operational mind. Hendling indigenous personnel and
He is good at grasping operational
leads but is not a capable writer. He has trouble expressing him-
self on paper* His Spanish language capability is a decided asset
to the Branch. A longstanding illness has limited his effectiveness
at the Desk. He is cost conscious and has no supervisory responsibil
co
ities.
Comments by Present Supervisor:
I concur in the above estimate of Mr. Hidalgo's operational
capabilities. During the months (Oct 1966 - March 1967) I have
worked with Mr. Hidalgo I have not found his health to be a factor
in his performance of his duties.

Mr. Hidalgo's health caused him to be absent from his duties
several times during the first part of 1966 but these absences
were for a limited period. From my observation, his health has not
presented a serious problem to the performance of his duties.
Several times during the absence of Mr. Tsikerdanos in the year
1966 Mr. Hidalgo was the acting desk officer. His performance was
most satisfactory, and his supervision of the other desk employees,
albeit for a limited period, was fully satisfactory.

Mr. Hidalgo is an able intelligence officer
able intelligence officer, deloped to his
profession and selfless in his desire to be of service to the Govern
ment. Although he has suffered ill health in recent years, he
was in-
sistent that he be among the first to be sent to the Dominican Republic
when the crisis occurred
-
An intense person, Mr. Hidalgo is industrious, works well under
pressure, and sets high standards for his performance. Because he is in-
tent on getting things done, he is occasionally hasty in judgment and in
written presentation of the results of his research and conclusions. He
is perceptive, quickly accepts suggestions and offers counter-proposals
with cogent argument. Mr. Hidalgo was not in a supervisory capacity.
He was cost conscious; always endeavoring to be conservative where possible
He is an effective and cooperative member of an office, ready
to assume responsibility and to help his colleagues. Thanks to his
unique experience on the Cuban target, he has wide knowledge of the
Cuban problem and is, in fact, an expert on the Cuban Security and In-
telligence Services.

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under
great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With
this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of
Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

Mr. Hidalgo has done a fine job during the reporting period, while assigned to the
CI Section of the Branch when it was in its most active period of buildup and operations
The manner in which he accepted any assignment is unusual and he was often working
under pressure, uring the period, he was on several temporary duty trips in
connection with operational activities which he completed very well.

b
He has a talent for getting along with and understanding Latin Americans, and
with his fluent Spanish language capability, he has performed in a commendable manner
While Mr. Hidalgo has never shunned responsibility, his assignment did entail the
delegation of extensive responsibility. It is the feeling of the Rating Officer
that be should be given the opportunity for greater responsibility, and training,
which will qualify him for a supervisory role. After that, he should be qualified
in all respects for promotion to GS-12.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Balmes N. šūdalgo,
SUBJECT
Exceptional Service Emblem.
7
•
Your request for consideration to receive the Exceptional
Service Emblem has been reviewed by this office to determine your
eligibility for the award. With considerable regret, I must concur in
the assessment that the injuries you suffered in the line of duty do not
fall-under the special criteria governing award of the Exceptional ·
Service Emblem. Hazardous duties, in the meaning of the governing
regulation, relate to duties performed in areas in which internal strife,
civil disturbances or hostile action by armed forces or persons un-
friendly to the United States were present at the time the injury was
incurred, or, relate to duties performed in an assignment defined as
hazardous due to unusual geographic or other natural conditions.
2. You may be sure that this decision has been based upon
thoughtful deliberation. Please accept my personal thanks for a job
well done under difficult conditions.

Mr. Hidalgo's fluent knowledge of Cuban Spanish, his previous
experience in DD/P Cuban operations, and his broad knowledge of Cuba
(people, geography, customs, etc.) made him a particularly useful an
versatile operations officer during his assignment in the WH/SA
counterintelligence operations section. As indicated in Section B.
(specific duties) he performed a wide variety of duties.
Mr. Hidalgo approached and performed his assignments with enthusiasm,
keeness; dedication, and promptness. He displayed a particular talent for
conducting debriefings, and it was in this type activity that he performed best.
He also writes well which added to his debriefing capability as well as to
his performance as a Headquarters desk operations officer in writing cables,
dispatches, niemoranda, etc, Mr. Hidalgo is cost conscious and effective in the
use of space, equipment and funds. "He does not hold a supervisory position.
Mr. Hidalgo performed most of his duties with a minimum of supervision.
In a few instances, however, he had a tendency (in his eagerness and desire
to get the job done well) to become impatient with the slow and deliberate
pace of progress which is sometimes necessary in operational activities.
In these few instances, Mr. Hidalgo's work required supervision by a
senior operations officer.

---
Mr. Hidalgo is a sound operations officer with native fluency in Spanish. His
impatience is with administrative delays rather than with operational problems
which he understands fully and handles well. He has had problems with his
health but these largely have been overcome and in the past 9 months have not
impeded his operational usefulness. As of the date of this fitness report, he
appears fully capable of handling any CI or FI operation assigned to him.

Mr. Hidalgo is an able intelligence officer, deloped to his
profession and selfless in his desire to be of service to the Govern-
ment. Although he has suffered ill health in recent years, he was in-
sistent that he be among the first to be sent to the Dominican Republic
when the crisis occurred.
An intense person, Mr. Hidalgo is industrious, works well under
pressure and sets high standards for his performance. Because he is in-
tent on getting things done, he is occasionally hasty in judgment and in
written presentation of the results of his research and conclusions. He
is perceptive, quickly accepts suggestions and offers counter-proposals
with cogent argument. Mr. Hidalgo was not in a supervisory capacity.
He was cost conscious; always endeavoring to be conservative where possible
He is an effective and cooperative member of an office, ready
to assume responsibility and to help his colleagues. Thanks to his
unique experience on the Cuban target, he has wide knowledge of the
Cuban problem and is, in fact, an expert on the Cuban Security ars In-
telligence Services.

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under
great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
·more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With
this consideration noted. the undersigned thinks very highly of
Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demunamated in current nosition keeping in proper perspective their relationship fo
overall performance. State suggestions mode for improvement of work performance. Live recommenuations for honing:
on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best
basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory dutiès must be described, if
applicable.
Mr. Hidalgo joined WH/PO/A in November 1961 and took up those responsibilities
listed above. However, Mr. Hidalgo's performance of duties was interrupted on
two occasions by serious illness, 9-27 March and 15 April-31 May 1962. He was
twice hospitalized. From 25 June-9 August 1962, Mr. Hidalgo was on TDY for WH/3
as escort officer for Latin American trainees. Although beset by health and other
personal problems, Mr. Hidalgo seized upon each new assignment with his customary
energy. He proved particularly adept in working as interpreter and escort officer
for Latin American trainees, and demonstrated high interest and proven competence
in counterintelligence work. His excellent memory and quick perception, were
distinct assets in these undertakings.
It is recommended, however, that Mr. Hidalgo's next assignment not carry
responsibility for submission of finished papers or staff studies, but be one
entailing duties commensurate with his ability to work effectively with indigenous
personnel and to pursue CI leads through records investigation.
