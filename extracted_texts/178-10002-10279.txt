Now, turning to the Miami Station's involvement for
assistance to the Secret Service in connection with the

describe for me the nature of the assistance provided by
the Agency to the Secret Service?

name traces on individuals whom the Secret Service wanted
traced. These included the employees of all hotels in Miami

Foreign news people and media, television, radio people.
Q Were these people on whom name traces were requested
all foreign nationals?
A
All foreign nationals.
Was there any check made to determine whether
any of them were American citizens?
A We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement
7
that they have identified these people by nationality before
13
we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time
14
they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens
15
which we promptly sent back to them and told them we could

not trace.

They were traced back here and also in Miami.
The

Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had
more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

A Normally, the requirements are pretty standard,
or they were at that time. But here again, you always have
ad hoc type things that pop up from time to time, and have to
be surfaced.
Some of these contract employees were, then, in
the business of collecting intelligence information in the
Cuban communities in Miami.
A
Right.
Now, I think we finished with the AMOTS but can
you think of any other functions performed by the AMOTS that
we have not discussed in the course of the afternoon?

Watergate' trial. Some of these allegations that came out

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

There are no domestic activities at all in the
Miami Station. All Cuban activities have been moved back
here to Headquarters. The Niami Station now is completely
and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean.
Does the Miami Station I beg your pardon
TH
does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban
situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have
109

a career agent who has been with us for a good many years.

in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
freed
12
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.

who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths,
this

type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
17
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like
18
19
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double him,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we
20

find out where relatives and these types of people are, We
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever.

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a
boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations
and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,
sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in
any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever
do it on any of our boats, planes, or anything that belongs
to the Agency.
Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain
a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting
together his own crew?
11
A
12
No. He had an assigned crew and every boat had a
Case Officer operating either out of the

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't
destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

A I can't speak to that but the records
don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin
American Division before they did anything since we do hold
the file.

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

It was this type of thing that obviously he was
trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any
money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't
want him to get the exchange. So it was those types of
activities.

many the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the
American community, by American bankers, and obviously they
lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the
lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange, this
type of thing, and it was naturally our Number 1 target. So it
was only natural that we would go to the American businessmen.

buying almost the entire output of the Nicaro mines. And this
French firm ex ported to the United States. So we went to

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as
much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type
of operation that we did.

some cane fields. Really, the classical operations that we

kits to be used by our own island agents. They contained
sugar to dump into gas tanks and metal fragments to put down
crank cases. Things of this nature.

frequently they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper
phase for communications and this type of thing. And these
things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our
own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We
contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped
it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking
down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have
everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive
equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going to
extend the credit.
The railroad system was in total disaster. The
Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done.
And then when it
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar
firm buy it back from the Soviets.

Fishing companies?
Well, fishing companies, Geodetic Survey, marine
supply. In all, I think during the period that the station
and these other entities were under commercial cover, or non-
official cover, I think we had 100 so cover companies.

Did any of these companies actually engage in any
legitimate commercial activities?

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved

in.

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could
have been used to debrief people within the community, within
the Cuban community, but we had in the organization all these
people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an
On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he
had a couple of assistants; including a secretary. These people
were directly under his control. Though the organization as it
was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,
but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.
