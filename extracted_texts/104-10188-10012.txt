MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
: Project KDAFGHAN Termination
1. A request for termination action is contained in
paragraph four, herein.
2. Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-
erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to
assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation, and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations.

The KDAFGHAN project en-
associated with the project since 1962.
3.
'
While this project may be of some value to the FBI
(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of
known leaders of extremist groups in the U.S. as well as with
photographs of persons who are subjects of identification
orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is
of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City
Station. There are other means of obtaining photographs of
PCS and TDY Cuban personnel.
4.
In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review
of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overall
security. Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no
apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period
of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity
to the Cuban Embassy, and the potential (perhaps immediate)
danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

Problems and Security
"
No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. Neither were there any security problems encountered
during the period. Gerald D. FAHLANGER continues to be the
Case Officer and handler of KDAFGHAN-1. FAHLANGER has met
and could continue to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency.
alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets
The
KDAFGHAN-1 when FAHLANGER is not available. Both Case Officers
are known to the assets in alias, and both meet KDAFGHAN-1
in a safehouse. During February 1971 the safehouse was
changed in compliance with normal operational security.
Meetings are generally held once a week. More frequent
contact can be made by telephone. In an emergency, anyone
can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home and say they are a friend
of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him
since last Christmas." KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.
Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically briefed
on this operation.
Future Plans:
The Station is constantly examining the possibility of
an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy.
A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to
identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1
since they normally identify themselves to the gate house
attendant. There are a few Station assets who have occasional
access to the gate house, and it is conceivable that one of
them could place a quick plant device, provided security
conditions are favorable. The Station currently has under
consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level
employee of the Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous
help in such an operation.
Costs:
1. General: This renewal request is for FY 1972 in
the amount of $11,950 and FY 1973 in the amount of $11,950
2. Source of Funds: Project KDAFGHAN is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's Operating Program in the
amount of $10,844 for FY 1972 and $10,844 for FY 1973.
The additional Funds required are to be absorbed from within
the WH Division allocation.

Purpose
KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico
City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The
objectives of the project are to furnish photographic coverage
of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to assist
the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations.
Description
The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,
KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the
project since 1962. Both agents continue to furnish information
on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the
Cuban target. A description of the individual assets is set
forth below:
:
a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal
agent of the KDAFGHAN Project since 1962. KDAFGHAN-l's
cover is that of a translator and would-be writer. Family
holdings from his deceased father also provide financial
backstopping. All photographic coverage of the main Embassy
gate through final printing and mounting is processed by
KDAFGHAN-1.
'
b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of
KDAFGHAN-1. Her cover is that of a dependent mother. KDAFGHAN-2
acts as KDAFGHAN-1's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away
from the basehouse.

very useful in identifying new Cuban PCS employees in Mexico.
Normally the Station has been able to match movements of new

contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so
identify their duties. KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs
of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has
often provided positive identifications of these persons.
Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer
visiting Mexico, was identified in this way.

Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general. He has not been specifically
briefed on this operation.
Future Plans:
1.
The Station is re-examining the various points of
view which the LIONION basehouse provides of the Cuban
Embassy complex in order to determine what steps can be
taken to improve the usefulness of the LIONION product.
For instance, from the window in the room where the pulse
camera proviously was installed, an excellent view can be
had of the Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between
the three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate.
The Station plans to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis,
observe the garden area. In this way, the Station hopes to
update its information on the location of the various
officers' offices, the general pattern of movement and
activity, etc. This area will also be observed during the
night to see if it can be determined which areas are being
used for living quarters or offices.
"
2.
It is also planned to assess LIONION/1's ability
to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-
vations, and to write these up for the Station.
3.
Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the
installation of closed circuit -TV coverage of the Consulate
entrance is being considered.
The Station is being queried as to emergency contact
arrangements with LIONION/1.
4.
Costs:
1. General: This renewal request is for the period
1 July 1970 through 30 June 1971 (FY 1971), in the amount
of $11,094.
Source of Funds: Project LIONION is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
in the amount of $10,000.

3. The Station also used the LIONION photographic
coverage and log. to check on the reports of Mexican and
other JKLANCE assets who claimed to have visited the Cuban
Embassy In the case of some assets, LIONION/1 was given
a photograph of the agent and told to be particularly alert
at cortain times of certain days to confirm the agent's
entry and exit. This proved particularly useful in checking
AVDIME/1's story of contact with the Cubans. It also con-
firmed LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early
stage in Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.
Probloms:
1. No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. Noither were there any security problems
encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was mot in a
safehouse on an average of once per week by Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, in alias. Following PELLEMENT's departure in
late May, Gerald D. FAHLANGER took over the responsibility
for the LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, meets LIONION/1
approximately once per week. In January 1970, the Station
had LIONION/1 change the safehouse used for meetings with
Station officers. He signed a one-year lease on the new
apartmont, in alias. LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends
and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he used in
ronting; i.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this
small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent
visits.
2.
Station visits to the LIONION basehouse were limited
to three during the reporting period. These were made during
non-daylight hours. LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer
away from the LIONION basehouse area and drove the officer
to the basehouse in LIONION/1's own car. The basehouse has
a driveway off the street entrance-way which facilitates
entry during non-daylight hours.
3. During the Project Year, the pulse camera and the
electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were
removed from the basehouse, thus reducing the amount of
compromising equipment in the basehouse.

Tampa, Florida, inherited from his deceased father also
provide financial backstopping. LIONION/1 received. his
"immigrado" (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and now
has a good deal of immunity from harassment from Mexican
immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the
main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and
mounting is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/1 and LIONION/2
maintain a log which indicates when a photograph was taken,
and pertinent identifying data. License numbers of cars
used by various Cuban Embassy personnel are recorded as woll
as license numbers of cars of unidentified persons visiting
the Cuban Embassy.

cover is that of a dependent mother. As with LIONION/1, she
has "immigrado" status and has been associated with the
LIQNION Project since 1962. LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's
assistant and fill-in whenever he is away from the LIONION
basehouse.
Changes:
During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of
the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued. Little or no
use was being made of the product from this camera. One
reason for limited use was that there was no real way to
readily fix the time--or the day-- a particular photo was
taken. There were no other significant changes in the
project during FY 1970.
Accomplishments:
.1. The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost
entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban
Embassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS employees in Mexico. The
monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees
usually drove.
·
2. LIONION also took photographs of what appeared to.
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy front gate.
In
.
the case of Americans who arrived in automobiles bearing
U.S. license plates, the license plate numbers, car
descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given
to ENERGO for identification.

was monitored through carrier current from the LISAMPAN/

Since the connection between the two basehouses was by carrier
current only, and since the agents in each basehouse are un-
aware of the other's activity, a possible compromise of the
LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

been no formal audio product from Project, LIGNION since July
1968 when the transcription of the LISARPAN/DOG traffic was

February 1969, the Station has been unable to activate LISAL PAN/
BAKER since 16 January 1969. A qualitative analysis of the
LIONION product is discussed in paragraph below. The Station
is unable to evaluate the worth of the pulse camera operation
since the bulk film, undeveloped, is pouched directly to
Headquarters. The cost of this portion of the operation is
minimal, however, since it is limited to the cost of the film.
and development at Headquarters. The camera works automatically
and requires only minimal maintenance.
D.
Effectiveness
1. Project LIONION is considered by Station Mexico City as
essential to its PBRULEN operations. It has consistently proven
highly effective and responsive to Station requirements of both
long and short range nature. LIONION-1, the Project's only full
time agent, continues to furnish on a timely basis, information
on the personalities and activities of the target personnel.
LIONION-2 continues to backstop LIONION-1 and substitute for him
when he is away from his post. At the age of 70, she is not
able to man the LIONION base full time, and her sight is
failing. She is able to photograph visitors, however, and live
monitor the LISA PAN/DOG traffic. LIONION-2's role as a
backstop to LIONION-1 insures continuous coverage of the target
during daylight hours, five days a week. LIONION-1's more than
six years of experience working on the same target continue to
produce an increasingly complete and accurate identification of
the staff and visitors to LIRING. These years of experience have
developed an agent knowledgeable of WOFIRM operational and
security requirements who will often bring to the Station's
attention those matters which he feels are of immediate interest
without having special requirements levied upon him and without
waiting for the next regularly scheduled meeting with his
Station contact. He has on numerous occasions notified the
Station of the presence of suspect PBRUMEN security types.
He
has also frequently passed along operational leads of use to
the Station in other aspects of its PERUMEN operations.
2. The addition of LISA PAN/DCG to the LIONION basenouse
has noticeably increased LIONION-1's ability to identify new
visitors to the target and at times, determine the nature of
their business. The LISAMPAN/DOG product was channeled to the
LIONION basehouse by carrier current from LISANPAN/LISASH on
10 April 1968. Since its primary value is as an aid to LIONION-1
in identifying LIRING visitors, its product has not been recorded

A.
Objectives
."
1. Project LIONION, a long-term support project designed to
provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance
of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City, has the
following specific objectives:
a. To furnish photographic coverage during daylight
hours of the main entrances to the target installation.
b. To operate as a listening post in support of
technical operations against this target to complement the
photographic coverage.
To radio dispatch physical surveillance teams
against persons associated with the target.
C .
A. To assist the Station in compiling information for
individual dossiers on officials of the target installation.
To fulfill various requirements in support of other
Station PRRUMEN operations.
e.
The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the
over-all objectives of Station Mexico City.
B.
2.
Change B
Oliver D. CIMOCH assumed administrative and operational
responsibility for Project LIONION in December 1967 and
continued this responsibility until his departure in December
1968. Pending arrival of CIROCH's replacement, the Project was
handled by Station Officer Gerald D. FAHLANGER and Station WOACRE
representative, Walter W. CORMBURY. On 28 February 1969, LIONION-1
was introduced to Andrew E. PELLEMENT, who assumed Project
© responsibility effective that date.
C.
Intelligence Production
As an operational support project, Project LIONION does not
produce disseminable positive intelligence. Quantitatively,
during CY 1968, the Project provided over 4,000 selective individual
photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering the target
installation and over 8,000 feet of pulse camera film. There has

or transcribed since July 1968. LIONION-1 live monitors the
traffic from his basehouse. LISA PAN-1 who mans the LISASH
base has been told nothing of the LIONION base and LIONION-1
was offered no explanation concerning the manner in which
LISA PAN/DOG. production is channeled to him. Thus a possible
compromise of the LISASH basehouse, linked directly to LIRING
would not compromise the LICHION basehouse which has no direct
link with the target.
3. Project LIONION was of direct assistance to the Station
on two separate occasions in recent months:
8. As a result of information received on a priority
basis (the same day as requested) from LIONION-1, the
Station was able to verify certain statements made by
ESMARRON-1 concerning the location of LIKING officials at
specific times. LIONION-1 reported the times at which
these officials came in and out of the LIRING compound and
provided a description of the clothes they were wearing at
the time. LIGNION-1's information raised the possibility
that ESMARROW-1 might at least have been confused in his
reporting of the times at which he met LIPING personnel,
etc.
b. In March 1969, LIONION-1 was able to provide
pictures of three WOLADY males, who, although unidentified,
fitted the general description and time frame fürnished by
LNERGO. The latter suspected that two or three WOLADY
draft dodgers might visit LIRING to arrange travel to
· PERUMEN. The Station was able to furnish LNERGO with
pictures of the three together with a report of their
arrival and departure from LIRING within three hours of
its request for information. Additional information waб
promptly forwarded to INERGO as it became available from
LIONION-1.
4. During the past year, LIONION-1 acted as a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team on a number of occasions.
By utilizing his vantage point in the area of the target, he is
able to radio information to the LIEMERACE team on the arrival
and departure of LIRING officials thus allowing the team to
remain at a distance from the target unseen by possible, counter-
surveillance from the target. The Station plans to use. LIONION-1
in this role more extensively in the coming year whenever
surveillance of LIRIE personnel entails the team's presence
near the LIRING compound. Such utilization of LICNICN-1 should
lessen the risk of exposure of the team to the PBRUAD IS.

without a substantial vacation, LIONION-1 plans a three week
trip from 4 - 25 Hay to Europe (Italy, Greece, France) and the

help defray the cost of making a second trip to Europe to
complete his original itinerary, the Station will give LIONION−1
a gift of $250 on 1 May 1969 and will tell him that consideration
will be given in 1970 to providing an equal amount, but no
decision can be made on that second gift until mid-1970.
E.
Problems
1. LISANTAN/EAKER: As reported in HMA 56553, 19 February
1969, LISALPAN/BAKER was turned off for security reasons on
16 January 1969 at 1345 hours. All subsequent attempts to
reactivate it have been unsuccessful. Headquarters was requested
to review all available Station information on this to decide
whether BAKER's abrupt end was the result of a compromise or
whether it was somehow connected with the installation of
TELEX equipment at LIRING.
2.
LISALPAN/DOG: The LISAMPAN/DOG/WETRAP installation is
generally working well. There have been numerous occasions when
due to unknown circumstances the audio reception has either been
bad or non-existent. Walter W. CORNBURY and PELLEMENT visited
the LISAMPAN/LISASE basehouse and round no problem with the
monitoring equipment there. The trouble may have resided with
the central office of the LIRISK company and was probably not

The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONIC-1's
experience, training and location to provide the photographic
and technical coverage cited above. In addition, the Station
will continue to make use of LIONION-1 as a dispatcher in
surveillances of LIRING personnel.
2. In order to check the LISAMPAN/DOG take for items of
possible value to other Station operations, LICALIPAN/1 will be
instructed to record the DOG traffic for the three week period
while LIONION-1 is on vacation. These tapes will be given to
Richard C. HABOUSH for an analysis of their operational worth
and technical quality. HABOUSH will transcribe them if the
contents warrant.
I. Costs
1. For the past project year, 1 January 1968 through
30 June 1969, it is estimated that the total project cost will
be about $16,250. It is approved for $16,632.
2. For the renewal period of 1 July 1969 through
30 June 1970, it is requested that $11,894 be approved.
Estimated figures for FY 1971 are provided below together with
the breakdown for FY's 1959 and 1970. The major addition to
the FY 1971 figures is a possible raise for LIONION-1 and

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
SUBJECT Processing and Exploitation of Photographic Coverage of LIRING
by the AMOT Organization.
ACTION REQUIRED RULMENCES
Action Required: FYI
Reference: HMMA-33841, 17 January 1968
1. The following comments are for the information and assistance
of those officers who are in the process of determining the future
of the LIONION operation:
a.
b.
The ANOTS have received and reviewed a number of the
prints from the LIONION operation and report that it
is a time-consuming and largely unproductive effort.
The practical results of such a review, i.e., the
identification of the greatest number of visitors to
LIRING, can be realized best through the widest cir-
culation of the prints among the AMOT staffers, con-
tacts, and informants. This practice would result
in wide knowledge of the existence of the operation,
and in the expenditure of many man-hours which, it
appears, could be more productively spent in other
pursuits.
The AMOT organization currently does not have either
the qualified personnel or available space and equip-
ment to process the film as suggested in paragraph
three of reference. Until they move into new quarters,
un hopefully mid-1968, the single AMOT photographer
will be working in very tight quarters.
2. It would appear from JMWAVE's experience with AMOT exploitation
of the LIONION operation, that further activity in this connection
at JMWAVE would be unwarranted.

MINORANDUM POR: Chief, Mi Division
10 January 1939
SUBJECT
: Renewal of Project LIGNION
1. Approval is requested to renew Project LIONION for
the period 1 January 1963 through 30 June 1969 For 16,632′ including
$9,374 for FY 1963 and $11,253 for FY 1959. 131 Division programed
$11,000 for this activity for FY 1969 and funds are available. Punis
requested for this renewal are slightly less than the previous year
due to a reduction in support costs.
2. This project provides Station Nexico City with photo-
graphic and physical surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate
in Mexico City. In addition, the project principal agent is able to
observe and record the patterns of activity and personal associations
of various Cuban personnel and visitors to the Embassy and Consulate.
This effort has been of assistance in planning recruitment attempts
against target personnel. The principal agent also performs ad hee
functions for the Station such as dispatching the surveillance team
against selected Cuban personnel and renting and maintaining e sare-
house. This project naturally does not produce positive intelligence..
3. Plans for the forthcoming period include using the pro-
Ject basehouse and the two project agents as IP operators in the
expansion of an existing technical operation targeted against the
Cuben Imbassy. There is also possibility that the photo coverage
of the Cuban Consulate entrance will cease shortly as this coverge
has not proved particularly useful. It is not anticipated that
these changes will substantially affect the cost of the project.
4.
It should be noted that the 4,800 operational loan made
to LICHIQN-2 in February 1966 has been completely repaid. The security
of this project is considered satisfactory.

PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST

s
A.
Objectives:
1. Project LIONION is a long-term support project designed
to provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance
of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific
objectives are:
a. To furnish photographic coverage during the
daylight hours of the main entrances to the target
installations.
bi To maintain in readiness a listening post to
support technical operations against the targets.
C.
To radio dispatch physical surveillance teams
against persons associated with the targets.
d. To provide for a mechanism which can fulfill
various miscellaneous PBRUMEN support requirements.
2. The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the over-
all objectives of Station Mexico City
B. Changes:
In late January 1967 the operational and administrative
responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred from Howard A.
TRECKLER to Cornelius L. PEUVION. No agent handling, control, or
administrative problems were encountered during the past year.
C.
Intelligence Production:
As noted in Section A above, Project LIONION is an operational
support project and does not produce disseminable positive
intelligence . During the past year this project did provide over
5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering
or leaving the target installations, as well as approximately 8000
feet of pulse camera film. Information on the comings and goings
of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which
LIONION-1 provides in daily logs, has been incorporated into Station
files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP
agencies, i.e., LNERGO. LIONION has been particularly useful in
spotting new employees whose photos are then passed to LITAMIL-7
for identification.

D.
Effectiveness:
1. Project LIONION is considered by the Station to be highly
effective and essential. In addition to providing the valuable
photographic coverage cited above, LIONION-1 continues to provide
interesting observations on the personalities and activities of
the personnel working in the targets. LIONION-1 reporting is
being incorporated into the recruitment operations targeted against
LIRING-2 and LIRING-16.
2. In early July LIONION-1 obtained and furnished a new safe
apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly meetings
with LIRESORT-1 as well as LIONION-1. The safe site has been
stocked with a sufficient supply of food so as to allow two persons
to live there for at least three days in the event the Station
ever needs a cooling-off site for an agent or defector.
3. Throughout the past project year LIONION-1 continued to
function effectively as the radio dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE
Surveillance Team. Much of this effort was expended in estimating
the movement/habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his
pending recruitment.
E.
Problems:
1. On 27 June LIONION-1 was hospitalized for emergency
surgery to treat a perforated ulcer. Since LIONION-2's presence
was required at the hospital during the operation and also through-
out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage
was suspended until 10 July.
2. Other than a temporary postoperative morale slump on the
part of LIONION-1, there have been no significant personnel,
security, or administrative problems.

extensive use of the operational log books and personality
observations provided by LIONION-1 in support of an intensive
physical penetration program.

Project LIONION continues to receive excellent technical
support from the local WOACRE representative, Walter W. CORNBURY.

2. During the ensuing period, the Station plans to utilize
LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 as LP operators for a portion of the
LISAMPAN technical penetration operation. It is anticipated that
this additional task will not be levied on LIONION-1 and LIONION-2
until after 1 January 1968.
I. Costs:
1. For the past project year, 1 January through
1967, it is estimated that the total project cost will be about
January through 31 December
$9,000. It is approved for $11,666.
2. For the renewal period of 1 January through 31 December

prepared each month by LIONION-1, a practice which will be continued
during the ensuing project year.

MICROFILM
1. Prior to submitting the LIONION project for renewal
1 January 1968, Headquarters requests the Mexico City station
comment on the desireability of continuing the photography
of persons entering and leaving the PBRUMEN Consulate. As
the station is aware this film is no longer reviewed at
JMWAVE and there are no present plans to resume this practice
since in the past it proved unproductive and costly. The
film has never been reviewed on a regular basis at Head-
quarters and has been referred to only once for identification
purposes during the past year. At present the film as
received at Headquarters is developed (negatives only) and
placed into storage.
2. Headquarters realizes this coverage is potentially
valuable and undoubtedly this film contains photographs of
assorted revolutionaries and others of CI/FI interest; but
the value lies in the ability to identify the persons
being photographed and until we have this capability
and personnel to sort out and follow-up the leads there seems

The physical security of the photo-basehouse
has been improved and the overall security of the
Project is considered to be satisfactory.
4. It will be noted that in February 1966 the
Station assisted LIONION-2, a Cuban citizen, to
qualify for Mexican immigrant status with a loan of
$1,800.00. which was reduced to $2,640.00 as of
31 December 1966 at a repayment rate of $240.00 per
month. This loan is being protected by an appropriate
Memorandum of Trust. Approval is requested to
continue this arrangement until LIONION-2's immigra-
tion status is settled, estimated to occur by
30 November 1967.

MEMORANDUM FOR :
Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT.
ACTION REQUIRED:
Renewal of Project LIONION
(Photographic/Technical Coverage
of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)
Approvals Requested Paragraphs One
and Four
1.
Approval is requested to renew Project
LIONION for the period 1 January through 31 December
1967 at an annual expenditure of $11,666.00, including
$5,574.00 for FY 1967 and $6,092.00 for FY 1968.
WH
Division programmed $12,000.00 for this activity for
FY 1967 and funds are available. The Project cost
has been increased by $668.00 over the previous year,
occasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal
Agent and a new provision for miscellaneous operational
expenditures.
2.
Although this two-man Project does not
produce positive intelligence, it contributes sub-
stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs
in bulk of personnel and visitors as well as informa-
tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,
and supporting recruitment attempts. It is contemplated
that the Project will afford support to the extensive
technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAṀPAN)
currently scheduled for installation in mid-January
1967. One of these penetrations is scheduled for the
Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally.
identify themselves upon entering. Information from
the gatehouse is to be transmitted securely to the
LIONION basehouse as well as to the LISAMPAN listening
post. By collating this and other LISAMPAN information
with the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify
photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.

LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL
SECRET/KAROK
A. Current Objectives:
There have been no changes in the objectives of the LIONION Project as
set forth in the renewal request of last year.
B. Changes
Howard A. TRECKLER has assumed the duties of Case Officer for LIONION since
the departure of Lawrence F.. BARKER in August 1966. TRECKLER is known to LIONION-1
and 2 as "Jose" or "Joe". TRECKLER meets with LIONION-1 at least once each
week and sees LIONION-2 only if he visits the LIONION basehouse. with the
departure of Hugh T. FRANCOTTE (P) in August 1956, Walter W. CORNBURY (P)
assumed the duties of technical consultant for the project. CORNBURY is known
to LIONION-1 and 2 as "Jack". LIONION-1 is being given a pay increase of
$8.00 (U.S.) per month effective 1 January 1967. There are no other changes
contemplated for the coming year.
C.
Intelligence Production:
The intelligence production is the same as that reported in the renewal
request for last year. It is difficult to estimate the intelligence value in
numbers of reports as there are so few positive reports made from this type of
production on the photographic end of the project. But this photographic
coverage is of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the
PBRUMEN target. Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONION's
time will be used in support of that operation.
D.
Effectiveness;
The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from
that expressed in the renewal request of last year. LIONION has further es-
tablished his importance to the Station's operational activities by demonstrating
his ability to spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip-
tion provided by the Case Officer. If the planned LISAMPAN activity gets underway,
LIONION observations and insight into activities of LIRING will be increased
greatly.
The apartment spotted by LIONION-1 and obtained by the Station across from
LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be
utilized in the LISAMPAN operation. The location of LIONION-1 across from the
target and his background knowledge built up over the years are invaluable assets
to the Station's coverage of the primary target of the Related Mission Directive.

E. Problems:
There were no major problems during the past year. One security problem
involved the claimed spotting of some of the photogrphic equipment from the
street by David M. WILSTED (P). A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION-1
and the Case Officer failed to reveal any such equipment as being visible from
the street. However, additional security measures were taken by darkening the
background in the room behind the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes
on the window, drapes on the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind
the equipment. This also serves as a security check against the prying eyes
of the household servant as LIONION-1 can now open the door fully to the room
when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment. The other problem
is the obtaining of inmigrado status for LIONION-2. This involves the depositing
of funds to a bank account and is discussed under paragraph I.
F.
Liaison:
There is no liaison involved in the project.
G. Interagency Coordination:
Not applicable.
H. Plans:
It is planned to have LIONION-1 keep special logs on the activities of
selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past year. With the case
officer handling LIONION-1 directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue
picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully
LIONION-1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take
from the LISAMPAN operation.
I. Costs:
For Calendar Year 1966:
1. In the period 1 January through 30 June 1966, $4,500.00 was expended.
The projected expenditure for July 1966 through 31 December 1966 is $5,000.00.
This total project year expenditure is approximately $1,000.00 under that
approved by Headquarters. However, this amount is probably due to having
drawn film and other supplies from overall Station support without their
having been charged off against the Project

was invited to appear for confrontation outside the Embassy. Without the LIONION
base and the expert knowledge of LIONION-1 of target personnel and activities,
such an opération as LIRHYS could not have been mounted. It might be noted that
this operation was an attempt to satisfy the top priority requirement laid on
Station Mexico by Headquarters. It is expected that additional similar operations
will depend to a large extent on the facilities provided by the LIONION operation.
Another very effective performance by LIONION-1 was his obtaining
sharp observation and quick, intelligent, secure action an apartment in a
by
building directly across the street from the target Embassy. The Station had been
seeking an apartment in this building for many years.

--
E. Problems. The problem of cover for LIONION-1 worked out well during the
year to the point where it ceased being a problem. By living his cover as a trans-
lator he was enabled to build in strong self protection when called upon to do some
translations for the office of the President of Mexico. Toward the end of the year,
LIONION-1 received the coveted status of "Inmigrado" which confers a great deal of
immunity from harrassment by Mexican authorities.
The only problem now besetting the project is LIONION-1's excessive work
load. As indicated above, an attempt is being made to alleviate this load.
F. Liaison. The operation has no liaison connection. LIONION-1's connection
with the Mexican Presidency is non-operational.
G. Interagency Coordination.
B.
Not applicable,
Plans. It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1's observations and
operational log books during the coming year rather than settle for his excellent
photographs alone. It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those persons who are under constant obser-
vation from the LIONION base. LIONION-1 can read significance into activity which
might go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by observers with less experience.
LIONION-1 will also be called upon for assistance in future recruitment operations
as in LIRHYME. Several such operations are being contemplated for calendar 1966,
the period for which project is being requested,
:
I. Costs.
1. For calendar 1965:
In the period 1 January through 31 October 1965
$7,218,20 had been expended. At this rate some
$9,200.00 will be expended in the concluding
project year.

Current Objectives. The original objectives of the project have not
changed but have been added to in the last year. The project is functioning well
as a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance operation against the PBRUMEN
Embassy in Mexico City. It is designed to:
1.
Furnish photographic coverage during daylight hours of the
two entrances of the carget installation.
2. Dispatch physical surveillance.teams against persons
associated with the target.
3.
40
Keep in readiness a stening post (LP) for the monitoring
and recording of technical penetrations of the target.
Assist the Station in building up individual dossiers on
officials of the target installation.
5. Monitor Station activities involving direct contact with
the target, and furnish an observation post (OP) for
other Station assets.
Objectives 4 and 5 are additions to those objectives set forth
original project outline.
in the
B. Changes. There have been no changes in personnel and none are contem-
plated in the coming year. It is being proposed in separate correspondence that
some of the work load now on LIONION-1 be shifted to Headquarters, specifically
the development of film.
:
LIONION-1's pay was increased 40 dollars a month effective 15 March 1965.
C. Intelligence Production. The operation has produced thousands of excellent
Infor-
photographs, many of which are shared with Headquarters and Station JMWAVE.
mation on the comings and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target
installation has been incorporated into many Station files (primarily personality
files -- individual dossiers). No precise statistics are available on this produc-
tion. It has been very heavy. Station JMWAVE should perhaps be called upon for an
independent evaluation of LIONION production it has received
D. Effectiveness. The project is considered both highly successful and
essential by the Station. In addition to excellent photographic coverage provided
by the LIONION agents, the Station has found in LIONION-1 a first class asset for
other operational duties. The LIONION besehouse was essential to mounting and
monitoring the LIRHYME recruitment (and harassment) operation. C/O Wallace B.
ROWTON sat with LIONION-1 for several weeks, observing the movement pattern of
LIRHYME-1. LIJNION-1 manned one of three radios used by the Station when LiRHYME

Note that the salary figures include the salary raise for LIONION-1 and the
usual one month pay Christmas bonus for LIONION-1 and 2. An additional
provision has been made for miscellaneous operational expenditures as there
may be a recurrence of same as in the past project year for which no provision
was made. Provision is being made for charging of funds for supplies to the
LIONION Project which was not done last year in order that more accurate
bookkeeping may be followed.
In addition, the Station has had to make a loan to LIONION-2 for gaining status
to qualify for inmigrados status in Mexico. This loan is held in a savings
'account in a Mexican bank to prove to the Mexican authorities that LIONION-2
can support herself. Funds are withdrawn from this account monthly, sometimes
with interest, and deposited to a checking account where LIONION-1 withdraws
the funds and they are applied to the revolving account for financing the
operation. The initial balance-deposited to the account in February 1966 was
$4,800.00. Withdrawals have been made at the rate of $240.00 per month and
as of 30 October 1966, the total account had been reduced by $1,680.00, leaving
a balance in the account of $3,120.00 which should carry the account through
November 1967. A separate dispatch follows with the Memorandum of Trust and
necessary details on the account. Approval is requested for continuance of
this account in order that LIONION-2 may obtain her inmigrado status.
J.
Other:
LIONION-2 continues to perform in an excellent manner in support of LIONION-1.

Renewal of Project LIONION
(photographic/
technical coverage of Cuban Embassy in
Mexico)
Approval is requested to renew Project LIONION for
the period 1 January through 31 December 1966 at an annual
expenditure of $10,998.00, including $5,244.00 for FY 1966
and $5,754.00 for FY 1967. Division programmed $10,750.00

Funds are available. The
vious year, occasioned by a small raise for the Principal
Agent.
2. The Project has contributed substantially and
directly to coverage of the Catan Embassy and Consulate
in Mexico and is considered highly successful and essential
by Station Mexico City. It has produced a large quantity
of excellent photographs of target personnel and visitors
and has furnished valuable data on their patterns of
activity and personal associations. It has also rendered
valuable support to Station recruitment attempts against
Cuban Embassy personnel and maintains an ever ready
facility for support. of any technical penetrations of
this target accomplished by other Station activities..
The Project has had no security or administrative
problems. The Station has submitted regular progress
reports.

Without the Baschouse and LIONION-1's expert knowledge of the
target personnel and activities, such an operation could not
have been mounted. The operation itself. was an attempt to
satisfy the top priority requirement laid on Station Mexico City
by Headquarters. It is expected that future similar operations
will depend to a large extent on the facilities provided by
this Project.
1
Another very effective performance by LIONION-1 was his
obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and
secure action, an apartment in a building directly across
the street from the target. The Station had been seeking
an apartment in this building for many years.
E.
Problems: The only problem currently besetting the Project
is the excessive work load on the Principal Agent. To alleviate
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of
the film produced by the Project.
Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has
received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good deal
of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly
out of the Office of the President of Mexico and thus has a
strong protective security factor built into it.
LIONION-l's
F. Liaison: The Project has no liaison connection.
cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-
operational.
G.
H.
Interagency Coordination:
Not applicable.
Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1's
observations and operational logbooks during the coming year
rather than to settle for his excellent photographs alone.
It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those persons who are
under constant observation from the Basehouse. He can read
significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be
misinterpreted by observers with less experience. He will
also be called upon for assistance in future recruitment
operations similar to the case mentioned in paragraph D
above. Several such operations are being contemplated for
calendar year 1966, the period for which the Project renewal
is being requested.
I. Costs: For calendar year 1965:

LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL
A..
Current Objectives: This Project is a technical, currently
primarily photographic, surveillance operation against the Cuban'
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. Its original objectives,
still current, include furnishing photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the Embassy and Consula te entrances; furnishing
a control point for dispatching physical surveillance teams
against persons associated with the target; and furnishing
a listening post (LP) in readiness to monitor and record
technical audio penetrations of the target.. Two new cbjectives
added during the Project year include assisting Station Mexico
City to build up individual dossiers on target officials; and
affording an observation post for Station activities involving
direct contact with the target. These new objectives are in
consonance with Priority A, Objective 1 of the current Related
Mission Directive for Station Mexico City.
B.
Changes: There have been no changes in personnel and none
are contemplated during the coming year. Headquarters is
assuming the task of developing some of the film exposed
under this Project. LIONION-1's pay was increased $40 per
month effective 15 March 1965.
C. Intelligence Production: The Project is not designed to
· produce disseminable information. It produced thousands of
excellent photographs during the year which were shared with
Headquarters and Station JMWAVE. Information on the comings
and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target have
been incorporated into many Station files, principally the
dossier files. No precise statistics are available, but at
least 100 exposures are made daily during target working hours.
D. Effectiveness: The Project is considered highly successful
and essential by the Station. In addition to the excellent photo-
graphic coverage provided, LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has
developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties.
The Project Basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring
the Station's attempt at recruitment and subsequent harassment
of a sensitive target employee. The Case Officer in charge of
the attempt sat with LIONION-1 for several weeks observing the
* movement pattern of the target employee. LIONION-1 manned one
of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical
surveillance of the target employee while near the Baschouse.

LIONION Project
16 February 1965
1.
LIONION is a new project which is submitted in the
amount of $10,478. This is a photographic surveillance opera-
tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Two
agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban lawyer in exile,
and LIONION-2, his mother. The agents act as observers and
photographers. LIONION-1 is also used as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team, from which he is compartmented,
to cover individuals associated with this target. These agents
were previously used in connection with the unilateral tele-
phone tap operation against the Cuban Embassy. The current
photographic operation began in the latter part of 1962,
and was previously funded under Cuban FI funds. The operation
has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of
action and personal associations.
2.
The security of this operation, particularly the
agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,
appear reasonably sound. Both agents know that they are
working for AIS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED
in October 1963. However, LITAMIL-7 and LITAMIL-9, who are
penetrations of the Cuban Embassy, are aware of this
activity, as they are used to help identify individuals
photographed.
3.
Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended.
It is requested that, in order to assist Headquarters'
evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data
furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
Termination of Project KDAFGHAN
1. Project NDAFGHAN, approved for FY 72 and FY 73 in the
amount of $11,950 each year, covered Nexico City Station's
observation post targetted against the Cuban Embassy and
Consulate in Mexico. OP operators KDAFGHAN-1 and his depen-
dent mother KDAFGHAN-2, Cuban exiles resident in Mexico since
1960, wore the only human assets in the project.
2. As a result of the JMYAK damage assessment and other
security considerations it was decided that the project should
be terminated and the agents resettled in another country.
DIRECTOR 235255 amended the project for FY 72 to a total of
$20,950 to provide for the termination and resettlement of the
agents. The agents were terminated in August 72 and are now
being resettled in Spain. DIRECTOR 300167 concurred in
terminating the project as of 31 August 72.
3. In view of the developments in paragraph 2, above,
WH/PI recommends approval of this termination request.
