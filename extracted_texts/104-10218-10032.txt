2. On 7 July 1965 "Modesto" called KOSTIKOV, saying that he had
just received a cable asking about the trip to Helsinki, to which "Modesto"
wanted to cable a reply. KOSTIKOV sald that they had to walt a day or two,
but that he would send an urgent cable. On 8 July 1965 an individual identified
by voice as the "Modesto" above called KOSTIKOV, who was out, and left the
message to tell him that he had a call "from the Panamanians.
On 9 July
"Modesto BERMUDEZ,” a Panamanian, left a message for KOSTIKOV to
/ call him. (Source: LIENVOY.)
"
3. It appears that the conversations above refer to the Panamanian
delegation to the World Peace Congress being held in Helsinki 10-17 July 1965.

because she, Subject, though willing to pursue a platonio friendship with
Andreev would have none of the other, and it was not unlikely that Georgine
might captivato Andreev. There was Antonio Cares, Subject's current boy-
friend, a bodyguard to Dfas Ordaz, who was giving evidence of growing serious
about her. Subj was concerned that her participation in the operation mi¿It
in some way cause harm to Antonio. Subject who entertains a host of artist
friends at her home expressed concern that if she were followed and spied⠀
upon, a misleading impression might be gained.
5. Other personal matters about Subject that came out in the conversation
were that she has income from stocks (sufficient to maintain her in Mexico),
she is in visitante artists status, would like to attain inmigrado because
she has difficulties with the Musicians Union (AHDA) that hampera pursuit
of her profession; she is not interested in marriage; she is opposed to
by-passing the limitations on her work imposed by her status.
6. The C.O.'s, in their guidance to Subject, made it clear that she could
pull out of the operation any time she wanted, that it was in her power to
terminate it either with us or with the Sove, if she got involved with them.
She was told that there was absolutely no harm that could befall her boy-
Efriend, Antonio, from her continued participation. As for Georgina, the
ohips would have to fall as they may with Andreev; sinoe Subject was
Georgina's confidante, we would be appreciative of knowing about Andreev's
involvement in any affair. She wanted to know why we were interested in
Andreev, and the C.O.'s glødhanded her to the extent of telling her that
it was our business to know about important Soviets, since one never knew:
when a Soviet might be in need of "help. Subject indicated the was willing
to go along further at a slow pace.
7. In talking about the Soviet Victory reception, the presence there of
LICRAVE-1 (his picture had been in the News) came up. Subject said she i
knew I-1. She characterized L-l as flighty. She said he didn't got along
with his wife. She intimated that when L-1 was lonely, he chasedxf aſter
female companionship. Il drops by Subject's place every so often. She
Lil
know that L-1 had left his father's business and had gone in for crop-dusting
( a relatively recent development).
Arrangements were made that "Mort" would keep in touch with Subject
about once a week by phone (Tel. 46-71-06, Calle kio Nove #32) and that
later she would be given an emergency number to call..

1. Gestetner, known ne Dion Jackson, and Marheine, introduced as Mort Bryan,
met Subject on 12 May. Subject reported on her attendance at the WWII
Victory celebration at the SovEmb held on 9 May, and its aftermath on 21
May at the art gallery of Alfredo Santos.
2. Subj, sho attended the reception alone, her invited friend Georgina did
not go, attracted a small circle of companions during the evening. Piret,
there was a Quatemalam, a professor at the National University, who made
conversation, learned she was a singer, and spoke of having her appear at.
a concert in Pusbla. Next, Vladimir Andreev, his receiving line duties ended,
joined her. Their conversation dealt with artists in Mexico, a pick-up
from the first time they had met at the Santos Gallery some two months ago.
Then, Valeriy came by and seemed to be mostly interested in watching Subject.
Subj took an instant dislike to Valeriy (probably Kostikow). A short, blond
Russian then drifted into the group, shoa Subj pegged as a parachutist. This
turned, cut to be accurate (probably Mikelai Isonov). Andreeva came by just
about the time Subj was inviting the group to visit the Santos Gallery. Subf
vas just about able to include Andreeva in the invitation, and then Andreevą
was gone from the group. The invitation was for 11 May at 1100. During the
evening Andreev mentioned that he would like Jubj to perform at the Sovimb.
Subj said she would, but not details for the engagement were made.
3. On 11 May Andreev and Valeriy showed up at the Santos Gallery. Subj
introduced them to Alfredo Santos. Andreev seemed to be enchanted by the
Gallery: Valoriy was less demonstrative. They had brought a bottle of Vodka
and passed a few hours in the company of Alfrede. Subj confirmed her distaste
for Valoriy, and formed her impression of Andreey that he wanted to break out
of dull Soviet circles into the gayer, freer atmosphere of the artist set in
Mexico. Ho specific appointment was made for Subj to see either of the two

4. Subj, in hen concern to know where this operation was taking her and the
part she was to play in it, rang in some additional characters in her personal
life. There was Georgine (Inu), her very good friend, ainless, clinging to
Subject's orbit, student at U of A, who considered Andreev a "¿ear." _Jubj
considered that Andreev and Georgina right very well develop a relationship

Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV
Valerly Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 35 years of age,
corpulent and paunchy, with a round somewhat fleshy face that sports a
5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses in dark heavy frames,
which partially obscure a pair of small, but plercing eyes. His heavy jowlą
thin lips, wide nostrils and dark hair add to an impression that his features
are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav. A
shapeless dark sult-coat, carelessly put over a white shirt, with unbuttoned
collar, through which protrudes a tuft of dark hair complete a photograph of
Valerty Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, Attache of the Consular Office and
Identified member of the KGB.
KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico in December 1961 and assumed his duties
as an attache at the USSR Consulate at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.
Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired
several "buddles" of similar background and with similar tastes. Among
these individuals, his closest associates have been, or still are, the following:
Vitally Borisovich SHUBIN, Attache and Identified member of the KGB, who
left for the USSR in July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-
e
pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR in October 1964; and Oleg
Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO, Vice-Consul and identified member of the KGB,
who is still in Mexico, and who has accepted KOSTIKOV into his circle of
Intimate friends.

However, It was mostly with SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV
felt entirely at ease. Many a time KOSTIKOV would talk to elther one of
them în the phone and Indulge in a friendly exchange of obscenities, where-
as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO in a like: manner, even though.
KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house. KOSTIKOV
developed an exceedingly close relationship with SHUBIN. They used to
travel together to various parts of the country and to spend time together
with their familles at the Casino de la Selva, a hotel in Cuernavaca. But
it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's
attentions. An embittered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her
husband and had a flerce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Inro
a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone in his
best unctuous and ingratiation manner. It is impossible to say whether they
had sexual relations, but the obvious and strong sexual overtones in Roza's
volce led one to presume that she had more than just a friendly interest in
KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was probably using Roza as a target for
his amorous or illicit aspirations.
It seems that KOSTIKOV lâ quite preoccupled with matters of sex and if
given an opportunity would turn into a veritable profligate. Apparently his

:
1. Forwarded herewith is a characterization of Subject prepared by Douglas
J. FEINGLASS. The SPR on Subject has been prepared and will be forwarded as
soon as typed.
2. It is interesting to note that LICOWL-1 describes KOSTIKOV as follows:
He is a man who would do anything to anybody. He is without morals, education
or manners. He uses foul language and has no respect for others. When
KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-l's) establishment, with Sovlet women present,
KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,
while their husbands are present, and thinknothing of it. According to LICOWL-1,
the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this. (Comment: However, from
a recent LICOWL-1 tape, It appears that Yuriy Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV,
GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative
employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIA NOV)
was going to say something to KOSTIKOV - someday - but had no: said a word to
him as yet.)

wife Roza has a tolerant attitude towards KOSTIKOV's probable incur-
sions into the domain of maltal infidelity, strice, on one occasion,
when KOSTIKOV had been invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's
home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV against
drinking too much, a woman answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV
to the phone. When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV It sounded that she was more
peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that
other women were present there at the time.
When KOSTIKOV started talking to his wife on this particular call, he
already had had a few drinks and in disguised voice spoke to her in Spanish,
French and English, possibly to Impress those who were present. His
Spanish is quite good and fluent, his French is rather tolerable, but his
English is somewhat stilted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studled
these languages at the Moscow Institute of Languages.
This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV a great latitude for making
friends among Mexicans and his easy-going earthy approach is presumably
of considerable help to him in developing contacts. Since his consular
dutles are quite negligible, he can easily engage in this sort of activity.
In fact, this neglect of official duties prompted a heated argument between
NECHIPORENKO and the visiting Soviet correspondent Timur GAYDAR,

To summarize KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilities: KOSTIKOV
Is well trusted to take trips around the country in the company of another
Soviet Embassy employee on various matters of Importance and, on
occasions, he acts as an interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. His
known physical defect is weak eyes. Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called up
an eye-speciallst for an appointment, because his eyes were troubling him
and that is probably the reason for his wearing tinted glasses. Sometimes
Mexicans refer to him as the man with glasses. It is quite possible that an
auto accident KOSTIKOV had in Vera_cruz may have been caused by his
somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness. However,
when KOSTIKOV was excusing himself for it, GARMASHEV, to whom
he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that it was about time KOSTIKOV
learned to drive.
Owing to this shortcoming of having weak eyes and his physical make
up, KOSTIKOV does not participate in various Indoor or outdoor sports as
much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy. It seems that billiards
are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes. However, it must
not be surmised that he is a weak individual in a physical sense and will
* probably give a good account of himself if a situation will demand It.
Many of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy" or "Smoked"

which in Russian slang may mean an individual with a dark skin, or may
refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he went
through a school of hard knocka
It is quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALFERIYEV belong to the same
group of former hooligans, who by dint of sheer disregard for mcral
standards forged ahead and became "somebodles".
45
KOSTIKOV seems to be qulte unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort
of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-
taln zest and bravado. It appears that he has no moral, religious, or
any other type of scruples. He is vulgar, untidy and lecherous, with a
penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions in conversation with
his "buddles", with whom he drinks quite a lot. circumstances permitting
In addition, it must be noted that he is a shrewd and resourceful individual
unquestionably loyal to the Communist system.

a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that
KOSTIKOV and Leonid Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourist representative
In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROV's apartment in
order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourists without any
Information about their next move and letting them shift for themselves.
Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has started
to "cultivate" NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potential drinking companion,
and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently in quite
a familiar tone of voice. It seems that NIKIFOROV, a younger man, is
being influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.
14
KOSTIKOV's family life does not appear to be a stormy one; because his
wife Roza A. sounds easy-going and friendly. She is in charge of the Embassy's
✓ dining-room. Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and
+
a slight contemp:, KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to
be an average child, who does not present any outstanding problems to her
1
parents.

AEPUPPIE positively identified photo of Valeriy Vlasi-i-ovich KOSTIKCY
as Soviet who had met him in 'exice City on 9, 11 and 12 Feb 1963.
KOSTIKOV gave FURPLE meeting, arran ements for next meeting" to be in NYC.
Soviet who appeared in NYC was 01-g D. PRYKIN. PRYKIK has been identified
as menter 13th Dept of HGB's FCD.
PURPLE is naturalized German Averican, has crop dusting business in
Middle 'hest, furnished info on industrial and missile sites in area.
PRYKIN particularly interested in pipelines.
1.
The 13th Dept may have exercised its prerogative and taken over case from
First (Enrican) Dept. Forser case officer Yuriy V. N07IKOV was apparently
from American Dept, not 17th. Put it appears that PRAIN asked PURPLE
for same i✰ type of info assigned by KCSTIKOV, surresting that KCSTIKOV
was from same KGB dept an PRYKIN.

3. It has been reliably reported that at present the
KGB's Thirteenth Department places the greatest emphasis on
its sabotage mission. Sabotage targets include the most in-
portant strategic military and industrial facilities of
Western countries. The requirements assigned to AEBURBLE
by both KOSTIKOV and BRYKIN correspond to this mission.
4. In view of the obvious ODYOKE interest in any acti-
vities of the Thirteenth Department, we urge that you pre-
pare an analysis of KOSTIKOV's activities and contacts in
Mexico.

compound mostly with Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV and Aleksandr Ivanovich
PRIKHODKO, KGB officers, since his arrival. LIEMPTY also reports
that he has been using a 1964 green Ford sedan, also driven by
YATSKOV and KGB chauffeur, Vasiliy Stepanovich MIROSHNIKOV, and
a 1962 beige Volkswagon which has also been used by Valeriy Vladi-
mirovich KOSTIKOV, KGB officer and Valentin Ivanovich KUCHEROV,
Tass Correspondent and suspect KGB.

3. KOSTIKOV has been positively identified as the Soviet
who met AEBURELE in Mexico City on 9, 11 and 12 February 1963.
(Mexico City Station identified KOSTIKOV as the only Soviet in
Mexico who fit the description, and subsequently AEBURELE iden-
tified him from a photo spread.) KOSTIKOV received informa
tion from ALBURELE on industrial and missile sites in PRPRIMÉ
and gave him requirements of the same nature for the future.
"KOSTIKOV also made arrangements with AEBURBLE for his next-
meeting, to be held in New York City with a différent, un- :
identified Soviet. On 6 May 1963 AFBURBLE was met in accor-
dance with the above arrangements by Oleg Danilovich KRYKIN

charts and was given additional requirements particularly
relative to missile bases. Nothing transpired during the
latter meeting to suggest that BRYKIN wished to change the
nature-of-the-case, and in fact he told AXBURBLE that he was
doing a good job. It therefore can reasonably be assumed..
that ESIIN and FOSTIKOV both were representing the sane KGB
department.

Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV: He is a 38-year-old officer of
the KGB who occupies the cover position of Second Secretary. He
first visited Nexico in 1959 for a Soviet Industrial Exposition'
and later came from September 1961 until August 1965.
He
returned again in September 1968 to replace another KGB officer.
KOSTIKOV is considered to be one of the most effective and dan-
gerous of the intelligence officers in Mexico. He has had a
wide range of responsibilities which have included operations
among emigre groups in western Nexico, operations directed
I
against the United States and currently against the governments.
of Central America. He presently meets with exiles from Guate-
J
mala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras. He is known to have
passed funds to these groups as well as tactical guidance.

KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the conversation
conformed exactly to that described by BALCARCEL, to LINEEEL-2 in paragraph 2
above.

(201-062689), leader of the Nicaraguan Communist Party exile organization in
Mexico, and similarly with Loren ZELAYA Romero (201-045172), a Honduran
Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least
one of KOSTIKOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives
of Central American Communist Parties in Mexico.

t of 201-3050527
1. On 10 February 1970 LIFEBEL-2 provided the details of his 6 February
meeting with Jose Luis ACARCEL Ordonez ((201-160-30), leader of the Quatemalan
Communist Party (FCT) exile organization in Mexico. LIREBEL-2 reported that he
arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the ctn, and found BALCARCEL about
to leave. BALCARCEL requested that LIFEBEL-2 take him to a garage where his
car was being repaired, which LIREBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready,
BALCARCEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for
2100 hours with his "Soviet contact. (Note: BALCARCEL had previously told
LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIREBEL-2
and BALCARCEL drove to the "Parque Escondido," also known as the "Parque Mundido,
lorated on Insurgentes Sur between Gomez Farias and Millet Streets. LIREBEL-2
parked and BALCARCEL held his meeting with his "Soviet contact" standing on the
sidewalk of Gomez Farias Street bordering on the park. The meeting lasted for
30 minutes.
H
2. BALCARCEL commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contact"
had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received
from a Guatemalan student. The student had asked to talk to the Soviet by true
name and asked him for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which
is scheduled to play some games in Guatemala. The Soviet told EALCARCEL that he
had told the student that he could not provide any current information on this
subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador,
where the team was to play some games prior to their arrival in Guatemala.
BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by
true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader
who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving
his name out to unauthorized persons.

1. LIENVOY reported that on 6 February 1970 Valery. KOSTIKOV (201-
305052), 2nd Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, received a long-
distance telephone call from Guatemala. The operator asked for KOSTIKOV
by name, then told the caller "Mr. HORTENECHO, I have your call to Mexico
ready”. When KOSTIKOV came to the phone, the caller stated he was call-
ing on behalf of the Guatemalan University Students Organization, but did
not further identify himself. The caller and KOSTIEOV discussed the USMA
national soccer team and its scheduled appearance in Guatemala. KOSTIKOV
stated he was not certain exactly what date the team was scheduled to
arrive in Guatemala, and suggested that the caller contact the soccer
federation in El Salvador, where the team would be playing prior to its
arrival in Guatemala. The caller also inquired whether there was any in-
formation on the Ballet. (Reference) and was told that there was none.
2. It should be noted that normally queries concerning the Soviet
soccer team or the appearance of a Russian Ballet troupe would be
handled by one of the Cultural or Sports Affairs officers of the Embassy.
KOSTIKOV's participation in these matters, us reported above, would seen »
to confirm previous Station reporting that KOSTIKOV handles dealings be-
tween the Soviet Embassy in Mexico and Guatemalan leftist organizations.

1. On 10 February 1970 LIFEBEL-2 provided the details of his 6 February
meeting with Jose Inis BALCARCEL Ordonez (201-160430), leader of the Guatemalan
Communist Party (IGT) exile organization in Mexico. LIREBEL-2 reported that he
arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2000 hours on the 6th, and found BALCARCEL about
to leave. BALCARCEL requested that LIKSBEL-2 take him to a garage where his
car was being repaired, which LIKEBEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready,
BALCARCZI asked LINEBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for
2100 hours with his "Soviet contact. (Hote: BALCARCEL had previously told
LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIFEBEL-2
and BALCANCEL drove to the “Parque Escondido,” also snown as the "Farque Hundido,
located on Insurgentes 8ur between Gomez Farias and Millet Streets. LIKEREL 2
parked and BALCARCEL held his meeting with his 'Soviet contact" standing on the
sidewalk of Gomes Farias Street bordering on the park. The meeting lasted for
0 minutes.
72
2. BALCARCEL commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contact"
had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received
from a matemalan student. The student had asked to talk to the Soviet by true
name and asked him for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which
is scheduled to play some games in Quatemala. The Soviet told BALCANCEL that he
had told the student that he could not provide any current information on this
subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador,
where the team was to play some games prior to their arrival in Quatemala.
BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by
true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader
* who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving
his name out to unauthorised persons.

3. Addressees will recall that per Reference A, LEMVOY reported that
KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the conversation
conformed exactly to that described by BALCARCEL to LIREBEL-2 in paragraph 2
above.
4. It is of interest to note that past LIENVOY reporting has shown
KOSTIKOV setting up clandestine contacts with Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegria
(201-062683), leader of the Nicaraguan Communist Party exile organization in
Mexico, and similarly with Lorenzo ZKLAYA Romero (201-045172), a Honduran
Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least
one of KOSTIKOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives
of Central American Communist Parties in Mexico.

1. Operations
CROF
Under this roof project, operations continue to be directed
against the MARSH target and, on occasions, Bloc targets. Activities
covered by the Project include providing information on INHARSHers,
their activities, personalities, visitors, and contacts (LISACK-2,
-4, -6, and LICOL-1); serving as access agents (LICRAVE-1, -2, -3,
LIROCKET-1, and BESABER); spotting, assessing and occasionally
recruiting access agents (LISPTY-3); providing information on
DILET activities (DXPETAL-1) and BEDOX activities (BESABER); and
performing such other tasks as may be required on an ad hoc basis
(LISACK-7 and all other assets of the Project).
2. Administration
As assets take on a permanent character in terms of
expenditure or other continuing administration, they are transferred-
from SB/00A to LISACK for orderly handling. Beginning with this
reporting period, and as outlined in the LISACK Project Renewal,
BESABER, DMPETAL, and LICO/L-1 were transferred from SB/00A to
LISACK. Details of the functions, security, and meeting procedures
are reported below for each asset.

to establish the location. On occasions, he is net at his
home in Cuernavaca. DESABER is currently targetted against
Subject of 201-268115, with whom he has re-established a good
social relationship. Through Subject of 201-268115 he also
met Subject of 201-276184, Chief of the Referentura. In
addition to serving as an access agent to Subject of 201-268115,
he has fulfilled spot requirerents such as providing information
on Centro Intercultural de Documentacion (CIDOC) and
personalities of Station interest. Although BLSABER has a
fairly good social relationship with the BEDOX Ambassador and
his wife and has entree to other BEDOXers and MARSHers, wo
are having him concentrate his efforts on the higher priority
MILIARSHer, Subject of 201-26C115.
-
c. LICOWL-1: He was met routinely once a month during
the reporting period. Each reeting date is established at
the preceding meeting and no further contact or confirmation is
required. LICOWL-1 arrives by bus at a car pick-up point and
is then driven by the case officer to a small coffee shop
where he reviews his diary with the case officer. Due to the
nature of his job and the level of his access, LICO"L-1 is not
in a position to do more currently than to report on the brief
encounters he has with MIHARSHers who come into his store. Ilis
reports normally consist of his assessment of personalitics,
description of new arrivals and, occasionally, biographic
information he has been able to pick up. He also gives timely
reports of demonstrations and other unusual activity in the
vicinity of the MHHARSH installation.
-
d. LIEMPTY-3: LIEMPTY-3 is met at irregular intervals at
various out-of-the-way restaurants for the purpose of briefing
and debriefing on operational assignments and discussion of his
written reports. Neetings are arranged by phone using open
code. His most recent assignment has been the development,.
assessment, and recruitment of 201-810931. LIEPTY-3 has few
peers at the art of developing an operational lead, but his
extensive operational activity in past years against the LHARS
target has required that he be used sparingly, selectively,
and always under alias. Development of 201-810981 has been
his only assignment during the reporting period, and LIEMPTY-3
made good early progress. Purporting to be the representative
of a film club for architects, LIEPTY-3 was able to get 201-
810981 to agree to become a consultant. Thereafter, LIEPTY-3
continued to ask questions about 201-810981's work, to the point
where 201-810981 realized that more than a film club for
architects was involved. At this point it was decided to let
LIEMPTY-3 break cover, recruit 201-810981 to supply information
on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people
in his office), and continue to handle him until the recruitment
was firm and previous questions about the stability and
reliability of 201-810981 had been resolved. This was done,
and 201-$10981 accepted recruitment, knowing that WOLADY
intelligence was involved. LIEMPTY-3 told several meetings with
201-810931 after recruitment, and countersurveillance did not
reveal any signs of NHILARSH surveillance. For about a month,
however, LIEMPTY-3 has not been able to contact 201-810961,
and it is possible that the latter has developed cold feet.
If LIEMPTY-3 can reestablish contact, he will continue to

handle this case for the time being. If he is unable to
reestablish contact, he will be given another lead to follow
up. LIEMPTY-3 is a very active person who has an extremely
full business day, with many, contacts. The Station. believes
that within this busy "cover" life,¨LIEPTY-3 can handle
selected operational tasks without coming to hostile attention.
As long as pro sensity precautions are taken by him in mis
operational activities, and by him and the Station officer
(who meets him in alias) in their meetings, there is no reason
why LIEPTY-3 cannot be a useful part-tine contributor to the
Station's REDTOP program for the foreseeable future.

His regular student has been the Subject of 201-028975, and he
has had occasional dealings with other ARSHers, particularly
AESEASICK. The meetings with 201-029063 have not been of
particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for
the latter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKET-1 would
have a better target to work on. It was LIROCKET-1 who
came up with the first local confirmation of the identity of
this replacement (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings
with AESCASICK have been concerned with attempts by the
director of the school where LIROCKET-1 teaches to borrow
sociological films from the MHILARSH film office.
.
2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKET-1 has
reached the end of the line. For some time he has been involved
in a rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1
reported that his wife had denounced him to Mexican authorities
as an RVROCK agent (a few months previously, she had denounced
him as an MIDHARSH agent). LIROCKET-1 was not inclined to take
his wife's ravings too seriously since he considered hor slightly
nuts. However, LIENVOY reported that on 16 September 1969
LIROCKET-l's wife called 201-028975 and told him she had to see him
urgently on something of extreme interest about her husband.
201-028975 told her to come to the Embassy, which she did, and
she presumably repeated her accusation. Since that time
LIROCKET-1 has received a polite brush-ofí. He has been told
that the MHARSHI Embassy has run out of funds for English
'language training, and that there would be no more lessons
unless 201-028975's replacement, or the new Ambassador (when
and if one arrives) wanted to rehiro him. He was told,
however, to check in regularly, and he was given, as usual,
an invitation to the annual MHHARSH national day reception (he
did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKET-1 has not spoken
with 201-028975 since his wife's visit--all dealings have been
through AEPOLYP, who has for some time been the paymaster for
LIROCKET-1.
'
3) LIROCKET-1 was not aware of his wife's visit, and
even after the case officer, without telling him that we knew
of the visit, brought LIROCKET-1 around to the conclusion that
she might have done this, he still does not think that she
spilled the beans to 201-028975. (It is apparent that the
MHHARSHers, whether or not they believe Mrs. LIROCKET-1's
story, have concluded that LIROCKET-1 represents a security.
hazard, and they are simply going to drop him. LIROCKET-1
will continue to press the NHHARSHers for an answer regarding
his future with them, and if, as suspected, they keep putting
him off, he will be instructed to break contact and he will be
terminated by the Station.)
+
4) Other than the blowing of LIROCKET-1 himself,
little damage has been done. The wife has never seen the current
case officer and knows none of the meeting arrangements or other.

5. Security
The
There are no known unresolved problems of security.
security problems relating to LIROCKET-1 and LISACK-C (discussed.
above) are under control with no adverse effects noted.
6. Plans
a.
There are several assets of the REDTOP section who
have been carried under SD/COA for a fairly bng period of
time. Since the targets of their access change from time to
time, as well as the nature of the information they provide,
we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to
cover them. We do believe, however, that they should be
brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and
administration without resorting to separato progress reports
on each.
b.
Since their activities closely parallel those of
assets already covered by LISACK, we believe it would be
logical to include LI20EBIN-1 and -2, LIORDER-1 and Subject
of 201-843659 (on when we are awaiting an Operational Approval)
in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary,
such a change will require some cost amendment to the Project
to account for minor operational expenses which have heretofore
been charged to SB/00A. Separate correspondence will follow
on these assets.
C. There are several additional assets currently in the
developmental stage who may eventually be administered under
LISACK. These include Subject of HIMMA-37742 of 28 August 1969,
targetted against AEPOLYP; Subject of 201-851552, targetted
against AEMERGER; Subject of 201-848881, currently in social
contact with Subjects of 201-250503 and 201-029068 under
Station direction; and Subject of 201-859225, who reports on
his contacts with Subjects of 201-305052 and 201-744341,
among other MHHARSHers.

details, and neither she nor LIROCKIT-1 knows the true nace of
any of LINOCKET-1's, past or present handlers. Necessary
security precautions have been taken at all meetings with
LIROCKET since his wife's conversation with 201-028975, and
there have been no signs of HARSH surveillance.
T
f. DAPETAL-1: She has been net weekly for a total of
13 times during the period. Meeting hours are prearranged and
the location is always a safehouse. Her normal function has
been to report on the activities at the DELET installation
where she is employed as the secretary to the DHLET Ambassador.
In addition, she performed some casing and investigation in
support of the AETAKEOFF audio operation. Since the DNLET
target is of low priority, DIPETAL-1 has been attempting to
increase her usefulness to us by trying to obtain a job in
the office of the President of the PRI, the ruling political
party, with excellent prospects for success.
6. LISACK-2:, Until he lost his job in September, he was
the resident administrator of the apartment building in which
both AEMERGER and AEMAESTRO reside. Meetings were held bi-weekly
for a total of four times, pre-arranged by telephone call
several days in advance to his office in a publishing firm.
Neeting location was a restaurant/cafe and meetings normally
lasted about thirty minutes. He provided information on the
activities of these two MARSHers and their families, license
plate numbers, and descriptions of visitors.
h. LISACK-4: He is the portero of the apartment building
in which Subject of 201-305870 resides. He maintains a daily
log of the movements and activities of this and other NUMARSHers,
and he reports the license plates and description of visitors
to the building. He was met weekly for a total of 12 times,
always in a small restaurant within walking distance of the
downtown office where he works a half day. Neeting hours aro
pre-arranged to permit LISACK-4 to attend on the way to or
from this second job. He compensates for his lack of formal
education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural
intelligence and cooperation.
He was
1. LISACK-6: He is the portero of the building in which
Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788861 (who took the apartment
of Subject of 201-205304) reside. He maintains a daily log
of these two MIHARSHers, their families and visitors.
met 12 times during the period. Since he cannot be absent from
the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion,
meetings are always for a brief ten minutes and are held in a
nearby park. As has been reported, the case officer who handles
LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August,
and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6. The
Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that
the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by male and
female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any
event, LISACK-6 has been put on ice, to be revived if the
occupants of his building become higher priority targets.
j. LISACK-7: She was not met during the reporting period.
She remains a "reserve asset" for special requirements in the
real estate field for such potential uses as safehouse rental,
key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although
there is no immediate requirement for her talents, we would.
like to maintain her Operational Approval so that she can be
called ou as a cleared asset when needed.

subsequently promoted to the rank of Vice Consul, and as of March
1963, held the position of Consular Attache. Subject was reassigned

1. Reference la made to your request dated 25 July 1969
concerning Subject.
2. In a report dated 27 August 1962 from a reliable source,
Subject was listed as a known or suspect KGB (Soviet Committee
for State Security) officer. Although this report did not specify
how Subject's position or possible position as an intelligence
officer was determined, numerous additional reports have
established that Subject is an officer in the KGB. Several of
these reports are noted below.
A report dated 12 January 1962 from a
reliable source indicated that Subject
had a background which "smelled
strongly" of Soviet intelligence service
(RIS) connections (i.e., a graduate of the
Foreign Language Institute and/or the
Institute of Foreign Affairs in Moscow).
Subject was described as possibly RIS
as early as 1959 when he attended an
Electrotechnical Congress held in Madrid,
-Spain, from 30 June to 10 July 1959.
During this congrees, Subject was

I recall that also in El Universal Grafico my colleague,
at
Alonso Fonseca G., published a note entitled "Alegres Diplomaticos"
[Tipsy Diplomats) recounting the entertaining story of the "binge
of Vladislav Koromovshkin and Valery Kostikov, attache and second
secretary respectively of the Soviet embassy in Mexico. These
officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive wines
in the 'red' district of Mexico City but had to bring their
adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they
hurled at Mexico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed."
Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent beha
but are also demonstrating their incompetence.
[sic]
The Peruvian chancellor, Mercado, Jarrin, who announced the
arrival of the Soviet trade mission, answered the newsmen's question
with a laconic comment that "at the appropriate time you will learn
whether the government has decided to take that step" (of establish-
ing diplomatic relations with the USSR). Before the Lima government
"decides to take that step," we would like to reproduce these two
paragraphs which the journalist Bernardo Escalante published in an
article entitled "La Embajada Misteriosa" (The Mysterious Embassy]

in the newspaper El Sol de Mexico.
"The strange thing is that the Soviet embassy is one of
those with the largest staff but with the least to do. Those
branches that have contact with the public consular section,

SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE
STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK
_ by Carlos Montiel
'
Source: La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 May 1969, San Jose,
Costa Rica
Mexico City
--
In a letter addressed to our editorial
department Peruvian newsmen informed me that, being acquainted..
with my article "Ahora Peru" (Now Peru], they asked that country's
chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade
mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important
mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation.
had
In that article I observed that members of the Soviet
embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social
circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diplomatic
relations with the Kremlin at the embassy level.
According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily
La Prensa confirmed with prominent play the report that I had made
in El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to
the indiscretion of Soviet diplomats included in the "cocktail
circuit" organized here among the ambassadors and trade representatives,
of foreign countries.

in making propaganda 'from one place to another' inasmuch as
in the land of Brezhnev and Kosygin they do not even have a
remote idea of what Mexico is like.
"What is this plethora of Soviet personnel used for
then in that embassy where not even a single Mexican citizen is
employed, where the domestics themselves are Soviet, in that
huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery
deepens if one considers that the Mexican embassy staff in Hoscow
barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more
than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a
large embassy staff in our country if it does what ours does in
Moscow?"

HMMA-36517, 14 February 1969
MICROFLA
On 1 April 1969 the Station received a memorandum from
local LNERGO concerning the latest meeting AEBURBLE had with his
Soviet Case Officers. This memorandum 18 1orwarded under separate
cover as Attachment #1. The meeting took place in Mexico City on
3 and 4 February 1969. The Soviet case officers were Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN (201-784917) and Valeriy Vladimirovich
KOSTIKOV (201-305052).
2. On 8 April 1969 we answered LNERGO's memorandum with comments
concerning NIKITIN's and KOSTIKOV's whereabouts on 3 and 4 February
1969, the possible meeting place on 4 February 1969, and the cars
used. Recent photographs oi NIKITIN and KOSTIKOV were forwarded
to local LNERGO also. This Station memorandum is forwarded under
separate cover as Attachment #2.
3. It is interesting to note that the 1969 Volkswagen with
Mexico City plates 787 IW, assigned to Stanislav Vasilyevich SYCHEV
(201-320963) was used as the vehicle to drive AEBURBLE to the meeting
site on 4 February 1969. The use of SYCHEV's vehicle, which is one
of two Soviet vehicles which do not have diplomatic license plates,
strengthens our suspicion that SYCHEV is a KGB officer.

- Phat
but, in the midst of a big "binge" made possible by hateful
capitalist brandy and whiskey, they decided to accompany four
engineers of PEMEX [Petroleos Mexicanos; Mexican Petroleum] in
an old automobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the
custozáry excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine"
drove the Russians to the worst extremes of crudeness exhibited
without any of the "academic bearing" that the Friendship
University of Moscow notes as the major assets acquired by the
progressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on
the Mexicans.
The four PEMEX engineers, as any well-born sons would
have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon,
the Russians suddenly became transformed into diplomat-gunmen;
brandishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no doubt
because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote-
controlled spaceships directed at the moon than in the skillful
discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed in
short order by the Mexicans.
'
On reaching Ciudad Victoria the PEMEX engineers handed
1
the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities.
Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the
Soviet representatives get their comeupparce the latter, with
insulting arrogance, insisted that their diplomatic immunity te
respected.
Let us compare the aggressive stance of both Muscovites
with the Chinese government of Mao Tse-tung so insistent on.

TIPSY DIPLOMATS
by Alonso Fonseca G.
NOL identified. //
Source: NoL ident
This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in
the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive
wines in the "red light" district of Mexico City and reached :
1
its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are
involved are two Marxist-Leninists from the Soviet Union who,
on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on
respectable diplomats, "tanked up" in tourgeois bars, not in
order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful episode or other
that gnawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of
abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext
that when one is "tipsy" everything that he does is absolved..
The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery
Kostikov, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshkin, attache,
not only forgot among hippies the socialist ethics in order to
indulge in a "small drink among those who are in the limelight"

Soviet Contact with Alejandro DARUDEZ Alegria (201-062689)
*ITIOS REQUIRED PERCES
"
1. The Station believes that Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegría,
Nicaraguan Communist living in exile in Hexico and knowa to
have been the link between Roscov and the Nicaraguan Communist
Party in regard to sending Nicaraguans to both CPSD school and
Patrice Lumumba University in Koscow, is identical with the
Modesto #RIVAS BO in 1965 was reported in contact with iden-
tified KGB officer Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-505002)
as well as with the Hocesto #BERMUDEZ, originally thought to
have been a Panamanian, who in 1905 was reported in contact with
KOSTIKOV and then with his successor, Vladislav Sergeyevich
KORMUSHKIN (201-744341), who is also an identified KGB officer.
It is noted that Alejandro BMNHUDE Alegria uses the alias
Modesto RIVAS for receiving mail at his post office box letter
drop.
2. Following is a chronology of the LI VOY reporting on
"Modesto'a" contact with the Soviets. As will be seen, it ap-
pears that the combination "Modesto BERMUDEZ" was a conclusion
jumped to by LIENVOY and was in fact probably never given as
such. The references to "Panamanians" could be a cover for
"Nicaraguans."
&. On 1 Jun 1935 "Modesto RIVAS" called at the Soviet
Embassy for KCSTIEOV and arranged to meet him at four o'clock
"in the same place.”

man actually said.)

1. On 22 Sep 1965 LIGHVOY reported that "Modesto
BERMUDEZ, panament" called from inside the Soviet Embassy at
1128 hours to a local travel agency (T.(1./Greyhound) and spones
with hias LABASTIDA, asking her about the price of the ticket.
to Prague undor the saw systen they had used to send the other
people. LABASTIDA asked for cae of the makes in order to pull
the card to sea how it had been done, and "BERMUDEZ” give her
the nano Guillermo #AGUIRE. LAZASTIDA gave hin various pon-
siblo flights and asked that he call back in the afternoon for
more definite information. (Station traces show that Guillermo
AGUIRER Rodriguez, 201-245711, is a Nicaraguan who was at the
CPSU school in Moscow in 1965.) (LILYRIC reported that the man
in the attached photograph, who is undoubtedly identical with
Alejandro BARUDE Alegria, visited the Soviet Bebassy in Mexico
City from illi to 1107 hours, Tacre therefore sooma no question
that he is the "Hocesto BARMUDEZ, panarono" who has been reported
by LIMVOY in all the above conversations.)
On 29 Sep 1965 LIENVOY reported that "Hodesto
BERMUDEZ, pan meno" called NORMU and said he had some things
("encargos") for him. KORELSHKIN said he would see Kodesto at
seven o'clock in the usual place.
