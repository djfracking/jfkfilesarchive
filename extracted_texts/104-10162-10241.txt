treat her husband better, and says, "I love my Galka very much,

C. continues soothing and lecturing B, and tries to convince
her that her husband isn't so bad. A. remaino silent.
C. changes the subject and suggests that Ivan finish him

about the good relationship between the MEDVEDEVs, C. says, "How

everything is done by them in a friendly manner." ((C. says

about the MEUVEDEVs and the foul up on the ment pastries))."

But
C. expresses his indignation about the situation and tells
of his conversation with the Ambassador about a dinner jacket when.
they were due to attend a function: "I told him... if I find a
dinner jacket... So, you will go ((alone)). You have one.

comment on tickets which they have received for various concerts.
((Readability is very poor: the TV covers their conversation.))
They talk about themtrical artists, the Bolshoi Theatre, and an
orchestra. Mention is made of DUBAYEVSKIY, the composer, and
various records. ((Loud music govers their conversation.))

of this lack is quite simple: AELANYARD has been main-

out a two week operation whereby we used different equip-

now have, we believe, sufficient coverage to establish
the pattern of activity of AEBOOR.

know that on two occasions AEBOOR did not return home
until five or six in the morning. Mrs. AEBOOR on one
occasion launched into him domanding to know where he had
been, etc. His reply was "I have been working" and nothing

Reference: HABA-20512, dated 25 April 1969
1. Reference dispatch described our efforts against AEBOOR
and stated that the next phase would consist of a 24 hour a day
surveillance of Subject for a period of about two weeks. The
coverage was initiated at 0600 hours on 19 May, and terminated
Rt. 1515 hours on 26 May, the day of AEBOOR's departure for home
leave.
2. The overall results of the surveillance effort were
interesting, and provided us with a great deal of basic data which
should prove valuable in futuro AEBOOR operational planning.
Although the period covered must be viewed as somewhat atypical
I since it covered a time of proparation for homo leave, the basic
pattern could not have varied greatly from the norm. There was
definite evasive action' designed to shake surveillance taken by
AEBOOR on several occasions; there were repeat visits to soveral
establishments which could easily sorve as lottor drops or con-
tact points; and there was an interesting contact on 21 May
(reported in BUENOS AIRES 3009) with an individual we failed to
identify positively.
2. Although the above makes it appear that we are approaching
the ASBOOR peration strictly from the CI/CE angle, this is not
the case. We are attempting to gather adequate information to
give us a clear insight into AEBOOR's activition in order to help
us attempt to introduce an accoms agent into this operation, or
to expand direct development of Subject by Station officers.
4. Forwarded under separato cover for Headquarters study
are copies of the surveillance reports along with a copy of the
AELANYARD transcript for 21 May.

transcript of 26 February we have extracted the information on

team do at loast an initial check. Otherwise, we are con-
fronted with tantalizing fragments which appear to be significant
but defy any attempt to read meaning into them. The pages are
filled with namos of individuals that we have not been able to
identify, exceptions being those of officials presently or
formerly stationed in Argentina. (From experience with BILOCULAR
_ and other BIOGENESIS transcripts, we feel that some of these
names escapo recognition simply because they are so garbled.)

3. In the coming months Buenos Aires Station plans to
examine and assess the AELANYARD transcripts with care in an
effort to decide whether they truly are worth the great
amount of time now devoted to their review by Station officers.
It is our present feeling that alternative, hopefully more
productive oporations against 201-236701 should be considered
unless we and/or the BIOGENESIS transcribers develop a greater
facility for putting the product into a more meaningful context.

Operational Possibilitios against ABBOOR'
Reference:
NCSW 7566, 11 February 1969
1. With the departure of ABBOOR and his wife on home leave,
wo would like to offer a fow comments about him for possible future
action by the Station when he returns. The impetus for these
thoughts was a recent examination of the files of all those Soviets
on the priority target list to determine if, perhaps, one of them
offers more of a potential for intensive development than another.
The purpose of this review was not to discard the agreed-upon targot
list, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept
of selective targetting; but rather, to attempt a narrowing of the
Station's focus on the one particular Soviet who appears to be the
best selection for operational development among the priority group.
We have looked at such factors as susceptibilities (known or
potential) contacts, accessibility, etc. and, for reasons discussed
below, feel that ALBOOR may be the best solection for a determined
Station effort aimed at his eventual recruitment. Thus, the Station's
focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its present
lovel but at the same time, ABBOUR would be placed "under the
microscope" as the object of a more intensive Station offort aimed
at gaining multiple access to him.
2, With the imminent departure of BIBANDIT/12 from Buenos
Aires and the resulting elimination of our one good contact with
ABVULTURE, the choice of ALBOUR became easier to make. His selection,
however, was based on several considerations which, from our
vantage point, seem to offer the best potential for Station action
when he returns to the country.
CHO DEFERENCE TO
vä
Accessibility: ABBOOR is one of the very few Soviets
with whom ulroet Staffor contact has been mindo. The social
ovening spont with him and his wife in January showed excellent
premise because it appeared that foundations for rapport and
Surther contact had been laid. We note, however, that there
has been no mention further meetings since the initial one,
four and one-half months ago. Due to the clapsed time, we
assume that Subject and his wife are not planning to rociprocate
the invitations on the other hand, enough time will have passed
since the initial contact for the Station to take the initiative

again and instigate a second meeting soon after Subject
returns from home leave. Since there are no other access
agents now in touch with Subject, the potential for assess-
ment of our target personality by direct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure.
Through the advantages of direct assessment, wo should be
able to make a good judgment concerning the susceptibilities
(or lack thereof) of ALBOOR and accordingly, determine the
value in pursuing him as a priority target.
b. The impressions of A&BOOR and his wife from the one
meeting thus far seem to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station may wish to consider in their planning. The
wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than
ABBOOR and through her professed interest in theatre, music,
and ballet, it might be possible for Nina T. MARGANDE to
exploit this interest and invite her to selected cultural
events. If ALBOOR does not share his wife's proclivitios
for the "arts", then she might appreciate the presence of
female commanion who shares her interests. AbBOUR's wife
also claimed to like both American songs and dancing. This
too, might open the door to some form of imaginative approach
built around a future invitation whereby the incipient social
relationship of 9 January would be further developed in the
depth needed for a thorough assessment of the target. Culti-
vation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate
because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her
and her husband. The accounts of this relationship from ther
previous tour in Mexico and also the current transcripts from
ABLANYARD paint a picture of an irascible and foul-mouthed
It
husband constantly doing battle with a dominooring wife.
seems likely that the impression of "sweetness and light" which,
they generated during their evening with the Station case
officers was atypical and manufactured for the benefit of
their hosts. This, of course, is natural with most couples
who choose not to air their personal differences in public.
but from our point of view, this lack of harmony between
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct possibilities for the
Station to contact the wife independently and offer her welcome
diversions from the regimented and turbulent life with her
husband. (We call your attention to the reference since it
may provide some useful points in devising an approach to
BOOR's wife). Their present home leave in the USSR would
seem to offer a ready-made situation for renewed contact when
they return since natural curiosity about their activities
and time spent at home could be sufficient grounds for an
invitation either to both or singly to spend an evening together.
We offer those thoughts only because they appear to us as good
opportunities not only to maintain Staffer contact with a
target of priority interest, but to also develop this contact
further to the degree of intimacy needed for a recognition
and ultimatic exploitation of his susceptibilities.
Since there are no access agents now in touch with
ABBOOR, we suggest, as a supplement to the direct Staffor
contact and in order to obtain additional assessments of Subject
from other angles, the Station consider "running" a controlled
In
asset into ALBOOR under suitably contrived circumstances.
other words, we would crente a relationship where none pre-
viously existed. By this device, we are not suggesting a doable
agent operation in which our agent offers himself for recruit-
ment; on the contrary, the rationale is simply to move a
controlled asset into the path of the target and attempt to
estabilan a contact through a common bond of social or business
interests. If we agree that ABBOOK can be brought under a more
intensive scrutiny than the other Soviets, then this ploy
would be a logical stop in his development as a recruitment
target if additional access to him is non-existent.

1. After many months of contact and many promises
to "get together" some evening, Paul W. LEVERONE received
a firm promise from 201-236071 that he and his wife would
drop by for a drink and a snack on 9 January 1969. The
promise became a reality, and the report of the evening's
activities is forwarded under separate cover,

1. Subject arrived at 1930 Learing a Russian record as a gift
from his wife and a bottle of vodka with a jar of caviar as a gift from
himself. He apologized that his wife could not make it that evening because
she had to attend a "command performance". Although Subject claim to be
under a doctor's care for problems with his stomach and legs (blood pressure
problems) and is supposed to avoid use of alcohol or four months, he did
accept & drink (Scotch) and then proceeded to chat about various inconsequential
topics. At about 2:000 MARGANDE dropped in and a general conversation
ensued. LEVERONE offered to prepare some Shashlik and Subject stated that
it was one of the favorite dishes of his wife. He suggested that perhaps
he could pick her up after the "command performance" and bring her to the
apartment. This was readily agreed to but since there was an hour and
a half remaining before Subject could fetch his wife, we continued with
general conversation. The following points concerning Subject's past
activity came to light.
a. Subject stated that he had spent some time in Argentina in
1958 and that during this time he had had a chance to travel freely
politer
and see something of the country. The pouple were friendlier,
and less hurried then. He did not go into detail as to what he was
doing in Argentina but it appears to have been an official pisit.
b. His "high point" was Mexico and his fondest memories are
of his time spent there. Ho claims that he was able to travel over

had various close friends in the journalistic field including several
Americano (wic). In Mexico he was a PRAVDA correspondent.
G. Subject also stated he had been in Ecundor for an unspecified
length of time during the month when the annual Indian ficuta in
held. No claimed to like the place very much and described at langth
the Indian practice of selling all their produce at the fair and
then spending the money on liquor.
d. When Subjout was ready to leave Mexico he applied for a

any specific problems regarding the visa or if it was being
withheld simply because he was a Soviet. If the latter were
the case, he said he would raise the question with the President
of the United States (who was visiting Mexico at the time and
was going to hold a press conference). Subject claims that as
a result of this threat the visa was issued almost immediately.
Due to completely fortuitous circumstances, Subject and three
other Soviet correspondents met in New York on the 4th of July.
LNERGO allegedly became excited about the presence of four Soviet
correspondents in New York at one time and carried on a very
tight surveillance which was quite annoying. During this time
the notes compiled for books on Latin Amerien were stolen from
Subject and as a result his literary ambitions have not been
realized.
0. Subject stated that he has a 14-year old son in Moscow and
although they miss the boy, there are no adequate schools in
Argentina. This is the reason for the separation.
In Mexico
the Soviet Embassy has provision for the three primary grades.
That is where Subject's son started his schooling.
2. At 2130 hours Subject left to pick up his wife saying he would be
back in about 40 minutes. This was fine since it gave MARGANDE and LEVERONE
At 2230 hours Subject called

to say they were "on the way" and would be over shortly. At 2315 they arrived
at LEVERONE's apartment.
3. A general four-way conversation continued during which Subject'o and
his wife's comments ran au follows:
a. Their son in Moscow is studying English and speaks it rather
well. He also keeps fish in a 175-liter fish tank. Subjent was
unable to recall the sort of fish in question.
b. There was a rather lengthy commentary on the system of sending
single people abroad for assignment to embassies. Subjectis wife
was very surprised that the Americans would send single men and women
abroad since this was very "dangerous". She stated that the Soviets
occasionally send a single girl to a foreign post but the implication
was very strong that she was "well chaperoned".

d. AVDEFTH: The ability to monitor ABBOOR through this
technical operation was a key factor in deciding to bring him
under cinser focus. it should be able to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
singular opportunity to "observe" AEBOOR" when he is relaxed at
home and not exhibiting the official mannerisms and personality
which he must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleagues. If we are able to expand the burgeoning Staffor
contact with Subject as well as place access agents in touch
with him, then his reactions to these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly.
3. As part of the total offort to build up a large amount of
information on the selected target, we are including as an attachment,
a copy of the new Personality Characteristic questionnairo (PCQ) with
instructions for its use. By employing it in conjunction with your
direct assessment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly build up
onough information on him so that the indirect psychological assess-
ment techniquican also be applied. The PCQ is a now form and less
time-consuming than others but we believe it should be an integral part
of the entire assessment process focused on a target Soviot and that
it can be an invaluable aid in attempting to evaluate the varied
impressions of the target which have been obtained from multiple
access to him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the impression
that many of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determination of a persons susceptibility to manipulation. The
questionnaire should not be perused piecemeal, however, but taken in
its entirety' since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by
the indirect psychological assessment techniques until a very complete
impression of the total personality emerges. We encourago the Station
to wailize the PCQ and when sufficiently complete, forward it to
Headquarters for evaluation.
Once again, we wish to emphasize that leadquarters is
position to offer guidance and support to your efforts, but the
direction of the case rests with the Station. The case officer
involved is in the best spot to judge the progress of the case and
make decisions accordingly. For this reason, we encourage a continu-
ous and candid dialogue, concerning the various aspects of your
operations against the selected Soviet targets in order to insure
professional development of each caso, If our choice of ABBOOR is
at wariance with your on-the-spot assessment of the priority Soviets,
thon we would appreciate your appraisal of him as well as any
suggestions about a more logical candidate for closer focus.

CROAT RIFINENT
1. It has come to our attention through AKLANYARD that
Ivan Gavrilovich ALFHIYEV (201-236071), a known KGB officer,
may have traveled to Uruguay during the first days of November.
This suspicion is taend on the fact that Subject informed his
wife he had to take a trip to Uruguay and then was not seen
in Buenos Aires on the following Saturday and Sunday, the
2nd and 3rd on November. Although we have been unable to
find any record of travel or any request for permission to
travel on his part, we cannot discount the possibility of
his having traveled under false documentation.
2. Forwarded herewith is a photograph of Subject for
your files. Buenos Aires Station will continue to monitor
Subject's activities. If it appears that he is planning a
trip to Uruguay, Montevideo Station will be notified immedi-
ately, and some coordinated action can be taken to try and
determine his contacts and activities while he is in Uruguay.

c. They were both interested in the linguistic abilities of
individuals assigned to the American Embassy and stated that the
Americans were often sent abroad with virtually no knowledge of the
language whereas the Soviets were always well trained. (Subject's
wife managed to get this point across in her halting Spanish and with
assistance from her husband whom she kept asking for the Spanish
equivalent of Russian words.) Subject did state that the Soviet
language training system was not the greatest and seemed to give a
point to the U.S. system when MARGANDE said that she had learned
her Spanish from tapes and instruction.
d. Subject and his wife agreed that Buenos Aires is a large,
dirty, indifferent city. They talked with nostalgia about their
Moscow apartment which was only a ten-minute drive from lovely forests
and streams where "a person could really relax". They mentioned that.
they had a quinta to which they retired on weekends but that the
quinta was noisy and full of mosquitos. (MARGANDE and Subject's
wife agreed that laid and off were the most important purchases
in Bueno's Aires in the summertime.)
3. Conversation and listening to music continued until about 0200
hours (with Subject's wife oohing and auhing over American songs and
arrangements). The evening was friendly and relaxed and there
was no attempt to get into deeper political or ideological discussions
since the primary purpose was to establish rapport and pave the way for
future meetings.
4. Given below are MARGANDE's and LEVERONE's impressions of Subject
and wife:

Subject: Although Subject at times gives the impression of being
rather simple follow, this effect is created more by his apparent non-
aggressive attitude than by actual evaluation of his intelligence. He
appears to be au courant of the general situation in Argentina and its
assessment of world situations and incidents seems to be quite logical
and unbiased. It might even be suggested that Subjent is not overly influenced
by Soviet official stands concerning certain specific topics. Unlike
201-183943, he does not go about spouting a vary obvious party line, Subject
presents a pleasant appearance, dresses well (he had on a clean shirti),

individual with a fairly good sense of humor. He appears to understand a
fair amount of English but it is hard to judge his speaking ability since
he seems to be reluctant to talk at length in the language. He also appears
to know some Georgian. He claims to know the Soviet Union west of the Urals
rather well but gives the impression that he has never traveled in the eastern
part of the country. From his comments and from observation it can be
assumed that he enjoys Mexican and modern American records and perhaps
even prefers them to the new, socially conscious Soviet music. His
one detracting mannerism is a heavy and constant blink.
Subject's wifes Subject's wife is also attractive and has a warm
personality. She dresses well and is interested in theater, music and
ballot. She enjoys going to the Colon but thinks the ballet at the Bolshoy.
is much better. She claims to enjoy dancing and apparently does not drink
very much.
Her Spanish is halting but adequate to make herself understood.
Their Relationship: Subject and his wife appear lu be a couție wild,
if not in love, have grown used to each other and each other's ways.
Despite reports and direct evidence of their squabbling, it would be
dangerous to assume that this constitutes a weakness or domestic problems
They appear to rely upon each other and complement each other in social
situations to the point where a deeper understanding hetween them can be

assumed. (An interest occurence was the wife's flat declaration that
the Soviet Union was rapidly becoming a matriarchal society. Subject agreed
with a smile.) Although Subject does not take open issue with his wife
on topics where he may not be in complete accord, he manages to get his
point across with a joke and a smile. All in all, Subject and his wife
appear to be two that could take part successfully in any social gathering.

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
REF:
BUENOS AIRES 9897, 30 January 68
1. Forwarded herewith is a draft Soviet Personality Report,
Supplement, and Characterization on Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYÉV ·
(201-236701), known AGB officer of the Fifth Department (Latin America),
First Chief Directorate (Foreign Intelligence), who served as Pravda
correspondent in Mexico City from September 1960 to Uctober 1964. Al-
though the draft is not in polished form it is leadquarters feeling
that it represents an accurate summary of Subject's 201 file. lead-
quarters traces were made on Subject's contacts and included in the
attached Supplement. The Characterization, prepared in 1964 by Douglas
J. FEINGLASS, provides an excellent personality' sketch of Subject and
family.
2. Throughout his tour in Mexico Subject and family remained apart
from the Soviet colony, associating chiefly with the SHUBINS (201-266547)
and the SIENGALEVs (201-328294). Subject's ill temper, coarse language,

majority of his time was spent in CP liaison in Mexico, Ecuador, and¨¨
Cuba. He was also actively involved with various leaders of the
Movimiento Liberacion Nacional (MLN) and Central Campesina Independiente
Tijuana, and
(CCI),particularly in the rural areas of Ensenada
Mexicali. He took those occasions to contact local Russian emigres and,
in one instance, to develop a rural recruiter to assess Mexican youths
desiring to study in the USSR.

3. As explained in Reference A we briefed BIOGENESIS
in the early afternoon of 25 January. BIOGENESIS immediately
issued instructions that the portero of the building be
approachod. This was accomplished successfully in the
late afternoon of the same day. Unfortunately the portero
did not havo a koy. The same night a BIOGENESIS team of
three (including BIBAFFLE-3 and BIOGENESIS-14) attempted
in vain to pick the lock. In the course of this lock-
picking exercise PIBAFFLE-3 had to identify BIOGENES IS
interest in the apartment to the owner of the neighboring
apartment. Fortunately this individual is wealthy and
was cooperative.
4. Once we had been forced to temporarily withdraw
(ALFERYEV occupied the apartment on 27 January), we
obtained through BIOGENESIS the blueprints of the target
apartmont and the apartments which abutted. A study of
those blueprints shows that the apartment belonging to
tho woalthy cooperative neighbor has a maid's room which
shares tho wall of the living room of ALFERYEV's.
apartment. We pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested
that they onlist the further cooperation of the owner in
order that a microphone could be installed through the
common wall. Unfortunately the owner had departed for
several wooks leave.
5. The owner should be back in 'Buenos Aires at
this time and wo have instructed BIOGENESIS to approach
him again and to move on with the oporation. We are also
presently working on an LP.
6. Wo shall koop you advised of our progress in
this oporation.

unilateral investigation revealed that the lock on the door

2. There wore several reasons for this decision. First
of all, we do not doubt the operational value of having an
nud: installation in the apartment of an identified senior
KGB officer. However, a unilatoral installation is a difficult
and at times risky operation. Considering this and matching
it against the potential tako of the operation wo folt that a
joint operation would be more penotionl. Cost also influenced
our docision. At the samo time our experience with BIOGENES IS
in the "Vista" operation showed that BIOGENESIS was perfectly
willing to give us and only us the tapes from the audio
installation,
