Mr. Tovar. No.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Would you look at letter "E". Sonia and
Fred A-S-I-N-I-A-N. When did they defect?
Mr. Tovar.
They renounced their US citizenship in 1948.
So I assume that is the operative year.
Mr. Goldsmith. Will you look at the letter "F" now?
Mr. Tovar. Jack Kuralski.
Mr. Goldsmith. When did he defect?
Mr. Tovar. He recounced his US citizenship in '34 and
departed USSR I assume in 1934.
Mr. Goldsmith. The point I am trying to make is that the
memo responding to the Committee's inquiry makes reference to
ten individuals who defected between the years '58 and '63.
It then proceed to provide us with ten names. But in fact,
if we continue to look through the list we will see that seven

Mr. Tovar. So these would be at least consistent with that.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes, that is true. I would like also for
purposes of further clarification, to have you read the letter
dated May 12, 1978 starting with the second full paragraph.
It is not numbered.`
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I show you that only for your background
purposes, not to ask you any questions about it. In any event,
I would appreciate having the name of the individual who

Mr. Goldsmith. The response that was provided to the

Mr. Tovar. I would speculate that the contact with and

category would be FBI's prerogative and the Agency as a rule

would not have had any basic interest or reason to be involved

or contacted? In some cases they hit one out of three, in
other cases two out of three. I think they were giving the
best correlation with your criteria that they could.
Mr. “Goldsmith. I understand that. My point might be then
that the introductory section should not have stated that these
were people in 1958 and '63 when in fact they were not.
Mr. Tovar. You are right. That is an incorrect statement
Is your requesting memo here? That is not a very good state-

ment.
15
Mr. Goldsmith.
Here is the letter dated April 6, 1978

under number two.

22
Mr. Tovar. Then this would appear to correlate with that.
You asked to indicate whether the Agency from '58 to '63
interviewed or debriefed former American defectors.
So, the
time they defected is not the operative consideration.
13
Mr. Goldsmith. No, it was not.

Mr. Tovar. The time of the debriefing

Mr. Tovar.
Berween the Soviet-East European Division and
CI Staff we should be aware of it. The two were most primarily
concerned with the USSR. I think one or the other of us would
inform the Bureau. This is not our primary concern: The
Americans, even when they have been naughty boys, having gone
to USSR and decided to return, we still don't have necessarily
a professional interest in that type of person.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the responsibility of the CI Staff
within the CIA?
Mr. Tovar. In a couple of sentences it is a little
difficult. I will tell you what we do. The CI Staff has two
principal areas of activity. We are first of all a staff.
Are you familiar with the staff as opposed to the division?.
Mr. Goldsmith. No, I am not.
Mr. Tovar. You have seen the table of organization of

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Mr. Tovar. You know generally how we are organized?

Mr. Tovar. The main set of components of the Directorate
is divisions and staffs.

The divisions operate a function over-

as a matter of routine operating procedure, debriefing return-

Mr. Tovar. None that I am aware of.
Mr. Goldsmith. Again would you say you relied on the
FBI to conduct those interviews?'

Mr. Goldsmith. Is there any coordination between the
Agency and the FBI so that the Bureau is informed when someone
in fact is returning?

Mr. Tovar. I know of no case where they would be
interested in the subject. I can't say there is a procedure
in being. Knowing the way we relate to the FBI, if we knew of
a case of returning Americans, Say we learned it from an
overseas station and it seemed of interest, we would probably
refer it directly to the FBI by letter.
I am speculating here because I know of no case in point.
Mr. Goldsmith. There is no standard procedure for contact-
ingthe Bureau and informing them of a returning defector?
Mr. Tovar. Not that: am aware of.
Mr. Goldsmith. You would be the person who would be aware
of such a procedure?'

So, having said that, the primary field of activity for
the CI Staff is research and analysis, and then the other,
what we refer to as operations coordination.
Now, that is sort
of the term which does not -- research and analysis is clear.
We examine and analyze cases, essentially cases. We are not
scrutinizing people. We are looking at intelligence operations)
old and current, primarily things that are not terribly
current. We don't tend to follow current operations in the
analytic sense. We take old cases and look them over to see
if mistakes were made, to see if we can derive lesssons from
mistakes made in the past. We publish papers for the Agency's
community at large, all in the R&A field.……

We monitor what they are doing, not in the sense of being
spooky but we simply read the correspondence. We are given
normal distribution of most: correspondence coming back from
overseas. We keep a hand on the pulse of counterintelligence
activities abroad.
To do this, we obviously have to have reasonable currency
on operational activity across the board. So, we are generally
aware of the operational patterns of activity that prevail in
various overseas stations. On that basis we are in a position

to advise the DDO or Directorate as to the level of performance,
the kind of activity conducted; the quality, the proper or
improper degree of emphasis. We maintain an overview on behalf
of DDO.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is your concentration oriented towards
counterintelligence threats of a foreign nature?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, totally.
Mr. Goldsmith. You would not be concerned at all with
counterintelligence threats domestically?
Mr. Tovar. None whatsoever.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is it correct to say that would be the

Absolutely.
Now, Lee Harvey Oswald returned from the

Soviet Union in 1962. While in the Sovietion Únion he worked
16
as a worker in a radio factory. Upon his return I imagine there

questions but would it be fair to say that would be more

his actual return?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, the question whether or not he was, let
us say, a counterintelligence threat.

about that.
Mr. Goldsmith.
However, 'would the Agency make any effort

Union to the United States?
Mr. Tovar. You are speaking of what the Agency might have
done in '63 or '62?

Mr. Tovar. Again, we are speculating concerning the
intelligence of the men who were in charge then.

It was not their primary precise prerogative. I think if they
could, as I assume they did, the Bureau would discharge its
responsibilities vis-a-vis any American of questionable

Bureau.
Mr. Goldsmith. That would be the aspect of Oswald where
there was a concern taht he posed a counterintelligence threat.
What about the fact that Oswald may have had positive intelli-
gence information that would have been helpful to the Agency?
That would not be within the jurisdiction of the Bureau?
Mr. Tovar. I think in that context it might have been
appropriate for the Agency. if the assumed the point you made,
to seek an interview with him. I think the appropriate

vehicle for that would have been the Domestic Contact Division
which I think handled most of the contacts referred to in this
memorandum.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the function of the Domestic
Contact Division?
Mr. Tovar. They are responsible for intelligence that
can be checked properly and legally in the United States y
normally through American businessmen or American persons and
nonofficials who travel abroad and acquire intelligence of
interest. This is not jus: USSR. It could be any other
country. Their primary field of activity is to contact and
12 debrief on a vluntary basis, if they so choose to respond,
Americans who return from overseas.

Mr. Goldsmith. I notice that the Committee's inquiry
concerning the CI's policy as to returning American defectors
was routed to your staff, CI Staff. When the memo was prepared
by the CI Staff for the Committee, was it done with the thought
of representing the entire agency or just the CI Staff?
Mr. Tovar. It is difficult for us to presume to speak for
the entire Agency. I think on this matter we are speaking for
21 the Directorate of Operations, not for the entire Agency.
Mr. Goldsmith. Fine. That is really the area with which
22

of activity, would be the SC Division. On this I think the
CI staff could be considered as speaking for the Directorate.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is the Domestic Contact Division part of
the CI Staff?
Mr. Tovar. No, part of the Directorate of Operations.
Mr. Goldsmith. The response of the Agency dated April
20, 1978, which appears in CIA Number 1818, indicates that
contact seems to be based on opportunity and circumstance.
Then it goes on to say only ten of the 117 persons have had
any contact with CIA. Would it be possible for you to go into
more dtail on what is meant by opportunity and circumstance?
Mr. Tovar. In the äsecne of a policy, of a guideline, a
procedure, internal instruction which says you will debrief
Americans who return from having resided in the USSR, in the
sabsence of that, this thing is left to chance obviously. I
cannot explain to you how the names of these 11 passed the desk
17
of whoever was in charge at the time, but assuming they did,
18
my guess, and it is really only a guess, would be that the
19
20
21
22
person who read that, whatever document it was, would say,
"Hmmph! He looks like he might be interesting", and perhaps
would then get in contact with CCD and suggest if they get in
contact with a person, let us say he is known to be living in
New York, suggest that they might want to seek out his location
23
24
and if possible interview him.

response on the part of the analyst who would say "Ah, let us
look into this further."
Mr. Goldsmith. In particular, a lot of focus has been
given to Mr. Robert Edward Webster, who appears in CIA Number
1820 who defected approximately the same time that Oswald did
and returned at approximately the same time that Oswald did and
who was debried by the CIA for two weeks in Virginia.

I think it would be a matter of chance in the sense that
the analyst or whoever it was who reviewed that document, might
react, and yet he or she might not, too, depending on how they

Since
the assassination of the President, there has arisen a group of
researchers who have reviewed the Warren Commission Report and
have reviewed releases made under the Freedom of Information
Act by the CIA and the FBI.
Having reviewed these materials the argument has been made
that Oswald received unusual treatment at the hands of the CIA.
14
One example of this unusual treatment is that there is no
15
record of Oswald having been debriefed by the CIA upon his

there any way you can give us guidance on how to respond to
that question?

along the way. I would hesitate to say more than Oswald

there is today no standard operating procedure of interviewing

to contact returning defectors and share information?
Mr. Tovar. None that I am aware of.
Mr. Goldsmith. Turning to another area which I would like
to get into briefly, would you define what a 201 file is?

that an individual was involved in, would you go to his 201
file or to his operations file?
Mr. Tovar. I would go to the 201 file first. There might
not be an operations file. In fact, in the vast majority of
the 201 cases there are no operational files because there is
no hard and fast rule on when you open a 201 file or who opens
a 201 file.
If I, for example, am overseas and I become interested in
a person who looks to me to have considerable promise from the
operational standpoint, say a local foreign type, I might give
my own local checks, I might examine my own files to see if I
know anything about him. 'Then I say to headquarters "here is
Joe Doe. He is interesting to me for these reasons.
Will you
please check against headquarters records and other agencies
ånd let me know if you have anything of interest on him."
I might not ask for a 201 file. Headquarters might then,
because they thought he was interesting, open a 201 file.
Conversely, I might likewise say this looks terribly interest-

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that the fact that someone
has a 201 file does not mean at all that the individual was
involved in any operations of the Agency. If you wanted to get
information of an operational nature, would you go both to the
201 file and operations file?
Mr. Tovar. Assuming here was information of an opera-
tional nsture?
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
Mr. Tovar. Yes, indeed we would.

Does the CIA have any affiliation with
3 organizations in the United States who might be responsible for
debriefing someone?

Mr. Tovar. Not that I am aware of.

Mr. Goldsmith. In other words, if anyone is going to be
debriefed it would be by the Domestic Contact Division?

13
Mr. Tovar. In the in:elligence sense. In the sense of
elucidation of intelligence, DCD would do it. A different type
of inquiry, personal investigation, the Office of Security, or
whoever it works through, would be the one.
The one we are talking about, DCD is the only organization
I know of. I can visualize a circumstance under which operating
components might seek out an individual or might have in times
past but I can't think of a case in point in my own recollec-
tion. I would say, given the strictures on our operating in
the United States, we would rely upon DCD to do it if they had
any positive intelligence connotation. If it were of an
operational nature today, the Foreign Resources Division might

pursue it.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
Mr. Tovar. It is the division level of the Directorate.

It is the division which seeks in the United States to develop
potential intelligence assets for abroad I think I had
25
better defer to the other people on that. That is roughly where

a field station might have a counter-person I described earlier
2
and become interested in him because he did have some CI
3
attraction or interest.
The station itself or the division would
5
8
10
open the 201 file. It would not be us. The CI Staff as a rule
is not involved in that type of thing.
At this stage of the game since we are not operating and
we are not out soliciting new contacts, we are not working in
that sense of the term, we don't to my knowledge originate 201
files.
Mr. Goldsmith. The C Staff does not open up 201 files?
Mr. Tovar. There is no reason that we couldn't.
11
12
Mr. Goldsmith.
13
14
15
As a pratical matter?
Mr. Tovar. As practical matter it does not work that way.
Our research is primarily ocused upon established cases, cases
that may even be dead, terminated, or dormant, or even current
16
in certain cases, but as a rule not very many. 201 file is
17
opened by someone else. We may examine those files and review
18
them. We do review other activities. But the 201 file would
be in existence. They whould not be created by ourselves.

:
Mr. Goldsmith. Will nost 201 files be open as a result of
information coming into headquarters from the field, one of
the field stations?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, the vast majority. In years before when
they has such programs as NH Chaos, I assumed they opened 201

which has been described in the press as domestic surveillance.

Mr. Tovar. I would speculate in the days when they were
functioning they probably did. You have a very unauthoriative
witness on that subject.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the relationship if any between
the Office of Security and the CI Staff?
Mr. Tovar. We have basically different functions. The
Office of Security is unde:: the Directorate of Administration
and is responsible for the personnel and physical security of
•
the entire division. It focuses on personnel security and
physical security.
The CI staff as I described it, is an element of DDO
13 concerned with research and analysis and operation and coordi-
nation. The relation between us and the Office of Security is
simply that between us and another fraternal element of the
Agency which has responsibility which sometimes comes close

Mr. Goldsmith. Is the Office of Security interested in
maintaining information so that if in the future an individual
was being considered for employment in some capacity with the
Agency the Secuirty Office would have that information on
him?
Mr. Tovar. I cannot visualize that heppening today.
Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to ask you to read CIA 0786,
which is a document that this Committee obtained from the
Office of Security files on Lee Harvey Oswald.
Mr. Tovar. That sort of suggests they maintained such
information then. I still cannot visualize there doing it
today.
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think the function of the Office of
Security may be different today from what it was in 1959 with
regard to maintaining such files?
Mr. Tovar. The function, I would use the term function,
I would say the policy of the Office as far as the way the
office operates today. I don't know what they do intrinsically.

or was of interest and so on and maybe there are reasons for
debriefing, I can visualize a 201 being opened if the matter
were of apparent continuing interest. I can see no reason why
a 201 would be opened in this case.
Mr. Goldsmith. What if this telegram was followed by a
aable indicating that the individual had decided to defect?
Mr. Tovar. What do you mean? He is applying for Soviet
citizenship, so he is defecting here?
Mr. Goldsmith.
You are correct. I withdraw the question.
Mr. Tovar. I think basically my point is that it is a
fact that a 201 need not be opened up on this type this is
12
a casual piece of informat:.on.

try to apply.

investigated whatever the CI Staff did in those days. I can't
speak to that with any first hand knowledge. I know some things
they did but I would be hesitant to make a general definition
of their function.
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether the function of that
group was to investigate Agency employees who were suspected
of having been penetrated?
Mr. Tovar. I think, because I have seen nothing in writing
on the subject, but I have been given to understand that was one

To whom would this document go today?
Mr. Tovar. You mean from the State Department?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, a State Department document. Which
is indicating that an American citizen is giving information,
intelligence information to a foreign country, to whom in the
CIA would that document go?
Mr. Tovar. I am not sure it would come to the CIA at all
because the CIA does not have responsibility for that type of
person. I think it would go to the FBI.
Mr. Goldsmith. Even though the individual is overseas?
Mr. Tovar. Yes. He is an American. Again, this is
speculation.
I don't know what moves the person who releases
cables to the Moscow Embassy today. He might decide or some-
body here in State Security might decide that CIA should see
this. In that event, it probably would go to the Office of
Security as a matter of information..

You know, inter-departmental correspondence is firing paper in

Mr. Goldsmith.
With regard to this document, after 1959
your testimony is moreorless speculation but you are saying
that today you don't think that this type of document would be
retained and have any special significance?
Mr. Tovar. I don't think so. I am scratching my head
trying to visualize circumstances under which it could be
retained.
There is nothing of interest to the Agency. There
is nothing of immediate counterintelligence interest. I don't
know who would retain it :: why.
Mr. Goldsmith.
For the purpose of clarification, if the
CI asked that of the CIA, by that I mean the counterintelligence
aspect of the CIA concerned primarily with a foreign counter-
intelligence threat, in otehr words, foreign nationals, foreign
citizens?

for the Army Intelligence and you are in Germany and you become
interdsted in Mr. Smith. Let us say you check Mr. Smith with
the CIA and with the other agencies and in so doing you wish
to have him recorded under the ISR, Inter Agency Source

another agency which said "Put Joh Doe's name in the ISR and
indicate he is a US Army intelligence source," at the very
least a person of interest to the US Army Intelligence Agency.

Mr. Goldsmith. So if someone were an agent it would in
all likelihood be indicated in the ISR and assuming the ISR

take note of that fact?
Mr. Tovar. Say that again. Some of this is pretty fuzzy

left the CI Staff, any type of followup was done by that staff
on the Nosenko issue?
Mr. Tovar.
Followup work?

Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
For example, one of the issues, the
key issue with regard to Mr. Nosenko was his bona fides.
Mr. Tovar. Yes, indeed. ·
Mr. Goldmsith. After Mr. Angleton left was any additional
analytical work done on that issue?

Mr. Tovar. I don't know for certain. The Hart Report is
a thick piece of paper. In the preparation of that report
there were probably all kinds of drafts, scratchings and sort
of preliminary jobs. All that I know would be in the context
of that report. All I know would be same representations in
response to the Director's inquiry or your inquiry or someone

Mr. Tovar. I am not sure. I would think it would be.
Again, I am speculating. I think almost certainly if I were
doing a file check on a person whose name came from one of the
field stations and it turned up the fact he was already
registered in the ISR, if a person is of interest let us say,
to the US Army Intelligence, that would automatically sort of
proscribe further attempts on my part to go in and get involved.
I think a notation would be made in the 201 file.
Mr. Goldsmith. As a practical matter that would be a good
reason for making the notation?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.

being registered there.

Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
Mr. Tovar. Most individuals don't maintain personal files,
I don't think. I would say, for example, anything I write,
I dictate a memorandum and I send it to anybody you want to
name, in a sense that is my work, I have done it but I don't
keep a personal file on that. That goes into my office file.
It is part of the office chronological file which is maintained
by my secretary. Let us say multiply that by 500,000 over, a
period of years the foles grow. At the time I leave I am
incidental in a sense. I just happen to be the person in the
job at the time. The files will still be there.
There is a normal retirement and destruction under normal
conditions, retirement and destruction program which eliminates
the accumulation of excessive useless material.
Mr. Goldsmith. Most paperwork would go in this office

Mr. Goldsmith. If it is an office chrono file does that

Mr. Tovar. Not necessarily. Here you ought to consult
my secretary. There might be a subject breakdown.
Ordinarily

no point in it. Let us say something I signed off on, here

that I might have signed, if I were there that day, I would
not maintain that in my front office as a rule. That would
probably be maintained by the office of origination. I think

am representing the staff as a whole.
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know when Mr. Angleton left the CI

I think it was either December '74 or January '75. That is the

Mr. Goldsmith. Think for a moment on the Nosenko issue.
As Chief of the CI Staff, if it were demonstrated to you very
clearly that the story given by Mr. Nosenko on Lee Harvey
Oswald was full of contradictions and in addition to contra-
dictions, it was in many ways simply incredible, what impact
would that have on the Agency's assessment of Mr. Nosenko as
being a bona fide rather than a dispatched defector?
Mr. Tovar. Well, it is difficult to answer. You are
posing a question in a narrow sense. You are focusing on one
point, Nosenko vis-a-vis Oswald and contradictions that may
emerge there. I would answer by saying that again I am not an
expert on Nosenko. I don'- profess to have a full grasp of
his bona fides or anything related to it.
I would say that question alone would not be enough to
15
satisfy me that the inquiry had been made carefully.
There is
'16
much more to it than what Nosenko had to say about Oswald.
17
13
There are more aspects about the bona fides issue, more than I
could give you today.
Mr. Goldsmith. I have read the Hart Report.
Mr. Tovar. He tried to deal with the whole consideration,

the whole Oswald, the handling, the methodology.
22
go into every jot and tittle of the issue.
He did not

Mr. Goldsmith. In fact, the Hart Report did not mention

Even so, the question I have

Oswald issue is untrue, cannot be believed, would that have any
impact on the Agency's assessment of him as a bona fied?
Mr. Tovar. The first reaction would be I would be deeply
distressed and concerned, I would want to know more about it.
You have to exptrapolate from me to the Agency. Other people
have views on this other than myself.

against the backdrop of the full Nosenko question.

personally be troubled by that?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, I think I would be troubled by it. I
would be troubled. I would be troubled that our current
assessment is wrong. That would trouble me.
Again, I would say, loo, if this is a serious proposition

you are making, let us say you adduced a number of analysts
who examined this thing thoroughly and were in a position of
making that kind of judgment, I would say, "I want to have
these analysts talk to my analysts because I am not in a posi-
tion to make that kind of judgment."
Mr. Goldsmith. First of all, I am not making the statement
that Nosenko's story on Oswald is inaccurate in any way.
Secondly, even if the story is inaccurate, I don't want
to suggest that because of that anyone on this Committee has
10 any feeling that that means Nosenko is not bona fide.

question is really very limited. A, if it were demonstrated

have on your overall assessment?
14

15
Mr. Goldsmith.
Yes.
16
Mr. Tovar. It would have to be examined. It would have

term "fighting it out" because there is no one here who is in

Mr. Tovar. Since I have no position to present and no

The only think I would reiterate is that I have been sort of
speculating here in many respects. Bear in mind there is an
area here where I have a purview that is perhaps valid. We
are talking about a lot of things which are way beyond my
immediate experience and certainly my current responsibility.
I would say, take some of my speculation with a grain of
salt, because I don't mean to be dogmatic on these things.

Mr. Tovar, since you have no direct

choosing these 117 people, I am not going to ask you questions

While you
read that paragraph, I will. state for the record that the way
the memo is set forth it indicates that it was not standard
