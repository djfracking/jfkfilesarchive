CI/R&A Memorandum, dated 22 June 1967,
same subject.
:
1. In response to your request, Subject's filo was
reviewed and Station JMWAVE was asked to supplement the
information in Headquarter's files with any additional
information which would be of value in judging the effect
on the Agency of Subjects' being investigated by Garrison
and/or NBC.
2. Our review shows that Subject was recruited by
the Agency in October 1962, not 1960 as was reported in an
earlier memorandum. He was given limited training for use
as an area guide on an infiltration operation in which he
participated during the latter part of May 1963. Subject
exfiltrated with his family about one week after being
infiltrated and was subsequently terminated.
