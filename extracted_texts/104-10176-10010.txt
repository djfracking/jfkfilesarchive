that Chairman of the Board, is Mitchell Livingston Werbell, m.
Werbell is a former Office of Strategic Services (OSS) officer
known to this writer during assignments in China during WWII.
2. This Agency, as well as other government agencies, have
considerable information on Werbell. He is an old and unsavory,
unsolicited, contact of the Miami Field Office dating from 1959.
He is of dubious character and reputation who had and has been
involved in grandoise schemes and international arms cals. He has
had perpetral financial difficulties.

1. 3. Merbell was involved with Baland Masferrer, Senior, in
comection with the abortive Haitian invasion in 1967. This may
throw a different light on possible source development of young
Bolando Jr. Any approach to him abould be executed with some degree
of cautio2. We do not desire to get involved with Werbell. However,
cannot foresee any objection to planned debriefings of Masferrer
Jr., following his trips to Latin America and other areas, in pursuit
of FPI and possible information of operational significance.

1. Subject seems to have inherited that particular
Latin American penchant for involvement in covert political
activities. However, the Subject's involvement is not merely
neatima or recrestion but it is instand intimately connected
with his chosen profession as an arms salesman. Here the
phrase "for fun and profit" seems aptly suited.
He seems
to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather than a towering intellect.
2. Subject has excellent contacts and access in
Latin America. This access developed from his extended
family, professional appointments, and his volvement with
Com exita gris fasily is well-known (infernus)
Enroughout many sectors of Latin America and opens many doors
for him (although it also closes others). It should also
be mentioned that his family has recently developed a rather
checkered association with this Agency. The particular
nature of his military products gives him contact with high
military, police. and security officials throughout Latin
America. ile seeps to be well versed on the status of various
arms deals (both official and under-the-table) in the
countries he travels. He has been involved with several
Cuban exile political and para-military organizations.
3. Politically, Subject is a staunch anti-Communist.
This position is probably ingrained from his family, but
also reinforced from his various political and professional
activities. He has voiced a particular hatred for Cuban
. Communists. He seems to view them not as respected enemies,
but as hated traitors. He is vehemently anti-Castro.

Subject has developed what could be interpreted
as a certain patrictis: for this country. Purist conver-
sations be referred a few times to my country" meaning
the 3.5. I believe that the fact he volunteered for 11.S.
military training reflects not only the selfish actives
of Leceiving Special Forces qualified ut also a sense of
Juty. I also believe that his recent statements to me
regarding international security matters is not merely
Temply loquacity but is evidence of his desire to contribute
something and become involved in the national interest.
5.
Subject would need sober briefings on the
responsibility of any Agency association as well as subse-
quent careful handling. ne would need to get a from
the "Flagler Street Commando syndrome" of visual and verbal
bravado, He would need instruction to discern nor from
fact, to identify sources, and to assess the ration
of acquired information.
6.
The
I am sure that the Subject is recruitable.
question is what degree of association with the Agency
would be appropriate. If the decision is made to approach
the Subject, may I suggest that his association be initially
limited to Agency briefings and debriefings before and after
his trips to Latin America. once his reliability is established
And the accuracy of his reporting is proven then further
utilization may be possible. Since his financial situation
to be secure I am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay basis.
7. Subject is scheduled to leave on a two-week business
trip to Venezuola and Colombia beginning in early August 1972.
He claimed to have appointments with a Venezucizz Air Force
Goneral and with Venezuelan national security officials in
DISIP.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.
12 June 1972
1
1.
Please be informed of a possible future contact--Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C. office, 905 L' Enfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm. Subject, born approximately 1945,
in Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.
2.
Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America. Because
of the nature of his main product (machine pistols with silencers) he
has good access to top Latin American governmental officials and
military and security officers. He has personally met many Latin
American presidents. He should be a good source of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
in mid-June.
3.
MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in the Washing-
ton, D.C. area when he returns from his Colombian trip.
4. Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
name, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigres (The Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting
to organize a 1957 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base
of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during
the last decade.
5.
I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami. Although Cuban
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti-
Communist, he joined the National Guard(while not under duress from
the draft) to become a "Green Beret.” He is polite and correct in
his social relationships. I received a letter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of his impending move to the Washington, D.C. area. He

6. If you are interested in exploring this possibility further,
please feel free to contact me at any time. I could suggest cautions
and method of contact or introduction. Subject is unwitting of my
Agency employment.

of Military Armaments Co. He will also represent Parabellum Corporation
another military weapons fim.

1. In regard to referent telephone conversation of recent
date, we asked Jeffrey G. Peterson (H/3/Venezuela) for additional
-
-
Sales, Military Armanent Corporation, Headquartered in Georgia.
2. Jeffrey Peterson is a young "career trainee" who has been
with the Agency for about six months. He met Masferrer in Miami,
Florida, where both belonged to a Florida National Guard Unit.
Peterson knows Kasferrer socially as well having met frequently
for "snacks and beer".
3. According to Peterson, based on his observations, subject
is a personable, intelligent, individual who appears trustworthy,
and of sound mind and judgment. He is a solid citizen completely
assimilated in the American mainstrean; intensely interested in the
U.S. political processes. Politically, he is of moderate conservative
persuasion. He is an estute businessman of demonstrated ability and
integrity. To highlight this point, Peterson mentioned that Masferrer
spurned lucrative cash offers for "under the table" deals to engage
in illegal veapons trade in Latin America. He refused these offers
to operate in legitimate business circles.
4.
Young Rolando takes a sociable drink; has no known bad
habits. He has a keen eye for attractive females, but no more so
than all healthy males. Peterson said he would not hesitate to
recommend subject for a position of trust and confidence.
5. Rolando Masferrer, Jr. sarved with the Green Berets, alite
U.8. Army unit whose members require special security clearances by
the military.
6. Peterson underlined his previous statement that Rolando
should not be confused with his father, Rolando Arcadio Masferrer y
Rojas, a former Cuban Senator who was leader of the notorious "Los
Tigers", the dreaded army of enforcers under Batists.

1. At 1700 hours on 14 May 1973 the Mimi Field Office received a
telephone call on the listed line from an individual whɔ ultimately
identified himself as Rolando Masferrer. It is believed that
Masferrer is identical with former Cuban senator and Batista
associate Rolando Masferrer Rojas sto is of dubious: reputation and
is well known for several nefarious actions in Haiti, Guatemala and
perhaps elsewhere. Rolando Masferrer was convicted of conspiracy
to invade Haiti in 1967. It is believed that there are extensive
Agency files on Rolando řasferrer.
2.
Masferrer was very reluctant to provide details, but finally said
he could be reached at local telephone 261-3689. A separate check
reveals this mumber to be registered to Daniel Bermudes, 6080 W.
Flagler, Apartment #17.
3. In any event the listed line caller indicated that he had been
approached by one Guillermo Iglesias and asked to engage in certain
activities which he did not further describe. According to Masferrer,
Iglesias carried credentials or other identifying material which
seemed to link him with the U.S. Coast Guard in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Masferrer said, however, that Iglesias indicated also that he was in
some way representing the Central Intelligence Agency. Masferrer then
said that the purpose of the telephone call was to check on the bons
fidas of Guillermo Iglesias.
Masferrer was told that the name Quillermo Iglesias meant nothing
to the ifiami Field Office and was otherwise given a rather non-
commital response.

6 July 1972.
:
1. On Monday, 3 July 1972, from 2100 to 2400 hours
at Clyde's Bar, Washington, D.C.; and Tuesday, 4 July 1972,
from 1500 to 1600 hours, poolside, 7623 Notera St., Apt. 201,
Falls Church, Virginia, the undersigned talked with Rolando
Masferrer, Jr.
2. I mentioned to Masferrer that my superiors (supposedly
in the State Department) were interested that some responsible
U.S. Government authority be informed of his story regarding
U.S. citizen involvement in drug trafficking and guerrilla
training in Mexico. Hasferrer said that last February he told
the story up to that date to Miami, F.B.I. Agent Bob Dyer, and
also certain information to U.S. Customs Bureau Agent Buchanan
(fnu). Masferrer said he had not informed any government
entities of events subsequent to February: I mentioned that
such information was not necessarily within the unique purview
of the State Department, but that my superiors would probably
be interested in anything further.
3. Rolando Masferrer, Jr., related to me four different
occasions when an insurgent organization, "Force Seven",
comprised of American adventurers in Mexico, was brought to
his attention.
4. The first time the Subject heard of "Force Seven"
was from Francisco BRAVO (or Brabo) [NFI], Chief of Judicial
Police, State of Merolos. Subject had not Bravo "a few years
ɛgo". They met again in Atlanta, Georgia, late December 1971,
when Bravo care for a weapons demonstration at the Military
Armament Corp, Powder Springs, Ceorgia, some 20 miles outside.
Atlanta. Bravo told Masferrer of the insurgency problem in
the Mexican states of Morelos and Guerrero. Bravo mentioned
the oxistence of "Force Seven". Bravo indicated his police

Bravo complained that the local Catholic Archbishop was

personalities who vacation in the Aerican community in
Cuernavaca. Bravo also implicated a professor that was
kidnapped in Guerrero in late 1971. Bravo believed that

were met by Bravo. They travelled by police vehicle for.
about an hour east of Acapulco to an area near La Treintas (NFI).

When they arrived, a search of the wreckage yielded a few

to the insurgents, and, whenever possible, supplied weapons.
In return, the Americans were paid in money and drugs, mostly
marijuana, but some cocaine. Masferrer said no heroin was

from the drug smuggling to finance operations. Bank robberies
had become increasingly difficult since the Army began posting

guerrilla strength at about 1,000 men. Masferrer, however,
said Bravo felt that figure to be high. The prisoner also
mentioned that some of the insurgents had previously received
guerrilla training in North Korea.
10. Masferrer said that later, upon Nazar's orders,
the American prisoner was shot and killed. The whole affair
was never reported in the local pross because, according to
Hesforror, such information, if revealed, would damage the

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.
12 June 1972
1.
Please be informed of a possible future contact--Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C. office, 905 L' Enfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm. Subject, born approximately 1945,
in Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.
2.. Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America. Because
of the nature of his main product(machine pistols with silencers) is
has good access to top Latin American governmental officials and
military and security officers. He has personally met many Latin
American presidents. He should be a good source of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
in mid-June.
3.
MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in the Washing-
ton, D.C. area when he returns from his Colombian trip.
4. Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
name, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigres (The Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting
to organize a 1967 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base
of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during .
the last decade.
5.
I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami. Although Cuban
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti-
Communist, he joined the National Guard(while not under duress from
the draft) to become a "Green Beret." He is polite and correct in
his social relationships. I received a letter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of his impending move to the Washington, D.C. area. He

please feel free to contact me at any time. I could suggest cautions

Government is having with leftist guerrillas, particularly in
two western states. He claimed the rebels were being trained
in part by U.S. alvonturers who claimed to be ex-ranger, airborne
Marine or Special Forces types, many with Vietnam experience.
The Americans were training the rehols in return for money and
marijuana and a piece of the drug smuggling action. The
Americans operated under the non de guerre "Force Seven".
This same "Force Seven" clained to have connections and affil-
iations in Guatemala. Subject claimed even to have participated
in a small firefight with the Mexican Army and the Judicial
Police against the guerrillas in an effort to prove the worth
of his particular military products.

SUBJECT: Assessment of Recruitability Rolando Masferrer, Jr.

and Associated with Defense Systems Incorporated

Drerimo
:
Subject seems to have inherited that particular
Latin American penchant for involvement in covert political
activities. However, the Subject's involvement is not moreiv
sation but it is instead intimately connected
with his chosen profession as an arms salesman. Here the
phrase "for fun and profit" seems aptly suited. He seems
to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather than a towering intellect.
C
2. Subject has excellent contacts and access in
Latin America. This access developed from his extended
family, professional appointments, andhis involvement with.
coa on groups is fastly well-known (infamous)
Throughout any sectors of Latin America and Opens many doors
for him (although it also closes others). It should also
be mentioned that his family has recently developed a rather
checkered association with this Agency. The particular
nature of his military products gives him contact with high
military, police, and security officials throughout Latin
America. He seems to be well versed on the status of various
arms deals (both official and under-the-table) in the
countries he travels. He has been involved with several
Cuban exile political and para-military organizations.
3. Politically. Subject is a staunch anti-Communist.
This position is probably ingrained from his family, but
also reinforced from his various political and professional
activities. He has voiced a particular hatred for Cuban
. Communists. He seems to view them not as respected enemies,
but as hated traitors. He is vehemently anti-Castro.

4. Subject has developed what could be interpreted
as a certain patriotism for this country. During conver-
sations he referred a few times to "my country" meaning
the U.S. I believe that the fact he volunteered for U.S.
military training reflects not only the selfish notives
of leconing Special Forces qualified but also a sense of
duty. I also believe that his recent statements to me
regarding international security matters is not merely
empty. loquacity but is evidence of his desire to contribute
something and become involved in the national interest.
5. Subject would need sober briefings on the
responsibility of any Agency association as well as subse-
quent careful handling. ile would need to get away from '
the "Flagler Street Commando syndrome" of visual and verbal
bravado. He would need instruction to discern rumor from
fact, to
and to assess the reliability
of acquired information.

The
·6. I am sure that the Subject is recruitable.
question is what degree of association with the Agency
would be appropriate. If the decision is made to approach
the Subject, may I suggest that his association be initially
limited to Agency briefings and debriefings before and after
his trips to Latin America. ence his reliability is established
and the accuracy of his reporting is proven then further
utilization may be possible. Since his financial situation
seems to be secure I am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay basis.
7. Subject is scheduled to leave on a two-week business
trip to Venezuela and Colombia beginning in early August 1972.
He claimed to have appointments with a Venezuelan Air Force
Goneral and with Venezuelan national security officials in

Richard Whooler and John Murray, Branch 1, Mexico

Their collective suggestions and instructions were:
a. Go slow on efforts to elicit information so
not to arouse suspicions of Agency involvement.
b. Find out any information regarding the Colombian
Army's E-2 battalion, U.S. citizen's involvement in drug
trafficking in Latin America (names, dates, and places), Cuban
involvement in cocaine traffic, and any ties between leftist
guerrillas and drug smuggling.
C. Write a memorandum and Subject evaluation (where
he works, where he goes, who he meets, and an assessment of
recruitability).
