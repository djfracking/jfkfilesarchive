Dame Fortune keeps popping up
in life of SFU's oldest professor
and has taken him.to Mexico, Cuba,
Moscow - and to 'best place of all'.
After the war, Dr. Halperin worked with the United Nations
for a couple of years and then joined the faculty of Boston
University where he was involved in the establishment of an
Interdisciplinary department of Latin American studies.
During this period he visited Brazil twice, lecturing at the
University of Sao Paulo and serving as a consultant to the
state government of Sao Paulo. After his second visit, he was
decorated by the Brazilian government with the Order of the
Southern Cross.
It was then that chance interfered again, this time in a most
malicious way.
"My stay at Boston coincided with the most intense period
of McCarthyism and this raised problems for a great number
of peepto at the timo. In my own cn30, I was given the choice
of co-oporating with the Inquisition or, as it turned out, losing
my job.
"Among other disagreeable aspects of co-operating. It
would have turned me into an informer against people who,
as far as I know, had committed no crime. I just couldn't think
of facing my students with their knowledge that I was an
Informer."
Leaving Boston University, he went to the National Unt-
versity of Mexico City where he remained for six years. While
working there, he did some consulting work for the Mexican
Government, thereby gaining further practical experience
on the problems of underdevelopment in Latin America.
This experience ted directly to his next position a three-
year appointment at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Halperin explains:
"At that time, the period when Kruschev was trying to
loosen up some of the rigid controls of Stalin's dictatorship.
there was a desire at the Academy to have some western
expertise on Latin American developmental problems. In
other words, my Mexican experience was a direct prerequi-:
sile for the Moscow Invitation.
"It's strange how, in retrospect, what seemed to be a
rather difficult choice in 1953 turned out to be very lucký,
You never know. Something happens that can crush you or,
on the contrary, can make you healthier and more robust
than you've ever been before.
"And, when the invitation came from Moscow, I was foot-
loose and free. My status in Me was always that of a
visiting professor, so I had no probe of security
1 of security - tenure
or pension, for example - to tie : town, when it came. I
m
had nothing to lose and everything to gain."
Dr. Halpurin spent three years at the Academy and found
It to bo en extraordinary experience. "I wasn't there as a
tourist; neither was I. there as an outside researcher. I was
actually in the machine, with no permanent ties to it. I was
working in the factory, rather than just studying it."
Foto ence again intervened in his life, this time in the form
of the celebrated Latin American guerrilla loader, Che
Guevara.
.
S
"Late one night, there was a knock on my door and I
opened it and there stood Che with a couple of his Cuban
friends. He had been told about me by mutual friends in
Mexico and they suggested that, in view of the need for
competent educators and social scientists in Cuba, i might
be interested in accepting an invitation to teach at the Uni-
versity of Havana."
-
As it happened. Dr. Halperin was interested. He spent the
next six years in Cuba, and after leaving, produced a book
on the country The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro: Ar
Essay in Contemporary History. It was published by the Uni-
versity of California Press and a second edition, in paper-
back, has recently appeared. (incidentally. Cr. Halberin's
published work spans 45 years and "several thousand
pages.")
As with the Moscow appointment, it was the fact that he
was freed of concerns about job secunty, since he had none.
which allowed him to accept Guevara's offer.
Although Cuba was "A very pleasant country," Dr. Hat
perin found life there to be somewhat disconcerting since.
"as a highly-paid foreign expert, I lived high off the hog and
didn't share the austerity of the rest of the country.
"And it was troubling, you know, when neighbors would
knock on our door to see if we could spare a thimbleful of
salt or a tablespoon of cooking oil and there we were, sitting
with everything at our disposal”
And a further quirk of fate, naturally, brought him to Simon
Fraser in 1968..He'd met a Canadian while in Havana and one
' dey, about a year later, he received a phone call “from a niace
called Burnaby." It was the same Canadian, imiting him to
participate in a seminar on Latin America, with “all expenses
paid."
When he received the invitation, in the spring of 1968, he
had already resigned his position in Havana and was planning
to return to the United States the following September.
"When the invitation came, I thought, 'Two weeks? Why not?'.
so I accepted and came up here and, like the man who came
to dinner, they couldn't get rid of.me.
"I never dreamed I would end up in Canada, Three-quarters
of a century after my father left it, but I now feel thoroughly
assimilated to the Canadian environment." In fact, he's so well
assimilated that he is now listed in the Canadian edition of
Who's Who.
During his well-travelled life, Dr. Halperin has had the oppor
tunity to teach at a number of reputable istitutens in North
America, Europe and Latin America but he says that he's
"never been in a more congenial place than Simon FraseY,
never in my life.
"It's the best place, all in all, that I've ever ball. Studenis
and faculty have it very good here and I'm not taking only

1. FHABOVE reports that on 13 January 1976 it again spoke to Subject
who, although remains approachable, declined to elaborate on previous
comments concerning the 1940's. Concerning himself, Subject said that
he and his wife toured Israel, Italy, Greece, Spain and England in the
summer of 1975. Work on the second volume of his book on Cuba has
fallen behind. HALPERIN left the impression that once the Cuba book is
out of the way, he will commence his autobiography. He also expects.
that Simon Fraser University will extend his teaching appointment to
August 1977.

THE NEW REPUBLIC
10 MARCH 1973
Independence Entangled
The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro
by Maurice Halperin
{University of Califórnia Press; $12.95)
At the end of a passage describing the
euphoric carly days of the Cubon Reys
olution, Maurice Halperin laments:
"Alas, it was shined to change.” In
effect, this attitude symbolizes his re-
ation and sessment of Castro and
Cuba, in this tirst volume of a two-part
study of the revolution from the fust
days of Fidiclismo to the present. A note
of frustration which occasionally marks

Halperin), thus has been a characteristic

"
:
foreign poker of the revolution (the
only patries in the book show Castry
đùing his 1*Stop to the Soviet Union).
If it is accuște to say that the revolu-
tion was pushed leftward and finally
into an alliance with the Soviet Union
by the inept and hostile pohey of the
United States, then it is also true that
Cuba's tate has continued to depend
upon the international struggle between *
the US and the Soviet Union. While
Castro may have been committed to
Cuban nationalism and social reform at
home, he could, ironically, only achieve
these goals by means of an aggressive
foreign policy.
Castro remains a vague and blustery
figure while Che Guevara figures hardly
at all. By placing his emphašis_else-
where. Haigoin' tells the story of the
revolution through the events, whicụ
touched it from the outside, particularly
those which effected its ties to the Com-
múnist woțid. Most important were the
Sino-Soviet struggle, the world price
of sugar, the internal buivaucratic
struggle of the USSR, the changing
American presidency, the role of the
Cubon Comminist Party, the CIA, and
so on. Cathering his facts, primarity
from magazine and newspaper artides.
plus 'his oņa first-hand knowledge of
events, he pieces together a fascinating
reading of Castro's speeches, policy
changes and their context. The shitting
and rather indecisive attitude of the
revolutionary leadership toward artistic
and intellectual liberty, for example, has
stemmed from Castro's need to balance
conflicting demands: for orthodoxy by
Cubsan and Russion Communists, and
for greates Reedoms by Western
intellectuels
Castro's driemama haszalways been to
assert Cuban wndependence, and yet
retain alignnwent with the USSR. Per-
haps this contradictory policy was
doomed, if the no other reason than
Culsa's / envirous f dependence, upon
other natiers to absorb her puslints
and provide her with energy. In any.
case, when Castro opted to exploit the
Cold War and let Ihrushchev loot the
bill, he created the crisis which Halperin
pinpoints. He made the economie kue-
ress of the revolution at home an
absolute necessity, yet a necessity that
could only be met with outside help.
Castro's own impatience; inefficiency
“and indecision made, matters worse.
From the carly attempts to industrialize
to the abrupt and devastating decision
to produce a mammoth sugar crop in
1970, the Cuban economy, the author
argues, has continually sunk to lower
levels. The result is Castro's dependence.
upon the Soviet Union, an admission
of failure.
Halpețin's emphasis on foreign affairs
„makes good sense, but leaves little room
for discussion of the internal dynamics
of the revolution and of the impact of
social reforms on the population. It
makes what Castro said and did; and
the revolution itself, explicable only in
a sort of code of international affairs.
However, given the volatile nature of
Cuban politics and the Cold War, it
still seems too early to write off the
revolution.

The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro
Maurice Halperin
The author of this unusual book was twice
forced out of teaching positions at American
universities because of his political beliefs. He
spent three years on the faculty of the USSR
Academy of Sciences and five years, from
1962 to 1968, at the University of Havana.
He went to Cuba in 1962 on the invitation of
Che Guevara, who had visited him in Mos-
cow, and there gathered the materials for this.
intimate portrait of the Castro regime.
Mr. Halperin concentrates his attention on
Castro's foreign policy, placing it in the con-
text of domestic policy and conditions. Ob-
viously skilled in reading the new socialist
rhetoric, Professor Halperin guides the reader
through the maze of documents, speeches,
and propaganda which constitute the record
of the Castro regime during the sensational
events involving Kennedy, Khrushchev, mis-
siles, and the CIA. Although the main narra-
tive is concerned with the years 1959-1964-
primarily the period of the rise of Fidel Castro
-it contains digressions into events of the
following years when, according to the auth-
or, Castro's great utopian dreams turned into
nightmares. A second volume, carrying the
story down to the present, is in preparation.
Maurice Halperin is Professor of Political
Science at Simon Fraser University, Van-
couver, B.C.
"A brilliant contribution to the literature
on contemporary Cuba and perhaps even
more a remarkable series of insights into the
new politics of mass society.".

1. It is requested that you take up the case of HALPERIN with
KKCOWBELL. Attached for your information and background is some
biographic data and information concerning his activities on behalf of
Soviet Intelligence.
2. We would like you to explore with KKCOWBELL the possibi-
lity of sending one of his officers here to debrief HALPERIN along the
Unes of the Milton SCHWARTZ case. The fact that he has been unwilling
to tell us anything and is yet now anti-Soviet indicates that a KKCOLLIER
officer might have much better entree. Give KKCOWBELL as much of
the attached information as he seems to need to make a decision.
3. Subject is probably still in British Columbia at the university
mentioned, but in any case the KKCOLLIERS should be able to locate him
precisely through Subject's son and/or daughter at the addresses given.
It is known that he is quite close to his children.
4. In any event, we are interested in any comments or traces
KKCONCOCTER may have concerning him.

"Therefore, in consultation with our legal branch, we have
drawn up the attached draft "Solemn Declaration" which we feel
satisfies the conditions set out by the Board and which we propose
to use in the case of Maurice Hyman HALPERIN. As you will note, we have
provided information which in the opinion of our legal branch will be
the minimum requirement if our declaratien is to be found valid.
"
5. "Wo would therefore request that you ascertain if consider-
ation can be given to have your Agency authorize us to include the
information contained in lines nine, ten and eleven of the attached
draft "Solemn Declaration". The decision of your Agency should be
made with the understandings that the declaration would be available
to HALPERIN and his counsel at both the Immigration Spocial Inquiry
and the Immigration Appoal Board Hearing.
6. "Our caso against HALPERIN rests on whether or not we
receive approval for the use of the information furnished by your
Agency, since we have to show that HALPERIN was ineligible for
admission at the time he entered Canada. We appreciate the problems
inherent in a request of this nature and if after weighing all the
considerations your Agency finds it impossible to authorize release,
we intend to advise the Department of Manpower and Immigration that
we are unable to issue the required "Solemn Declaration" and will
study, other ways and means of overcoming our problems in cases of
this nature.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
"American Defectors to the USSR"
1. The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR.", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components
until ca. 1963. The compilations were derived from a variety
of sources, and contain both classified and overt data.
L
2. In the fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
Staff. In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program. In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum,
.
3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have already been made through the US Defector
Machine Program.

November-ecember 1960. Halperin, "an identified Soviet agent who left
the US 1900
and is now in the Soviet Union," was to be head of one of.
the two new organizations founded during a Moscow conference of communist
leaders: office for permanent studies and cooperation with Latin American
mrties" to be organised by the Communist Parties of Argentina, Brazil, and
Cuba, and to be located in Feiping. This presumably never happened.) (SRS,
TDCS-3/452,130, 13 January 1961, info Nov-Dec 60, from an official Swedish

July 1962. Their passports would have expired, requiring issuance of
new ones. (Only passports actually issued not renewed.- after September
1959 had the new three-year validity instead of the old two-year validity,
according to Central Processing.) We have no record of issue of new ones,

keeping his US citizenship after moving to Cuba.

factory and world start teaching at Havandiniversity on 3 October. (SRS; copy

but it soon wore off and the Cubans considered him cold and pedantic. (SRS,
DEA-62084, 13 January 1964)
21 January 1963. Elizabeth Mora (long-time communist) returned to "exico
from a women's congress in Havana, where she had seen the Halperins. They
had a mansion and servants because of his "important job," but he had aged.
greatly, looked old, had to do without such amenities as underwear and socks,
was rationed to one tube of toothpaste every six months, etc. Wife said it
was Soviet treatment that had broken him, not Cuban. They intended to stay
in Cuba because of the friendlier climate and his feelin: more useful there.
She wanted to become a Cuban citizen so that she could visit her son and his
family in sexico, but he planned to keep his US citizenship. (SHS, DRA-34390,

Maurice Hyman Halperin
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
1. Attached is a copy of DBA 34398, dated 26 February
1963, concerning Maurice Halperin and his activity in Cuba.
2. The Station's attention is drawn to page two which
states that Subject's wife hopes to obtain Cuban citizenship
so that she can come to Mexico to see her son and grandchildren.
On the same page, there is an interesting, yet vague, reference
to his treatment in the USSR.
3. Headquarters is still most interested in Subject,
and the Station should be alert to any information it can gather
on HALPERIN, or on his wife's travel to Mexico, which might
be used for KUDESK or KUWOLF purposes.

appeared at the embassy to re-
new their passports.

he was working for the Sovieti
Academy of Sciences "doing!
research in the foreign field
especially relating to under-
developed countries."
The State Department, re-
calling that Dr. Halperin was
an authority on Latin-American

working at the present time."

have repeatedly called attention
to the Soviet trade and cultural
offensive in Latin America,
Referring to Dr.: Haleprin's,
employment by the Soviet
Academy, the State Depart-
ment observed that it was di-
rectly subordinate to the Soviet!
