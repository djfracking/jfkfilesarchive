RECENTLY CONCLUDED HOS REVIEW OF ZEPRIMA PROGRAM SHOWS
THAT KUDARE EFFORTS HAVE NOT ACHIEVED ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND
CONTINUATION OF PROGRAM AS SUCH NO LONGER WARRANTED. MAIN REASON
2
FOR KUBARK FAILURE IS THAT CUBAN TECHNICIAN RECRUITING PROGRAM
FIDEL'S
HAS BEEN MISERABLE FAILURE WHEY MEASURED AGAIN/ORIGINAL
OBJECTIVE OF 2000 TECHS FROM WESTERN EUROPE ALONE. THOUGH OUR
FIGURES NOT COMPLETE, WE ESTIMATE PROBABLY LESS THAN FIFTY
CANDIDATES HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT APPROVAL AND WE ABLE CONFIRM
ABOUT TEN WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MADE IT TO THE ISLAND.
SUCCESLED IN INSERTING ABOUT THIRTY RECRUITED TECHS INTO THE
VARIOUS MIRING CHANNELS, BUT SO FAR ONLY TWO HAVE RECEIVED CONTRACT
APPROVAL FROM HAVA.

KUBARK
2. CUBAN FAILURE TO RECRUIT IN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS APPEARS
DUE LARGELY TO RELUCTANCE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICERS PURSUE TECH RECRUITING MIŠŠION AGGRESSIVELY, BUREAUCRATIC
INCOMPETENCE IN HAVANA, FEAR OF INFILTRATION OF HOSTILE AGENTS

IN THIS CONNECTION WE NOTE THAT KOST PERUMEN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE

RESPONSE OF KOST STATIONS IN IMPLEMENTING (ZEPRIMA HAS
BEEN MOST GRATIFYING. WE PROVIDED CUBANS WITH GOOD NUMBER HIGHLY
QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS WHICH THEY FOR REASONS CITED
UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ACCEPT.

KUBAEK HAS MADE A RESPECTABLE
EFFORT TO EXPLOIT THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT
ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IS HARELY REFLECTION CUBAN CONFUSION
AND INEPTITUDE WITH RESULTANT FAILURE ACHIEVE THEIR OWN GOALS.

3. IN FACE OF FOREGOING WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WORTHWHILE
TO CONTINUE INTENSIVE SEARCH FOR (ZRPRIMA CANDIDATES FOR INSERTION
´INTO CUBAN HIRING CHANNEL. /STATIONS WITH ACTIVE LEADS SHOULD STAY
WITH THEM IN THE HOPE THEY MAY STILL BE HIRED, BUT CEASE EFFORTS
TO GENERATE LEADS FROM SCRATCH. ON OTHER HAND, THERE ARE FAIR
NUMBER NON BLOC TECHS IN CUBA AND IT LIKELY CUBANS WILL CONTINUE
TO BINE NESLES DICIT ON LIMITED SELECTIVE BASIS AS THEY DID PRIOR
Uz 1
TO INPAINA PROGRAM. STATIONS THEREFORE ARE URGED TO CONTIN
AUT
ALERT FOR SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND TO EXPLOIT THEM IN SAME HANNER
DE ALL OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE RESIKENT AGENTS IN CUBA.
