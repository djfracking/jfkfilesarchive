curiosity that LIPSTICK-14 and LIJERSEYS-2 and 12 may have. This
procedure is believed desirable due to the confining nature of the
photographic tasks and the lack of additional personnel to assist
at each of the bases. Also, this staggered schedule of coverage
should reduce some of the duplication presently coming in from
the two bases,

(2)
LIPSTICK-39, his wife and three small children
live at the LICALLA Base. He is an accountant for a local
bus line and works at his cover job in the evenings. LIPSTICK-39
does an excellent and conscientious job of photographic coverage
at the LICALLA Base. In addition to the photos he takes, he
writes a narrative description of the events which take place
in the target's garden area. He receives a monthly salary of
$2,000.00 (MN) and free rent at the LICALLA Base,
(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-39 twice
weekly, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They have four
contact points, one of which is selected at each meeting for
use for the next meeting. In the event that contact is not
established, GERENDE has the initiative in contacting LIPSTICK-39
by phoning him at the bus line office during the evenings. Then, by
prearranged open code, a meeting site and time are agreed on.
Since Oliver G. SCANTLING is also acquainted with LIPSTICK-39,
it would be possible to contact him through SCANTLING should
something happen to GERENDE. However, to facilitate proper
and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been
directed to establish a reserve system of communications with
Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonafides.
(4) Security- The most serious security problem concerning
LICALLA is the fact that LIPSTICK-39 is the brother of
LIPSTICK-47 (the first agent arrested by the local police agency
during the recent LIPSTICKflap). Although it is generally
believed by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39's name was not
mentioned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any indication was given
concerning LIPSTICK-39's job, it must be understood that
should the local police agency decide later to interrogate
LIPSTICK-47, the probability exists of compromising LIPSTICK-39
and LICALLA. The Station sees no way to overcome this
possibility.

LIJERSEY-2 is the LILYRIC Base operator. He is a Captain in
the Mexican Army Reserve and is also employed by Colgate-
Palmolive Peet Company as an industrial engineer. He receives
a monthly salary of $1,000,00 (MN) and he and his wife live rem
and willies free in the LILYRIC Base,
LIJERSEY-12 is the wife of LIJERSEY-2. She does most of the
photographic and reporting work at the LILYRIC Base and has
proven herself to be a capable and worthwhile asset. It has
been necessary for her to become proficient in the LILYRIC work
since her husband works at his regular job during the day. She
receives a monthly salary of $800,00 (MN),

AT
Communications GERENDE contacts LIJERSEY-5 twice
weekly at prearranged contact points during the late afternoon
hours. LIJERSEY-5 contacts LIJERSEY-2 two to three times
weekly at prearranged car contact points and receives the "take"
from the LILYRIC Base. On occasion GERENDE has contacted
LIJERSEY-2 directly, but this procedure is used only when LIJERSEY-5
is out of town or otherwise not available. GERENDE does not
know LIJERSEY-12 or vice versa. No reserve system of com-
munications exists whereby a Station officer could contact
LIJERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE has
been instructed to set up such a system of communications. The
same will be done with LIJERSEY-5, although he is known to
several Station officers and little difficulty would be expertenced
in contacting him directly.

Security
-
The security of the LILYRIC Base appears,
at least on paper, to be in better shape than the Limited or
LICALLA Bases. Insofar as the Case Officer has been able
to determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC
Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, 5 and 12, and LIPSTICKS
38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connection
with the operation of the Base. The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base
has with the LIPSTICK operations is through GERENDE.
(5)
Recommendations - GERENDE has been instructed
to change his meeting plans with LIJERSEY-5 and to review
the communications set-up between LIJERSEY-5 and LIJERSEY-2
(L-5 and L-2 are long-time friends and, consequently, the
cover problem is minimized). A staggered schedule of
coverage of the LIMERICK target between LILYRIC and LIMITED
was initiated on 18 August 1958. Although the operators of
these two bases are unaware of the existence of the other,
a suitable cover story has been worked out to satisfy any

boat" at this stage of the game and suggests that we maintain
LICALLA at its present location and with its present operator,
LIPSTICK-39. One alternative appears to be about cs good as another
in this case, and it is an acknowledged fact that LICALLA, at its
present location, is a worthwhile and productive asset. Head-
quarters ideas and comments on the LICALLA Base would be
&ppreciated.
At the present time it is planned to move LIPSTICK-39 and family
to a furnished apartment when the time comes to remodel the
LICALLA Base. After completion of the remodeling, LIPSTICK-39
and family will return to the present LICALLA Base,
PHOTO TRUCK

Target Investigative asset used for taking curreptitious
photographs of persona, places and things that are from time to
tume of interest to the Station and Headquarters,
(2)
Personnel - LIPSTICK-2, as indicated by the low numerical
designation of his cryptonym, has been employed by KUBARK for
several years. At the present time LIPSTICK-2 is responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the photographic surveillance
truck. He is also used occasionally to spot and rent operational
apartments. In the past, LIPSTICK-2 has served as team leader
of a low level surveillance team (which was compromised and
subsequently disbanded), as a LIFEAT line inspector (when he
was not busy with the photo truck), and as a statt surveillance
man (L. e., used as an outside sentry during the March 1958
entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB
technicians. (NOTE: LIPSTICK-2 was assigned the task of
watching the entire area during the day for any unusual activity
on the part of target personnel. He was not told that he was to
watch a specific house. He was dismissed from his static sur•
veillance before dusk and the Headquarters technicians did not
enter LIMUST until after 2030 hours.) LIPSTICK-2 is the brother
of LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) and LIPSTICK-34 (LIPSTICK
Surveillance team member) is LIPSTICK-2's wife's nephew.
LIPSTICK-2's cover is buying and selling cars; however, about
the only bustness he has in this connection is when he buys and
Bells cars for KUBARK. His cover is quite weak. He receives
a monthly salary of $3, 200,00 (MN) plus $600,00 (MN) per month
for the use of his personal car.

SECRET
It is important to note here that LICALLA occupies one of the four
LIMUST properties. While it is believed that LIPSTICK-39 does
not know that KUBARK owns the Base or has anything to do with
the other three houses, it is entirely conceivable that should one
of the local police agencies or the LIMERICK personnel become
aware of LICALLA activities, they could very easily arrive at
some logical conclusions about all of the LIMUST property. This
would be detrimental, if not fatal, to our aims. However,
another Station viewpoint on this same problem is that if compromised,
LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than to, LIMUST.
Should one of the local police agencies begin an investigation which
might involve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be™
sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base. These possibilities
become somewhat theoretical and perhaps impractical due
to the lack of predictibility of the local police agencies, but neverthe
less must be weighed one against the other.
In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST
operation a lot of thought and discussion have transpired at the
Station about continuing the LICALLA operation in us present
location or suspending it for the immediate future and attempting
to find another suitable location away from the LIMUST property.
A sound argument can be made for terminating the base since such
an alternative might have the effect of limiting any knowledge
LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST installation.
However, the termination of a productive base such as LICALLA
would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help but
leave him a bit suspicious. For Headquarters information, the
local rental laws are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to
comprehend why we did not insist on him maintaining "squatters
rights" (as stated previously, LIPSTICK-39 apparently does not
know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest in any of the
other LIMUST properties) which can easily be done in Mexico.
Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more
of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permitting
LICALLA to operate as it is now. Another possibility would be
terminating LIPSTICK-39 and putting another agent in the present
LICALLA Base. If this measure were followed, it would not
eliminate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even if terminated, would
still know of the existance of the present LICALLA Base. Still
another possibility would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the
LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST
properties are ostensibly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspicions
and investigations could still lead to LIMUST.

Recommendations

The Station is inclined not to "rock the
SECRET

SECRET
LIPSTICK-24 does not know GERENDE and, presumably, knows
only LIPSTICK-2, with whom he works on the photo truck. His
cover is as a salesman of electrical appliances; however, he
does not pursue his cover job to the desirable extent. LIPSTICK-24
was recruited by LIPSTICK-2 about one year ago and is currently
receiving a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month. Since he has
now worked a year for the Station, and performed satisfactorily,
his salary should be raised to $1,200.00 (MN) per month (LIEMPTY
will provide for this increase).
(3) Communications - GERENDE meets LIPSTICK-2 two to three
times a week. These meetings are arranged by phone and take
place at previously selected contact points which can be referred
to in telephonic conversations by Innocent sounding code names.
LIPSTICK-2 also knows GERENDE's true name, where he lives, and
his phone number. In the past he has had occasion to telephone
CERENDE at the latter's home. LIPSTICK-2 knows DINGLEY, and
could, in an emergency situation, contact DINGLEY. However,
GERENDE has been instructed to arrange a complete communica-
tions plan with LIPSTICK-2, including a reserve means of contact.
For security reasons, GERENDE has been instructed to inform
LIPSTICK-2 that his only contact is with CERENDE and that in
the future he is not to contact anyone else in the organization
without GERENDE's permission. Also, that should contact with
GERENDE be disrupted, he is to await for the higher echelon to
establish contact with him (all agents under GERENDE are being
go instructed). This is particularly important in the case of
tpstick-2, since he has by-passed GERENDE in two or three
Instances in the past.
(4) Security - Probably the most serious security situation
involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 and Lipstick-24 is the
basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK surveillance team that such an
asset exists, even to the point that one of the team members
(LIPSTICK-34) is the listed owner of the photo truck. The personal
knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operation also represents
a security hazard of the first class. For example, if LIPSTICK-2
were compromised and arrested as a result of his activities,
there is a possibility that he could compromise his brother,
LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE
and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation.
(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former
LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have
been reminded on several occasions during the past few years
that they were not to discuss any aspect of their operations with
each other. Also, LIPSTICK-2, to the best of the Station's

knowledge, does not know the location of any of the LIFEAT
Base houses).
A new truck should be purchased as soon as possible to replace
the present truck. The new truck should be purchased in an
assumed name and vehicle papers should list an untraceable
address. LIPSTICK-2 has already been informed that he is to
have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other operational
personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,
with whom he works, and GERENDE, who supervises his
activities. In addition to the above, the Station should begin
thinking about a replacement agent for LIPSTICK-2 and every
effort should be made to set up an independent and compartmented
photo truck operation. This would permit the eventual termination
of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to
reduce his knowledge of current operations.
LIJERSEY
(1)
Target - Foot surveillance and investigative support of
other Station operations,
-
(2) Personnel. LIJERSEY-4 tu of a low social class and
lives with his mother in a slum area of Mexico City. He ta
the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers
and sisters. He is described by GERENDE as having a lot of
ambition and a strong desire to improve his standard of living
and position in life. The Station has found him to be a good
observer and, consequently, adequate for static surveillance
work. Although he now has his drivers license, he is not a
capable driver and probably will never develop into one.
GERENDE has been encouraging LIJERSEY-4 to obtain employment
as a salesman to supplement his KUBARK income of $1,000,00
(MN) and to establish himself in a cover job. However, LIJERSEY-4
has not yet obtained such employment. It is the Station's
opinion that LIJERSEY-4 is definitely an asset of limited value
and will never develop into the high-calibre surveillance asset
which the Station really needs.
LIJERSEY-8's situation is about the same as LIJERSEY-4's.
He lives with his family and is currently taking highschool
courses (LIJERSEY-4 is doing the same). He is not an imaginative
talker and has difficulty making up cover stories and spur-of-the-
moment excuses and explanations - the vital qualifications for a
good surveillance man. He is the best driver of the three LIJERSEY

MISCELLANEOUS
Also on the payroll as worthwhile assets are GERENDE's brother-in-
law, LIPSTICK-38, and his sister, LIPSTICK-40. GERENDE and LIPSTICK-
38 process and print all the LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and truck
photos. LIPSTICK-40 does non-sensitive translation work for the Station.
Both LIPSTICKS-38 and 40 are handled by GERENDE. They do not have
contact with other agents or with station officers. LIPSTICK-38 receives
a monthly salary of $1,000,00 (MN). LIPSTICK-40 receives the equivalent
or $1,75 U. S. in pesos per hour for her work.
Although it is not adviseable from the security point of view to have any
Indigenous agent aware of all three of our LIMERICK photographic bases and
the photo truck, the load on the Station photographer several months ago
resulted in just such a solution to the problem. Previously, GERENDE and
LIPSTICK-38 had processed only the photographs from LIMITED, LILYRIC and
the truck.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations have been included in several sections of this paper,
These same recommendations, excepting those which have already been carried out
or are in the process of implementation, are listed below in a composite form
to facilitate the readers' overall comprehension.
a.
Continue the reorganization of communication arrangements
with all agents.
b.
Relieve GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties (B GMORNING and Qubau
Exiles taps) as soon as possible.
C.
Continue to use GERENDE for the time being as the principal
agent in charge of LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA, the Photo Truck,
LIJERSEY, LIMITATIONS-5 and 6, and LIPSTICKS 38 and 40.
d.
Arrange a warning system of communications for removing
GERENDE to PBPRIME should he be compromised to one of the local
police agencies.
e.
Purchase a new photo truck for use by LIPSTICKS 2 and 24.
£.
Begin planning for a compartmented photo truck operation
which will later permit termination of LIPSTICK-2.
8
Spot and recruit at least three indigenous agents from the
middle class social level to form the nucleus of a new LIJERSEY

SECRET
For this reason, it is not advisable to have GERENDE
connected with a surveillance team and also contacting and
directing the sensitive photo base houses. Therefore, until such
time as a suitable asset can be developed or acquired to take over
the LIJERSEY team, their actual surveillance assignments will
be kept at the mtaimum.
(5) Recommendations
-
It is suggested that the LIJERSEY
framework be used for the recruitment of at least three competent
and higher class local nationals for use ca surveillance assign-
ments. After the recruitment of such individuals, it may be
suggested that LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 be terminated. LIJERSEY-13 should
remain as an independent investigative asset to conduct "credit"
and other type of inquiries which he can do without help from
other agents. LIJERSEY-5 has already been asked to spot
prospective candidates of a higher social standing for use on a
new surveillance team; however, even under optimum conditions,
one and a half years will be required to get such a team functioning.
In order to recruit the type of team member that will be most
worthwhile to the Station, we must plan to pay a minimum starting
salary of $1,600,00 (MN) per month. The cost of living in
Mexico is continually on the rise and where $1,000.00 (MN)
was a good salary one to two years ago, it really is not adequate today.
LIFEAT
(1)
Target - Conversations coming from two telephone taps,
BGMORNING and Cuban extles.
(2) Personnel
->>>
GERENDE lives in the apartment where these
two lines are maintained. He personally processes the take
from the lines and passes it to OUSLER for Station dissemination
to Robert B. RIGGS (BGMORNING) and Calude K. Shyrock (Cubans)."
GERENDE, in accordance with LIFEAT procedures, is supposed to
remain in this apartment seven days a week. However, this is
impossible due to his other operational assignments and activities.
(3)
Communications - GERENDE meets daily with OUSLER
to pass the LIFEAT "take" and to discuss other operational
matters.
(4) Security - It is not a good security practice to have a
LIFEAT montor working on anything except LIFEAT. Other
duties, which GERENDE certainly has, limit one's capability
for matmaining the required security alermess for telephone

repairmen and others who might accidentally discover one of
our LIFEAT taps. Also, should GERENDE be compromised
through any of his other operations, it la concetvable that the
EGMORNING and Cuban Exiles LIPEAT taps would be discovered
by one of the local police agencies.
(5)
Recommendations - It is suggested that a replacement
be found as soon as possible to relieve GERENDE of his present
LIFEAT duries.
LICOOL-7
(})
Target - A planned technical installation against a person
of interest to the Station and to Headquarters,
(2)
Personnel - LIMITATION-5 and his wife, LIMITATION-6,
are the LICU-7 Base House operators. LIMITATION-5 has
been with KUBARK for several years. He was at one time the
LIAXIOM Base House operator. He presently works for the
DuPont Company. He dreases well, speaks some English
and could be described as belonging to the rising middle class of
Mexicans. His wife can do photographic work and has had previous
experience with KUBARK in the dispatching of car surveillances
by radio, LECTATIONS-5 and 6 are not participating in any
active work pending the Installation of LICOOL-7 in their apartment.
LIMITATION-5 receives a monthly salary of $300.00 (MN) and
LIMITATION-6 receives $400.00 (MN) monthly.
(3)
Communications. A complete communications plan does
not exist between CERENDE and LIMITATION-5. At the present
time it is only necessary for GERENDE to see LIMITATION-5
on pay day and when Harvey C. MULFORD desires to visit the
apartment for technical surveys and other work. Therefore,
GERENDE and LIMITATION-5 utilize an open code telephonic
means of getting together. So far, this has worked quite well, but
It will be necessary later to set up a more sophisticated
commmications system.
(4)
Security - The operational aspects of LICOOL-7 are under
the jurisdiction of Matthew S. DINGLEY; therefore, the author
of this report is not familiar with the security ramifications, if
any, surrounding this technical installation and the agents operating it.

Recommendations - None.

team members and with more practice will probably develop
into a capable and dependable driver. LIJERSEY-8 has
recently shown a commendable amount of initiative where his
awer situation is concerned. He has obtained a job as a
commiscion salesman for UNDERWOOD typewriters and,
according to GERENDE, is making a substantial amount of "pin"
money. However, as in the case of LIJERSEY-4, LIJERSEY-8
is at best an asset of only limited value. LIJERSEY-8 also
receives a salary of $1,000.00 (MN) per month.
LIJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 and vice versa,
LIJERSEY-13 is better dressed than the other two team members
and can pass as a better educated and more socially flexible
Individual. He speaks fairly good English. He performs pretext
investigation assignments with facility and imagination and is
adept at making up cover stories. In brief, he makes a good
impression on the people he interviews, He is not a good
driver and is too nervous to develop into one. His salary is
$1,000.00 (MIN) per month.
(3)
Communications
-
GERENDE has daily contact arrange-
ments with the three LIJERSEYS. Prearranged meeting places
are used on designated days of each week and the LIJERSEYS are
instructed to go to each meeting. They have standing instructions
to continue going to their meeting sites for two weeks; if they
have not been contacted during that period of time, they can
discontinue their communications plan and await contact by
GERENDE or another appropriately selected agent at their
respective homes. None of the LIJERSEYS have home telephones;
hence, it is impossible to arrange any type of communications
using this means. GERENDE is currently in the process of
setting up new and more complete communications arrangements
with the three LIJERSEYS.
(4)
Security - Insofar as knowledge of other operations,
personnel and assets is concerned, the LIJERSEYS appear to have
the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE.
New communications plans with the LIJERSEYS w ill do much
toward increasing security and ability to meet contingencies.
GERENDE will be instructed to give refresher training to all
three LIJERSEYS in operational security, cover and communications.
The major danger existing with the LIJERSEY team, and with any
survelliance team, is the possibility of compromise and arrest
by one of the local police agencies. Should this happen, GERENDE
and his other operations would be placed in considerable danger,

surveillance team.
h.
Eventually separate GERENDE from either LIJERSEY surveillance
team duties or the three photographic base houses, preferably the former.
The two types of activities are not compatible with each other and should
not be handled by the same principal agent.
1.
Implied, but not specifically stated elsewhere in this paper,
is the suggestion that GERENDE be given a "cooling off" and training
period of two to three months in PUPRIME. Of course, this will not
be possible until other assets are developed to take over GERENDE's
present duties. After his return from PBPRIME, GERENDE could be
used to develop new support assets which would be completely compartmented
from all of his previous operations, personnel and activities.
CONCLUSIONS
It would take several weeks of uninterrupted study of files to write a
really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities,
However, besed on the facts contained in this paper, it is the Station's opinion
that GERENDE probably is not now known to the local police agencies as a
KUBARK or FBPRIME agent. It is believed that GERENDE could be identified
by the local police agencies at any time they choose to interrogate LIPSTICKS-12
and 30 in detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or currently
associated with GERENDE is compromised. Furthermore, if GERENDE ta
arrested, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plus the
BGMORNING and Cuban Exiles portions of LIFEAT.
Given several months time, the slow process of compartmentation
can be introduced into GERENDE's operations. Such compartmentation, however,
will never reach the truly desirable point, but some improvement over the
existing situation can be made. If GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed
from the current incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable
long-range support asset.

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/III/Mexico
SUBJECT:
REFERENCE:
Paymond H. GERENDE
HMM-A-11368
6 November 1958
i
1.
This dispatch represents the type of operational reporting
we nood. I think any answer to the Station should lead off with an
expression of appreciation for a good job. Maybe it will encourage
than to write more of this type.
EKA2011 GERENDE is very exposed, and should be taken off some of his
Jobs at once. Specifically, my ideas are as follows:
3. Re para. 3 a, agent is very capable and should be retained
if secure means can be found. Getting rid of him would not solve the
problem. As long as he is in Mexico he is vulnerable. Some thought
should be given to how he would be supported in the event of arrest.
Personally, I believe the Station would do better to sacrifice a case
officer than permit things to drag on to the point where GERENDE might
tell all to the police.
Recommendations:
a. GERENDE be briefed so as to be ever ready with an innocuous
story to tell the police in the event of arrest.
b. GERENDE be told to contact one of already blown Station
officers like HAZLETT in the event of arrest and that the Station
officer be ready to appear personally at police station to free
GERENDE. If the case officer named for this city and GERÄNDE
both know the innocuous cover story, there should be little problem.
I have done it myself. A good cover story is "looking for draft
dodgers" or some such tale which does not have implications of
working against Mexican citizens.
That if not allowed to communicate directly GERENDE should
tell the senior officer present at police station that he works
on (cover story) for HAZLETT and insists HALLETT be sent for.
d. That a second blown case officer's name be given as an
alternate for HAZLETT, who is often out of town and unavailable.

That GERENDE be taken off LIFEAT at once and all
suspicious audio equipment be removed from his home or offices.
At present, LIFEAT is the only illegal activity being engaged
in by GERENDE; if he is made merely in connection with his
physical surveillance activities he is not likely to be hurt
by the Mexicans.
1. Concur preparations should be made to hide out GERENDE
if it is known he is to be arrested.
4. Re para. 4 a, GERENDE's participation in LIMITED is 0. K.
I believe no law is being broken. However, LIMITED is probably blown
to the Soviets. Here
Heœis the more real danger. Station should find out
who is the registered owner of the phone at LIMITED. Prior to leaving
Mexico I noted to MAHONEY it was still held in the name of LIMESTONE-3
(now fired and hence a possible threat).
5. Re para. 4 b: This is the same situation as LIMITED but not
so likely blown to the Soviets. There is no reason why GERENDE should
not continue this work.
6. Re para. 4 c, LICALLA is a very special problem and should
be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIMESA/LIMUST.
I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out when LIMESA began to shape up.
I consider it a danger to LIMESA. Has LICALLA produced anything of
value? I think, we could vacate this in such a way that the agents in
LICALIA would have no cause to be suspicious. (Put an obvious tail on
the agent, scare him off, etc. This would throw off the Mexican police,
too, in the event they are already wise to LICALLA through LIPSTICK 47.
We could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail and the game is up.)
Recommendation: Get rid of LICALIA unless very productive. Better
do this before the remodeling begins.
7. Re para 4 d, photo truck. LIPSTICK-2 does know of the locations
of some of the basehouses on LIFEAT since he was a line inspector.
Recommendations:
a.
New compartmented truck should be set up. Don't use false
names and addresses. It could result in great harm.
b. LIPSTICK-2 be sent off to some small town as "resident
agent" for general work and to get him out of the area.

8. Re para. l. e. I have no particular thoughts on LIJERSEY but
think it consistent for GERENDE to handle it,
9. Re para. 4 f: GERENDE should be taken off LIVEAT at once,
even if it means losing lines. As of March this year the Station
had enough agant personnel to handle bases for 24 lines. They should
be able to fill the gap even though LIMESTONE-3 and his tribe ware
fired. Only 12 lines are now being handled (latest report). The way
CERENDE is handling his LIFEAT work seems to be breaking all the rules
wo set up inseven years of experience.
10. Re para. 4 g, LICOOL-7. I see no harm in GERENDE's harviling
the operational aspect of this case. But through LIMITATIONS the
police could get back to LIMITATION and the main LIMERICK tap, that is,
if they were able to make GERENDE talk before we could-save-hing & The
danger to LIMITATION was not brought out in the Station's survey.
11.
In re para. 5, recommendations
a. Approve.
b. Get him off LIFEAT right now.
c. Concur, but liquidate LICALLA.
L
d.
•
$
This needs some discussion. What do we do with GERENDE
in the U. S.?
e. Concur.
f. Concur with reservation noted abɔve.
g. O. K.
h. I don't see why he can't handle all these jobs since
they are physical surveillances.
1. Not a bad idea.
12. Final observations:
a. What is GERENƉEls cover?
b. We must be sure he is not overworked. Sloppy work has
resulted from people being overworked.

:
DATE: 12 September 1357
SUBJECT:
Evaluation of trainee in Special Project LIPSTICK
1
}
:
:
1. Instruction in this project commenced 10 June and was
concluded 12 July 1957. It covered tradecraft, observation,
description, casing and reporting, principles of CELCI, elicitation
and interviewing, investigative techniques, and TSS briefings in
photo and the use of recording machines..
2. Trainee was known as "Ray". He was easy to work with.
Sɔ was always pleasant, courteous, cheerful and seemed genuinely
interested in every phase of the training. He can speak, read and stakes-Pipoxing
write English without any difficulty.
3. Ray seemed well motivated; more Pro-American than Mexican.
Se posseses a strong interest in clandestine work. He is an avid
reader. He demonstrated ability to apply principles he had learned
from reading and study. He seemed possessed of initiative although
there was a limited opportunity of observing this quality in action.
4. While Ray's duties to date apparently have not given him a
wide and varied experience in clandestine activity, he seemed to
grasp the material quite readily; and although in the field of
CIACE he stated he had never thought of many of their aspects as
applying to him, he seemed glad of the opportunity to learn and
absorbed then quite readily. He now possesses a good worlding
knowledge of fundamental principles involved. However, it is felt
that if he is to work primarily in this field, it should be under
the supervision of a case officer with considerable experience and
background in this type of activity.
5. As previously indicated, Ray was an avid reader. In addi-
tion to certain case studies, be read the following books:
"Handbook for Spies"
"The Spy Web*
"Out of Bondage"
"London Calling North Pole"
"A Spy Has No Friends"

ROFILE
1. Station Mexico City fully agrees with Headquarters evaluation of Subject as
a "valuable long term asset with stay behind potential. In order to place the matter
of the 2,100 pesos in the apropriate frame of reference it is felt that a few back-
ground points should be noted.
In Jamary 1956 the LIFTY/LILYRIC basehouse was set up and placed in operation
in a site which provided visual coverage of the LIMERICK installation. A deposit of
three months rent was made per terms of the rental contract at that time (2,100 pesos.)
In April 1961 the building in which LIEMPTY/LILYRIC 18 located was sold by the owner.
Normally the rental deposit would have been transferred to the new comer as part of
the sale transaction. However, approximately three months after the transfer of the
property to the new omer, the rental deposit was returned to the basehouse operator,
LIEMPTY-13. The deposit was then returned to GERENDE. GERENDE did not inform the
then LIENTY case officer nor the present case officer of the return of the LIMPTY/
LILYRIC deposit. This 2,100 pesos continued to be carried on the Station books as
an outstanding operational advance charged to G.DE. GEFUR used part of this
2,100 pesos to make loans to two sub-agents (LINITY-6 and LIHTY-9.) It is probably
that he also used core of this on ocassion for his own purposes.
On 16 October 1963 GERENDE returned the 2,100 pesos to the case officer and the
Station has adjusted its books to reflect the return of this money. OERENDE noted
at the time of the return that he had this money intact but did not know how to go
about returning it so long after having received it. This is the same as he stated at
the time of the LCFLUTTER interview. GERENDE was obviously impressed with his inability
to "beat" the LCFLUTTER. He was sincerely remorseful when talking to the case officer

THI n
about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of this nature would happen again.
With the reality of future LCFLUTTER tests set firmly in G RENDE's mind, it is believed
that he will not attempt any such action again.
As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than periodic re-LCFLUTTER) to
prevent recurrence it must be noted that GERENDE kept spart the 2100 pesos which were
really still charged to him and the Station had no way of knowing that the money had
been returned to him by the basehousekeeper. Only when the close down of the LIMP!/
LILYRIC basehouse would be effected would the Station expect to have the rental deposit
returned. Until such time the deposit would remain charged to GERENDE. The only way
to completely safeguard against this type of action would be for the case officer to
meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliminating GEREDE from the operation
and causing unacceptable security risks. It is believed that periodic LCFLUTTER of
GERENDE is the best insurance against a similar occurence in the future.
As to GEREDE's regular operational revolving fund, irregularities have never
been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are conducted by the
case officer to control the unspent portion of the revolving fund by comparison with
accountings (receipts) GERENDE takes every two weeks. GEENDE's revolving fund is
kept at the minimum amount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for which
GERENDE is responsible.
The "other false claims" GERENDE admitted making involved occasional use of his
OP vehicle for personal driving while entering all receipts for gas on his KUPARK
accountings. Station does not consider this a major problem. If GDE used his
car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him would be relatively
easy (1.e., surveilling only when he is using his Q vehicle) and it is believed that
latitude must be allowed in this area for indigenous agents.
2. In the area of GERENDE's morale and his statement that he "is not being
utilized to his full potential" the Station is as fully concerned as Headquarters. It
should be noted however, that GRINDE has never written the report setting forth what
he thinks he can do and when prodded on this has stated that he had been thinking about
what additional work he could assume and that he "just does not know". The reason he
gives is he does not know what else is being done in the operations area other than that
to which he is already exposed. Additional operational work is assigned to GERENTE
when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.
An example of this was his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station is reluctant
to expose GFR-IDE to additional operations only for the purpose of improving his morale"
since he already has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations.
The Station appreciates Headquarters comments on the results of GERENDE's LCFLUTTER
and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GERENDS in
the future.

1.
Reference is made to the results of the LCFLUTTER interview
of Raymond H. GERENDE which was held on 8 October 1963. Headquarters
would like to have a progress report on what steps have been taken
by the Case Officer with regard to the 2,100 pesos which he had
kept but belcaged to KUBARK. Headquarters is also interested in
what has been done about other falso claims he admitted making in
his accountings, and what precautions are being taken to see that
this does not continue in the future.
2. The Station's comments are requested on GERENDE's statement
that he is not being utilized to his full potential and that he
often has free time. Beadquarters would be interested in seeing
a copy of the report which the LCFLUTTER examiner suggested he write,
setting forth what he (GERENDE) thinks he can do and what he would
like to do. Headquarters considers GERENDE a valuable long term
asset with stay behind potential, and it is hoped that the Station
will do what it can within the limits of security, to raise his morale
and see that KUHARK is receiving full benefit of his services.

1. By reference Subject's annual salary was increased to us present
figure of US $5,040.00.
2. Station hereby requests a further increase in Subject's annual
salary to US $5,500.00 based upon Subject's outstanding performance as
Principal Agent in the LIEMPTY project. The latest LIEMPTY Project
Renewal Request, recently forwarded to Headquarters, detailed GERENDE's
duties. In Station's opinion, the noted salary increase is considered justified
not only from agent's excellent job performance, but also as an incentive
to continued superior work as well as an offset to the inflationary trend of
the cost of living in Mexico,
3. It is requested that Headquarters initlate the appropriate amend-
ment to GERENDE's contract Increasing his yearly salary to themted figure
of US $5,500.00 to be effective 1 January 1962.

UV Lamp for Raymond H. GERENDE
ACTION REQUIRCO • REFERENCES
REF: IDMA-16102, 9 December 1960
1. As requested by reference, KIRIOT is herewith forwarding the following:
(Confirming documentation charging you for theftem will be issued in the near future.
Long Wave Ultraviolet Lamp
2. For ordinary P&S work, the difference between long and short wave lamps is
very minor and the long wave UV lamp should prove adequate for the needs of Reymond H.
GERENDE. Should a special need arise demanding the use of a short wave UV lamp by
GEREHDE, it will be supplied by KURIOT.
3. Disclosure of the existence, advantages, or uses of short wave UV lamps, or
in any way making available such lamps to other than KUMARK personnel requires prior
Headquarters approval. A copy of Instruction No. 20-2 containing the basic EHURLI
policy governing the use of short wave UV lamps is herewith enclosed for your guidance.
4. Short wave UV lamps embody a definite health hazard and should be used with
caution. Short wave UV rays quickly cause sunbura, to which the eyes are particularly
susceptible, and should not be used without wearing protective goggles. Ordinary eye
glasses cut out most of the harmful reys, but even persons wearing glasses may receive
harmful eye burns from UV rays entering at the sides of the glasses. Short wave C7
laups also produce small quantities of ozone so that the lamp should be used in a well
ventilated room, which, of course, must also be darkened. For the above reasons, it is
advisable to use only a long wave UV lamp whenever possible.

1. The referenced dispatch forwarded the most recent contract
amendment raising GERENDE's salary to $4,560.00 per year.
2. In the Station's opinion, GERENDE's continued Superior per-
formance of his LIEMPTY Principal Agent duties justifies another salary
Increase. Headquarters attention is invited to the recent Request for Renewal
of Project LIEMPTY wherein GERENDE's duties were specified.
3. It is requested that Headquarters initiate an appropriate amend-
ment to GERENDE's contract increasing his yearly compensation to
$5,040.00. This amendment should be effective 1 January 1961.

1. In ampliance with a Station Request, LIZMPTY vrinoint
Raymond H. GENDE, is being given training in basic flaps and seals
techniques. It is felt advisable to have a second person outside the
Station who can service this type of requirement in case HULPR is prevented
from doing so by the security situation arising from the ALPHUR cams.
2. As an aid to this training, a copy of the portion of the NACHARITY
Operations Fanual (Section I.D.l.) dealing with basic fiepe and seals work
has been made end turned over to FXEDE. A second copy is being forwarded
berewith to Beadquarters. This material was proparad on the basis of the

1. In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,
Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the
following information, including recognition signals and bona fides, is
forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the information,
it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to
include it with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY).
2. Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could
probably be contacted at one of the following places:
a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A
b. Mother's Residence: IDENTITY B
:
c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C
3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,
are to be used as indicated:
CONTACT:
"Mr. (GERENDE-true name), I bring the most
sincere wishes and greetings from your Aunt
and Uncle.
"
"Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D."
GERENDE:
CONTACT:
"No, I am referring to your other relatives in
South Carolina, the IDENTITY E
"
GERENDE:
"Yes, Auntie is my Mother's sister."
t
4. For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso
note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files. GERENDE has
been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to
keep in a safe place pending his having to show it to some future KUBARK contact.
It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical
bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and
accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona
fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's
bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).
5. Assuming that adequate time will be available at the beginning of an
emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret
Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E
addresses.-

1. Reference (o) forwarded a contract amendment which provided
increased compensation and a termination settlement for Raymond H. GERENDE.
This dispatch also requested that the Station comment on the provisions of
the Terminal Payment clause as written into this amendment.
2. Since the provisions of the original contract amendment ware
written in general terms and did not specifically cover the circumstances
under which GERENDE would be aligible for a terminal settlement as
interpreted by the Station and outlined in reference (b), a revised
contract amendment was written. The attached contract amanduent also
shows corrected compensation figures. The original contract amendment was
incorrect due to the absence of the amendment, effective 1 September 1957,
which increased GERINUE' a compensation from $3,600 to $4,090.
3. Since GERENIE's origine? contract was prepared at Headquarters
and forwarded to you for exsoution and retention, this amendment should
follow the same procedure. Therefore, the original and one copy are
attached for your action and retention. Neturn one signed copy.
4. Reference (a) requested Headquarters to comment on a two-year
extension for GERENDE's contract, indicating that the extension should be
from 1 July 1959, the date of the last amendment, to 1 July 1961. There
secas to be sous confusion on contract extension procedures which Head-
quarters would like to clarify at this point. Contract extensions are
besod on the date of the original contract not the wmntments. Accordingly,
GERENDENS contrect, originally effective 1 October 1955 and extended to
30 September 1959, was further extended for a period of two years from
1 October 1959 to 30 September 1961.

PROPOSED ACTION
(Include Eranch and/or field recommendations;

utility of inciviouel for Branch area and over-

The contract for Raymond H. GERENDE expires on 20 September
1965. The Kexico City Station has recommended that the contract
be extended for one year, and that GERENDE be granted a salary
increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum.
GERENDE received his last salary raise on 1 August 1963,
from $5,500 to $6,000. He was first placed under contract on
1 October 1955 at $3,600.
There are sufficient funds in the LIEMPTY Project to cover
this salary increase, and GERENDE's local cover job can logically
cover this additional income.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERENDE's signed
contract amendment, GERENDE is most appreciative for the raise in salary
and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment clause.
"1
2. The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any
termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE's resignation in
the "best interests of the Government. Examples in connection with the "best
interests of the Government" interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation
for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a change of residence
to some geographical area where his services could not be utilized by KUBARK,
Assuming that no security problems are involved in making such a payment, the
Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to GERENDE's estate
in the event of his death while in the employ of KUBARK.
3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as
originally requested and concurs in Headquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station
would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed,
if he elects to resign just to receive some extra money or to pursue some other
career. The Station hastens to add, however, that to the best of its knowledge,
GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK job.
4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the
original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Head-
quarters will note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by
the Chief of Station, but was not formally witnessed. It is suggested that Matthew
S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the
document. DINGLEY was the Case Officer handling GERENDE at the time this
amendment became effective.

payment, the attached contract amendment was written.
2. Paragraph (a) of this amendment states that the figure
$3600 is doleted from CERENDE's contract and in lieu thereof the
figure $4560 is substituted. This figure of $3600 is the amount
GERENDE was to receive under his original contract, dated 1 October 1955.
According to the referenced dispatch, however, Subject's contract was
amended on 1 September 1957 to provide him with an increase in compensation,
bringing his salary up to $4080. Neither Contract Division nor your
area desk has a copy of this amendment. Please forvard a copy to
Headquarters for our files.
3. Your attention is also directed to the "Terminal Payment"
alsuse.
Under the provisions of the attached amendment, GERENDE is not
eligible for a termination settlement if he resigns from KUBARK. Only
in the event that we give him 30 days' notice of termination or fail to
renew his contract is he eligible for this termination payment. Your
comments on the stipulations as written into the attached amendment are
requested. In the event you feel that GERENDE should be entitled to a
termination payment should he resign his position, the clause will be
rewritten.
4. The attached amendment should be returned to Headquarters with
your comments and a copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT * Contract for GERENDE
In reviewing the last contract amendment, it came to note
that CPD was deleting the original compensation figure of $3600
instead of the figure sent by the Station which was $4080. In
checking this out, we find that we have no copy or notification
of the amendment dated 1 September 1957 increasing his salary
from $3600 to $4080. CPD is rewritting the contract without
using a compensation figure for the amount to be deleted.
When we send this to the field, ask them to send us a copy
of the contract amendment, dated 1 September 1957. Also inform
them that they are to execute and retain the original copy of this
new contract amendment. It may be well to point out that Subject's
termination clause stipulates that he will received this benefit
only if we terminate the contract.

1. It is requested that aproval be granted to amend Kaymond H. GERENDE
contract to provide him with a termination settlement of one month's salary for
each full year that he works for KUPAKK and to raise his salary effective July
1959 from $4,030 to 34,560.00 per year.. His last salary increase was granted on
1 September 1957. The date, 18 March 1955, has been sugreated by the Station as
the beginning date for the computation of GCADE's termination benefits. The
Station believes that this benefit will provide GERENDE with the necessary
incentive to make KUBANK a career and at the same time will give the Station
additional element of control.
2. As pointed out in the LI:MPTY Project Approval, CRUDE, an indigenous
agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. He has a responsible full
time job as the LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LIBIRIC and
LICALLA base houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing
and translation service and all the agents participating in these activities.
he performs his duties in a conscientious and "rofessional manner and his
already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.
3. Honey was already allocated in the LIEPTY (Toject approval for the
salary increase. With the effective date of 13 March 1955, for the termination.
elause, GEKANIK will already have accrued $1,520 (his salary is $4,560 per year)
if he should resign today. The LIEMPTY Project, as approved, has sufficient
funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the
present Project year. Therefore, no additional funds are requested.

BY QUALIFIED HQ. DESK CARY
1. Raymond H. GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March
1955 under provisions of an oral agreement. Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE
was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual
salary of $3,600.00. On 1 September 1957 his contract was amended to increase
his salary to $4,080.00 per annum, which is the salary he is presently receiving.
It is requested that a new two year contract he prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959,
providing an increase in salary to $4,560.00 per annum and including a termination
clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary,
calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for
each full year of his KUBARK employment. All other provisions of GERENDE's
initial contract should remain in force. (The increase in salary to $4,560.00
per annum is already covered by the LIEMPTY Project.)
2. As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA-11368, 22 October 1958,
paragraph three of MEXI-2836, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Field
Project Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station asset who carries
a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility. He is the
LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA base
houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-
lation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He performs
his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent
abilities are showing continued improvement.
3. Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the
Station was considering amending GERENDE's contract to provide for some type
of retirement benefits. Although it is recognized that indigenous agents are not
usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should
have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with
KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station recommends that GERENDE's new contract
provide for a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that
he has worked for KUBARK. In other words, should GERENDE's career with
KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $8,000.00, .
then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16,000.00. After
.considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several
other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting
the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make
KUBARK a career. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date
for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits.

Chronological Narrative
Performance Report
I
(Summary of evaluation of past performance (if applicable with emphasis
and details of current performance for assigned operational tasks)
DATES
LOCATION
AGENCY TASK
GERENDE was recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the team.
He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
processor of tapes. He excelled in this type of work because of his bi-
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his diver-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads.
Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic take
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation
He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited
to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career. The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.
:
:
In case of "New Hire" give a personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job.

tourist class ticket: from Rexico City to an Frarsicco and washington
D.C. and return to ‘extes City. Although tris triɔ m appear to be
a generous and unusual wedding gift, the Station considers it is more

1. The subject paper is attached. It is believed that Headquarters will
have a clearer picture of what GERENDE ta doing at the present time together
with several informative facts concerning the security of GERENDE's operations.
Also included in this paper are several recommendations which the Station pro-
poses to implement through Project LIEMPTY, Obviously, some of the recom-
mendations are goals to work for and, because of a lack of personnel and other
valid reasons, cannot be immediately adopted,
2. The attached paper should be read in conjunction with the new LIEMPTY
field project online, which was recently forwarded to Headquarters. Please note,
however, that the old agent cryptonyms are used to this paper.
3. The attachment has been read and approved by histthew S. DINGLEY,
who recruited this excellent agent (GERENDE) and was his Cass Officer util
GERENDE was recently assigned to Quinton N. Ousler.

4. GERENDE is one of the most valuable assets of this Station. This
review is considered to be a worthwhile exercise; lat under the present operationa)
pace and with present assets, security conyparumentation, which is desirable,
camt be achieved. The main security precamica (viz ging GERENDE out of
Mexico City and well hidden in case of an emergency) will constantly be kept
in mind.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF
KAYMOND H. GERENDE'S
OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES
wend
1.
SITUATION
As a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK flap, it was decided by the Chief
of Station on 30 June 1958 that Quinton N. CUSLER would assume direct contact
with several of Matthew S. DINGLEY'a agents, one of whom was Raymond H.
GERENDE. After being introduced to GERENDE by DINGLEY on 1 July 1958,
CUSLER assumed contact responsibilities with GERENDE on 2 July 1958, On
18 July 1958, the Chief of Station decided that OUSLER should be assigned
permanent responsibility for the management and handling of GERENDE and
GEKENDE's operations.
2.
3.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this operational security review is threefold:
IA
a.
b.
C.
To identify possible security problems and conditions;
To establish a framework for recommendations which will
result in the Station's submission of a new support project
(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H. GERENDE as a principal agent; and
To acquaint the new case officer with the operational problems
and agent personnel with which he should have a comprehensive
knowledge aid detailed understanding.
PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H. GERENDE
2.
Background - GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since
18 March 1955, which was just prior to his graduation from the Mexico
City College. He is now only 24 years of age, but in the Station's opinion,
is a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract agent. During
the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico
City Station, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment of support
and intelligence operations. Initially, he was trained and used by Matthew
S. DINGLEY as a member of the LIPSTICK survefilance team. In addition,
to surveillance work, he was used as an investigator to collect operational
data on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was the leader of
the LIPSTICK team. He has been used as a LIFEAT Base House operator

would be if GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies
and interrogated in detail. Also, the Station must forever be aware that
the local police agencies are certainly capable, for only a few dollars, of
selling information concerning KUBARK to the Soviets and/or Satellites.
d.
Recommendations It would be unwise to consider terminating
GERENDE since he is a highly competent agent and since his termination
would not eliminate the fact that he knows a great deal about the Station's
support operations. He has been reminded several times, and the Case
Officer will continue to remind him, that his tradecraft professionalism
must improve and stay ahead of the increasing sophistication of the local
police agencies and opposition services operating in Mexico.
It is the opinion of the Station that GERENDE should continue
to be used in about the same manner that he is presently being used. It
would be advisable, however, to separate him from the two LIFEAT
functions he is currently handling, BCMORNING and the Cuban Exile
taps. This is suggested not only because of the possible future seɑiruy
ramifications, but also because GERENDE does not have time to run
properly his support mechanism and to monitor taps seven days a week,
To provide for a situation whereby one of the local police
agencies becomes aware of GERENDE's illegal activities and assuming
that either GERENDE or the Station learns of this before the local police
agency can take positive action, it is imperative that a warning system
of communications be established to facilitate GERENDE's removal
from Mexico. Arrangements such as those used for Wilfred O. CLOWER .
could be set up or local arrangements could be made with ODUNIT or
ODOATH for a more expedtrious exit from Mexico. The Case Officer
will develop this plan in detail.
OPERATIONS

B.
(1)
Target
-
Stationary photographic surveillance of persons
entering and leaving the LIMERICK Installation.
(2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-14 is the agent in charge of the
LIMITED Base. According to GERENDE, LIPSTICK-14 is
conscientious, security minded, speaks no English, and on
occasion is a bit over confident. He performs his operational
duties competently and with discretion. In addition to his
photographic duties, he is also used occasionally as a one-man

foot surveillance to follow individuals leaving the LIMERICK
Installation, LIPSTICK-14 receives a monthly salary of $1,800,00
(MN) and free rent and utilities at the LIMITED Base. His wife
(LIPSTICK-27) and son (LIPSTICK-28) live with him at the LIMITED
Base.
LIPSTICK-28 until 15 July 1958 assisted his father with photo-
graphic work at the LIMITED Base. However, on the above
date he decided to resign from his LIMITED Job and, strange
as it may seem, to devote full time to working on a chicken
farm. LIPSTICK-28 made this decision on his own and against
the wishes of his father. He will continue to live at the
LIMITED Ease and it is believed that no security problems will
result, since any security difficulties could adversely affect
his mother and father. Although LIPSTICK-28 has been
terminated and a termination report forwarded to Headquarters,
it is suggested that we maintain his operational approval since-
he continues to live in the LIMITED Base.
(3)
Communications - At the present time GERENDE meets
with LIPSTICK-14 three times a week at contact points away from
the Base. They have seven separate contact points which are
used for their meetings. Usually the place of contact is pre-
arranged at the previous meeting; however, a rapid means of
communication exists whereby GERENDE telephones LIPSTICK-14
and through a pre-arranged open code, utilizing insurance
policy numbers, sets the time and place of contact. LIPSTICK-14's
overt occupation is that of an insurance salesman and adjuster;
consequently, there is a cover basis for such a telephonic
conversation. A reserve system of communication with LIPSTICK-14
has not yet been arranged, GERENDE has been instructed to do
this as soon as possible, thereby giving the Station a means to
contact LIPSTICK-14 directly should the need ever arise.
(4) Security- Excluding KUBARK staff personnel, the LIMITED
Base is known to LIPSTICKS-2, 14, 27 and 28 and to Oliver
G. SCANTLING and Raymond H. GERENDE and possibly to
LIPSTICK-12 (CERENDE's opinion). Since LIPSTICK-14 has
known LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) for many years and since
LIMEWATER is LIPSTICK-2's brother, it is important to recognize
that the desirable degree of compartmentation between LIPSTICK/
LIMITED and LIFEAT probably does not exist. Although LIMEWATER
must be aware of LIPSTICK-14's and 2's PEPRIME employment,
it has not been possible to ascertain the extent of LIMEWATER's
knowledge about their specific activities, and vice versa. LIPSTICK-14

and processor of tapes; he has excelled in this type of work because of
his bi-lingual Spanish/English facility and, more importantly, due to
his diversified experience in clandestine operations which permits him
to spot operational leads much more readily than the average LIFEAT
monitor.
b.
-
Dutles GERENDE is currently serving as the principal agent
in charge of LIMITED, LICALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY
Surveillance Team and LILYRIC. In addition, he monitors and processes
the EGMORNING and Cuban Extles LIFEAT taps. He also supervises
the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-in-law) and the
translation work of LIPSTICK-40 (his sister). He maintains contact with
and provides administrative support to LIMITATIONS 5 and 6, LICOOL-7
Base operators. Quite obviously GERENDE's many dutles overlap the
bounds of several Station operations, namely LIPSTICK, LIJERSEY,
LIFEAT, LICOOL and several activites which are not listed under
formal projects such as BGMORNING. It is recognized by the Station
that it is not advisable to have one principal agent connected with as
many operations as is GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of
both staff and contract agents of the principal agent type necessitate
such efficiency measures. Every effort is being made to compartment
the various segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and
to eliminate where possible, all lateral communications between
agents.
C.
-
Security Problems The most serious security situation
surrounding CERENDE and his many activities is the fact that
LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested
in the June 1958 flap) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he
also worked for KUBARK. In fact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal
friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK
employment by GERENDE. The operational security hypothesis that
can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous
to list in this brief review; suffice to say that should GERENDE be
arrested by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining
support assets would be destroyed or so seriously compromised that
the Station would indeed be foolish to continue using them. It is
appropriate to state here, however, that neither GERENDE nor the
Station believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise
identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap. It is granted though that
any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro-
mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE.
Based on the duties which GERENDE is currently performing, the readers
of this review can well imagine what the consequences to several operations

worked with James O. AYCALL (LIMESTONE) during WW-II;
however, he claims that the only members of AYCALL's family
that he ever met was AYCALL's "alieged wife.' Since she saw
him only one time many years ago, LIPSTICK-14 does not
believe that she would recognize him now,
Neither GERENDE nor LIPSTICK-14 are aware that KUBARK
owns the LIMITED Base House. The extent of their knowledge
is that LIMOUSINE is the owner and we simply rent from him.
(5) Recommendations - It is recommended that GERENDE
continue to meet with LIPSTICK-14 and to supervise his operation.
In this connection, GERENDE has been instructed to reorganize
his existing communications arrangements with LIPSTICK-14 to
include a new regular system, a rapid non-scheduled system and
a reserve system. Also, GERENDE is to review with LIPSTICK-14
their cover reasons for mecting and knowing each other and to be
prepared to use this cover story should they ever be apprehended
together.
LIPSTICK-14 was instructed on 8 August 1958 to cease all
social and business contact with LIPSTICK-2. Oliver G.
SCANTLING, who has previously handled LIPSTICK-14 and sees
him occasionally even now, has been directed to cease all
contact with the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14 except when
approved by the Case Officer. (NOTE: It is necessary at times
for SCANTLING to debrief LIPSTICK-14 for LIMESA leads).
LILYRIC
(1)
Target - Stationary photographic surveillance of persons
entering and leaving the LIMERICK installations.
(2) Personnel - LIJERSEY-5 is personnel manager of a
Mexican affiliate of a large PBPRIME company. In addition to
serving as a spotter for potential surveillance team members, he
also serves as the cutout for the LILYRIC Base, GERENDE
manages and directs the LILYRIC Base through LIJERSEY-5.
LIJERSEY-5 maintains direct contact with LIJERSEY-2, the
Base House operator, and his wife, LIJERSEY-12, who does
most of the photographic work. LIJERSEY-5 is a PBPRIME
citizen. He is paid a monthly salary of $1,000.00 (MN).
