1. The following items from LIBIGHT/LIMUD coverage
concern contacts of Subject who are believed to be of interest:
A. Attachment A: A letter from CAW, the
magazine of Students for a Democratic Society, signed
by Jerry *BODANES, thanks Margaret for her poems
which they are using. The magazine is scheduled to
be off the press around May 10. The letter clearly
indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure
of Columbia University. It says, "Right now our
glorious brothers have seized Columbia University--
now named Malcolm X University--and over which an
N.L.F. flag now flies. The others, faculty, deans
managers, are all scurrying and speaking pious--
saying SDS this, SDS that, "while we hold five
buildings in joyousness and the most serious
B.
preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."
Enclosed is a check made out against the account of
the SDS in the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company,
2681 Broadway, New York, for the amount of $50, and
signed by Robert M. *SHAPIRO.

B. Attachment B: Letter from Heiner *BASTIAN,
1415 Kearny St., San Francisco, California 94135,
signed Heiner & Celine. BASTIAN has made arrangements
with the editor-in-chief of AKZENTE to publish works
of revolutionary poets, and he asks Margaret's
help in collecting them. BASTIAN says that he is
going to Berlin about 1 July, to Prague in early
autumn for a "group 47 meeting, " and to Cuba in
early November.
C. Attachment C: Letter from Jaime *CARRERO,
Art Department of the Interamerican University in
San German, Puerto Rico. CARRERO has apparently sent
Margaret a series of drawings based on Dr. Martin
Luther KING's assassination. He describes them as
"poetic...but full with guts and disgust."
He says
there is a possibility CBS will do a program on
his paintings and the work in his Art Department.
CARRERO is going to Columbia University in the
summer of 1968 to study and plans to distribute
El Corno there.
D. Attachment D:
Letter from Susan *SHERMAN,
305 E. 6th St., No. 3, New York, N. Y. (see HMMA-
33837). She tells of her plans to go to StoneyBrook
on 23 April to speak about the conference for their
week of protest activities. She tells Margaret
that there are three people in Cuba she thinks
would be interested in "The Hippie Book." They are
Jose *BELL Lara, of Calle J #556, Vedado, Habana,
who is connected with Pensimento Critico%;B Cuban
psychologist Gustavo *TORROELLA, Ave. 3A #22,
Marianao, Habaña; and Lohania *ARUCA, 99-4722,
MINREX-Direccion de Organismos Internacionales,
Depto. ONU 516, La Habana.
E. Attachment E: Margaret got a letter from
someone associated with CATERPILLAR. He is thinking
of getting married to Marie *BENOIT in England this
summer when he goes there to work in applied
philosophy. Therefore, he tells Margaret he cannot
go to Cuba as planned.
2. Attachment, F: An interesting development was the
fact that Margaret RANDALL received a letter from Moscow from
Luis *SUARDIAZ, whose return address was given as the Cuban
Embassy, Moscow, URSS.
URSS. SUARDIAZ asks for Suzan SHERMAN
(see paragraph 1D above). SUARDIAZ says he will be working
as Cultural Counselor in the Cuban Embassy and hopes Margaret
will keep in touch with him and send him things of interest
(in a literary line).
3,
In attachment G, Sergio MONDRAGON, Subject's husband,
indicates that Margaret RANDALL is planning to travel to
Venezuela from 15 to 30 June. It is suggested that Head-
quarters may wish to send Venezuela some background information
on Margaret with suggestions for action by the Venezuela
Station.

I am very pleased bout that and I hope that
Jou are too. I would suggest that you collect
about lo -15 revolutionary poets. You shoula
write an introduction or whatever you like.
I also suggest that you end not sergio shouldä
collect as man or less "other" poets. If you
don't want to do that, please arrange something with sergio.
It makes things much easier for me mailings, translations,
proofs, etcj.
I need all the meterial in about 5 -o weeks. If this
date will put pressure on you, let me know.'

Dear Mag:
I've received the group of Cornos #24 and 25,26. I've
also sent a saria of drawings based on Dr. Martin Luther
King's assasination.. They postic as usual but full with
guts and disgust. The US will get no where with this
killing of the best of their sons. Your work is getting
there-here- where it is needed, so keep up the excellent
job you are doing- since I know that you are working under
a tramandous preassure. Very soon I'll send some money.
Again I want ten Cornos 24- if you have any left. These
drawings are getting a lot of attention especially in
our younger generation which where is counts,
There is a possibility of CBS doing aprogram of what I am
doing in painting and in our Art Department- if it comes
through I'll put a word or two about el Corno. This is
to happen -if- you know- in the fall.
I'm going to New York during Au June- 'till agust-and I'll
be studying at Columbia. I'll take with me some cornos
to distribute. If you want to give any messages or anything
that I can do in New York while there-please-let me know,
Bueno, Mego como siempre-la familia receives my beat
regards and you by sincere love and efforts.
Be careful which living.

Dear Mag,
Just a nota--I'm going this afternoon to StoneyBrook to speak.
about the conference for their weak of protest activities.
'
I finally got most of my things & I have a packet of poetry
that I'm sure was meant for you--it was the poema Tania, meant
for you--it must have gotten mixed up in my things. In any case
I'm sending them in a separate envelop Air-Mail,
The Hippie Book is really great looking, thank you for it. There
are two people in Cuba I think would be very interested in it
if you could send them copies. One works on Pensimento Critico--
Jose Bell Lara, Calle J #556, Vedado, Habana--he particularly
wanted information about the Hippies. The other is a Cuban
paychologist Gustave Torroella, Ave 34 #22, Marianas, Habana,
who was also extremly interested in anything concerning hipppies,
Also Lonania Aruca, 99-4722, MINREX-Direccion de Organismos

It seems now as if I also have a small ulcer which showed up on
Last weeks X-rays, But I'm feeling much, much better now. Just
have to try not to get too excited and dat right for awhile.
It should go away if I'm good. (but then I dont give myself
agrivation so its only partly up to me). That was what vas
probably causing all the trouble in Cuba. Anyway, I'm much
better now. I really have to learn not to take everything so
much to heart--but thats a long lesson,
I'm going to try to get the issue in shape the next few daya.

dear Meg,

I am sorry to have put the Japanese filmmaker on you; my
misjudgement. You were right to send the thing back to me.
Ex
Some changes in my life have recently re-determined the
summer, and I am doubtful tonight, really doubtful for the
first time (tho I have been thinking about this for a couple of
weeks, but have not written because Everything was up in the
air), about the trip this summer. The thing is that a more im-
portant thing has come up, namely going to England this fall
to do some very important work in an applied philosophy called
Scientology (to go "clear" as they call it), and doing that I
must teach all summer to make money and also to do work on
the fall issue of CATERPILLAR, Marle Benoit and I are
seriously considering getting married in England, and while
I could put the trip off until next spring, she wants to do the
thing this fall, and we both want to go clear together. So,
considering all of this, I think you should scratch my name,
and hope I can go to Cuba later as well as hope the Cubans
will see fit to invite me later (I have heard nothing from any
Cubans about the trip this summer, so I figured it is not com-
pletely set).
Homena
All of the other names I sent you are still to my
knowledge good If I hear otherwise I will write you immediately.
I'm not fom

Contact Them.
CATERPILLAR 3/4 is out, and 3 copies are on their way to you, nov II WW)
I will mail a box of #2 and more 3/4s when I get the time. Sorry
not to hv sent more, but only 3 went out to the contributors this
time and I forgot about you sending some to Cuba when I mailed
yours.
Saw Sergio a few weeks ago, It was nice to see him.
We had supper in Chinatown and I gave him a new poem.
A number of people have commented on your prose/poem in
#3/4. Very Impressive is the general word. I hope it looks good
to you when you see the magazine,
I have a great deal new
work; are you open to printing more of my poetry in a forthcoming
EL CORNO7
I hope you are not upset my change in plans. This..
Sunday is the first day they have been definite. Hoping your
life goes well these days,
affectionately,

Dear Miss Randell:
My former colleagus Sara Blackburn (who sends hor
love) has told me that she recently heard through
your husband about your plans for a trip to Cuba
in order to write a book on Castro. I should be
very interested to know more about your plans with
a view towards the possibility of publishing your
book and hope you'll be able to write me.
Incidentally, we are about to publish Jose Iglesias's
In the Fist of the Revolution: Life in a Cuban
Country Town. I thought you'd be interested to read
It and have sent you a copy under separate cover.
Yours sincerely,
Paula McGuire

Pratiquement, comment tout cela peut-il s'agencer ? :
En organisant les Noirs. Historiquement, nous vunoris tous d'Afri-
que. In nous dispersant dans leur monde, les Blanes occidentaux
nous ont appris, par la négative cortes, mais nous ont appris quand
même à apprécier Punité. Nous savons aujourd'hui, que l'unitó, c'est
In puissance. C'est pour réaliser cut inspératif d'unitó que nous a-
vons arrêté, dans un premier temps, do nous réaliser culturellement,
on rejetant lo christianismo (culture d'imposition, lib à l'idée do su-
prématie do la culturo des Blancs occidentaux).
Le problème à résoudre est celui de créer des révolutionnaires
noirs. Pour nous, cela signifio 3 objectifs :.
1. Adoption d'une langue nationalc africaino lo swahill, par
exemplc.
2. Destruction du christianismo.
3. Redécouvrir l'Afrique, mais d'une manière scientifique, pour y
puiser nos propres héos, au lieu d'assumer les héros blancs
occidentaux.
En comme, recréer notre culture pour en faire une force do cohó-
sion.
Dégager une idéologie politique commune. A cet égard l'expérion-
co do in Révolution chinoise est riche d'exemples mobilisatours.
Notre tâche à nous est de fuller pour acquérir une idéologie cor-
recle, capable d'unifier tous les Noirs.
La close fondamentale à retenir, c'est de contribuer à développer
la conscienco qui doit amener l'Américain noir à résister. Cette
concclence est nécessairo.

CRITICIZING THE NON-VIOLENT LINE WHICH WAS ADVOCATED BY LUTHER KING,

HIS TRIP. HE CALLED THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS--WHO WERE MORE OR
LESS UNDER CONTROL--TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOHNSON APPEARED ON
TELEVISION, HE EXPRESSED HIS ANGUISH AND HIS SORROW. HE MADE
INSPIRED COMMENTS ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING. THE SE ACTIONS AND THE SE
WORDS HIDE FEAR OVER THE WAVE OF JUST VIOLENCE WHICH IS STARTING TO
SPREAD THROUGH THE UNITED STATES.' JAT A TIME WHEN COMPLEX INTER-
NATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT BE UNDERWAY, UNDER DIFFICULT CONDITIONS,
THIS NEW CRIME WIDENS THE CHASM WHICH DIVIDES THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES AND INCITES THE PEOPLE TO PROMOTE DISTURBANCES WHOSE
FAR-REACHING EFFECTS ARE HARD TO PREDICT.
MARTIN LUTHER KING CONFIRMS THAT THE VIOLENCE OF IMPERIALIST RACISTS
IS ONLY ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY
STRUGGLE.
