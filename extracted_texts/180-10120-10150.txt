SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
NAME Sgt. Lewis Wesley LEBER
Address Headquarters TAC
Date 2/24/78 Time
Place Bldg. #693 Hqs. TAC
12:03P.M.
Langley AFB, VA
Interview:
Due to the nature of the interview, DOD approval was sought and
acquired prior to scheduling contact with Sgt. LEBER. The
sensitive nature of the military activities at Langley AFB also
required that approval be given to Sgt. Leber to participate in
the interview with the undersigned, which in turn resulted in
the presence of two military personnel at the outset of the
session, namely Colonel Gene D. Hunter and Special Agent David
(804) 764-7778
Herb Pelham, both of the USAF Office of Special Investigations
Because of the awkward circumstances, the two civilian-
attired military observers were asked to leave the room to help
Sgt. Leber âœ“ relax and to encourage freer recall. Without ob-
jection, both observers left soon after the interview began.

2. Since Leber was transferred to Hqs. TAC at
Langley AFB in 1970, he only knew STANLEY for approximately
2-3 months (exact time unknown). However, during this period
of time, LEBER does not recall any conversation with STANLEY
relative to the JFK assassination, Russia, Cuba and/or Mexico.
LEBER stated that Capt. STANLEY was an ex-enlisted
man who had served 16 years in the Army and was about 38 years
of age in 1970. He was possibly "r.i.f.'ed" from the service
in 1971 and was said to have had severe financial problems.
4. Further, it is believed that Capt. STANLEY left
the service and went to study law at the University of Miami
(Florida) in 1971.
5. Two servicemen were identified as having served
under Capt. STANLEY, namely Larry F. CAISON and Chief Master
Sergeant Charles FISCHER, about whom, it was felt, additional
information could be secured.
Following the termination of the interview, assistance
was provided in obtaining the addresses of the above-referenced
servicemen:
Lt. Col. Rudolph D. GOBEL, Jr., Retired
2671 Merrie Oaks Road
Winter Park, Florida 32789
Larry F. CAISON
1508 Gronin Drive
Hampton, Virginia
At the present time the whereabouts of Sgt. FISCHER
and Capt. STANLEY are unknown.
