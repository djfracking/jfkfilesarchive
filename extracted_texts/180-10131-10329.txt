Mr. Goldsmith.
Mr. Shaw..
Where were you serving in 1963?
From about the middle of April, I was serving
in Mexico City in our station.

Mr. Goldsmith.
How long did you stay in Mexico City?
Mr. Shaw. I stayed there until September of 1966.
Mr. Goldsmith. Who was the Station Chief in Mexico
Mr. Shaw. Winston Scott.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give us your assessment of
his competence?
Mr. Shaw. Competence. It is difficult, because I was
not looking from on high. He was a brilliant man. He was
reputed to have a doctorate in mathematics. He had an uncanny
ability to remember numbers and he carried in his head the
file numbers of what we called P-files in Mexico City.

Mr. Goldsmith.
Headquarters never asked you to come in
and give a description, for example, of Oswald's activities,
to your knowledge, in Mexico City in 1963?
Mr. Shaw. No.
I would not have known anything about
Oswald's activities anyway.
Mr. Goldsmith. Are you familiar with the photograph
that was taken in 1963 that was reportedly linked to Oswald
1 and which subsequently turned out not to be a picture of

Mr. Shaw. I am familiar with a photograph that was

being an American-appearing person. I do not know that it
was every considered to be Oswald.
I think, if I remember correctly, what they were doing
Mr. Goldsmith.
We will get into that. My question is,
did anybody from Headquarters ever ask you about that parti-

have been normal for any other case officer in the Cuban sec-

Mr. Goldsmith. In light of that, do you know what infor-
mation LITAMIL-7 gave concerning the Cuban government's reac-
tion to the death of the President?
Mr. Shaw. I do not recall, and I do not recall the
specifics of anything. You may have something in your files
with my name on it; I do not know what LITAMIL-9 produced.
I do have the recollection of the sense of feeling on the
part of those people that there was no exultation or jubila-
tion or happiness whatsoever inside the Cuban Embassy at the
assassination of President Kennedy.
Mr. Goldsmith.
Did the penetration agents ever indicate
that Oswald had been to the Embassy and had stated that he was

was being hurt, hurt careerwise, to step back and I was very
interested in Cuban operations, so I did willingly, let us say,
relinquish command, if you want to, of Cuban Ops and I served
Dave as one more officer.
Later on, after Dave left, a year or two later, I once
again took over the Cuban Ops group.

then, after Phillips left, you went back to that position?
Mr Shaw. That is right.
Mr. Goldsmith. Our review of Agency records indicates
that Phillips would have assumed that position on October of
163. Would that be consistent with your recollection?
Mr. Shaw. My recollection would have been, had you not
told me this based on your review of the files, that it took
place earlier than October, but I do not know. I really do not
know.
Mr. Goldsmith. My questions are going to be confined,
unless I indicate to the contrary, to the period up to the
end of 1963. So, from the time of your arrival in Mexico City

Mr. Goldsmith. Chief would be the word, and you had those

Mr.
Shaw.
Since it was not ratified to me upon my

the Cuban target. Our basic interest was in effecting pene-

What we wanted most of all were effective penetrations

possible line-in to their communications set-up.

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, in light of your response, I am
certainly aware of the sensitivity of this issue and of your
10 concern for sources and methods, and I would also make two
points. One is that under the letter, you are free of your
secrecy obligation. At the same time, I am not about to rely
13 upon that letter to compel an answer out of you, because you
are here voluntarily today to help us. And, as I said, because
I understand your concern for a sensitive source in this case,

reluctance to, then, as far as I was concerned, then the
matter was terminated.
Mr. Shaw. No problem?
Mr. Goldsmith. I will say that we will pursue this by
contacting the appropriate people at the Agency.
Mr. Shaw. I think if you requested the Agency for those
two names, it would probably produce them. I wouldn't want to
be the guy to say it.
Mr.

Mr. Shaw. There was a mix, and I cannot recall which
were which. It may well have been that we were tapping some
Cuban Embassy phones unilaterally, and some of them were being
tapped jointly. I know that there was coverage on the joint tap
operation, which I believe was called LIENVOY. I am not sure.
Mr. Goldsmith. That is correct.
You indicated that you think Ann Goodpasture may have been
responsible for the telephone tap operation against the Cuban
operation. What basis do you have for that?
Mr. Shaw.
Responsible in the sense of picking up the take.
I am not sure of that, because I know she did some of that kind
of work. I am not sure who did it. We used to get copies of
the transcripts and I remember
I am sure I saw some of the
Cuban stuff on joint taps. And then, of course, taps that
were run by the Mexican government.

Mr. Shaw. That agent was an employee of the consular
section of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. LITAMIL-9 was an
officer of the Embassy.

of these two agents, when you go back to the Agency, could you

the Agency is in the process of looking into this issue.
Mr. Shaw. Okay.
Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like to get into
the area of the telephone taps that were in operation in 1963
against the Cuban Embassy and consulate. My first question is,
what responsibility, if any, did you have with regard to the
telephone tap operation?
Mr. Shaw. No responsibility. I saw the product,
usually.
Mr. Goldsmith. Who was the individual who was in charge
of that tap?

that, I mean which phones were covered by the unilateral one?

a variety of take, what we call take, from the various tap
operations. This take sometimes was processed into English.
The stuff that appeared in the resuma was in Spanish. Sometimes
the conversations were typed out in Spanish and translated into
English. I prefer them in Spanish, because I am at home in
Spanish.
Mr. Goldsmith. How many people reviewed the take from
the surveillance operation of the Cuban Embassy and consular
telephones?
Mr. Shaw. I have no idea. I assume there were quite a
few. The stuff was widely passed around.

This would be a little far-fetched, because a Soviet
would not be likely to handle it by phone. But in a case
where you are looking for something fast-breaking to protect
yourself, being on top of the situation it would not apply
much to Mexico, but if you had a revolutionary situation
breaking out someplace, surely there is a possibility of
getting information very quickly off any given line.

been the day Phillips left for Mexico, probably a year or

there was a Cuban photo, or a photo operation against the

interpretation of those words, suggesting that that the mean-
ing is prospective in intent. In other words, after December
9, 1963, the timelag for retention of tapes prior to erasure
would be two weeks.
Mr. Shaw. I think it could read that, yes. I do not know
what went on between Winn and the station as far as periods
for keeping these, but I think what you are trying to do is lead
me into a situation of pointing out that the station was remiss
in destroying tapes, and I do not believe that is the case.

for the record, that what I am trying to do here is go over
questions that are raised by the documents and the Committee
has no predisposition, one way or the other, to reach any

Mr. Shaw. Okay.
Mr. Goldsmith. The second paragraph indicates that the
station is unable to compare the voices, as the first tape was
erased prior to the receipt of the second call.
Mr. Shaw. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. Does that suggest to you that at least
one tape was still in existence on November 23rd, the date
that this cable was sent? Otherwise, the second paragraph would
have said the tapes had been erased, routinely, whatever.
Mr. Shaw. It could indicate that. It does not definitely
state that. That is an interpretation, certainly.
Mr. Goldsmith. Does that refresh your memory as to whether
or not there was a taping system?
Mr. Shaw. I do not have anything in writing. This did
not refresh my memory at all. This probably would have been
considered.

things that I would do with the agent that I mentioned earlier
was that I handled was take batches of these pictures to him
and sit down with him and say, did you ever see this guy, or
who was that? And he'd say, that's a courier, or that's the

We used to try to identify people with those pictures.
Mr. Goldsmith. How many photo bases were there taking
pictures of the Cuban consulate and Embassy?
Mr. Shaw. To the best of my knowledge, there was only
one photo base. At times, the consulate was not covered and
the Embassy was. If I may draw you a picture, this would be
the block, the compound block. The Cuban Embassy was the
big building up here, and there was a little gatehouse down
here. I do not remember whether it was in or out.
This was the consulate, on the corner. People who would
want to get visas would routinely appear here and they would
send them down the street and they would go into the consulate.
Sometimes they knew where they were going and they came in here,

This is a block, a city block. The house from which the
photographs were taken is over here on this corner. The
photographs were taken long distance down here and here. This
was not always covered. This was considered more important,
because it was routine -- either there was a lot of routine

Mr. Goldsmith.
Whose picture would be taken?
Mr. Shaw. For example, that you would normally in an
operation like this be limited by time available for the
photographer. You would be limited by daylight. You would
not photograph a milkman, or a mailman or somebody who would
be there repeatedly. You would not photograph a staffer of

You would not photograph a regular visitor to the Embassy,

Mr. Goldsmith.
Would you photograph all foreigners?
Mr. Shaw. I do not know. I would have to say the answer
is no. I never photographed any of them. Do you mean would
all foreigners be photographed? I would say, given the
limitations that I have enumerated, namely how long a person
19 can sit there and watch, and they have to take a break now

Mr. Shaw. Go ahead.
Mr. Goldsmith. You were not involved in the photo-
surveillance operation and you were not involved in the wire
tap operation, so, my question is, what was your primary
responsibility?
Mr. Shaw. My primary responsibility was to try to
effect penetrations of the Cuban government. I spent a good
bit of time with Cubans of the non-Castro persuasion, attempt-
ing to identify Cubans of the Castro persuasion that we might
go after.
##
By "go after,' I mean attempt to recruit.
I spent a lot of time collecting information from the
Cuban asset on the outside to process into the intelligence
reports on what was happening in Cuba.
We had a system set up in Mexico City under an agent
called AMSAIE who was the representative of the exile commun-
ity. He would arrange to meet, help, debrief, Cubans who were
arriving constantly from Cuba on the way to the United States
or to Mexico or to somewhere else in the world, people who
24 were exiting Cuba.

Another thing they did, by the way, was they tried to
photograph the license plates of automobiles that came to these

in operation?

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what his responsibilities
Mr. Shaw. I believe his responsibilities had to do with
dealings with the Mexican government, liaison responsibilities.
I think George was used by Winn because George had good contacts
in the Ministry of Interior, which would have been sort of the
equivalent of the Department of Justice here and out of that
Ministry came, for example, the man who became President of
Mexico. He was the station assets contact, not agent.
Mr. Goldsmith. You mentioned earlier. Mr. Charles Ander-
son, is that correct?
Mr. Shaw. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why Mr. Anderson had an inter-
est in Eusbio Ascue?

Mr. Shaw. There was little reporting that came out of
the photographs. Usually, it yielded what we called operational
information rather than intelligence information, to enable us
to develop a better understanding of who was in the area, of
who was in the Cuban Embassy, and what they were up to.
As far as reporting intelligence that came from those,
it probably was reported by the reports section of the Embassy

We had reports officers who actually repaired most of the
reports from raw reports, if you will, reported by the case

Again, I would like to point out that these photographs
yielded very little reportable intelligence. It was mostly
operational intelligence.
Mr. Goldsmith.

say, late '62 or somewhere in there, it probably would have
been Tom who would have done that..
Mr. Goldsmith. What was Anderson's position at the
Embassy?
Mr. Shaw. He was not at the Embassy then. He was at
the Embassy back in 1965. I do not know, for a number of years.
At that time, Charlie had gone back to Headquarters and he
was involved in Cuban operations from Headquarters, the details
of which were not made known to me. Whether they were made
known to Winn Scott or Dave Phillips or others, I do not know.
Mr. Goldsmith. When would he have made an effort, if
he did, to recruit Teresa Proenza?
Mr. Shaw. I am not sure that he ever tried to recruit.
I am merely saying that he had a lot of interest. I do not
think anybody ever tried to recruit her. If they did they
were wasting their time.

What this comes down to, of course, is gardeners and
secretaries.
Mr. Goldsmith. Why do you make that distinction between
a Cuban national and a Mexican?
Mr. Shaw. I make that distinction because of the flap
potential. If the Mexicans had attempted to pitch a Cuban and
the Cuban had not accepted that pitch and had reported it
to his superiors, the Mexican Foreign Office then would have
had a problem with the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
Mr. Goldsmith. Of course, the Mexican government was
also taking a risk by being involved in the liaison operation

be able to contact through an intermediary the photo bases
to warn them or indicate to them that someone is coming of
interest?

not exist, and I do not believe that the guys monitoring the

the people at the photo house to take pictures. This was in
the most perfect of all worlds. Usually things did not work
that way and you end up out on the street, in the middle of

the photographs, printed them and turned them over.
Mr. Goldsmith. If he were to put the time on, he would
have to go to his log and see what the time was and then make
the entry?
Mr. Shaw. Right. He probably made a little notation to
himself like I mentioned, the bright shirt or something. Then
he would recognize that person in the photograph and make that
notation.

that the photograph reflected Oswald?

American going in, and maybe this is the fellow. I do not
see from this cable any conclusion that that is Oswald. I
2
3 rather suspect they never got a picture of Oswald. This is
4
the one that appeared there, that looked like it could be
an American. Therefore, an effort was made to help Headquarters
by saying a man who looked like he might be an American
entered the Soviet Embassy at that time.
Mr. Goldsmith. I agree with you, Mr. Shaw. Certainly,
the cable does not say that the photograph is a photograph of
10 Oswald. At the same time, though, it gives the information
in paragraph 1 on Oswald and the second paragraph makes a
reference to a photograph taken of someone who appears to be

Certainly they would not have sent to Headquarters simply
a cable indicating the existence of a photograph, so by putting
the photograph in paragraph 2 immediately below the information
on Oswald, although the cable does not say that the photograph
is one of Oswald, it does in some way suggest that they are
related.
Mr. Shaw. It suggests to me that they know an American
who claimed to be Lee Oswald called at a certain time, and
then they went to the photographs to see if they could find
23 anybody who looked like he might be an American, and the

photo they found was of a man apparently 35, athletic build,

For example, I have never issued a visa. I have issued
a passport for another consular officer who accepted the

and issued the passport to the American citizen concerned.

As I mentioned very early in our session today, I am not
aware that there was any exultation, satisfaction, or happi-

President.
And I think, and my personal belief is, that
everything points to Lee Harvey Oswald having done it, and
done it alone.
There is nothing I have ever seen or heard which would
lead me to accept, for one moment, any complicity on the part
of my Agency or any other agency of the United States

Mr. Goldsmith.
Normally when somebody is acting under
State Department cover, is the person required to hold down
two jobs at the same time?
Mr. Shaw. It depends on the location of the person.
As I understand it, people we have, for example, in the Iron
Curtain countries, or the countries of Eastern Europe, do
hold down virtually 100 percent full-time State Department,
Foreign Service jobs. Some of the people that I have run into
in my work as an Inspector for the Office of the Inspector
General, notably in the Mid-Eastern countries, have spent much
more time on their cover work than I did.
I think that it has to do basically with the permissive-
ness, or lack thereof, of the operational environment that
you are in. In Mexico, it was not necessary to spend much
