e. Yesterday it was announced
that the carrying of firearms by
anyone outside the security forces
was forbidden until the elections
are over.
f. Some 3,000 reservists have
been called up to protect the polls.
Leaves are being cancelled and all
security forces are maintaining a
high state of alert.
a. We now have a fuller ac-
count from official US sources of
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain
villages mentioned in Tuesday's
Checklist.
b.
This account makes it clear
that the earlier press versions,
which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-
lagers, were highly colored.
C. Our present information
is that the attack, in company
strength, was successfully repulsed.
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas-
ualties; government losses were six
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

d. As is usual in these cases,
the villagers began to trickle back
once the Viet Cong left.
e. This episode aside, we see
· a number of indications that the
Communists will try to sustain the
higher level of military activity
they have kept up since the coup.
f. The Communist radio has
called for more attacks in an effort
to destroy strategic hamlets and
"develop" Viet Cong forces. In sup-
port of this, Viet Cong communica-
tions traffic has been unusually
heavy and has involved a large vol-
ume of high priority traffic and
special alert patterns.

3. Israel
a. We have some reason to be-
lieve that the Israelis are develop-
ing a surface-to-surface missile of
their own.
b. A reliable clandestine
source says that an Israeli repre-
sentative is trying to buy US stable
platforms for the inertial guidance
system of a missile with a range of
300-350 miles. He wanted delivery
in six to twelve months. There have
been several earlier reports that

4. USSR-India
:
Israel is buying missile components
in the US and England.
C. We think this missile pro-
gram is independent of another
Israeli venture: Tel Aviv's con-
tract with a French firm, Marcel
Dassault, for the development of a
system which will be able to deliver
a 1,600-pound warhead to a maximum
range of 300 miles.
a. Moscow has promised the
Indians to ship the equipment for
one surface-to-air (SAM) training
site early next month.
b. The Soviets had agreed to
provide eight SAM sites. The rest
will probably not be sent until the
Indians have learned to handle the
equipment about a year from now.
c. As we noted last Sunday,
there are some Indians who have
doubts about the Soviet willingness
to live up to the letter of their
military aid agreements with New
Delhi.

They call into question
especially the contract for the
Soviets to set up in India a facility

impractical from the beginning.

Soviet aircraft specialists working

a. Ne Win has followed up his
action in breaking off talks with
the Burmese Communists by arresting
over 700 of their number.
b. Ne Win had been trying to
lure the faction-ridden Communists
into a "national front." However,
he found the demands of the Commu-
nist negotiators, some of whom had
only just returned from long exile
in Peiping, to be impossible.
C. This will probably lead to
renewed fighting between the army
and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

1. Venezuela
a.
The country's six presiden-
tial candidates have swung into the
home stretch of their campaigns.
So have the terrorists, who are still
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's
vote.
b. There is little doubt that
the terrorist effort has all-out
Cuban support. Castro looks on
Venezuela as his prime target in
Latin America and would do everything
in his power to prevent President
Betancourt from finishing his term.
C.
So far, the terrorists have
tried to intimidate the candidates
by harassing political rallies, bomb-
ing their party headquarters in
various cities, and threatening them
with assassination. They have tried
to scare voters from the polls by
creating a general atmosphere of law-
lessness. Kidnappings, like the one
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,
are part of the pattern.
d. The government counterattack
is under the personal direction of
Betancourt, who is as determined to
finish out his term and turn over
power to a freely-elected successor
as Castro is to prevent this.

Comments by Goulart, that
"social disaster" is sure if his
program is not passed soon, have drawn
sharp rejoinders from moderate and
conservative figures and have fed
rightist coup plotting.
C. Strains are also growing in
the military following the arrest
of a young officer who refused last
month to execute an order to arrest
Governor Lacerda, a leading conserva-
tive spokesman and likely presidential
candidate.

b. His party does not have a
parliamentary majority, so he needs
support from either Karamanlis'
party on the right or from the Com-
munists. The military has apparently
been pressing Karamanlis to withhold
that support. He does not need much
urging.
C. . The military has also let
it be known that it would consider
Papandreou's acceptance of Communist
support as sufficient reason for a
coup d'etat.
d. In addition to this military
string-pulling, the royal family is
also meddling--not for the first
time. Should Papandreou fail to
form a government, the palace intends
to pass the mandate to Karamanlis,
believing that he too would fail.
e. This would then open the
way, the palace calculates, for a
compromise premier more amenable to
palace influence.
a. President Goulart and his
opponents are keeping political ten-
sions in Brazil high.

e. US officials on the spot
doubt that the army, hobbled by poor
leadership and its many political
responsibilities, will be any more
effective in dealing with the prob-
lem this time than in past anti-
insurgency campaigns.
a. Sihanouk has signed an ac-
cord setting up regular air service
between Cambodia and Communist China.
A similar agreement with Hanoi is
in the works.
b. These lines are significant
largely as gestures by Peiping and
Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense
of importance. Neither would be a
paying proposition commercially and
both could flounder before the first
paying passenger enplanes unless
rights to overfly Laos can be obtained.

a. It looks more and more as
if Papandreou, who squeaked through
to a narrow upset victory over ex-
premier Karamanlis in the 3 November
elections, will not be able to form
a government.

USSR Simultaneous activity this morning on the
Tyuratam missile test range, satellite tracking nets
and Soviet space support ships in the Atlantic prob-
ably represented an attempt to launch an unmanned
earth satellite. The launch apparently failed on
the pad or was cancelled at the last moment. It
may be tried again soon. (INTERCEPTS)
Rumania-US Rumanian officials are about to award
a US firm, Ferguson and Company of Cleveland, Ohio,
a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati
steel plant. The Rumanians are pressing ahead with
this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis-
courage it in various ways, most importantly by re-
fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial
degree.
Turkey The New Turkey Party has followed the
Peasant Party in withdrawing from the present three-
party coalition government. This means that the
coalition has to all intents and purposes collapsed,
even though no formal action will be taken until
Prime Minister Inonu returns from Washington this
weekend.
Thailand The Thai doctors attending Sarit now ad-
mit for the first time that the Prime Minister is in
critical condition. Our doctor agrees with this
prognosis. US officials in Bangkok believe that the
most likely successor would be Thanom Kittikachorn,
now deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
Thanom is not likely to last long, however, since he
is neither a strong personality nor a figure of great
weight in the military hierarchy.

man states that everything was set, as we noted yes-
terday, for Sukarno to visit Manila today. This
official says, however, that the visit was postponed
as a result of Macapagal's decision to attend Presi-

Indonesia Djakarta is giving every indication that
it will hold up final action on the long-pending oil
contracts with US companies in an attempt to smoke
us out on the question of US aid policy toward Indo-
nesia.
Rwanda-Burundi Tribal refugees from Rwanda, now in
Burundi, seem bent on making trouble between the two
countries. Some 3,000 of their number were reported
yesterday to be moving toward the frontier. They

C. Communist documents seized

ask that the Council of the Organi-
zation of American States be con-
voked for consultation on the matter.

A. South Korea President-elect Pak Chong-hui's suc-
cess in winning control of the unicameral legisla-
ture in Tuesday's elections improves prospects for
smooth operation of the new constitutional govern-
ment. However, political stability will still de-
pend on Pak's willingness to rule with moderation.
If he interprets this victory as a popular mandate
to pursue an aggressive authoritarian program, he
could provoke serious unrest.

Prime Minister Sarit appears to have
taken a further turn for the worst. Our station
reported yesterday that he was flown by helicopter
to a Bangkok hospital from his seaside villa.
Police escorts described his condition as critical

Rwanda-Burundi - Prompt action by Burundi security
forces appears to have halted the march of tribal
refugees on Rwanda that we reported yesterday.

There is little doubt that the refugees, who carried NBR

Teng put the issue of
another meeting of world Communist
parties even deeper into limbo by
saying that Peiping would be in favor
only when assured of the support of
a majority of the world parties.
d. Moscow, for its part, has
apparently stopped thinking about
another gathering of world Communist
party representatives.
e. The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-
ban treaty were received coldly by
some of the fraternal parties. They
felt such a meeting could only make
matters worse with the Chinese.
f.
Indeed, Peiping saw this
to be Moscow's purpose, and when
the idea failed to take hold, the
Chinese took it to be a setback for
Khrushchev personally.
g. Their reaction to Khrush-
chev's subsequent call for a cessa-
tion of open argument was to press
the offensive, and this they have
been doing in roundly abusive terms
since.

Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV

Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,

The Betancourt government
has struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,
set up at US urging, passed this
initial test with flying colors.
d.
At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on. Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against
elections in major cities like Caracas.
e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circum-
stances. The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-
tion of the victor.
-
f. The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con-
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself.
g.. In the background, as
always, looms the military, which
could intervene if the president-
elect shows signs of being soft on
communism.

paramilitary forces in the villages.
They have been designed more for
their psychological impact than for
immediate military gain.
d. A high volume of messages
on Viet Cong military and political
communications nets indicates a prob-
able continuation of this effort.
e. The new government is re-
sponding by stepping up its own
military operations. It is also
setting about the hard job of re-
vamping the Diem government apparatus
and harnessing broader popular sup-
port for the war effort.

are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.
g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.
b.
The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis and failed to
get on the right side soon enough.

a. The death toll from the
terrorist outburst in Caracas last
Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at
about 30.
b. This is the high water mark
thus far in the campaign of the
Castro-supported Communist extremists
to disrupt the national elections a
week from tomorrow.

In the past week we inter-24
cepted Cuban military messages which 24
show that Cuban interpreters are now
posted at several surface-to-air mis-
sile (SAH) sites on the island.
b. We think this means that
on-site training of Cubans has begun
on schedule. Field training is to
mil Dio helites last six months, after which the
OCI

Castro.

d. Prior to their coming,
had detected no more than a few
hundred Soviet military personnel
entering Cuba since the October
crisis last year.
e. We estimate that at least
15,000, and probably closer to
18,000, have been withdrawn in the
intervening 13 months, leaving, very
roughly, 4,000 to 7,000. Those re-
maining are for the most part ad-
visors whose main functions are to
train and supervise Cubans in the
use of weapons turned over to them.

The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
Philippine counterparts. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.
d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

a. Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.
b. The Russians are now being
held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese
surete says the seized papers include,
among other things, minutes of a
"liberation committee" meeting of op-
position politicians in Brazzaville,
and a document showing Soviet pay-
ments to this group.

d. The coup group has not
thrown all Baathists out of the
government; there are party members
in the new cabinet.
e.
Syrian Baathists have wel-
comed this retention of their Iraqi
brothers. Their attitude springs
from the recognition that the Baath
in Syria cannot stay afloat without
support from Iraq. Even so, we hear
talk of coup plotting in Damascus.
f. The reaction of Nasir's
Egypt, which passionately desires
to see the Baath go under, has been
exactly the opposite. Cairo has been
backing off its all-out support for
the coup ever since the new cabinet
was announced.

d. This sort of harassment
stopped in the spring of 1962 when
Soviet leaders became convinced
that the US was interested in a
serious discussion of a Berlin settle-
ment. Moscow may hope that the
threat of more of this sort of har-
assment will jog the US into talks

a. It now appears that Presi-
dent Arif's role in last Monday's
coup in Baghdad may have been vir-
tually that of a bystander.
b. According to our latest in-
formation, Arif was wakened early
that morning and given five minutes
to join up. Tahir Yahya, now prime
minister, was reportedly the orga-
nizer.
c. Whatever Arif's role may
have been, the coup was primarily
an effort by the Iraqi Army to cur-
tail the activities of the extreme
wing of the Baath Party. The Baath
is an Arab nationalist political or-
ganization, active throughout the
Arab world, which has been ruling
Iraq and Syria.

a. We have had an indication
that Soviet harassment of Allied ac-
cess routes to West Berlin will shift
this weekend to the air corridors.
b. The Soviet man at the Ber-
lim air traffic control center told
the Allied representatives yesterday.
that Soviet transports would be using
the air corridors for brief flights
during the next five weekends.
C. Moscow has tried on a num-
ber of past occasions to assert its
right to restrict Allied use of the
air corridors. In early 1962, the
Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"
of air space for their own use. They
have since demanded that Western
flights stay between stipulated al-
titudes, that we file flight plans
in advance and provide prior notice
of border-crossing times.

a. North Vietnamese leaders
are pressing their campaign for neu-

b. They can count on Cambodia's
support. Prince Sihanouk has said
he believes neutralization of South
Vietnam to be the only way to keep
his country and the rest of the area
from falling eventually into Commu-
nist hands.
c. The French feel the same
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-
portedly told a closed session of
the Laotian National Assembly that
the French were urging him to sup-
port Hanoi in this.
=
d. Moreover, according to one
of our clandestine sources, the North
Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into
backing the neutralization proposi-
tion in the UN.
e. The troublesome Polish ICC
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who
will be going home soon), has just
returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and
is trying, with somewhat less suc-
cess, to enlist British support too.

a. Sihanouk knows his actions

b. He has intimated that aid

a. Haile Selassie is planning
to withdraw all Ethiopian troops
from the Congo in January, according
to the commander of his ground forces.
b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the
UN operation. They had been slated
to stay until June and are likely to
be very difficult to replace.
C. The Emperor reportedly.
ordered the withdrawal on grounds
that the troops are urgently needed
in Ethiopia, particularly in view
of the Soviet military accord with
Somalia.
d.
Our ambassador has asked
to see the Emperor, as well as the
prime minister and foreign minister,
to press for reconsideration.

e. Sihanouk's actions toward
the US have not been universally
popular. This is particularly true
among government officials, the bus-
iness community (who have reason to
fear stepped-up nationalization),
and the military, where the US re-
tains a considerable reservoir of
goodwill.
f. Indications are that Si-
hanouk will try to win fuller sup-
port by creating new feuds with
neighboring South Vietnam and Thai-
land. This is a gambit he has used
to advantage in past difficulties.
a.
A number of Yemeni leaders
have told us they want the Egyptians
to get out of the Yemen. They want

the greater the possibility of major
pro-government tribes deserting to
the royalists.

d. Nasir, with some 30,000
troops in the Yemen, has grudgingly
promised to pull out 5,000 before
the end of the year. So far there
has been no sign he is preparing to
do so.
So far as we can tell,
Faysal has kept to his promise not
to supply the Royalists before the
latest extension of the UN observa-
tion mission runs out on 4 January.
f. But he has made plain his
intention to resume supplying them
thereafter. There has been a sub-

a. Military activity has
slackened but the stalemate continues.
b.
Egypt still has about 32,000
troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown
Prince Faysal believes Nasir will
not withdraw any significant number
of them before 4 January when the
extension of the disengagement agree-
ment expires.
c. Faysal is preparing to re-

time; he is stockpiling quantities
of arms and ammunition along the
border.
(Includes INTERCEPTS)
a. The opposition Justice
Party, heir of the old Menderes re-
gime, appears to have won a victory
in Sunday's nationwide local elec-
tions on the basis of incomplete re-
turns.
b. The collapse of Prime Min-
ister Inonu's coalition government
appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-
ister.

1. South Vietnam
!
a.
Vietnamese Communist forces
kept up their high post-coup level
of activity over the weekend.
b. The most significant action
was an attack early yesterday morn-
ing against a US special forces train-
ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.
C. When the smoke cleared after
a sharp fight, four US soldiers were
missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese
were dead.
d. Late yesterday morning, the
Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-
porting a government operation in
the extreme south, and damaged twelve
more. Two more Americans are missing
in this action.
e. Back in Saigon, the new re-
gime's troubles with the ambitious
General Ton That Dinh continue.
f. He is still angling to get
control of the important strategic
hamlet program and has yet to give
up command of the Third Corps, which
the generals assigned to another of
their number earlier in the month.
This corps is of particular signifi-
cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

b. The Venezuelan Air Force

down and destroy intruder aircraft.
The Venezuelans are convinced that
planes have been ferrying supplies

Peiping has signed con-
tracts for just over one million tons of Australian
grain to be delivered early next year. We had been
expecting the Chinese Communists to enter the market,
since they had another mediocre grain crop this year.
Peiping has been buying close to five million tons
of grain for the past several years.
Congo We hear that the Soviet Embassy in Leopold-
ville had booked 75 places on a flight to Brussels
last Saturday. There is still no information on-

departed, however.
Berlin There was no new harassment of Allied ac-
cess routes to Berlin over the weekend. A total of
16 flares were fired last evening near Tempelhof
Airfield, but we connect these with Communist ef-

German police were observed stringing barbed wire
in the same area a short time later.
Laos
The neutralists claim to have made significant

However their party leaders do not
believe the Turkish military, which
Cousted Menderes in 1960, would per-

a.
The shaky new accommodation
between the two countries following
the recent coup in Iraq has been
threatened by Syria's action in grant-
ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the
exiled leader of the extremist wing
of the Iraqi Baath.
b.
Saadi had arrived in Syria
unannounced following a brief stay
in Madrid. On Friday, Iraq sent a
message asking Syria to expel him on
grounds that sheltering him was a
breach of agreement.
C. Both regimes continue to be
troubled with internal dissension
with affairs in one deeply tangled
with those in the other.
d. In Syria, as we mentioned
yesterday, the Baathist regime is
split between moderates who desire
a broadening of the government's
power base, and a doctrinaire faction
which wants to keep all control of
the government in Baathist hands.
e. In Iraq, the pull is more
away from the Baathists. Two minis-
ters have threatened to resign unless
the government adopts an openly pro-
Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the
government feels secure enough to
ease up on curfew and transport re-
strictions imposed since the coup.

a. Intercepted neutralist mes-

Vieng and its airfield, long held
by the Pathet Lao. They also told
of the capture of Ban Namone farther

a. According to press reports,
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped
out two of the government's strategic
hamlets in the central highlands about
250 miles north of Saigon.
b. More than 1,000 inhabitants
in the hamlets--who are minority
tribesmen--are missing and possibly
have fled into the mountains. They
abandoned a significant quantity of
weapons to the Viet Cong.
C. These attacks not only sug-
gest continued erosion of the govern-
ment's programs to win over tribal
support, but also signal that stepped-
up Viet Cong pressure against the new
regimé is spreading to the north.

d. This Communist effort is
aimed at discrediting the post-Diem
regime before the new leadership is
able to get its feet on the ground
and capture the loyalty and respect
of people in the provinces.
e. Although the Viet Cong still
continues to draw its main strength
from local recruiting, a steady stream
of cadre and training personnel con-
tinues to make its way to the south
from North Vietnam along the Laotian
border.
f. We are now reasonably sure
that at least 784 persons infiltrated
from the north during 1963 and the
actual total may be much higher.

by now an announcement closing an area

d. As one example Raneiri
Mazzilli, President of the Chamber
of Deputies and next in line for the
presidency, told Ambassador Gordon
on Saturday that he profoundly mis-
trusts Goulart's intentions and in-
tends to maintain the strictest con-
gressional vigilance.
e. Our station in Brazil be-
lieves that Goulart is living in a
dream world. He seems either out
of touch with reality or very poorly
informed. Public opinion is not
with him and the tradition that po-
litical power should only be trans-
ferred constitutionally is very
strong in the army, coup reports
notwithstanding.
f. The biggest danger from
this quarter is that the opposition
may resort to some illegal act, giv-
ing Goulart the excuse to take over.

C. The Soviet note was designed
to make a record, showing that the
USSR exercises "control" of the auto-
bahn and that the recent incidents
resulted from US refusal to comply
with "existing procedures."
d. On the other hand, the Soviet
procedures described in the oral re-
plies seem to reflect actual Allied
practices, though there is enough
ambiguity to afford the USSR flexi-
bility in any future actions.
a. The danger of an immediate
coup against the Goulart regime has
receded with the reported decision
of Second Army Commander General
Bevilaqua not to join the coup plot-
ters.
b. Bevilaqua, who has been some-
thing of a storm center, may have
been asked to hand over his command
today as part of a series of reassign
ments made by President Goulart to
keep the military off balance.
C. On the other side of the
coin, there is widespread belief
that Goulart himself will at some
time resort to a coup to establish
an authoritarian regime.

Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over
Cuba crashed while returning,about 40 miles north
of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to
the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened
parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash
area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no in-
dication that the plane was attacked.
Berlin Local East German troops acting without
higher authority appear to have been responsible
for turning high powered searchlights on pilots tak-
ing off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on
14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A
message of 16 November instructed border guard ele-

further incidents reported since.

○ C. Now the Peasant Party, one
of the three in the coalition, has
voted to pull out, and probably will
do so as soon as Inonu gets back from
Washington. Another partner, the
Turkey Party, has wanted to pull out,
and apparently has stayed in only
because of pressure from the military.
d. A new coalition is at least
a theoretical possibility, with a
number of independents taking the
place of the Peasant Party, but
Inonu probably would not be prime
minister.
e. The military are working
for an all-party coalition. This
way, they feel, they could keep
tabs on the Justice Party, but the
Justice Party is not likely to buy
this arrangement.
f. As matters now stand, the
military would takė over the govern-
ment itself before it would let the
Justice Party form one.
a. Soviet President Brezhnev
has told the Iranian prime minister
that the decision to buy wheat abroad
was taken to avoid lowering reserves,
which he has described as ample for
one or two years. We think the sit-
uation is more serious than that.

a. Czech President and party
boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,
evidently for economic talks, judg-
ing by the composition of his dele-
gation.
b. Novotny's background of
Stalinist excesses have put him on
the wrong side of Khrushchev. They
also have given rise to control
problems, particularly in the frac-
tious Slovak party where pressures
for liberalization have made their
mark.
C. Party problems and Novotny's
leadership may thus also come under
review.
d. A curious sign of the times
is the fact that, although President
Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential
flag has remained up at the official
residence. It might simply have been
an oversight, but the symbolism will
not be lost to the people in Prague.
a. Cambodia, as expected, has
asked the Geneva co-chairman to call
the Geneva conference participants
together (in Djakarta) to discuss
measures "to ensure the internation-
ally guaranteed and controlled neu-
tralization of Cambodia."

Peiping last week con-

This adds to the 1,000,000
tons just contracted for with Aus-
tralia, but is still far below.
the 5,000,000 tons the Chinese have
normally imported in recent years.
Additional suppliers will be hard
to find.
c. A large sale, apparently
involving some $56,000,000 worth
of meat, is apparently also being
arranged. This is interesting,
not only for the sizeable foreign
exchange outlay, but also for the
concern it shows for improving the
diet of the mainland's urban pop-
ulation.
d. The same caloric value
could be obtained from grains at
a fraction of this cost.

b. This year's harvest was
clearly very bad. The weight of
evidence suggests that Soviet grain
stockpiles have been far drawn down
this year and are not sufficient to
protect the country from another
poor harvest.
C. Our estimate is that total
grain production each year since
1958 has been well below that year's
level of 125 million tons, while
the population has continued to grow.
d.
We have seen from intercepts
signs of extensive slaughtering in
anticipation of fodder shortages
during the winter. This runs counter
to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to
build up the livestock industry.
e. We have also noted that
the extensive wheat purchases weaken
the USSR's gold reserves at a time
when it hopes to expand its imports
of machinery for a huge chemical
fertilizer program.
f. In addition, we have seen
signs of stringent measures to pro-
tect the grain supply, accompanied
by public discontent in some areas
over the absence of bread.
