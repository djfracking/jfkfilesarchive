RACIAL MATTER HAWAII
On November 23, 1964, William File, 634 East Boulder
Street, Colorado Springs, Colorado, advised that his daughter
Irene had been arrested approximately three months ago in Pueblo,
Colorado, on a charge of robbing a filling station. He reported
his daughter had been placed in the custody of her parents until
such time as there is an additional hearing in the matter.
:
While Irene was in the Pueblo County Jail she started
receiving letters from Brown, a person whom she has never
personally met. File pointed out Irene's picture had appeared
in newspapers after her arrest, and it is possible Brown may
have gotten her name and address from a newspaper article.
File made available a copy of a letter of November 9,
1964, addressed to his daughter. He advised she is not aware
of the fact he had made such a copy. The letter is quoted as
follows:
"Dear Irene,
"Nov. 9, 1964
"Looks like my boy Barry sure took a shellacking, doesn't
it? I lost $115 on that clown. Next time I'll back
Robert Shelton (Grand Imperial Wizard of the KKK) or
somebody I can get better odds on. As long as I'm
going to lose I'd like better than 4 to 1 odds like I
got on Goldwater.
"Commander George Lincoln Rockwell (head of the American
Nazi Party) spoke here last week at the university.
He
was fabulous! If he's ever in Colorado speaking be sure
to hear him. My little band of extremists and I had
dinner with him and decided to cast our lot with his
movement--the guy really knows some things. Like did you

RE: MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN
On January 3, 1965, Mrs. R. S. Lowrey, 1920 Awapuhi
Street, Honolulu, advised as follows:
>
Mrs. S. H. Snodgrass, a woman in her early 60's, has
resided next door at 1926 Awapuhi for at least 12 years. Mrs.
Lowrey stated she has no idea of Mrs. Snodgrass' background and
does not know if she is a divorcee or widow. She related that
Mrs. Snodgrass lives a quiet life, has a substantial home, and
enjoys a good reputation in the community. She related that
Mrs. Snodgrass has a divorced daughter, Mrs. Brown, who is a
local school teacher. Mrs. Brown formerly lived on Cahu Avenue
and her two children, Mike and Leilani, have occasionally
stayed with the grandmother. Mrs. Lowrey stated she believes
Leilani Brown is presently in school in England.
Mike Brown,
about 20 years of age, has recently returned to Honolulu to
live with his grandmother. He has been in one of the branches
of the armed services for some three years and is now attending
the University of Hawaii. Mrs. Lowrey stated Mrs. Snodgrass had
expressed relief that her grandson had enrolled at the university,
explaining that when he had graduated from high school he had
not wanted to go on with his, schooling.
•
On January 13, 1965, HN T-1 advised as follows:
Dr. Dorothy Brown has taught in the English Department
of the University of Hawaii at Honolulu for at least 13 years.
She is presently Assistant Professor at the university and
resides in the Kalia Apartments. Mrs. Brown is a divorcee and
has two children, Mike, aged 22, and Leilani, about 17.
During the early 1950's Dorothy Brown resided on
campus with her two children. Mike was a large boy for his
age and his mother found him a difficult problem as far as
discipline was concerned. When he was some 14 years of age
he was caught burglarizing the ROTC Armory on the campus. The
following year he was sent to Arkansas to live with his maternal
grandfather and finish high school there. Mrs. Brown has
related in the past that Mike is fond of guns and has been a
disciplinary problem and also experienced some trouble in the
Mike returned to Honolulu before the fall semester of
1964 and enrolled at the University of Hawaii as a freshman
intending to major in political science. In late October 1964

views including George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the American
Nazi Party, a characterization of which is appended hereto.

Mrs. Brown, after the political symposium, had stated
that many of the immature students at the university had been
very impressed with Rockwell's speech.
source On January 11, 1965, Mrs Beatrice Shinoda, Office
of the Dean of Student Personnel, University of Hawaii, Honolulu,
reported that university files reveal Mike H. Brown, born
September 11, 1942, Montgomery, Alabama, is presently enrolled
at the university as a freshman. University records indicate
he was graduated from Fountain Lake High School, Hot Springs,
Arkansas.
A check of the records of the Honolulu Police
Department under File Numbers G83259, G82369 and G82301, reflected
that Michael Halsey Brown, born September 11, 1942, Montgomery,
Alabama, was arrested on April 25, 1957, for burglary and
released that date to Juvenile Crime Prevention. Those files
reflect Brown, then a resident of 2648B Rock Road, was a 14-year-
old juvenile attending St. Louis High School. He had been
arrested along with Robert Vincent Fletcher of 1839 Keller
Road who was 13 years old and attending the university High
School. Police files reflect that on about April 13 or 14
1957, forced entry had been made into the university snack bar.
Cones, icecream, coin wrappers, and possibly coins were taken.
On the same date the RCTC Armory and Supply Room were entered¨¨
through a forced entry. Apparently nothing was taken from the
Supply Room but two .22 rifles valued at $60. were taken from
the Armory. The rifles were found before police were notified -
one on the rifle range and one in the ROTC garage: On
April 20 - 22, 1957, the ROTC Supply Room was again entered.
Fletcher and Brown, when questioned by the police, admitted
the above burglaries and the fact they had taken some $6.95
in cash, $5 in school supplies and $10 worth of RCTC equipment.
They also admitted entering a campus service station by taking
screws off door hinges on April 14, 1957, and taking some $5 in
tools.
Police File under 'Number K40001 notes a notice of
AWOL of Michael Halsey Brown, Army Serial Number RA25434640,
Social Security Number 576-40-3264. The notice reflects that
Brown was AWOL on August 6, 1962, from Company E, First ABG,
501st Infantry, Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The AWOL notice
listed Brown's father as Robert Arthur Sylvester Brown,
whereabouts unknown; mother as Dorothy Snodgrass Brown, 2865 Oahu
Avenue, Honolulu.

APPENDIX
RE:
MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN
:
1
AMERICAN NAZI PARTY OF THE WORLD UNION
OF FREE ENTERPRISE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS,
ALSO KNOWN AS THE GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL PARTY
In his book, This Time The World, copyrighted in 1961,
George Lincoln Rockwell identified himself as Commander, American
Nazi Party of the World Union of Free Enterprise National
Socialists (ANP - WUFENS), Arlington, Virginia.
The April 4, 1963 issue of "The Richmond News Leader,
a Richmond, Virginia daily newspaper, reported that George
Lincoln Rockwell had, on the previous day, again applied for
the American Nazi Party to be chartered in the State of
Virginia, but this request was turned down by the Virginia
State Corporation Commission. This action was taken pursuant
to an act of the 1932 Virginia Assembly which prohibits use of
"Nazi" or "National Socialism" in a Virginia charter. This
article further pointed out that Rockwell's party is presently
chartered in the State of Virginia as the George Lincoln
Rockwell Party.
On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the ANP
WUFENS was organized by George Lincoln Rockwell at his
residence in Arlington, Virginia, on February 26, 1959, as an
international "National Socialist" movement based on the German
Nazi Party headed by Adolf Hitler. He added that Rockwell is
the dominant force and personality in this party; that he is
espousing a "line" of hatred against the Jews and Negroes;
and that he is seeking, through speeches, distribution of
literature and picketing, to establish a cohesive and dominant
political party in the United States and in foreign countries.
According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual," an official
publication of the ANP, the phases of ANP struggle for power
are fourfold, namely, first "to make ourselves known to the
masses;" second "the dissemination of our program and the
truth about the Party;" third "organizing the people who have
been converted to our propaganda; t and fourth "the attainment
of power through the votes of the newly-won masses."
"
On February 17, 1964, Harl Rogers Allen, Jr., former
Deputy National Commander of the ANP, advised that George
Lincoln Rockwell believes he has completed the first two phases
in his struggle for power and is now well into the third phase.
Allen said, however, in his opinion, Rockwell has only completed
phase one.

DE T-l advised on April 27, 1973 that LONNIE
DARDEN, Detroit BPP Minister of Information, received a
telephone call in late April, 1973, from BOBBY SEALE in
California. SEALE reportedly told DARDEN that the Detroit
BPP Chapter has the least number of actively involved
members of all BPP Chapters throughout the country.
SEALE also complained that the Detroit Chapter is operating
only two survival programs (the Free Breakfast Program and
the Free Busing to Prison Program) and warned DARDEN that
the Detroit Chapter will have to take steps to initiate a
substantial number of survival programs to serve the
Detroit Black community as it deserves to be served.
II.
MEMBERSHIP
A. Requirements for Membership
The BPP is constantly attempting to recruit
community workers from the black community to help in
the operation of the BPP programs. Outsiders, however,
are not trusted by established Party members and community
workers are not allowed inside the Party Office or pad.
They are required to sell BPP newspapers and to perform
various other duties "in the field".

I. ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE
OF THE DETROIT BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)
The Black Panther Party (BPP) is a black
extremist organization started in Oakland,
California, in December, 1966. It for-
merly advocated the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics to bring about the overthrow of the
United States Gaernment. Since early 1971,
it has preached a policy of "survival
pending revolution".
A. Goals, Guidelines and Objectives
The goals and objectives of the Detroit Chapter
of the BPP remain in accord with those specified by BPP
National Headquarters in Oakland, California. The Party
advocates a non-violent philosophy of education of the
black community to the "evils of the oppression and
suppression of the poor by a racially oriented society.
The Party has put aside the gun and no longer advocates
the use of guerrilla tactics to change the political
system. An additional goal of the Party is to change
the community image of the Panthers as "thugs dressed
in black".
DE T-1
April 27, 1973
It is against the laws of the BPP for members
to carry guns or to use hard drugs.
DE T-2
}
November 8, 1972
BPP members must dedicate their entire energies
to the furtherance of the programs and philosophies of
the Party and all personal desires must assume a secondary
role.

In a February 2, 1973, article entitled "Black
Panthers Seek to Expand Survival Service", which appeared
in the "Michigan Chronicle" a weekly black oriented
Detroit newspaper, LEONARD MONGO, a BPP member, was
quoted as saying, "Our goal is not recognition but
service to the people". The article further quoted
MONGO as saying, "Much of our image in the past was
created by an unfriendly press. Our goal continues
to be survival of the people. The people themselves
will determine the approaches to be used in the meantime.
The Black Panther Party makes itself available for
guidance and assistance. Our survival services are
essential to the daily existence of the people."

Location of Detroit BPP Offices
The BPP Office on Detroit's east side located
at 2228 Bewick, closed down at the end of December, 1972.
This site was the location of the BPP Free Breakfast
Program. The only office now in operation is the
Ministry of Information Office located at 157 Collingwood
on Detroit's west side.

The BPP Ministry of Information Office on
Collingwood was closed down on February 28, 1973 and the
Party relocated its members to 2228 Bewick, the former
site of the Party's east side office. The 2228 Bewick
address is a temporary location.

There are also approximately six community workers
who are young high school age blacks who are interested in
the BPP and help sell BPP newspapers and solicit donations
to the Party. They hold no official Party status and their
interest in the Party's work vacillates and their work is
irregular and inconsistent.
DE T-2
April 4, 1973
The fact that four Detroit Party members are
presently in California, the fact that so many Detroit
Party members work for the Party on a very limited basis
and the wavering interest of the community workers has
severely hurt the BPP's success in the last six months
in Detroit.

Survival Day refers to a program
implemented by the BPP with purpose
of giving away bags of groceries to
oppressed families living in the inner

Political Education classes are no longer held
on a regular basis. The classes are held occasionally
during the week as the Party feels it is more beneficial
to personally come into contact with members of the black
community on a one-to-one basis. For this reason, Party
members solicit donations and sell BPP newspapers door to
door and attempt to "rap" with the people concerning the
BPP, its aims and programs.

An article which appeared in the February 17,
1973, edition of the "Michigan Chronicle" entitled
"Panthers Appeal for Support of Prison Busing Program"
quoted ROLLIN REID, a BPP member as saying "The Community
should do more to support the program. Basically we
cannot get more community support because of the old
BPP image of leather coats and guns. People think we
are thugs."
An article which appeared in the February 27,
1973, edition of the "Detroit News", a daily Detroit
newspaper, entitled "Panthers Appeal for Bus Funds"
quoted LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader as saying that what
the Panthers are seeking is "a good used vehicle"
which would cost them around $2,500.00. DARDEN stated
that commercial rental costs are too high and that the
BPP funds would not allow the Party to purchase a used
bus even if one were to be found. DARDEN stated that
the Party funds at the present time for the purchase
of a used bus stand at zero.
An article which appeared in the April 20, 1973,
edition of the "Detroit News" entitled "Panthers Add Trips
to Prison Program" stated that the Panthers are appealing
to Churches and other civic groups for the loan of vans
or busses for their busing to prison services and have
been successful in receiving aid from the Burnette Baptist
Church in Detroit which has offered to make their vans
available.
B.
The BPP Free Breakfast and Lunch Programs
The Free Breakfast Program provides free hot
breakfasts for school children in the black community
from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. on each school day. The Free
Lunch Program is an alternate program which is run during
the summer months when schools are closed and provides
a free lunch to children who live in the vicinity of the
BPP Office. The Free Lunch Program was suspended in
September, 1972 and will be reinstituted in June, 1973.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES
A. Weapons and Fortifications
On March 12, 1973, DE T-1 advised that the BPP
Headquarters, Ministry of Information Office, 157
Collingwood, Detroit, had been closed down and that the
Party members had moved out temporarily and relocated
their office at 2228 Bewick, Detroit.
On March 12, 1973, ORELL BENJAMIN, 18580
Dequindre, Detrit, owner of the residence located at
157 Collingwood, Detroit, advised that the BPP had
vacated the residence recently and relocated their
members to a different office. BENJAMIN stated that
the FBI was free to enter the premises if they so desired.
On March 13, 1973, a search of the residence
located at 157 Collingwood, Detroit, was conducted by
Special Agents of the FBI. Results of the search are
set out below as well as descriptions of rooms and floor
space.
The residence of 157 Collingwood, Detroit, is a
two story dwelling with a basement and attic space. The
BPP Office space at 157 Collingwood comprised one side of
a two family duplex type dwelling. The Party occupied
one half of the entire dwelling.
The first floor consists of a living room, dining
room, kitchen and pantry. Steps off the kitchen lead down
to the basement. Four bedrooms and a bathroom are located
on the second floor. Steps lead upstairs to an attic area.

Sources further advised that the sandbox and
iron mesh grates for fortification also date back to the
"old days" of the Party when the Party was "at war" with
the establishment and in constant fear of being raided
by law enforcement agencies.
On May 1, 1973, DE T-3 provided the following

Physical observation of the interior of the
residence revealed that all furniture had been removed
and that the house was not habitable.
No pertinent BPP literature of any kind was
observed in any rooms of the house.
The windows of the living room which face the
north front entrance to the dwelling were painted black.
Built in wooden boxes beneath these three windows were
filled with sand. Two other windows facing east were
boarded up. The front north windows in the attic space
were covered with a heavy iron grate and draped with
blankets.
The north and south basement brick walls were
pocked with large holes which penetrated deep into the
brick and masonry work.
Also observed stored in the basement was a
four foot by eight foot sheet of three-quarter inch
plywood covered with a heavy gauge metal grate.
On March 20, 1973, DE T-1 and DE T-2 advised
that KENNETH BERNARD HORSTON, former BPP Minister of
Information and various other EPP members selected by
HORSTON had on occasion taken target practice in the
basement of BPP Office at 157 Collingwood. Above
sources stated, however, that it has been over one year
since Party members fired or possessed weapons. Sources
stated that LONNIE DARDEN, the present BPP Minister of
Information, in view of the BPP's new philosophy of non-
vidence, has prohibited the use and possession of weapons
by Party members. Sources advised that no weapons are
currently maintained by any Party members.

and has no affiliation with other extremist groups. BPP
members do not officially come into contact or associate
with members of other militant organizations.
DE T-1
February 14, 1973
DE T-1, DE T-2, DE T-9 and DE T-10 all advised in
January, 1973, that the BPP faction headed by HUEY P. NEWTON
remains diametrically opposed to the BPP faction headed by
ELDRIDGE CLEAVER.
HUEY P. NEWTON is the leader of
the BPP-Newton Faction (NF) headquartered
in Oakland, California.
ELDRIDGE CLEAVER is a leader in the
BPP and early in 1971 was expelled from
that organization and those members of the
BPP who continue to support him and advocate
the use of guns and guerrilla tactics became
known as the BPP-Cleaver Faction (CF).

On December 20, 1972, LONNIE DARDEN, BPP-NF
leader at Detroit, was interviewed under suitable pretext
by a Special Agent of the FBI and DARDEN made the following
statement regarding ELDRIDGE CLEAVER:
"Eldridge Cleaver will not be allowed back
in the BPP. We're (BPP-NF) not saying that
there is a peaceful co-existence that will
exist between the BPP and Eldridge Cleaver.
We're saying that the court systems are
responsible for the execution of poor and
oppressed people and we in turn are exposing
the court system in this particular racist
attitude against poor and oppressed people
and not trying to build a peaceful co-existence
with a particular element that had defected
from the Party.'
"
VII. BPP FUNDS

MISCELLANEOUS
In a December 21, 1972 edition of the "Detroit
Free Press", a Detroit daily newspaper, an article appeared
entitled "Black Panthers Charge Police with Harassment”.
LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader, charged the Detroit Police
Department with harassing Panthers while they were selling
the Party newspaper at the corner of State and Woodward
in Detroit. DARDEN charged that Party members had been
ticketed more than 25 times in the past year for loitering
and interfering with pedestrian traffic. DARDEN went on
to state that members of the Party are being harassed
because they are black. DARDEN stated that the police
are attempting to stop the selling of the Party newspaper
because the BPP is involved in various programs to
serve the people of the community.
DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973, that the BPP's
lease on 2228 Bewick expires on September 15, 1973, and
that the Panthers must vacate the premises on or before
that date. Source further advised that LONNIE DARDEN
is currently seeking suitable office space for the Party's
headquarters.

LONNIE DARDEN said the situation at BPP headquarters
in Oakland, California, is very tense with all of the members
carrying guns on their person at all times. Everyone is
jockeying for the number two position. No one trusts anyone
else. Confusion, competition, contention, and bad feelings
mark the mood of the office. They all seem to be out to get
each other. DARDEN seemed to be making these statements
out of personal observation when he was in California.

F. Philosophy of the BPP
and
In explaining the new Panther image, GERALD
CRAWFORD stated, "For too long the Panther Party has found
itself in the role of defender, rather than educator of
the community. We feel the Party should be a vehicle to
take the community to liberation and not the force which
consistently finds itself in conflict with the Police.
We are now moving toward the role of humanitarians,
our goal is humanization of all mankind. We would like
to remove all racial and class barriers. Our struggle is
more a class struggle rather than a racial one, and
our role is to educate the community to that fact.
are not trying to teach individuals what to think, but
instead, we are trying to teach them to think for
themselves and objectively analyze the situation we find
ourselves in.
We
"Ironically, those people who can best perform
this service turn their backs on the community and help
those forces which are oppressing all of us. College
students today do not bring their talents back to the
community, but help to build the system which they have
suffered under. In order for us to successfully perform
our duty, we need the support of the community. The
Panthers are a part of the community and need its entire
support. Without this support, we will be unable to
continue our fight against oppression.
"For the past ten years, the Black Panther Party
has found itself on the covers of national magazines and
in newspapers. Reporters have described Panther members
as Communists and revolutionaries: But for several reasons
this description is not applicable to today's Black Panther
Party. In the past two years, the Panther Party has .
undergone drastic changes. Black Panther members have tried
to drop the role of guerilla fighters and are putting every
effort into being known as educators and humanitarians.
"The Party's Detroit Chapter is trying extremely
hard to change its image from community bodyguard to community
servant.

"BLACK PANTHER PARTY
INFORMATION CONCERNING
'
Information was received from Inspector Francis
Johnson, Alexandria, Virginia Police Department on February
27, 1969 to the effect that an unknown source of information
to the Alexandria, Virginia Police Department had recently
been approached by persons, which that source described as
Black Panther members, had requested the floor plans for
Hunter's Haven, also known as. Potomac Arms located at
Prince Street, Alexandria, Virginia.
¬tha
COULD IDENTIFY
SOURCE OF
OTHER LAW
This company conducts ENFORCEMENT
business in the sale of firearms and ammunition.
The Alexandria, Virginia Police Department estab-
lished appropriate surveillance at this company, and an un-
known person was seen to cut through the cyclone fence ap-
proximately 7:30 P.M. on March 1, 1969, and thereafter crawl
under the building. An attempt was made by this individual
to saw a hole through the floor of the building, but the
would-be burglar was hampered in his sawing operation by guns
and cases, which obstructed his sawing as well as the cold.
and water under the building. He was seen to depart through
the hole in the fence, which he then temporarily repaired.
He was not successful in gaining access to the building nor
in obtaining any weapons. No arrests were made, hoping that
accomplices would also be involved.
Inspector Johnson advised on March 3 and March 10,
1969 that the police have a "monitoring device" at the build-
ing, which will alert them at the police headquarters to any
unusual noises after working hours, inasmuch as they have
withdrawn their surveillance team. He stated that the source
of information is not a member of the Black Panthers, but
that the source continues to describe the burglars as such.
A characterization of the Black Panther Party is
attached hereto.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and
Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton is presently
serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man- ·
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police
officer.
The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently re-
ferred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.
"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,
contains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George
Mason Murray, which ends with the following:
"
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everywhere. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the
pigs everywhere."
Included in the introduction to an article appear-
ing in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther"
is the statement,
we will not dissent from American
Government. We will overthrow it.
11
1:
Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'
[1
The national headquarters of the BPP is located
at 3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have
been established at various locations throughout the United
States.

This matter is being pursued intensively by
the Detroit Office and contact is maintained on a daily
· basis with the Intelligence Unit of the Michigan State
Police and the Special Investigations Bureau of the
Detroit Police Department, both having direct interest in
local black nationalist activities and conduct surveillances
in regard to key black nationalist figures in the Detroit
area. Racial informants, who are familiar with the black
nationalist activity in the Detroit area, are contacted often
in regard to an organized BPP in the Detroit area. Contact
with the above sources has revealed that no organized BPP
has been established in the Detroit area wherein the BPP is
holding regular scheduled meetings.
In the event any information is received to show
that a BPP is organized and meeting at a regularly scheduled
time, the Bureau and other appropriate offices will be
properly advised.

THE CATECHISM OF THE REVOLUTIONIST
BY Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin
with Introduction by Minister of
Information Black Panther Farty
The Catechism of the Revolutionist, by Mikhail Alexandrovich
Bakunin, is one of the most important formulation of principles in the
entire history of revolution. A contemporary of Merx, Bakunin was the
epitome of the activist and his deeds spoke louder than his words. But
his words, are what history has allowed to endure, Bakunin's message.
The history of revolutionary' movements all over the world attest to the
fact that Bakunin's message must. be unearthed and scrutinized by a new
generation faced with a new tyranny. In the midst of all this Evil and
human suffering there is too much co-existence going on. Peach sechers
co-existing with War Mongers. Communists co-existing-with Caritelist.
Slavee co-existing with Slave Masters. Black nationalists co-existing
with Inti-Aro-American hordes.
It's time to intensify the struggle. Within the black colony of
Afro-America, this means a declaration of war upon the black bourgooinio
and upon the class of Big Business Men who have turned thNational
Liberation Struggle into Big Business. Those Civil Rights Executives
must be allowed one choice and one choice only: return to your people,
bringing with you your wealth and skills, and put it as the disposal of
your people's cause. You have nothing that la sacred--not even your..
life,
Intesifying the Struggle means, at this stage within the white
mother country, arising from the sleep of tradition and making some new
definitions. Some new distinctions. Within the ranks of the white mot-
her country radicals, the new generation must part company with the old
at the very least. Preferably, the new generation should take hold of
the old and bond then or break them. There is nothing left for them to
prove. They must be demoted to advisory and technical positions.
Pressure on them must be stepped up to the maximum and kept there,
Stop at nothing.
Compared to the job that Afro-American Revolutionarios and white
mother country relicals have on their hands, all revolutions and national
Eiberation struggles of the past have been childs play. What must be
kept clear in that white mother country radicals are fighting for a reve
olution--while Afro-American revolutionaries are fighting for national
libsration against a common enemy: White Racist Capitalism and its
bastard offsprings, Colonialism, Imperialism, and Neo-Colonialism,
Read the Catechion. Perhaps you will find a word or phrase that
will enhance your revolutionary perspective and intensify your cativity,
At the very lecat you have to appreciate Palminin's spirit. "If you got
Bakunin's message, then the whole world will have moved a little olon
to the Jutrire,

The Relations of the Revolutionists Toward His Conrades in the Cause
8.
A revolutionist may feed friendship or attachment only for those
who have proven themselves by their actions to be revolutionists like
'himself. The measure of friendship, devotion, and other obligations
towards such a comrade is determined solely by the degree of his use-
fulness to the cause of the alldestructive revolution.
.9. Solidarity of the revolutionists goes without saying. The whole
strength of the revolutionary cause is based on it. The fellow revol-
utionists who stand in the same plane of revolutionary understanding
and ardor must, as far as possible, discuss all important matters jointly
and decide them unanimously. In the execution of a plan thus decided
upon, however, everyone must, as far as possible, count upon himself.
In carrying out acts of destruction each one must act alone and resort
to the counsel and aid of comrades only when this is necessary for
success 2
10. Each comrade must have at hand several revolutionists of the second
and third degree, i.e. such as are not entirely initiated. He must con
sider them a part of the common revolutionary capital placed at his dis-
posal. He must spend his portion of the capital economically, always
striving to extract the greatest possible.use from it. He is to consides)
himself as capital, fated to be spent for the triumph of the revolution-
ary cause; however, he has no right personally and alone to dispose of
that capital without the consent of the aggregate of the fully initiated.
11. When a comrade comes to grief, in deciding the question whether or
not to save him, the revolutionists must take into consideration not his
personal feelings, but solely the interests of the revolutionary cause.
Therefore, he must weigh on the work contributed by the comrade, and on
the other, the expenditure of revolutionery forces necessary to rescue.
him, and he is to decide according to which side.
The Revolutionist's Relations with Society
12.
The admission into the organization of a new member, who has proved
himself not in words but in deeds, can be effected only by unanimous
¨agreement.
13. The revolutionist enters the world of the State and of the educated
privilege classes and lives in it only for the purpose of its fullest
and quickest destruction. He is not a revolutionist if he is attached
to anything in this world, if he can stop before the annihilation of
any situation, relation, or person belonging to this class or world--
everything and everybody must be equally hateful to hin. All the worse
to him if he has any relations of kinship, friendship, or love; ho is
not a revolutionist if they can stop his hand.
14.
For the purpose of ruthless destruction, the revolutionist may era
frequently must live in society, pretending to be something entirely
different from what he is. The revolutionist must ponstrate everywhere
into all the higher and middle classes, the merchant's 'store, the church
the nobleman's home, the bureaucratic world and military circles, into
literature, into the Third Department (Secret Police), and even into

"
Only through an all-destroying popular revolution and the Association
will by all means and all its power further the developement and exten.
sion of those evils and those calamities which cust at lost exhaust the
patience of the people and drive them to a general uprising.
23... By Revolution the Association does not understand a regulated
movement after the classical Western model. A movement which always
bowing to the property rights and the traditions of the social systems
of so-called civilization and morality; has until now limited itself
everywhere to the overthrow of one political form in order to replace it
by another and striven to create a so-called revolutionery state. Only
that revolution will be beneficial to the people which will destroy at
the very root every vestige of statehood and will annihilate all of this
country's old traditions, institutions, and classes.
24.
The Association therefore does not intend to force on the people
any organization from above. The future organization will no doubt evol-
ye out of popular movement and out of life itself. But this is the bus-
iness of future generations. Our business in destruction, terrible,
complete, universal, and merciless.
25. Therefore, in getting closer to the people, we must first of all
join those elements of the masses, which, since the foundation of the
U.S. powers, have never ceased to protest, not in words alone but in-
Qeeds as well, against everything which is directly or indirectly con-
nected with the State: against nobility, the bureaucracy, the clergy,
the guilds (meaning the merchants and capitalist in general) and against
the parasitie kulak. Let us join hands with the cold and bold hands
and world of the bandits--the only genuine revolutionist in the U.S.
26.' To consolidate this world into one invincible, all-destroying
force is the sole subject of our organization; this is our conspiracy;
our task.

THE CATECHISM OF THE FEVOLUTIONIST
The Revolutionist's Attitude Toward Himself
The revolutionist is a doomed man, He has no personal interests,
ffairs, sentiments, attachments, property, not even a name of his
Everything in him is absorbed by one exclusive interest, ont tho-
one passion the revolution.
In the very dept of his being, not merely in word but in deed, he
broken every. connection with the social order and with the whole
þated world, with all the laws, appearances, and generally accepted
Fentions and moralities of that world which he considers his ruthless
Should he continue to live in it, it will be solely for the pur-
> of destroying in more surely.
The revolutionist despises every sort of doctrinairism and has re- ·
ced the peaceful scientific pursuits, leaving them to future generation
bns. He knows only one science, the science of destruction.
For this
only this purpose he makes a study of mechanics, physics, chemistry
possibly medicine. For this purpose he studies day and night the
ing science of human beings, their characters, situation, and all
conditions of the present social system in its various strats. The
oct is but one The quickess possible destruction of that ignoble
tem.
He despises public opinion. He despises and hates the present day
o of morals with all its motivations and manifestation..
To him,
tever side the triumph of the revolution is ethical; all that which
ders it is unethical and criminal.
The revolutionist is a doomed man, He is merciless toward the State
I toward the entire system of privileged educated classes; ho need in
nexpect no mercy from then. Between him and them there is continuous
1 irreconcilable war to the bitter end, whether it be waged openly cr
retly. He must be ready to die at any moment. He must train himself
stanâ torture.
Rigorous towards himself, he must also be severe with others. All
ider, softening sentiments of kinship, friendship, love, gratitude, and
en honor itself must be snuffed out in him by the one cold passion of
> revolutionary cause. For him there is only one satisfaction, con-
lation, and delight the success of the revolution. Day and night wo
st have one thought, one ain--inexorable destruction. Striving coldly
I unfairly towards this aim, he must be ready to perish himself and to
stroy with his own hands everything that hinders its realization.
-
The nature of a real revolutionist precludes every bit of sentimen-
lity; romanticism, or infatuation and exaltation. It precludes even
rsonal hatred and revenge. Revolutionary passion having become a non.
1 phenomenon, it must be combined with cold calculation. At all times
d places the revolutionist must not be that towards which he is impoll-
by personal impulses, but that which the general interests of the

Y
draw up a list of persons thus condemned in the order of their relative
harmfulness to the success of the cause so that the preceding numbers
may be removed before the subsequent ones.
16. In making up such lists and for the purpose of establishing the
above mentioned order, one should by no means be guided by the personal
villainy of the individual, nor even by the hatred of which he calls
forth in the association or among the people. This villainy and this
hatred may even by party useful by helping to arouse the masses of the
revolt. It is necessary to be guided by the measure of usefulness which
would result from his death, to the revolutionary cause. Thus, first of
all, those men must be destroyed who are particularly harmful to the rev-
olutionary organization and also those whose sudden and violent death may
fill the government with the greatest fear and shake its power by depriv-
ing it of its cleaver and energetic man.
. 17. The second category must consist of persons whose lives would be
spared only temporaily so that, by a series of brutal acts, they bring
the people to the point of inevitable revolt.
18. To the third category belong a great many brutes in high positions
not distinguished by any particular intellect or energy, but due to their
position, enjoy riches, connections, influence, and power. It is necess
ary to exploit them in every possible way; trap them into one's slaves.
Their power, influence, connections, riches, and strength will become the
inexhaustible treasury and support of various revolutionary enterprises.
19.
The fourth category consists of ambitious officeholders and liberals
of various shades. One may conspire with them in accordance with their
programs, making them in accordance that one follows them blindly and et
the same time one should take hold of them, get possessions of all their
secrets, compromise them to the utmost; so that no avenue of escape may
be left to them and use them as instruments for stirring up distrubances
in the State.
20. The fifth--doctrinaires (refers to Bakunin's opponents within the.
revolutionary camp), conspirators, revolutionist talking idly in groups.
and on paper. They must be continually pushed and pulled forward, to-
wards practical neckbreaking statements, the result of which would be
the complete destruction of the majority and the real revolutionary
training of a few. .
.
21. The sixth and very important category includes women who should be
classified under three main divisions; empty headed, stupid, soulless
who may be under like the third and fourth category of men; others ord-
ent, devoted, capable, but not with us because they have not yet worked
themselves up to the real phraseless and genuine revolutionary under-
standing; they are to be made use of like the men in the third categoly;
finally, women, entirely ours, i.e. fully initiated and having comple--
tely accepted our program. They are our comrades, We must look upon
them as our most precious treasure. Without the aid of with we cannot
get along.

in the March 27, 1971 edition of "The Black Panther" news
paper, page three, and according to DE T-2, was written by

COMMITTEE TO COMBAT FASCISM (N.C.C.F.), THE
POLITICAL ORGANIZING BUREAU OF THE BLACK PANTHER

PARTY AT 2009 ALBERT ST. HAS IMPLEMENTED A FREE
BREAKFAST PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN.
"THIS PROGRAM WAS STARTED BECAUSE WE OF
THE N.C.C.F. KNOW THE FININCIAL STATUS OF THE
BLACK COMMUNITY AND KNOWING THAT MOST BLACK FAMILIES
ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN A HOT,
WELL BALANCED, NOURISHING BREAKFAST. WE KNOW THAT
CHILDREN AREN'T ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON THEIR STUDIES
IN SCHOOL AS OPPOSED TO PAINS OF HUNGER WITHOUT A .
NOURISHING HOT BREAKFAST; SO THAT THRY WILL BE ABLE
TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION TO BETTER THEIR CONDITIONS OF
LIVING IN THE YEARS UP COMING.
"WHEN THE FREE BREAKFAST PROGRAM FIRST STARTED.
WE SAW THAT QUITE A FEW CHILDREN WERE INTERESTED
BUT RELUCTANT TO COME. IN OUR TIRELESS EFFORT TO
BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY, WE IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO INVESTIGATE

THE REASON BEHIND THE CHILDREN NOT COMING TO THE
FREE BREAKFAST PROGRAM. IN OUT INVESTIGATION, WE
DISCOVERED THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM; WHICH LIES AT
-
DORT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, LOCATED AT THE CORNER OF
HAMILTON AND AVE. A.
"YOUR CHILDREN ARE CONSTANTLY BEING HARASSED,
FRIGHTENED BY MEMBERS OF A PROFESSIONAL STAFF, BETTER
KNOWN AS TEACHERS. ONE SUCH RACIST LACKEY'S MISS
BROWN, MURPHEY, A MISS COLDPEPPER, A MR. HOLIDAY
AND YOUR EVERYDAY PRINCIPAL SIMMONS.
"THESE FOWL LOW NATURED TEACHERS ARE HARASSING
YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT COMING TO THE FREE BREAKFAST
PROGRAM. THEY TELL THEM THAT IF THEY COME TO THE FREE
BREAKFAST PROGRAM THAT THEY WILL BE KICKED OUT OF
SCHOOL, THAT WE PUT DOPE IN THE FOODS, OR THAT WE
INTEND TO HARM THEM.
"ALONG WITH HARASSMENT BY THA TEACHERS THEY ARE
EVEN SUBJECTED TO BEING HARASSED BY YOUR UNFRIENDLY
BLUE-SUITED PIG. THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST
LYING TO THE CHILDREN, THEY HAVE MOVED IT TO A HIGHER
LEVEL, TO INSURE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY WOULD NOT RECIEVE AMPLE NOURISHMENT, AND
SO THAT THEY COULD FURTHER ENHANCE THEIR GENOCIDAL
PRACTICES OF THIS DECADENT COMMUNITY.

"THESE FOWL INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING HAVE UNIFORMED
PIGS ALONG WITH THEIR NIGGER LACKEYS TO PATROL THE
HALLS OF THE SCHOOL, ARMED WITH. 357 MAGNUMS/ PISTOLS,
UNSTRAPPED AT THEIR SIDES.
"THESE PIGS PATROL THE HALLS DAILY UNDER THE
PRETENSE OF KEEP- OLDER STUDENTS FROM OTHER SCHOOLS
OUT OF DORT.
INSTEAD THEY RUN AROUND IN THE HALLS,
TAKING CHILDREN TO THE OFFICE THAT COME IN LATE,
TAKING CHILDREN OUT OF CLASS ON A PASS FOR THE
BATHROOM, TO THE OFFICE.
"THESE LOW NATURED BEASTS GO SO FAR AS TO DO
SUCH THINGS AS TO THREATEN YOUR CHILDREN WITH SHOOT-
ING THEM, AND TAKE THE CHILDREN TO SOME SECLUDED AREA
AND BEAT THEM. WHEN THERE IS CLEARLY A LAW IN THE
STATE OF MICHIGAN THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT TO BE WHIPPED,
BEATEN OR PADDLED WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE PARENTS.
"THIS CLEARLY INDICATED HOW THE FASCIST RACIST
PIGS OF FLINT AND THEIR LACKEYS THAT ARE WORKING IN
THE INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING HAVE NO REGARDS FOR THE
RIGHTS AND WELL BEING FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY.

::Re: Black Panther Party
Detroit Division
LAUTTAL
The panelists were introduced by the moderator
Lonnie Peeks with the following titles:
Luke Tripp
Leonard Brown
Deputy Minister of Information
Victor Stewart
Marian Kramer
-
Deputy Minister of Education
Deputy Chairman
-
-
No title
Luke Tripp stated that the Black Panther Party is
not a party that adheres to violence but is geared towards
political education for the black people. Tripp stated that
the Black Panther Party is running Eldridge Cleaver, leader
of the BPP in San Francisco, California, for the presidency
of the United States in Michigan. Cleaver is being sponsored
by the New Politics Party. Tripp stated that the BPP is not
interested in seeking or getting votes, rather it is concerned
with presenting its program for revolution to the American
people. Tripp stated that social turmoil as manifested by
George Wallace, youth rebellions and riots in the streets,
can be blamed on power being in the hands of the establishment
and not in the hands of the people where it belongs. Tripp
stated that the black economic, political and social condition
as opposed to the condition of the whites is far below normal.
The system has as its basis a cast system based on race. It
is the relationship of the oppressor and the oppressed, superior
to the inferior. Tripp stated that socially the black man
is unable to control his destiny. School, police and welfare
are all in the hands of the white people and the black people
must grasp for what is left.
Tripp further stated the BPP has a ten point program
that is geared towards elevating the black people out of the
slums. He further stated that the BPP in the Detroit area is
in the process of organizing a party and at this point has no
definite meeting place or date. However, any persons interested
in assisting the organization of the BPP in the Detroit area
may do so by contacting Luke Tripp or Leonard Brown.

ON THE DEFECTION OF ELDRIDGE CLEAVER
FROM THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
AND THE DEFECTION OF
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
'FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY
BY HUEY P. NEWTON,
MINISTER OF DEFENSE OF
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY AND SERVANT
OF THE PEOPLE

***
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY BASES ITS IDEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY ON A CONCRETE
ANYALYSIS OF CONCRETE CONDITIONS, USING DIALECTICAL, MATERIALISM AS OUR ANALYTICAL
METHOD. AS DIALECTICAL MATERIALIST WE RECOGNIZE THAT CONTRADICTIONS CAN LEAD TO
THE INTERNAL STRUGGLE OF OPPOSITES BASED UPON THEIR UNITY CAUSES :
WE RECOGNIZE THAT
DEVELOPMENT.
MATTER TO HAVE MOTION AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT.
NOTHING IN NATURE STANDS OUTSIDE OF. DIALECTICS, EVEN THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY.
BUT WE WELCOME THESE CONTRADICTIONS, BECAUSE THEY CLARIFY AND ADVANCE OUR STRUGGLE.
1. WE HAD A CONTRADICTION WITH OUR FORMER MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER.
F
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS NECESSARY TO OUR GROWTH. OUT OF THIS CONTRADICTION HAS
COME
COME NEW GROWTH AND A NEW RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL VISION OF THE PARTY.
EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY I WROTE AN ESSAY TITLED
"THE CORRECT HANDLING OF A REVOLUTION". THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER CONTRA-
= DICTION THE CRITICISMS RAISED AGAINST THE PARTY BY THE REVOLUTIONARY ACTION
MOVEMENT (R.A.M.). AT THAT TIME R.A.M. CRITICIZED US FOR CUR ABOVE-GROUND ACTION
-
OPENLY DISFLAYING WEAPONS AND TALKING ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO
AKM ITSELF FOR ITS OWN SELF-DEFENSE. R.A.M. SAID THAT THEY WERE UNDERGROUND, AND
SAW THIS AS THE CORRECT WAY TO HANDLE A REVOLUTION. I RESPONDED TO THEM BY POINTDE
OUT THAT YOU MUST ESTABLISH YOUR ORGANIZATION ABOVE GROUND SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
ÓUT
RELATE TO IT IN A WAY THAT WILL BE POSITIVE AND PROGRESSIVE TO THEM. WHEN YOU GO
UNDERGROUND WITHOUT DOING THIS, YOU BURY YCURSELF SO DEEPLY THAT THE PEOPLE CAN
NEITHER RELATE TO NOR CONTACT YOU. THEN THE TERRORISM OF THE UNDERGROUND ORGANIZA-
TIỔN WILL BE JUST THAT--STRIKING FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHOSE
INTEREST THE ORGANIZATION CLAIMS TO BE DEFENDING--BECAUSE THE PEOPLE CANNOT RELATE
TO THEM AND THERE IS NOBODY THERE TO INTERPRET THEIR ACTIONS. YOU HAVE TO SET UP
A PROGRAM OF PRACTICAL ACTION AND BE A MODEL FOR THE COMMUNITY TO FOLLOW AND APPRE-
CIATE.
(43)
THE ORIGINAL VISION OF THE PARTY WAS TO DEVELOP A LIFELINE TO THE PEOPLE
MAR 27 1972
BY SERVING THEIR NEEDS AND DEFENDING THEM AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS WHO COME TO XEROXED ORGINAL-RETAIN
THE COZACNITY IN MANY FORMS--FROM AMED FOLICE TO CAPITALIST EXPLOITERS. WE

THIS WAS
THE ORIGINAL VISICI OF ME PARY. THE ORIGINAL VISION WAS HOT STRUCTURED BY
KHEXORIO MOR BY THEOLOGY. IT WAS STRUCTURED ET TES FRICHICAL HELIC OF THE PROPLE,
AND IPS DYIMMERS WERE AFTED WEIN AN THEOLOGY WHICH PROVIDED A SYSTEMATIC HISTIOD OF
ANALYSIS OF DUW BEST TO HERT FROSE NEELS..

HAD BEEN THROUGHT MANY GROUPS. HOST OF THE WERE SO DEDICATED TO RHETORIC AND
AHTISTIC RENTALS THAT THEY HAD WITHDRAIN FROM LIVING IN DIE TWENTIETH (ENRKY.
SETHES THEIR ANALYSES WARE READYIFUL, EST THEY HAD FO PRACTICAL PRONS WHICH
WOULD DELIVER THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS TO THE PEOPLE. WHEN THEY DID TRY TO LEVELOP
FRACTICAL PROTRAIS, THEY OFTCH FAILED, INCAUSE THEY LACECD A SYSTEMATIC DIGOLOGY
WHICH WOULD HELP PHIM DO OCHICHETE ANALISIS OFF CONCRETE CONONPIONS TO GAIN A FULL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORRINITY AND HIS NEDS. WHEN I WAS IN DONALD WARDEN'S AFRO
AIGLICAN ASSOCIATION, I WATCHED KIM TRY TO MAKE A FRALITY OF COURONITY OCCITAOL,

THEY DID NOT KNCH WHY CAPITALISH WOULD NOT WORK FOR THEM, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD WORKED
FOR OTHER LAINIC OROITS.
WHICH WE FORHED THE PARTY, WE DID SO LECAUSE WE WANTED TO PUT THEOTY AND PRACTICE
TOGETHER, IN A SISTEMATIGISHNER. WE DO THIS THROUGH OUR PASIC TEN PODHT PROGRAM.
IN ACTUALITY NE WAS A 20-FOINT FACARUI, WITH THE PRACTICE EXPRESSED IN "WHAT WE

THEN- THE ORGANIZED STRUCTURE CAN GUIDE THE PROLE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE PRE-

RELATED TO IN A POSITIVE WAY.
SO THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY HAS REACHED A CONTRADICTION WITH ELDRIDGE CLEAVER
AND HE HAS LEFECTED FIX¨THE PARTY, BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT ORDER EVERYONÉ INTO THE
STREETS TOMORROY TO MAKE A REVOLUTION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BE-
-CAUSE CUR DIALECTICS OR IDEOLOGY, OUR CONCRETE ANALYSIS OF CONCRETE CONDITIONS
SAY THAT IT IS A FANTASY, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT AT THAT FOINT ECI. THIS
CONTRADICTION AND CONFLICT MAY SEEM UNFORTUNATE TO SOME, BUT IT IS A PART OF THE
DIALECTICAL PROCESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CONTRADICTION HAS FREED US FRCI IN-
CORRECT ANALYSES AND EMMASES.
WE ARE NOW TREE TO MOVE TOWARD THE BUILDING OF A COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WHICH
WILL BECOME A TRUE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE, PROMOTING THEIR INTERESTS IN MAY WAYS..
WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUSH OUR BASIC SURVIVAL PROGRAM. WE CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE THE
PEOPLE AS ADVOCATES OF THEIR TRUE INTERESTS. WE CAN TRUELY BECOME A FOLITICAL.

CULT GROUP, WE ESCAME, I THAT ACT, A REVOLUTIONARY CU_ GROJP-
BASIC CONTRADICTION,
AUSE REVOLUTION IS A PROCESS, AND IF TH
BUT THIS IS A
CTS YOU COMMIT DO
NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROCESS THEN THEY ARE NON-REVOLUTIONARY.
WHAT THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY NEEDS IS A VERY STRONG
STRUCTURE. THIS STRUCTURE CAN ONLY EXIST WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE AND IT
CAN ONLY GET ITS SUPPORT THROUGH. SERVING THEM. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THE SERVICE TO .
SERVI
THE PEOPLE PROGRAM THE MOST. I'PORTANT THING IN THE PARTY. WE WILL SERVE THEIM
NEELS, SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE THROUGH THIS OPPRESSION. THEN WHEN THEY ARE READY
TO PICK UP THE GUN, SERIOUS BUSINESS WILL HAPPEN. ELDRIDGE CLEAVER INFLUENCED
US TO ISOLATE OURSELVES FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY, SO THAT IT WAS WAR BETWEEN THE
OPPRESSOR AND THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY, NOT WAR BETWEEN THE OPPRESSOR AND THE
OPPRESSED COMMUNITY.
THE BLACK PANTHER FARTY DEFECTED FROM THE COMMUNITY LONG BEFORE ELDRIDGE DE-
FECTED FROM THE PARTY. OUR HOOK-UP WITH WHITE RADICALS DID NOT GIVE US ACCESS TO
„THE WHITE COMMUNITY, BECAUSE THEY DO HOT GUIDE THE WHITE COMMUNITY. THE BLACK
COMMUNITY DOES NOT RELATE TO THEM, SO WE WERE LEFT IN A TWILIGHT ZONE, WHERE WE
COULD NOT ENTER THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY REAL POLITICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS; YET WE
WERE NOT DOLIG ANYTHING TO MOBILIZE WHITES. WE HAD NO INFLUENCE IN RAISING THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND THAT IS THE POINT WHERE WE DEFECTED.
WE WENT THROUGH A FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT IN THE PARTY, WHICH WAS NOT NECESSARY
AND ONLY FURTHER ISOLATED US FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WE HAD ALL SORTS OF PRO-
AND ONL
FANITY IN OUR PAPER AND EVERY OTHER WORD WHICH DROPPED FROM OUR LIFS WAS PROFANE.
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN BEFORE I WAS JAILED, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT. BUT
ELDRIDGE'S INFLUENCE BROUGHT THIS ADOUT. I DO NOT BLAME HIM ALTOGETHER; I BLAME
THE PARTY BECAUSE THE PARTY ACCEPTED IT.
. ELDRIDGE, WAS NEVER FULLY IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY. EVEN AFTER BOBBY
WAS SNATCHED WAY FROM US, I DID NOT PLACE. ELDRIDGE IN A POSITION OF LEADERSHIP,
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THAT. I MADE DAVID HILLIARD ADMINISTRATOR OF
PROGRAMS. I KNEW THAT ELDRIDGE WOULD NOT DO ANYMIING TO LIFT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
THE COMRADES IN THE PARTY. BUT I KNEW THAT HE COULD MAKE A CONTRIBUTION; AND I
PRESSED HIM TO DO SO.. I FRESSED HIM TO WRITE AND EDIT THE PATER, BUT HE WOULDN'T
DO IT. THE PAPER DID NOT EVEN COME OUT EVERY WEEK UNTIL AFTER ELDRIDGE WENT TO
JAIL. BUT ELDRIDGE CLEAVER DID MAKE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
_ WITH HIS WRITING AND SPEAKING. WE WANT TO KEEP THIS IN MDID, BECAUSE THERE IS A
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SIDE TO EVERYTHING.
THE CORRECT HANDLING OF A REVOLUTION IS NOT TO OFFER THE PEOPLE AN "EITHER-ON"
ULTIMATUM. WE MUST INSTEAD GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE THROUGH SERVING THEIR
NEEDS. THEN WHEN THE POLICE OR ANY OTHER AGENCY OF REPRESSION TRIES TO DESTROY THE
PROGRAM, THE PEOPLE WILL MOVE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND ACTION.

WORD LIST
REVOLUTION- Revolution means change, A revolutionary is one who is
dissatisfied with a system that brutalizes, murders, exploits and
oppresses the poople it pretends to serve (Amerikkka). He is not

MERCENARY- A soldier who only fights for pay, doing the dirty work
for someone else.
HOUSE NIGGER- The slave that thinks he is free because the master
invites him for coffee (but not for dinner) and then is used to
control the field niggers.
FIELD NIGGER - Slave who must work the hardest but gets almost nothing

Leonard Brown mentioned the fact that the white
. policemen must realize that the black people are not
afraid of them and will defend themselves in any critical
situation. Brown mentioned the fact that a good example of
the white police officer is the incident that occurred in
New York City where 200 white off-duty policemen attacked
innocent members of the EPP. Brown further stated that the
black political leaders in the country are nothing but
"phonies" and "Uncle Toms". He further stated it is time
for the white power structure to realize that it is impossible
to dictate to the black people as they have been doing for
years and that the black people only want a chance to govern
their community as they see fit.
Victor Stewart stated that the BPP in its useful
state is not an "underground party" but an "above the ground
party". Stewart stated that the only way the black people can
excel or exist in this world controlled by the white man is to
take what he wants. Stewart stated that this does not mean
asking or getting on your knees begging the white power
structure. He further stated that the key to the black man's
destiny is through black political education classes in
which he will be cognizant of the political structure in this
country. Stewart further stated that the BPP's motto is
"All power to the people; Black power to black people".
Marian Kramer, Negro, female, stated that the black
female must awaken and play a vital role in organizing the
BPP.
She stated for years the black female has been neglected
from the political system in our country.
Sources in the Detroit area who are familiar with'
the black nationalist movement, stated that they have no
information at this time that a BPP is organized in the
Detroit area and conducts regular scheduled meetings. These
sources further advised that during other black militant
organizational meetings the name Black Panther Party has come
up; however, no significant meaning as to actually being
established in the Detroit area is known.

-
A NEW ERA HAS ARISEN IN THE UNITED STATES. INSURRECTICH, REVOLUTION: AI.
LIBERATION BAS KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF AMERICA, THE WORLD'S HOW HOST POTENT
BASTION OF IMPERIALISM. HISTORICAL CONDITIONS HAVE FORCED THE CONFLICTING
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY FTO THE POINT CF DIVISION. NOW ONLY THE STRAG-
GLERS ARE PICKING WHICH SIDE THEY WISH TO FIGHT 03, THE SIDE OF THE FORCES
OF OPPRESSION, RACISM AND FASCISM OR WITH THE FORCES OF LIBERATION THE
PEOPLE'S JUST CAUSE OF FREEDOM. BECAUSE. THIS CONFRONTATION IS ALREADY
RAISED TO THE LEVEL OF SPORADIC MILITARY ENCOUNTERS- REVOLUTIONARIES SHOOT-
ING IT OUT WITH THE PIGS, REVOLUTIONARIES BEING HARASSED FOR SELLING PAPERS
REVOLUTIONARIES LIBERATING THE GOODS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM THE COM-
MUNITY - MANY BROTHERS ARE BEING LOCKED UP IN NUMEROUS PRISONS AND JAILS
OF BABYLON.
THE INCREASE IN REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS HAS PROPORTIONATELY INCREASED THE
LEVEL OF POLITICAL AWARENESS THROUGHOUT THE PENAL SYSTEM. SAN QUENTIN,
BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE POPULATION, IS GETTING ITS SHARE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS.
REAGAN'S GOVERNMENT AND HIS PUPPET PRISON ADMINISTRATORS ARE WELL AWARE OF
THIS AND ALSO ITS EFFECT. THAT AWARENESS CREATES A REPRESSIVE ATMOSPHERE
THROUGHOUT THE PERS. HERE IN SAN QUENTIX WE ARE FEELING THAT REPRESSION
FULL FORCE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN PREVALENT FROM THE TIME OUR COMRADES
JONATHAN JACKSON, WILLIAM CHRISTMAS AND JAMES MCLAIN MADE THEIR SUPREME
SACRIFICE FOR FREEDCK, IT HAS INTENSIFIED, CULMINATING WITH A WEEK OF STORY-
BOOK REIGN OF TERROR. THE NEN ENCUSE AND PRETEXT FOR LOCKING BROTHERS IN
THE HOLE IS "POSSESSION OF INFLANDATORY LITERATURE". THIS LITERATURE IS,
OF COURSE, REVOLUTIONARY, AND IS IN CER FOSSESSION BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING
TO BRING CUR INCARCERATED PHOTHERS UP TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF AWARENESS.
CAN THEN CHANGE THEIR CUTMODED IDEAS OF INDIVIDUAL MATERIAL GAIN
THROUGH EXPLOITATION OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
THEY
THE PIGS SEE US AND ANYONE WHO ASSOCIATES CLOSELY WITH THE CADRE HERE
TAKING ON A NEW COMPLEXION, A NEW OUTLOOK ON SOCIAL CONDITIONS. WE ARE
BECOMING MORE DISCIPLINED AND ARE STARTING TO UNIFY AROUND THE IDEOLOGY OF
ESTABLISHING REVOLUTIONARY POLITICAL POWER FOR BLACK PEOPLE. THE PIGS KNOW
THAT ONCE WE ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY POLITICAL POWER THEY CAN NO LONGER
EXPLOIT AND OPPRESS US. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOCKUP CUR WARRIORS IN
PRISONS AND JAILS ANY LONGER. THEY ALSO REALIZE THAT ONCE THE MASSES OF
ANGRY BLACKS BECOME POLITICALLY AWARE, WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE MACHINERY
OF OPPRESSION TO A SCREECHING HALT, THROUGH VIOLENT, BLOODY, BUT JUSTIFIED
HARFARE.

THIS HARASSMENT TAKES ON A FAMILIAR FORM. THEY WATCH A GROUP OF BROTHERS
WHO ARE KNOWN REVOLUTIONARIES, THEN ACCUMULATE THIS KNOWLEDGE INTO SPECIAL

ALONG WITH PHOTOGRAPHS. THIS INFORMATION IS KEPT AT THE FOREPOST (A CENTRAL

THIS WEEK FIVE BROTHERS WERE TAKEN OFF THE YARD: JAMES ELLISON, KENNY
• FAVRE, CHARLES AUGUSTINE, J.P. TROTTER AND EDDJE CHILLIES. ALL WERE
CHARGED WITH HAVING REVOLUTIONARY MATERIAL IN THEIR POSSESSION. THERE
WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN WE WOULD RUN TO OUR CELLS AND DESTROY ALL WRITINGS
IN HOPE THAT WE COULD KEEP THE BUST FROM COMING DOWN ON US. THAT TIME
HAS PASSED. NOW WE REALIZE THAT THIS PIG HAS NO LAWS WHICH WE AS OPP-
RESSED PEOPLE ARE ROUND TO RESPECT, HE CANNOT STIFLE CUR THOUGHTS IN
ORDER TO SLOW UP HISTORICAL INEVITABLE REVOLUTION - LIBERATION. WE
SAY DAMN HIM AND ALL OF HIS REACTICIARY, FASCIST RUNNING DOGS, BECAUSE
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE AND´ EDUCATE WHENEVER WE ARE AMONG THE MASSES
AND REGARDLESS OF THE REPRESSIVE MEASURES AND REPERCUSSION HAPPENING
BEHIND IT. IT IS TINE THAT WE AS PEOPLE STAND UP AND FIGHT OFF THIS
PIG POWER STRUCTURE. WE ARD RIGHT; HISTORY HAS PROVEN BEYOND A SHADOW
OF A DOUBT THAT WE ARE MONALLY, INTELLECTUALLY AND SPIRITUALLY JUSTIFIED
IN TAKING OUR FREEDOM BY THE MOST DRASTIC MEANS AVAILABLE.
THE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAKKY AND 20.THE PIGS WE SAY COME ON, FOR HISTORY
•AND UNBORN CZTERATIONS ARE WATCHING CER ACTION CLOSELY. IF WE DO NOT
TAKE A STAND FOR LIBERATION NOW, THEN WE DO NOT DESERVE TO BREATH THE
OXYGEN WE INNALE, OR THE SPACE WE TAKE UP. THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE YOUTH,
SO WE MUST GIVE THE YOUTH THE PROPER TOOLS TO FIGHT AND DESTROY THIS
SYSTEM OF RACISM, FASCISM AND IMPERIALISM. THE TOOLS NEEDED ARE BRAVERY,
LOYALTY TO THE CAUSE OF LIBERATION AND FAITH IN THE PEOPLE. MS CANNOT
GIVE THEM ANYTRING TO FIGHT WITH, IF WE ALLOW CORCELVES TO 23 BACKED INTO
A CORNER WITH OUT PUTTING UP ANY STRUGGLE. IF WE DO NOT GIVE THE YOUTH
ANYTHING BUT A FLEETING GLANCE AT A REVOLUTIONARY ACT, THAT IS MUCH
BETTER THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF TOMISM AND STEP N' FETCH IT, FCOTSHUP

ONCE, WE AS MEN, ARE RECONGIZED AS WHAT WE ARE, POLITICAL PRISONERS,
A NEW SITUATION DEVELOPS. THE CORRUPT PRISON OFFICIAL, THE GOVERNOR,
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE WORLD LOOK AT US AS POLITICAL PRISONERS AND
TREAT US IN ACCORD WITH THE GENEVA CONVENTION'S MANDATE FOR TIME TREAT-
MENT OF THE POLITICAL PRISONER AND THE PRISONER OF WAR. AS OF NON WE
ARE NOT TREATED ANY BETTER THAN ANIMALS IN A CAGE. ONCE OUR PEOPLE, THE
SENSIBLE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY, REALIZE THE NATURE OF A POLITICAL PRI-
SONER, THEY WILL DEMAND OUR HUMANE TREATMENT, UNTIL THEY BUILD UP THE
NECESSARY FORCES TO DO JUST WHAT THE FRENCH PEOPLE DID TO THE BASTILLE

RESSED PEOPLE UNITE AROUND THE BANNER OF LIBERATION, NO FORCE IN THE
WORLD CAN STOP THE NATURAL COURSE OF HISTORY. THE FRENCH COULD NOT
STOP THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE, THE VIETNAMESE OR ALGERIAN PEOPLE; THE JAP-
ANESE AND THE REACTIONARY CHINESE COULD NOT STOP THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE
OF CHINA; IAN SMITH AND HIS APARTHEID PARTNERS WILL NOT STOP THE PEOPLE
OF RHODESIA, SOUTH AFRICA OR SOUTH WEST AFRICA FROM GAINING THEIR FREEDOM.
THE PIGS IN THIS COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT, CANNOT
STOP THE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION. THE PIGS HERE IN SAN QUENTIN
.. REGARDLESS OF THE INTIMIDATION AND HARASSÉENT CANNOT STOP THE EXCHANGE
OF REVOLUTIONARY KNOWLEDGE. THEY ARE ONLY MAKING SURE OF THEIR DEATH BY

THE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS SENT TO US ON JUNE 21, 1971, FROM OUR
THEN INCARCERATED COMRADE, GEORGE JACKSON. BECAUSE OF CONFUSION
CREATED PARTICULARLY BY THE. PRESENT GOVERNMENT'S PROPAGANDA MEDIA
SURROUNDING COMRADE GEORGE'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY,
AND, BECAUSE THE MESSAGE THE LETTER CONTAINS IS SO CLEARLY IMPORTANT
AS A GUIDE TO OUR STRUGGLE, WE FEEL IT APPROPRIATE TO NOW PRINT THE
LETTER HERE:
****
MASS MOVEMENTS THAT ARE EGALITARIAN AND AIMED AT THE FUTURE ES--
TABLISHMENT OF REVOLUTIONARY MASS SOCIETY MUST AT ALL SUBSTRUCTURAL
LEVELS BE GUIDED BY AN AGGRESSIVE AND DISCIPLINED VANGUARD POLITICAL
PARTY. WITHOUT THIS LEADERSHIP, POSITIVE ACTIONS AND UNITARIAN CON-
DUCT OF THE PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS IS NOT POSSIBLE. ONE SIMPLY CANNOT ACT
WITHOUT A HEAD. FOR THE VANGUARD PARTY, IT IS ALWAYS THE INTERESTS
OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR FORWARD MOVEMENT THAT IS OF PRIMARY CONCERN.
---WITHOUT THE VANGUARD PARTY, THOUGH, ALL ARE IN FACT EQUAL. THE PARTY
· ITSELF CANNOT ACT WITH PURPOSE WITHOUT THE TRUEST EXPRESSION OF DEM-
OCRATIC CENTRALISM: THE PARTY CADRE, FREELY ELECTED OR OTHERWISE
DISTINGUISHED IN THE SERVICE OF THE PARTY AND THE PEOPLE, MUST REACH
FOR MAJORITY DECISIONS THAT ONCE ARRIVED AT MUST BE RESOLUTELY CARRIED
OUT BY ALL, EVEN THOSE WHO MAY HAVE IN THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING
OPPOSED THE MEASURE.
: NOTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SUCH DISCIPLINED AND PRINCIPLED
CONDUCT. WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH NOT ONLY THE ENEMY FORCES THAT WOULD
RESTRICT CUR MOVEMENT, BUT ALSO PRIMAL IMPULSES WITHIN EACH OF CS,
LITTLE UNDERSTOOD AND AT MOST OCCASIONS JUST BARELY UNDER CONTROL.
DISCIPLINARIAN CONDUCT IS THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO SUPPRESS THE
EQUTIEN, SELF-INDULGENCE, INTROVERSION THAT WE ABSORBED WHILE STILL
IN THE HELPLESS NON-COCCUS STATE. IT IS ACTIVELY COMBATING THE

APPENDIX
BLACK PANTHER PARTY, also
known as Black Panther Party
for Self Defense
A source advised that the Black Panther Party for
Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister
of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December,
1966, as a militant black nationalist political organization
to combat "police brutality", to unite militant black youth,
and to determine the destiny of black communities.
political philosophy was taken from writings of Chairman MÃO
Tse-tung of Communist China and black militant writers.
The
In March, 1968, the name of the organization was
changed to Black Panther Party (BPP).
;
The official BPP publication, "The Black Panther
1. Party - Black Community News Service", states that the BPP
advocates use of guns and guerrilla tactics in their violent
revolutionary program to end oppression of black people.
On February 17, 1968, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of
Information, announced merger of the BPP and Student Non-violent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and bestowed title of Minister of
Justice, ẸPP, upon H. RAP BROWN, Chairman of SNCC.
SNCC is a militant Negro organization
which preaches black supremacy.
NEWTON, aforementioned, is incarcerated in the Alameda
County Jail, Oakland, California, awaiting trial on charge of
murger of an Obkland police officer.
Headquarters of BPP and Huey P. Newton Defense Fund
are located at 4421 Grove Street, Oakland, California.

RONALD SMITH and LARRY ROWELL held up what they believed
to be a dope house and one of the victims was killed.

STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE
Re:

Black Panther Party
PAVEL 46 Ma
The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia,
is a non-membership organization, which was born out of the
sit-in movement that erupted across the South beginning in
1960.
Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in the
revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful it
is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary
program.
According to SNCC, the year 1967 marked a historic
milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people
in the United States and the year that revolutionaries throughout
the world began to understand more fully the impact of the
black movement. SNCC declared that "liberation will come only
when there is final destruction of this mad octupus--the capitalis-
tic system of the United States with all its life-sucking
tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the people of
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities of black life,
together with the recognition instilled in SNCC workers forced
its members to further popularize the legitimacy of self-
defense and rebellious when oppression became too great."
From May, 1966, until May, 1967, STOKELY CARMICHAEL
was National Chairman of SNCC. As of July, 1968, CARMICHAEL
resided in Wahington, D.C., where he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition group.
In May, 1967, CARMICHAEL was replaced by HUBERT GEROID BROWN,
commonly known as H. RAP BROWN, who served until June, 1968.
In June, 1968, at the Staff and Central Committee
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was decided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by creating ten deputy or vice chairmanships. The primary
purpose for this change is to take law enforcement pressure
off any single individual.

DE T-4 advised on various dates in 1971, through
October, 1971, that the Detroit BPP attempted to regularly
hold political education meetings at its various offices.
These meetings were generally boring and consequently poorly
attended. Various 5PP members would lead discussions of
articles appearing in "The Black Panther" news paper and
a number of persons attending the meetings would have a tendency
to sleep.
A liberation school has been initiated at 2435
Pennsylvania, Detroit, and is operated in conjunction with
the Free Lunch Program. About 30-40 children are being
indoctrinated in BPP philosophy at this school, which opened

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)
also known as
Black Panther Party for S f Defense
Accordin, to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to.
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
. Minister of Defense, EPP.
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Dynamite! Black power. Use .
the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere."
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
¨ December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct
overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is... by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government:"
The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA. :

the "HISTORY OF THE SECRET ORGANIZATION" material attached
to this LHM wherein a group of six Minutemen allegedly met
in Northern Arizona in February 1970. Based on the general
tenor of the conversations at Yuma incidental to the organ-
izational meeting there informant feels that the meeting he
attended at Yuma is the first official organizational meeting
of the group.

Minutemen in California, who has been missing approximately
three years.

"
Jerome Lawlah was shot and killed on July 10 by. this racist owner of the
Kozy Korner Bar in Highland Park. This brother was killed in cold blood because.
he was black. The racist bar owner was taken down to the pig station where he
was charged with first degree murder which was later dropped to 2nd
wap
degree murder. The brothers and sisters in Highland Park couldn't relate to this"
murder of this brother and nothing being done about it. The brothers and sisters
had protested at the bar. The people of Highland Park were witnesses to the un-
justful laws used by the pig's for their unjust act. Saturday evening the bar.
was burned down. This was an open opportunity for the pig Mayor of Highland Park..
Blackwell to call in the gestapo pig force into the community. These pigs were.
carrying weapons in our community that are used in combat in Vietnam. There.
an illegal curfew put on in Highland Park by this pig Mayor to try to control,
the tension of the Community. This low-lifed pig Mayor had the nerve enough to
make a statement saying that the people of the community go to their homes and
let the local pig force department handle the problems. These pig's came in the
community with blood in their eyes and the power of the gun. The inhuman pig's
who call themselves protectors of Liberty, are nothing but facists outlaws who
patrol our community looking for brothers and sisters to rip off in the name of
law and order.
About 150 bloods were arrested on trumped up charges. The brothers and sisters
were told to get off the streets or be shot. We as Black People must ride we

by these racist pigs. The sople of this community are not going to stand still
and see another little Danny Smith get shot down.

Some of the brothers and sisters who are members of the N.C.C.F. were victims
of pig harrassment. These brothers and sisters were relating to the people in
the community of Highland Park. They were beaten and kidnapped off the streets
of Babylon. This is the plot and plan of the facists to try to exterminate the
Black Panther Party. The pig's are openly making statements on radio and T.V.
to try and destroy the Party. But the Black Panther Party is strong. It is strong
because it's the people's party. After the statement was made by Pig Mayor Black-
well, J. Hog-Head Hoover made a statement about the Black Panther Party being the
most dangerous and violent organization in the country. This pig knows that the
Black Panther Party is relating the real deal about this foul system. How these.
pig forces are carrying out the orders of fascism against the American People in
general and Black People in particular. J. Hog Head Hoover knows he is a pig
and a pig is a pig is a pig. Right On!!
Thẻ lying politicians runs this cold game on the people that the U.S. Govern-
ment is existing for the benefit of the people. The real deal is that the U.S..
Government is the largest facist force there is. And the Black Panther Party is
hip to the game these low-lifed pigs are trying to run down. So there is no way
out for these pigs.

1
C: JULY 15, 1979 FBI CHIEF J. LDGAR HOOVER ISSUED A STATEMENT CALLING THE
E.P.P. THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF AMERICA; IN THE HISTORY
CF THE NATION DAYS AFTER THIS STATEMENT MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT POLICE DEPART-
MENT VICIOUSLY ATTACKED THREE MEMBERS OF THE N.C.C.F. HERE.
MALIK AND WILLIAM MCCLURE AND TOMMY WARD WERE HELPING TO PAINT THE HOME
OF MRS. EARLENE MCCLURE (MOTHER OF MALIK AND WILLIAM). WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF
PAINT MALIK AND WILLIAM VOLUNTEERED TO GET MORE. THEY WERE THREE DOORS FROM
THE HOUSE WHEN 50 STORMTROOPERS STOPPED THEM AND DEMANDED A CAR REGISTRATION.
WHEN THIS WAS PRODUCED THEY COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR AND SAID THAT THE
BROTHERS WERE LYING. THIS WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO HAND CUFF THE BROTHERS.
THE TWO BROTHERS TRYED TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE, AND WERE HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH GUNS AND CLUBS. BY THIS TIME MRS. McCLURE AND TOMMY HAD COME OUT OF THE
HOUSE. WHEN TOMMY CAME OUT ON THE PORCH, THE RACIST DOGS TURNED ON HIM. MRS.
McCLURE WAS ATTACKED WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO.
FER SONS.
MRS. McCLURE, MALIK, TOMMY AND WILLIAM PROTECTED THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY
COULD BUT ALL WERE BRUTALLY BEATEN. MALIK SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD WOUNDS, INTERNAL
BLEEDING AND BRUISES OVER THE FACE AND UPPER PART OF HIS BODY. TOMMY SUFFERED
INCONCIOUSNESS, BRUISES ON THE FACE AND HEAD, HE HAS FOUR STICHES. WILLIAM AND
HIS MOTHER RECEIVED CUTS AND LACERATIONS.
ALL THREE BROTHERS WERE CHARGED WITH RESISTING ARREST, AND OBSTRUCTION OF
"UISTICE" AND RELEASED ON $500.00 BONDS. WE RECOGNIZE THIS MOST RECENT ACT OF
BRUTALITY AS AN INTRICATE PART OF THE PREPLANNED ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THE BLACK
PANTHER PARTY AND ITS ORGANIZATIONAL BUREAUS. FRED HAMPTON SAID IN 1969, THAT
YOU CAN KILL A REVOLUTIONARY BUT, YOU CAN'T KILL THE REVOLUTION. WE WILL COR-
TINUE TO RESIST THE GENOCIDAL POLICYS OF THIS CORRUPT SYSTEM. WE WILL NOT STOP
LEEDING HUNGRY CHILDREN OR PROVIDING CLOTHING FOR OUR PEOPLE. THE MURDERES OF
AMERICA KNOW THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A FREE MEDICAL CLINIC IN DETROIT
AND THEY THINK THEY CAN STOP US WITH THEIR FOUL ACTS. OUR ANSWER TO THESE AT-
TACKS ARE THE SAME- WE WANT AN IMMEDIATE END TO POLICE BRUTALITY AND MURDER OR
THE RACIST DOG POLICEMEN WILL FACE THE WRATH OF AN ARMED PEOPLE.

WHY SHOULD WE REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
-
The Constitution of the U.S.A. does not and never has protected our people or
guaranteed to us those lofty idcals enshrined within it. When the Constitution was
first adopted we were held as slaves. We were held in slavery under the constitution.
We have suffered every form of indignity and imposition under the Constitution, frum
ecomic exploitation, political subjugation to physical extermination.
We need no further evidence that there is something wrong with the Constitution
_ of the United States of America. We have had our Human Rights denied and violated per-
petually under this Constitution-- forhundreds of years. As a people, we have rec-
eived neither the Equal Protection of the Laws nor Due Process of Law. Where Human
Rights are being daily violated there is denial of Due Process of Law and there is no
Equal Protection of the Law. The Constitution of the United States does not guarantee
and protect our Economic Rights, or our Political Rights, nor our Social Rights. It
does not even guarantee and protect our most basic Human Right, the right to LIVE!.
The pigs here in fascist America are using their power to repress the masses of
poor and oppressed people. The oppressor makes the lows and then turns these same
laws into weapons to be used against the mass of oppressed people.
3434
Evidence of this is seen daily through out the Black Community. Such as the un-
authorized imposing of curfew by the mayor of Ecorse, We all learned then that the
meyer does not have the authority to impose curfews, on June 12,1970 Mayor Blackwell
of Highland Park imposed another of these unauthorized curfews, in which black people
were besten, gased, shot, arrested for violation of this illegal curfew..
'
June 28,1970 Red, Lawrence White, and Michael Anderson. wore attacked, gased,
fired upon, arrested, and incarcerated by the Detroit Police Department, and held for
75,000 dollars ransom apiece. These brothers are in Jail today because they chose
to defend themselves when attacked, rather than accepting their own murder in. the
name of so-called law and order.·
June 17, 1970 Mrs. Mc Clure and her two sons Malik and, William Mc Clure, and
Tommy Ward were for no other reason other than general harassment stopped, "harassed
vicously beaten, arrested, ond charged with resisting and obstructing justice, after
which they were also incarcerated.
These are only a very few of the incidents that take place in the oppressed com-
munities through out the United States of America, under the existing constitution
of the United States.
be therefore call for a Hevolutionary People's Constitutional Convention, to be
convened by the American people, to write a new Constitution that will guarantee and
deliver to every American Citizen the inviolable Human Right to Life, Liberty, and
The Pursuit of Happiness!

TEDDY ROBERTSON ALL MEMBERS OF THE N.C.C.F., WERE VICIOUSLY ATTACKED, AND BRUTALLY
BEATEN, BY MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE EXCUSE USED THIS TIME BY
THE D.P.D. TO SO CALLED JUSTIFY THE ATTACK, STEMMED FROM AN ACCUSATION MADE BY THE
OFFICER ON THE BEAT AT THE CORNERS OF STATE AND WOODWARD, THAT LINDA LAURA: ALSO A
MEMBER OF THE N.C.C.F.., HAD THROWN SONE PAPER ONTO THE SIDEWALK. LINDA TOLD HIM
THAT SHE HAD NOT, THE OFFICER SAID "EITHER PICK UP THE PAPER OR T'LL GIVE YOU A
-TICKET FOR LITTERING" THEN HE RADIOED FOR REINFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDED TO ARREST THE
SISTER. 30 STORMTROOPERS ANSWERED THE CALL TO ARREST ONE SISTER. TONY, TEDDY, RONNİE,
ROBERT, AND DELPHINE, ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE WENT OVER TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT WAS
GOING ON, AFTER FINDING OUT THEY BEGAN TO RELATE TO THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM OF THE
INJUSTICE TAKING PLACE, THE STORMTICOPERS IMMEDIATLY ATTACKED THIS BEATING THEM
WITH THEIR FISTS, BILLY CLUBS, BLACK JACKS, ISQEY FELL THIS DEATING CONTENDED
AS
THEY WERE STCHPED AND KICKED, NEARLY UNCONSIOUS. THESE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
PROTECTED THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY COULD, BUT ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LINDA WERE
TAKEN TO THE 1st PRECINCT, AFTER REACHING THE 1st PRECINCT RONNIE WAS AGAIN BEATEN.
ALL FIVE WERE THROWN INTO CELLS AND NOT INFORMED OF THEIR CHARGES, TONY AND
TEDDY WERE HOSPITALIZED WITH CUTS AND BRUISES, RECEIVED DURING THE BEATING, TEDDY
RECIEVED 13 STICHES TO THE HEAD AND RIGHT HAND, TONY HAS A FOSSIBLE CONCUSSION.
.
WE REALIZE THAT THIS ACT OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THESE MEMBERS OF THE DETROIT
N.C.C.F. IS PART AND PARCEL OF J. EDGAR HOOVERS' PREPLANNED LIQUIDATION OF
ELACK PANTHER PARTY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. THEY BELIEVE THA“ THESE ATTACKS WILL
DISCOURAGE USE IN OUR STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION, BUT WE WILL NOT BE DISCOURAGED. IT
ONLY SHOWS MORE CLEARLY THAT OUR STRUGGLE IS JUST AND VERY NECESSARY.

My name is Michael D. and as much as I dig life; as much as I want to be with

The eminence of death has been with me since I joined the Black Panther Party

all that my mind is turned to now is how to die like a man. My sons and my daughter

Today is August 2, 1970. am in the city of Detroit, worming with the N.C.C.F.
here. A lot of us will be dead soon--very soon. The chief of Pigs in this city--
Hurphy has conspired with the head of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover (Pig) to attack
and destroy the members of the N.C.C.F. here. At this very moment the 10th precinct
is and has been for two weeks stock piling weapons, and when I say weapons, I mean
tanks and half tracks and all the conventional weapons of modern warfare to attack
what they call the "Panther Complex"--not office but complex. They (the pigs) have
been trying hard to create an incident. First the news media comes out with a lie
that we have over 200 weapons and over 100,000 rounds of ammunition at this office
1 alone. This statement was made a week after a minor rebellion went down in an area
known as Highland Park where the Mayor stated after occupying the community, shoot-
ing and beating Black people--"I don't know why the Black Panthers want to pick on
my little city." When in actuality it was the people responding to the racist mur-
ders of people at the Kozy Korner Bar. The brother was shot after an argument ensued.
because the brother didn't have the money for a drink. The brother was Black-the
murderer was White--the brother was unarmed. The people's response was; the bar was
immediately burnt down and niggas hit the streets. The Panthers were the scapegoat.'
then we went into the area to educate the people to the pigs tactics we were immed-
iately arrested.

1--1
About four days ago the people around the office here on Indiandale hung pos-
ters and when the pigs attempted to tear them down they were run away. Then the people
got really uptight and began saying that this is their community, and they have a
right to do what they want to do. So they changed the street from Indiandale & 14th
to Panther Ave. and Free Red. They sang revolutionary songs and rapped about how they
• would like things to be for everybody. The following morning a pig was shot at, try-
--
"
ing to sneak up and pull down the sign. The N.C.C.F. was blamed immediately, a few
hours later a channel 50 news car was fired on in the same neighborhood, again the
N.C.C.F. was blamed immediately the area was surrounded by pigs of the 10th pre- :
cinct. They did this without permission from Pig Chief Murphy. They were about to ¨¨¨
attack when orders came and they were instructed not to make a move because they were
1 not equipped to handle the situation. That they were in reality about to be barbequed
because it just so happens that the people here relate to the Black Panther Party
and it would be impossible to move on us without moving on the whole West Side. That's
: why the 10th Precinct right now has tanks and half tracks and 50 cal. machine guns--.
to kill niggas. That's why today August 2nd, pigs have been going door to door tell-.
ing people where to lay in their house when the attack comes. They also stated that..
if they were to come out on the street that they would be killed.
So this is no joke, this is war in the truest sense of the word. This is the
tighest form of politics. We want freedom--they want blood. I say they can have mine,

PART 1
*
In organizing self-defense groups at
this stage of the struggle the most
important consideration is whether or not
the person to be in incorporated into the
group understands fully that what he or
she is doing is the right thing to do. At
this stage of the struggle if any members
of a self-defense group are weak minded
or do not understand that the only way to
put an end to brutality & murder is to or-
ganize self-defense groups & counter-atta-
ck, practice has shown that if this weak
rinded person is ever captured he or she
will certainly not be able to withstand
the methods of persuasion used by the
fascist pigs and they will talk, give up
information. So the first priority for
any self-defense group is to be armed
ideologically.
Because of the consequences if anything
goes wrong during an operation, MeMeers
within the group must maintain a face to
face relationship, get to know each others
strength and weaknesses thoroughly, and
participate fully in the planning of ag
erations. Liberalism at this level can
cost the lives of comrades and/or jeopar-
dize the success of an operation.
At this time self-defense groups should
have no more than four to six members.
The struggle at this time requires no oper-
atica that cannot be handed by four to six
people. Also security is sacrificed the
larger the group. At this. time self-defense
groups should be formed all across Babylon,
North, South, East and West. However, at
this time groups must work autonomously.
Later no circumstances should any group
seek out and try to make contact with an-
other group. Due to the fact that this
level of struggle is in its embryonic
stages and fools, agents and provacateurs
are scattered all across Babylon; if
autonomy is maintained when a member of
a group is captured he or she will caly
be able to give up information on one
group, their own.

PART 11
Due to the brainwashing done by TV,'
movies, comics ect, there are a lot of
incorrect ideas about firearms that must
be cleared up. The first thing to under-
stand is, there is no piece (gun) that
covers any and all situations. Although
they show pigs on TV and in the movies

nose 38
The pigs also use slugs, 1 giant lea

had drawn up to attack National Headquart
of the Black Panther Farty, they intecdo
to use slugs to knock the amour plate off

that is necessary to give you a differ-
ent perspective is to examine the arma-
ment of the pigs that occupy our Black-
Communities anywhere in Babylon. When
you do that you will discover that most
pig cars have at least one .12 gauge pump
or automatic shotgun; one or two semi-
automatic or automatic assault rifles, one
br two bolt action rifles with a scope
mounted for shipping purposes, and of
course, the pigs have strapped on ar
Least one handgun either an automatic
pistol or a revolver. In San Francisco,
the S.F. Tactical Squad members carry two
handguns, their standard service revolver
›lus a second handgun which is their per-
sonal preference; in many cases an auto-
atic pistol. So at this time let's
examine these three types of weapons; the
shotgun, the rifle, and the handgun.
•12 Gurge
.12 GUAUGE SHOTGUN:
the pigs use the
hotgun, either pump or semi-automatic,
caded with 00 buckshot generally in
* rowd situations such as rebellions. The
tandard load is nine (9) buckshot pellets

bad of 12 pellets per shell. These magnum
loads are to be used only in magum shot-

make an investigation based on ballistic
marks.

If you put one in the chamber that means 14

M-16
THE RIFLE: The bolt-action rifle in
.30-06 or .308 (7.62 MM Nato) with a four
(4) power scope (or better) mounted, is a
snipping weapon. A specialist piece. This:
virulent (deadly) combination is for one
purpose, and one purpose only-to fire CNE
well placed shot. So cach self-defense unit
needs only one such weapon at this time..
There is nothing else to say about that.
The assault rifle is either semi-
automatic or preferable one that can be
fired either semi-automatic or fully auto-
matic. The limit here is that posed by the
limit of the enemy's arsenal. Here we will
discuss the most common seen in our
communities carried by the gestapo pig
forces. The AR-15 caliber .223 is the semi-
automatic civilian model called "sporting"
model of the M-16 used in Vietnam. The M-16
fires either semi-auto or fully auto. After
the lives of many brothers were lost in
Vietnam because the weapon was new and un-
tested, it has now been de-bugged and is:
fairly reliable. It can be found on all
military bases and sole gestapo polico ar-
senals. The AR-15 was taken off the public
market and has been replaced by the AR-
180 caliber .223. The AR-180 does not
appear to be as good as the AR-15. How-
ever, many rig departments are stocking
up on them.
M-14
Another very good assault rifle is
the M-14 caliber 7.62M Nato (.308 in
English). This is a very gcod weapon al-
though it has been replaced by the ligh-
ter M-16 in the fascist military. Most
national guard units, at least here in.
California, are equipped with the M-14.
Check your local National Guard, availa-
bility.
The Thompson Sub-Machine gun if in
good working order is very reliable in
..45 ACP caliber. It fires either seni or
fully auto. Che rewarding feature is it
uses the same ammunition as the .45
automatic pistol cutting down on the
variety of ammunition necessary for you
Litnah
Finally the age-old Ml-Garand
caliber 30-06. Very good, plenty of t
around, heavy and accurate way out, e
to get and plenty of ammo. around. Ch
your pawn shops and gun shops also sc
national guard units and college ROTC
units have them readily available.

Assault rifles are to be used in
fire fights, more commonly known as s

around the world also use assault rif
to annihilate (wipe out) their enemy

ESSAYS FROM
THE LINISTER OF DETEUSE
"IN DFFNSE OF SELL DEFENSE:
HUEY NEWTON
THE CORRECT HANDLING OF A REVOLUTION.”
The Vanguard Farty must provide leadership for the people. It mus
teach the correct strategic methods of prolonged resistance through lit
erature and activities. If the activities of the party ore respected b
the people, the people will follow the example. This is the primary jo
of the party. This knowledge will probably be gained second-band by th
masses just as the above mentioned was gained indirectly. When the peo
le learn that it is no longer advantageous for them to resist by going
into the streets in large numbers, and when they see the advantage in t
activities of the guerrilla warfare method, they will quickly follow th
example.
But first, they must respect the party which is transmitting this
message. When the Vanguard group destroys the machinery of the oppress
by dealing with him in small groups of three and four, and then escapes
the might of the oppressor, the rasses will be overjoyed and will adher
to this correct strategy. When the masses hear that a gestapo policon
has been executed while sipping coffee at a counter, and the revolution:
executioners fled without being tried, the masses will ses the validit
of this type of approach to resistance. It is not necessary to organiz
thirty million block people in primary groups of two's and three's but
important for the party to show the people how to go about revolution.
During slavery, in which no vanguard party existed and forms of communi.
cation were severely restricted and insufficient, many slave revolts oc-
curred.
I
The Black Panther Party for Self Defense teaches that in the final
analysis, the amount of guns and defense weapons, such as hand grenades
bazookes, and other necessary equipment, will be supplied by taking the
weapons from the power structure, as exemplified by the Viet Cong. The
fore, the greater the military preparation on the part of the oppressor
the greater is the availability of weapons for the black community.
is believed by some hypocrites that when the people are tought by the
vanguard group to prepare for resistance, this only brings the men down
on them with incrasing violence and brutality; but the fact of the nati
is that when the men becomes more oppressive, this only heightens the re
olusionary fervor. The people never make revolution. The oppressors by
their brutal actions cause the resistance by the people. The vanguard
party only teaches the correct methods of resistance. So, if things car
get worse for oppressed people, then they will feel no need for revoluti
or resistance. The complaint of the hypocrites that the Black Panther
Party for Self Defense is exposing the people to deeper suffering is an
incorrect observation. People have proved that they will not tolerate a
more oppression by the racist dog police through their rebellions in the
black communities across the country. The people are looking now for
guidance to extend and strengthen their resistence struggle.

The National Committees to Combat Fascism, organizing bureau
of the Black Panther Party would like to inform the communities
of the childrens free breakfast program at this time.
The breakfast programs are not only to feed the children in
our community but also to bring the children, parents, and all
people of the community together, to work and see to it that every
child is fed a balanced breakfast each morning.
This being the peoples breakfast, our goal is to spread this
program throughout the communities in Michigan. This is the peoples
program and without the peoples support we have nothing. Since this
is a basic necessity, it has to be met..

when you can get behind a car or something,
in making yourself as small a target as

PRESS RELEASE
OCTOBER 25, 1970
i
1
"
On October 24, 1970, at approximately 6:30 PM, two racist pigo
from the 2nd Precinct, without provocation, brutally beat 2 black youths
on the corners of Myrtle and 16th Streets. Two brothers from the local
National Committee To Combat Fascism, interceeded, simply exposing the
police brutality to the people in the community, and they also were
beaten by the pigs. People in the crowd that had formed came to the
brothers aid and began to attack the pigs. At this point, Mod Squad,
bootlicking, yardnigger pigs Forrest Harvey, Glenn Smith and Marshall
Emerson, responding to their masters orders and wantonly opened fire on
masters
the crowd.
The crowd defended theselves and one treacherous dog police was
dead and to others layed wounded. Many people from the community' ran
into the newly opened National Committee to Combat Fascism office at
3376 16th Street.
The Detroit gestapo forces moved in with its overkill machinery,
which included 2 tanks, automatic weapons and other types of lethal
weapons exactly like the ones these same imperialist. use in Vietnam.
The pigs indiscriminately opened fire on our office and other houses in
the community. The fork tongued police have said that they used "great
restraint," but we know that if it wasn't for the swift actions taken
by the black community and other progressive people, Commissioner
Nicholas' henchmen would have committed mass murder. The sisters and
brothers in the N.C.C.F. office, not taking the word of lying pigs, re-
fused to come out and didn't do so until they were insured by trusted
✓ people from the community that conditions were favorable.
We see this as part and parcel of the relentless attempt by the
fascist, U.S. government to destroy the Black Panther Party and its or-
ganizing bureau's, The National Committee to Combat Fascism. For the
last six months, since the Nixon, Agnew, Mitchell, Hoover gang has been
oinking its fascistic "law and order" rhetoric, gangsters, disguised as
"guardians of the law" have attacked Black Panther Party and National
Committee to Combat Fascism offices, all across the country. Our Party
offices and N.C.C.F. offices in Philadelphia, New Orleans, Toledo, Ohio
and New Bedford, Mass. have been under attacked by the forces of re-
pression. And now, here in Detroit, police Commissioner Nicholas' and
NW 88296 Docld:32989574 Raget forces have joined in this fascist act.

--- Image 124-10179-10221_page_360.jpeg ---
However, we want the people here in Detroit and throughout the world
to know that the Black Panther Party and its organizing bureau's, the
National Committed to Combat fascism, will not quiver in the wake the U.S.
inspired onslaught that is being waged against our Party, Black people'
and other oppressed people throughout the world. And we have said it be-
fore and we will say it again:
THE RACIST DOG POLICEMEN MUST WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY FROM OUR COMMUNI-
TIES AND THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WORLD, CEASE THEIR WANTON MURDER ANL
BRUTALITY AND TORTURE OF OPPRESSED PEOPLE, OR FACE THE WRATH OF THE ARMED
PEOPLE.
The Courts in Detroit are holding our comrades in Preventive deten-
tion and have placed a astronimical ransom on our sisters and brothers.`

Dear Sir:
The Free Breakfast for School Children has covered the
the country and has been initiated in every city where there
is a Black Panther Party and National Committee To Combat
Fascism. This program was created because we as black
people and human beings understand that our children need
a nourishing breakfast every morning so that they can learn.
These breakfasts include every nutrient that they need
for the day. For too long our people have gone hungry and
without the proper health aids they need. It is beautiful .
to see our children eat in the morning for it is a fact this
enables them to think.
!
To begin and continue this program it takes donations
from concerned people, businessmen, merchants and grocers
who draw their profits from the black and oppressed people
in Detroit. We need donations of foods which can be stored,
such as cereal, grits, sugar, cocoa, salt and pepper, jelly
and cooking oil, also syrup.
We need daily and weekly donations of perishable foods
such as eggs, milk, oranges, bacon, sausage, ham, butter,
bread and cheese, etc..
We need donations of money to bùỷ food and utensils with
which to prepare the breakfast.
If you want to help make the Free Breakfast for Children
a program that truly satisfies the pressing needs of Black
People, donate or offer your services.

History of the Secret Army Organization
CONFIDENTIXE
One early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and
imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had
brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles
as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.
After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the
Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had
effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-
ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial
support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-
-nating organization was greater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity
by communists in the United States.
With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of
action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next
morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to
merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command
`. of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a
General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.
While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was
decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a
completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-
tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach
would be needed. Never again could the arrest or death of a few leaders be allowed to
cripple the entire organization.
For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type
orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original
force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army
Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national
and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the
S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as
the freedom fighters of tomorrow.
The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have
no desire to commit suicide ourselves, or to let our members do so. We have a
strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.
We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country
is worthy of any sacrifice. If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

in the charber, the first thing..
to deal with is proper s
alignment.
¡Sight aligament is lining up your fr-
•ont sight with your rear sight and both
lined up on the target is called the
eight picture". The correct sight pic-
ture basically is having the front not
jtco high or too low, not to the right
or to the left, but having the taiget
resting on top of the front sight. The
sight picture will not always appear
perfect, but if the correct sight pic-
Aure is understood practice will bring
improvement.
The next thing to get down with is
trigger squeczo. That's right you¨:sq-
usezo the trigger, you don't pull it
for jerk it, contrary to what ever you
I saw on t.v., trigger squeeze is a pro-
cess of putting show steady pressure
on the trigger until a shot goes off.
If you try to anticipate the skot, you
Will jerk and mess up your aim.
It would be ideal if you could incor-
porate into your group a veteran of the
pigs' military service. Veterans are of
great value and assitance in helping with
the above training also when you are re-
:ady to begin practice with live ammunit-
ion. When practicing with live ammunition
make sure your location is where you
on't be hasseled by pigs. Actual combat
| conditions can be deadly as a training
ground. When practicing with live ammO.,
remember it is valuable. Don't just start
popring caps for the heck of it; the wh-
ole purpose is to prepare yourself to be
a Match for One Hundred" which will only
come about as a result of correct practice.
."
One thing to guard against is flinching.
Flinching is caused by being intimidated
by the sound and kick of your weapon. With
proper trigger squeeze and breath control,
you won't have any problems with flinching.
If you have problems keeping all your shots
in a fairly smell group or if you have a
problem just getting your shots on the tar-
get anywhere you are probably flinching.
Have someone watch you as you fire and they
ll be able to tell you whether or not you
hare flinching.
.
B
The basic thing in the training of members
of self-defense groupsis to know how to han-
3 fire arms of all types, hand guns, rifles
shot-guns
'chine guns, etc.
The use of different types of aucunition
and explosives should be considered also.

I will begin by pointing out that te "must
not allow the racist poyer structure to defi

we use like everything else in this society
in the service of the racist capitalist band
They control the educational institutions, t

are trapped by the rhetoric (words) of the s

it has been the guns and force manifested in
the racist pig cops that occupy our communit

a pig by any reens, sniping, stabbing, bombi

Take a (water) pipe about 3" in diameter

Screw on bottom cap then put wadding in
the botton. (Wadding can consist of card-
board, rubber or toilet tissue) for tighter
packing and prevent leaking. Put in about
one inch of shot or scrap metal, then put
tube with BLACK POWDER packed in it and
put fuse into pipe taped at emis, then poub

inch space at top of pipe for top adding

Tut top pipe cap on and tighten.. Then bend

taken out away from people so the person

upon the placement of the container.
PART 5 HOW TO COMBAT C.M.I.
The principal of Juche (self-reliance)
clarified by Eldridge Cleaver, the Minister
of Information to the Black Panther Party,
is "use what you got to get what you need."
To answer the question of how do you combat
the pigs' C.M.I. (communication, mobility
and information), we must first determine
✅ what we have going for ourselves. Checking
out the practice of self-defense groups, we
see that we have the power to determine what
is to happen, when it is to happen and how
it is supposed to go down. What, When and
Now (W.W.H.)—the clement of surprise. The
pigs have C.H.I. and self-defense groups
have W.W.H.
To consider a self-defense operation sus
cessful: to just plan and execute bu
to plan, excute AD cscape. There have be
too many instances where members of self-
defense groups have planned and executei
righteous blows against this racist system
only to be captured, wounded or killed. 1
are the consequences for revolutionary act
ivity, however we must keep casualties tib
an acceptable minimum. The slogan must be
Maximum Damage to the Enomy, länimum Damay
to Us. Practice has shown that when planni]
W.W.H. if it is done th knowledge and an
understanding of C.M.I. casualties will be
kept within an acceptable minimum. Too oft
much attention is given to a plan up to th
point of execution without giving the same
attention to evasion and escape, that phase
of the operation that determines success,
This is a subjective approach, a one-sided
approach. W.W.H. is only one side of the c
C.M.I. is the other side. Because self-def
groups use .W.H., the pigs' C.M.I. does no
go into operation until a self-defense gro
commits itself by actually executing some i
of self-defense activity.
All of us should be aware that once C.M.I
is activated pigs start showing on the set
from 30 seconds to 1 minute maximum in ever
major city in Babylon, therefore the succes
or failure of a defense operation is depend
upon the attention given to C.M.I. and the
planning of evasion and escape. As I see it
learning to deal with the pigs' C.M.I. is t
number one military problem facing revoluti
forces in Babylon today, It is time for all
have something to teach, by example, to sto
forward. And remember, to die honorably, on
does not need company.

Fifteen members of the local National
¡Committee to Combat Fascism, the organizing
bureau of the Black Panther Party, are in jail.
Each of them has been charged with first degree
murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
They were in or near the N.C.C.F. office
on Saturday evening, October 24, when two rigs
beat two black youths who were selling the Black
'Panther Newspaper. The people in the community
· responded by defending the two brothers; and.
"
when more pigs came on the scene with their
•
guns out and shooting, the people again de-.
fended themselves, leaving one pig dead and ..
another wounded. A whole army of officers
converged upon the N.C.C.F. office, and
finally, after about eight hours, the 15.
sisters and brothers inside surrendered.

To. Mospective Members Of The
SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL
The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and
most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.
We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had
learned his job.
Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political
situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have
developed and supervised our training program.
OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER
It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our
nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must
know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what
they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.
THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development.
The Underground Network
1)
2)
Active Guerrilla Warfare
3)
Open or Conventional Warfare
The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against
the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.
The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system
must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.
Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member
of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of
all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-
la activities.

UBI WITH TUK ULD THO0101
IN DITO THE NEW
The pig media has been broad-
casting the resignation of Chief
Pig Commissioner Murphy as a
great loss to Detroit and again for
New York. The pig, media is oinking
that Detroit has lost a great pig
Commissioner who is well
experienced and has done many
things to improve Detroit and the
police forces here. At the same
time that the Detroit Pig Dept.
is expressing great sorrow for
such a grevious loss, they wish
him luck in his exciting and new
job. So with tears in their eyes
the Detroit Pig Dept. pig Mayor
The
Cribbs etc., wish him a fond PIG CHIEF MURPHY
farewell.
To black people and other op-
pressed people the whole buildup
and play sounds like a story from
Mother Goose. That's exactly what
it is, one of the biggest fairy
tales the pigs have ever tried to
get over. Pig Murphy and no other
pigs have done anything for poor
and oppressed people. To get the
books straight, pig Murphy didn't
have a choice on whether to resign
or not, he was told either to re-
tire or get another job. To dig
where I am coining from, you must
understand how and who controls
the
oppressive pig forces in
Detroit and the events that lead to
pig Murphy getting his hat. The
pig forces are controlled by the
D.P.O.A. (Detroit Police Officers
Association). Chief Detective,
Field Lt. and related conspirators.
Murphy got the position of Chief
Pig Commissioner during the time
he was an Inspector for the New
York Pig Dept. This made a lot
of top pigs in Detroit mad because
they had been working on the pig
force all their low-lives and
thought that if anybody should get
the position it should come out of
their little circle instead of a pig
from New York that nobody ever
heard of. So antagonistic con-
ditions existed from the jump.
Many things came into play that
strained the relationship between
the Pig Commissioner and the
D.P.O.A.
The black community began to
respond to the continuous pig bru-
tality and murder of black people
with shots of gun fire and dead
pigs. Pigs were getting up-tight
because all across the nation
people were defending their homes
Mann
E
the pig administrators and the pig
Commissioners by the D.P.O.A.,
the Chief Detective and the top
pigs to give them more liberties
to deal with the people. The stop
and frisk laws and the no-knock
laws were passed to benefit these
racist pigs. Other demands were
made to pig Murphy
Murphy by the
D.P.O.A. The N.C.C.F. (organi-
zing bureau of the Black Panther
Party) was beginning to grow
rapidly and these racist dogs
demanded the green light to vamp
on our office. The Pig Com-
missioner told them to hold off
until they could get a warrant or
a trumped-up conspiracy charge.
• Two major
major events happened
recently within the black com-
munity that caused pig Murphy to
get his walking papers quick. In
the area around the N.C.C.F. office
on Indiandale, members of the
N.C.C.F. and people in the com-
munity were putting up posters and
passing out free posters to the
community. The pigs came into the
area and began tearing the posters
down and rassing the people,
Shouts of "Kill the pigs" and
“get out of our community” came
from the people as they dug the pigs
tearing up their posters. The next
day a news car that lookedexactly
like a pig's car came into the
area to take pictures and to get
posters. Someone in the com-
munity thought that it was the pigs
intimidating the people once again,
therefore they righteously shot at
them. When the report of the
shooting got to the 10th precint,
these pigs immediately saw their
chance vamp on our office.
Without notifying Pix Murphy and
the rest of the pigs downtown the
alled in all their units
to
Indiendale Weet a message froin
the Iith preenit that we better be
out of Detroit by 10:00 p.m.
A press conference was held at
our office and the only news re-]
porters that were present were the
very ones who had been shot at.
We informed them that the shots
didn't come from our office and
they agreed that they didn't be-
lieve they did. Pig Murphy realized
that he didn't have an alibi to
justify a raid on the office, so he
told the 1th precint to call the
raid off. This sent the D.P.O.A.
the Chief Detective, Field Lt.
etc, into an outrage. They had ex-
posed their half-track tanks in the
parking lot of the 10th precint and
flooded the Indiandale area with
mod-squad pics but most of all
they didn't feel that they had to
justify raiding a Panther office
and pig Murphy had the audacity
to call it of. There wasn't any
future at all left for pig Murphy
in Detroit. The fascist D.P.O
hooked up their machinery to
either force Murphy to come down
on the black community and raid
our office on Indiandale or lose his
job, one way or the other. In-
formation started flooding our
office that the fascist pigs were
really putting pressure on Murphy
to raid our office.
This was the last straw for pig
Murphy, the D.P.O.A., the Chie
Detective. Ku Klux Klan etc.
had hooked up and demandeda nev
pig Commissioner, pig Murphy
was pawned off to New York agai
and the stage Wils set for
completely new fascist pig Com
missioner. Nigger Sheriff Lucas
coat-tail had been pulled to refuse
the top payi Commissioner's jo
if he wanted to stay en good re-
lations with his bosses. They ha
just got pig Murphy out and ye
Anow they couldn't trust a nigges
in that position even if he is a goo
nigger. Now the lying pit news
papers are saying that it will b
hard to decide who will be the nex
pig
Commissioner. Well th
D.P.O.A., the Chief Detectiv
Field Lt. and Roman Gribbs hay
already decided. If there is an
doubt about who the next pig Com
missioner is it must be a toss
up between Hitler and Spiro Agnes

The Association of Black Students, Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored a rally in
support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring
HUEY P. NEWTON.
Oakland University, was that
the working classes, the
join forces as a united
The main theme of the speech given by HUEY P.
NEWTON on November 16, 1970, at
all poor blacks and poor whites,
oppressed of the world, must all
body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.
NEWTON repeatedly referred to this "ruling circle" through-
out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling
circle" as those leaders of Government and industry, the
imperialists or those who are rich in this society. NEWTON
wanted equality for everyone with no one being superior to
his fellow man. He indicated the Negro is a class brother
with the poor whites and they must join in their effort to
overcome the "ruling circle."
NEWTON stated, "The Black Panther Party is the
vanguard of the revolution on à world-wide level because the
world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist
to a greater level and, therefore, we are the greatest
Marxist-Leninists that ever lived, and we say this not to
be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else
would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the
burden is heavy."
In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a rambling,
many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key
revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection
between the BPP and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBW), as well as a unity between the BPP and all oppressed
persons of the world.
A characterization of the LRBW is contained
in the appendix pages attached hereto.
His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,
freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed
brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

LARRY POWELL, member of the Detroit NCCF, conducted
the political education classes on July 5, 1970, at which time
the topic of discussion was the center page of the July 4,
1970, issue of "The Black Panther" newspaper.
Those in
attendance were instructed as follows:
Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it.
Put your words into action. Use the slogan "all power to
the people" as the pigs think they are the power. Now we
have to add to our slogan "death to the pigs," so stop
talking and start putting your words into action. The pigs
are planning genocide against us. The reason there are more
pigs in the community this year than last year is because
they are planning to get rid of all blacks, and they want all
blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to
do is put a fence around it and give them just enough money
to get food. They want to take everything away from us, but
we still have the power to destroy and there is no way the
pigs can destroy the BPP. If they kill us off, our struggle
will be taken up by the people in the community as we are
the people's party. If we don't go to the people then we
are not serving the people. Our struggle is not confined
and exists also in the South in the field of Civil Rights.
We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression
and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed peoples.

"I say hungry children should be fed. Not
because they got money but because they're hungry..
This morning the children sitting here at this
free breakfast for children program.
This is
Chairman Bobby Seale's idea. He organized the
breakfast for childrens program for you children
and you know where Chairman Bobby Seale is right
now? He's in Connecticut. There fascist pigs
tried to murder him in the electric chair for
feeding all the children.
"
"Now you children know what we are going to
do to the pigs for that? Right on. (Group in
background replies "Right On.")
"Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton of the Illinois
Chapter of the Black Panther Party was murdered in
his sleep for implementing the socialistic programs
that Chairman Bobby Seale laid down for him. The
free breakfast for children program, the free
medical health care clinic is why.
"He was murdered in his sleep, you know?
(response from group in background "Right On.")

"You can look at, you can look at the pigs
and you can see every time somebody tries to help
the people are do some for the people or serve
the people like the members of the Black Panther
Party and National Committees to Combat Fascism
do, the pigs will vamp down on them. Pigs will
start coming down on them hard. And that shows:
you that they're doing their job. But there's
a lot of people running around here who call
themselves serve the people call themselves
so-called revolutionaries, you know. And the
pigs they don't care nothing about them. They
don't look at them twice. All the pigs do is
laugh at them. And you know they ain't doing their
job. You know: Revolution comes out the barrel
of a gun, not out of the sleeve of no dashaki.

The speech appeared to be rather poorly organized
and NEWTON was easily diverted from the main topics which
he seemed to be pursuing. The speech had very few references
to any actual radical action or violent confrontation.
The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the
Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUEY NEWTON.
NEWTON stated that the working class will be the
ones to carry out the "revolution" and carry the "revolution
banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the
new order. Throughout his speech; NEWTON talked about the
new order which will occur when the world is taken over by
Communism. Throughout the speech, NEWTON refers to capitalism
stating that while it has caused many problems, it has also
laid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the
wealthy are the ruling circle and named ROCKEFELLER and FORD
as being in this circle. NEWTON stated that they offered
troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a
definite answer on their proposal.

doors were open prior to 10:00 a.m., and persons admitted
after a thorough search, for a fee of $2.00, except Negro
females, who were charged 25 cents. Those persons attending
the speech were advised that they were not allowed to leave,
applaud, or stand during the speech, and that anyone leaving
could not return. NEWTON arrived at approximately 11:30 a.m.,
and spoke on Marxist-Leninist theories placing particular
emphasis on the Russian Revolution and its relationship to
the BPP. The body of the speech was concluded at 1:45 p.m.
At approximately 1:00 p.m., most of the audience had left
because they were unable to understand NEWTON and were

served a car traveling at a high rate of speed, which had
the trunk lock punched out. This vehicle was stopped and
the three Negro occupants exited the car and the driver was
asked for his registration, but claimed he had none. OLIVER
MC CLURE, leader of the Detroit NCCF, began swearing at the
police officers and the driver, WILLIAM BYRON MC CLURE,
brother of OLIVER, also began yelling insults. WILLIAM
MC CLURE jumped on one of the officers' backs and appeared
to grab for his gun, which fell to the ground, and was picked
up by a second officer. While the officers were struggling
with the MC CLURES, an additional scout car arrived and the
third passenger of the car, THOMAS KIRK WARD, also a member
of the Detroit NCCF immediately jumped one of the officers
from this car. The above three individuals were subdued

Detective Lieutenant WILLIAM MC COY, Security

advised on July 30, 1970, that about 9:30 a.m., this date,
a Channel 50 television news car was in the vicinity of
Detroit NCCF headquarters, 2219 Indiandale, Detroit, when
a Negro male, age 25 to 30 years, 6'2", 200 pounds, with
beard and moustache, fired three shots at the news car from
the porch of the office. There were no injuries to the
occupants of the car, which was probably in the vicinity to
film traffic signs in the vicinity of the above office, which
had been painted black and had posters pasted on them.
On October 24, 1970, Detective Lieutenant WILLIAM

two Detroit Police Department Officers put out a radio
"officer in trouble" call due to difficulty in subduing
individuals who had been given loitering tickets, apparently
in connection with their distributing NCCF literature.
Two unmarked patrol cars with plain clothes officers
responded and arrived in the area almost immediately, however,
a crowd had gathered and one of the officers was recognized
and the crowd began to attack the car with bottles and rocks.
When the officers attempted to leave the area by driving across
a vacant lot, the car was hit by gunfire and one officer
suffered minor injuries.
The second police car had stopped near the corner
of 16th and Myrtle near an NCCF office and a short time later
another shot hit one of the patrolman on the back of the head. ·
and he was dead on arrival at the hospital.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS
CONFIDENTIAL
Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization
seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.
Look at it this way. · Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and
training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-
cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to
have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit
that you you knew little or nothing about?
Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-
ground project, he must undergo a period of training. During this training he will be
directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may
be observed by other members without his knowledge. Only when a new member
proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate
effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate
with other unit members in a teamwork operation.
EXPENSES ·
Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every
effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you
must expect to pay your own way.
Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month. This money is
absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence-network, and to maintain
training areas.
Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is
engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and
other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to
buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During
this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,
marksmanship training, etc.
Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an
existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or become part of an underground network.
Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a
definite series of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be
expected of you.
We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately
needs patriots at this time.

DE T-26 advised on November 30, 1970, that one of
the trucks being driven by the Detroit NCCF members headed for
the Constitutional Convention in Washington, D.C. broke down
on the turnpike near Pittsburgh, on November 26, 1970. While
stopped, they called Washington, D.C. and determined that the
convention had been called off and were instructed to return
to Detroit. The group was upset upon receipt of this infor-
mation but decided to return to Detroit, and the truck that
had broken down was left to be repaired and the rest of the
· convoy made a U-turn on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and headed
back to Ohio. Upon reaching the end of the Pennsylvania
Turnpike, all vehicles had to pay the full toll after which
they again called Washington, D.C. and determined that the
convention had been re-scheduled so they turned around and
headed back to Washington, D.C. picking up the truck which had
broken down en route.

On December 2, 1970, Detective WILLIAM HENNAHAN,

Electric Company, who advised that a crew from the electric
company went out to check the meter at 611 Continental,
Detroit, a NCCF office, which is in the rear of the house,
as the house was occupied and a request for service had not
been received. They discovered that the meter had been
jumped and were going to disconnect service at the meter
but were chased away by occupants of the house. The electric
company is not going to take any further action as they
consider it too dangerous to attempt to cut off the electricity
and are going to let the NCCF have the electricity.

LEAGUE OF REVOLUTIONARY BLACK WORKERS
Also known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement
(DRUM)
A source advised on April 22, 1970, that the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW) is a black
extremist labor union, with headquarters at 179 Cortland,
Highland Park, Michigan, in the greater Detroit metropolitan
area. Source advised that the LRBW is attempting to oust
the United Auto Workers (UAW) from their position as
bargaining representative for black workers in the Detroit
area automotive plants. Source advised that the LRBW has
used threats of violence against both black and white
supervisory personnel and UAW leaders in an attempt to
intimidate them into an agreement with LRBW demands. The
LRBW has referred to the automotive industry and the UAW
as "racist".
A second source advised that membership in the
LRBW is limited to Negroes only, by virtue of the LRBW
constitution which states "membership is denied to all
honkies due to the fact that said honkey has been the
historic enemy, betrayer and exploiter of black people."
Membership in the LRBW is less than 25 persons.
The second source also stated that the LRBW had'
suborganizations operating at Ford Motor Company which was
known as the Ford Revolutionary Union Movement (FRUM) and
Eldon Avenue Gear and Axle Plant (ELRUM) as well as other
assembling and supplying plants, but that at the present the
LRBW is active only at the Dodge Main Assembly Plant in
Hamtramck, Michigan. This suborganization is known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM). The other
suborganizations are now defunct.

CUNTIDENTIAL
BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPF
also known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPF Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP..
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the EPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere.".
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it.'
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct
overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is... by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,-
until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."
The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP,
Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA. .

"INNER CITY VOICE
11
The "Inner City Voice" (ICV) was registered
with the Wayne County Clerk's Office, Assumed Names Division
on August 4, 1967, by KENNETH JOHN WATSON, under Certificate
Number 208945.
A bulletin entitled, "Build Black Newspaper"
dated July, 1967, stated, "A group of black revolutionaries
in Detroit, Michigan, have begun work on the production of
a new newspaper. It is hoped that the first edition of the
'Inner City Voice', will appear on the newsstand in August
of 1967." According to the bulletin, the ICV's goal is the
building of a mass circulating revolutionary propaganda
program. The bulletin stated the newspaper was to concentrate
on local news, cultural and social events, as well as providing
coverage of radical politics.
A source advised on March 17, 1970, that the ICV
was published from July of 1967 through June of 1968, when
it was terminated. In the fall of 1969 a newspaper similar.
to ICV appeared on Detroit newsstands which was called
"SAUTI", meaning Voice in Swahili. This publication, in its
first edition stated that it emerged from the ICV, and its
purpose, in addition to the above, would be to exist as the
official organ of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBW). In January of 1970, an edition of "SAUTI" stated
that it would continue publication under the old name of
"Inner City Voice" and would provide coverage of the black
extremist labor movement. In the spring of 1970, the ICV did
not publish the inflammatory articles which were common in
1967-68, but called for the overthrow of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) leadership and control of black workers at
Detroit area auto plants.
Source advised that the editors of the ICV are
KENNETH JOHN WATSON, LUKE SAMUEL TRIPP, „GENERAL GORDON BAKER,
MICHAEL C. HAMLIN and RONALD LEE MARCH, all of whom source
identified as members of the Central Committee of the LRBW.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP),
also known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.
31
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
→
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere."
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct
overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is... by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."
The EPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA..

FREE THE DETROIT 15
The judicial system is proving
at every turn of events that it is
impossible for Black people to re-
ceive a fair trial in Babylon.
Fifteen members of the Detroit,
N.C.C.F. are illegally being held
in the Wayne County jail. Seven
brothers and eight sisters are
being held on charges of murder,
conspiracy to commit m.urder and
malicious destruction of police
property.
These charges stem from an in-
cident that happened On October
24th when a nine year old youth
and 2 members of the N.C.C.F.
were severly beaten by the fas
cist pigs The people in the com-
munity showed their contempt for
the pigs by hurling bricks and
· bottles in their direction. In
response, the pigs drew their guns
and hegan firing into the crowd
of people. An exchange of fire took
place between the pigs and an un-
known assailant. The results were
one dead pig and one wounded pig,
and a victory for the people.
Using this as an excuse the pigs
raided the N.CCF. office. The
brothers and sisters inside the of -
fice relating to Executive Mindate
No. 3, defended their home in a
confrontation that lasted from
6:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. the next
morning. The pigs had alerted the
national guard and they were about
to enforce the McCarran Act. If
- the whole community would have
heen armed the cowardly pigs
wouldn't have even come into the
community brutalizing the people.
* the brothers and sisters would not
be in jail and the people would
have had an even preker victory.
As it stands now they are all
being held on trumped-up charges.
The sisters have ransoms of
$10,000 with 2 surefties; the bro-
NW 88296* Docid:32989574 Page 428
"
thers' ransoms are $25,(°n except
for one brother (Erene, whose bail
ransom is $30,000;ius 2 surcities.
They have all been brutally
beaten and constantly harassed by-
the dogs since they have been in-
carcerated. Cassandra limps, (due
to a heating from the pigs). The
entire left side of Linda's face
is swollen from being beaten; .
David's face is also swollen, from
-being beaten. Kim's right forearm
was busted by a pig who slamed
a cast iron door on it. And Jerome
has severe burns (his face, neck,
years and right arm), from a pig
trying to set him on fire.
They were arraigned in court
on the 25th of October and had
their preliminary hearing on the
30th of October. A preliminary
hearing is held to determine if
the pigs have enough evidence to
prosecute the defendants<
If there isn't suf-
ficient evidence produced then the
defendant is to be released from
custody. The pigs realizing that
they didn't have any evidence what-
soever to continue the confinement
of the brothers and sisters,
decided to employ the fascist tac-
tics of "the 17-man citizens grand
jury”. This grand jury has been
given the authority to continue the
confinement of the defendant on
given word from the police de-
partment. "The 17-man citizens
grand jury' was ruled unconsti-
tutional by Genesee Circuit judge
Elra 11. Papp. Judge Papp ruled
against the grand jury lawon three
counts.
E
The first issue deals with the
provision in the law that a defense
attorney cannot see grand' jury
testimony from a witness until
after that witness has testified at
the trial: Judge Papp found that
4
**
.
;
this procedure does not "adiere
to the principles of a fair trial".
"Never could 1 effectively
prosecute or defend without
thorough investigation, disco:ery
and preparation", she said.
The second issue concerns the
right of an accused person to have
an effective attorney.
The judge ruled that an attorney
cannot be effective when he gets
a copy of grand jury testimony
during the trial.
"He can neither properly pre-
defense
pare a
nor can he
recommend to his client that he
.
plead guilty without knowledge of
what witnesses have said against
that client” Judge Papp said.
The third issue involves the
denial of a preliminary exami-
nation to persons indicated by a
citizens grand jury.
'Preliminary examination or at
least access to the grand jury
transcript before trial is vital for
one accused of a crime" she said,
A preliminary examination's
purpose is to determine if there
is evidence to force a person to
stand trial.
Judge Papp said that under the
citizens grand jury law, this is
done by inexperienced lay people
"acting as an arin of the pro-
secutor".
The pigs are desperately trying
to make a case. They have no
evidence, since all of the original
complaints and warrants have been
dismissed. But the fascists are
still trying to railroad these pro-
thers and sisters on make believe
trumped-up charges. This is just
another example of the need for a

tutional Convention

WAYNE. THEODORE ROBERTSON, leader of the Flint,
Michigan branch of the Detroit NCCF, lead a discussion at
2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan, on December 1, 1970, during
which the following items were discussed:
Tactics to eliminate the foot patrolman in the
black community through the use of three-man squads to attack
them and obtain their weapons and radios. The police are not
to be killed if possible, however, this is permissible if
there is no other means. The attacking of police stations
and knocking out power facilities was also discussed as a
future tactic.

On December 2, 1970, Detective WILLIAM HENNAHAN,
Security Section, Intelligence Division, Detroit Police
Department, advised that he was contacted by the Detroit Edison
Electric Company, and advised that a crew from the electric
company went out to check the meter at 611 Continental,
Detroit, an NCCF office, which is on the rear of the house,
since a request for service had not been received, and found
that the meter had been jumped. They were going to disconnect
the electricity at the meter but were chased away by occupants
of the house. The electric company is not going to cut the
wire at the pole as they consider it too dangerous and are
going to let the NCCF have the electricity.
The Flint Chapter of the Detroit NCCF has begun
work on fortifying the house at 2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan,
by placing plywood a few inches from the wall, which they
then plan to fill with sand.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)
1 so known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was .
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.
"
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression.
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere."
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon.
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct
overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is... by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."
The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA..

The Association of Black Students, Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored a rally in
support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring
HUEY P. NEWTON.
HUEY P. NEWTON is the Minister of
Defense, BPP.
speech given by HUEY P.
Oakland University, was that

The main theme of the
NEWTON on November 16, 1970, at
all poor blacks and poor whites,
oppressed of the world, must all
body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.
NEWTON repeatedly referred to this "ruling circle" through-
out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling
circle" as those leaders of Government and industry, the
imperialists or those who are rich in this society. NEWTON
wanted equality for everyone with no one being superior to
his fellow man. He indicated the Negro is a class brother
with the poor whites and they must join in their effort to
overcome the "ruling circle."
NEWTON stated, "The Black Panther Party is the
vanguard of the revolution on a world-wide level because the
world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist
to a greater level and, therefore, we are the greatest
Marxist-Leninists that ever lived, and we say this not to
be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else
would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the
burden is heavy."
In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a rambling,
many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key
revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection
between the BPP and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBW), as well as a unity between the EPP and all oppressed
persons of the world.
A characterization of the LRBW is contained
in the appendix pages attached hereto.
His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,
freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed
brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs,

On Sunday, November 15, 1970, a meeting of the
National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF), organizing
bureau for the BPP, was held at 2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan,
at which WAYNE THECORE/RODERTSON was in charge, Everyone
present was asked if they had a weapon and those that did not
were told to get one and that it was no big problem to obtain
weapons as all they would have to do is kill some "piça" and
take their weapons and equipment. ROBERTSON emphasized
that Flint was overdue in the killing of police officers and
also commented that if you owned a gun, there would never
be an excuse for being arrested for carrying a concealed
weapon as Flint Police Officers worked only two men to a
car and the officers should be killed if confronted. It
was also mentioned that they would attempt to get a black
policeman to become an informer for the NCCF.

Wayne State University, Student Center Building, made a
speech regarding the shooting of the Detroit Police Officers
on October 24, 1970, and stated that the white radicals
should support the Detroit 16. He stated that the "pigs"

On November 18, 1970, members of the Flint branch
of the Detroit NCCF, nailed 2 x 4s around the down stairs
windows as a framework for some heavy screen or fence which
they plan to stretch across the windows. WAYNE THEODORE
ROBERTSON ordered that sand should be brought in to bullet
proof the walls by using plywood sheets to box in an area
approximately three feet from the outer walls of the house
both upstairs and downstairs and then filling the area with
sand. They also feel that heavy screening on the windows
will prevent tear gas from being thrown or shot through the
windows. A sign "National Committee to Combat Fascism" has
been placed in front of 2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan.
A discussion was held as to the obtaining of gas
masks, water canteens, and a fire extinguisher.

The speech appeared to be rather poorly organized
¸d NEWTON was easily diverted from the main topics which
_seemed to be pursuing. The speech had very few references
to any actual radical action or violent confrontation.
The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the
Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUEY NEWTON.
NEWTON stated that the working class will be the
ones to carry out the "revolution" and carry the "revolution
banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the
new order. Throughout his speech,' NEWTON talked about the
new order which will occur when the world is taken over by
Comununism. Throughout the speech, NEWTON refers to capitalism
stating that while it has caused many problems, it has also
laid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the
wealthy are the ruling circle and named ROCKEFELLER and FORD
as being in this circle. NEWTON stated that they offerred
troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a
definite answer on their proposal.

The doors were open prior to 10:00 a.m., and persons admitted
after a thorough search, for a fee of $2.00, except Negro
females, who were charged 25 cents. Those persons attending
the speech were advised that they were not allowed to leave,
applaud, or stand during the speech, and that anyone leaving
could not return. NEWTON arrived at approximately 11:30 a.m. ;
and spoke on Marxist-Leninist theories placing particular
emphasis on the Russian Revolution and its relationship to
the BPP. The body of the speech was concluded at 1:45 p.m.
At approximately 1:00 p.m., most of the audience had left
because they were unable to understand NEWTON and were
getting fed up with the treatment they were receiving.

Wh
ho Are The Black Panthers?
"
The 10 point program of the Black Panthers Party begins "We want our freedom.
We want power to determine the destiny of our black community." The Black
people in America were brought here from their native land as slaves, and ever
since they have been kept on the lowest level of American society. They are
a community of people with their own history, economic life, and culture.
they've never had political power over their own community. The Black Panther
Tarly formed to fight for this political power.
Yet
But the founders of the Black Panther Party, led by Huey P. Newton, knew
what they had to have more than their goals. They had to understand how they
were going to achieve them. Huey's answer was "Serve the People" and "Pick up
the gun.". The Black Panthers realized that the people can be liberated only
-by their own efforts, and that the Panthers had to reach out to their community,
find out its needs, and respond to then. And they realized that- "political power
grows out of the barrel of a gun," that the people in the black community were
being mowed down by the police and had to defend themselves, and that political
· power over their community would never leave the hands of the rich and enter their
own hands unless they combatted the police--the army of the rich.
Huey first put his understanding of serving the people and picking up the
gun into practice when he and Bobby Seale went out one night with a hammer
and a shot gun to put up a stop sign that was badly needed by the community.
Bohhy stood guard with the shot gun while Huey hammered in the sign. Later,
the Panthers started many health clinics, breakfast for children programs, and
other community services.
Because of what the Panthers want for their people, because they are going
about getting it, and because the community is beginning to look towards them for
leadership, their enemy is scared. So scared that they have started a nation
1. wide campaign to destroy the Panthers. Fred Hampton was murdered in Chicago
while he slept, Bobby Hutton was murdered in Oakland, Calif. as he walked out
of a house with his hands up, both by police officers that still remain free.
Black Panther and N.C.C.F. offices all across the nation (L.A., New Orleans
Toledo, Philadelphia) have been attacked and ransacked by police officers. And
now Detroit joins the list, just as the N.C.C.F. here was beginning to start a
free community health clinic and to gain the support of the community.
But the Panthers continue to grow and sink deeper and deeper roots among
the people. And all of us poor and working people, black and white, should be
glad, should defend the Panthers and help them grow. For the Panthers are
fighting the enemy of all poor and working people: the rich (e.g. the owners
of GM) who run this country and control not only the black community but all of
·our communities, schools and factories. Huey says "We don't hate white people;
we hate the oppressor." And so do we. We say right on Huey P. Newton. Power to

It is indeed an honor to address this Seven-
eenth Convention of the Organization of Arab Students
In the United States and Canada. I wish to thank the
rganization for its kind invitation to Fatch to
ddress this conference which represents a corner-
stone of active Arab thought vis-a-vis the Palestinian
Revolution. It is evident from the delegatos, the
progi and the guests, that we are concerned here
hot with rhetoric but with conscious analysis, plan-
hing, and understanding of the importance of the
Falestinian Revolution and its far-reaching impact.

world's conscience and all busanistic values.

ever since they first realized that world colonialism
and expansionist Zionist settlor colonialism were
conspiring to rob them of their Palestinian homeland.
To Zionists, this was the first step toward seizurę
and control of the Arab nation's resources which
will effectively hinder its economic development and
cultural progress.

* As you also know, the Palestinian people sub-
sequent to the 1948 catastrophe have been subjected
to severe constraints, as well as dostitution, poverty,
dispersion, and persecution. It is indeed amazing
that this treatment has not led to the loss of the
Falestinian people's identity, destruction of their
will, and their total dispersion, as was originally
intended. The Palestinians' genuine revolutionary
will, their clear understanding that they are part
of the Arab nation and that their struggle against
Zionism-is-in-reality-the Arab nation's strugglo,
their ultimate victory, and their mature understanding
of the moral and human imperatives for the liberation
or their homeland are all various elements combined

failure of the Arab governments became blatantly
evident.
The beginning of 1965 signaled the end of
depordency and asserted the Palestinians' right to
take command of their own struggle. Hence the Falos-
tinian people formed the general framework of the
Revolution according to the following principles:
1. All action must be guided by a free and
independent Falestinian will in thought,
words, and deed.
2. Protecting the Revolution from any influerce
or interference from any Arab government and
avoiding involvement in the internal affairs
of the Arab governments.

7. Mobilizing the channeling forces in the Arab
world toward the Palestinian Revolution.
8. Rejecting the principle of conventional
warfare duo to the international imperialist
circumstances which protect the Zionist forces
in our occupied Palestine and due to the con-
tradictions in the Arab countries which
resulted in a passive atmosphere and led to
: continuous failure regarding the Palestinian
question, thus enabling the enemy to grow and
prepare for its next expansionist battle.
9. Adopting "armed struggle" as the only means
for the liberation of Falestine and "people's
war" as the only method for action.
10. Adopting the concept of "national security of
the Arab nation" instead of "divided regional
security" which parcels responsibilities and
leads its proponents into a morass of cost-
benefit accounting.
11. Rejecting any international patronage which
is inevitably allied to the interest of
colonialism and Zionist influence.
This persistont insistance of the Palestinian
people to rovolt, their conscious rebellion against
any and all attempts to impose upon them external
limitations or solutions, and their rejection of
rosettlement or compensation plans would have been
impossible were there not material, national, moral,
ard human imperatives far stronger than those external
forces.
The material imperative is clearly demonstrated.

the Zionist presence which caused and still causes
tremendous dislocation in the social and political
fibers of the Arab world. The result of this has
been the continuing backwardness of the Arab people
and will be their ultimate destruction.
From this point, the national imperative for
the Palestinian Revolution becomes apparent, for in
the process of liberating Palestine, the Revolution
will also destroy that ever-present expansionist
Zionist threat to the Arab people. By so doing, it
also destroys the most important stronghold for
world colonialism in the Arab land. Such develop-
ment would open the way for the Arab nation to assert
its cultural presence, material progress, and would
allow it to cooperate with the other nations of the
world. to realize peace.
The moral imperative of the Palestinian Revo-
lution finds concrete expression in the people's
rejection of the injustices heaped upon them, the
aggressions committed against their national ard
human rights and in their rejection of all forms of
oppression and injustice. This is what gives the
Falestinian Revolution its humanitarian fourdation
and goals since it is a struggle against world
Zionism whose foremost base is occupied Falestine.
Why?
--because Zionism is a movement of an aggressive and
racist nature, employing neo-Nazi fascist means to
achieve its expansionist settlement aims.
--because a Zionist victory in Palestine deprives all
previous liberation movements their human content.
Hence it follows:
1. The Palestinian Revolution does not aim at
annihilating the Jews, for such an act is
based on racism, against which the revolu-·
tion is struggling. Furthermore, the Arab

face all challonges and through their belief in
armed struggle as the moscapable path to freedom.
Though it is still in the developing stages, it
urdoubtedly will reach the required level of action
through continuous struggle. The remaining road is
still a long one, but it befits us to pause and
analyze the future prospects of the Revolution and
to shed some light upon its state since the June War.
It is evident that the Revolution today is
ng through a new phase in which two opposite
Is are active:

which has qualitatively changed the nature of the
confrontation and created a new spirit of commit-
ment and unity among the Palestinian people.
Second: The counter-revolutionary forces

Revolution by limiting our actions and forbidding
vs from acting in two critical fields: confronting
the onery, which when blocked prevents our commando
activity from evolving into a full-scale war of
national liberation; and, interacting with the Arab
masses in a revolutionary manner whose inevitable
eflects, the counter-revolutionary forces fear.
These two opposite orientations point directly
to the responsibility of the Palestinians and the
Argo citizens. They are to oppose all attempts to
impets the Revolution by following clear systematic
and organized action aiming at the escalation of the
armed struggle to the point where all aborting
attempts will be fruitless.
The catastrophe of June, 1967, has not only
proven the validity of the principles and strategy
of cur Revolution, it also pointed out many aspects
of the counter-revolutionary movements, the most
evident of mich and the following:

?
It is noticeable that after each catastropho
we have suffered starting with 1948 and onding
with 1967, the Arab nation found itself sub-
jected to tremendous political pressures in
which the international aspect completoly
overshadowed the Arab aspect, in general, and
the Falestinian aspect, in particular. These
pressures inevitably assert the new "fait
accompli" for Israel and further legitimise
Israeli military gains by giving them inter-
national sanctions and protection. The pres-
sures following the June War, however, are
of a special and more dangerous nature, since
they aim at completely liquidating the
Falostinian issue under the guise of "poli-
tical settlement" or so-called "peaceful
sottloment." Those offorts revolve around
three main points: returning to the pre-
June 5th situation in exchange for ending the
state of belligeroncy, ensuring safe frontiers
for Israel along with other international
guarantees, and destroying the identity of the
Palostinian struggle by creating what they
call a "frail political society," or tho
"duroy Palostinien identity,"
If we can say that the partition resolution
of 1947 opened the dossier of Zionist usurp-
tion of Palestine, then it is equally correct
to infer that the projects for "political
settlement" aim at closing that same dossier
pormanently. Likewise, as the 1947 partition
resolution gave the Zionists a political
ontity upon our land, the present efforts aim
at completing the past efforts by legitimizing
all the domands of that entity on one hand,
and putting, on the other hand, Palestinians
and the Arab people in the impotent position
of being unable to undertake or to justify any
future action for liberation.

poople, of whom the Falestinians are an inte-
gral part, have not known racism throughout
their long history.
2. Likewise, the Palestinian Revolution is not
an anti-semitic movement, for "anti-semitism"
is a Western concept alien to the Arab past.
3. The Palestinian Revolution aims at destroying
the Zionist structure in Palestino as repre-
inted by the political entity of the State
Israel. It has been pseudo-legitimized by
so-called international recognition which
ignored the will of the Falestinian people,
their right to self-determination and to
sovereignty on their Palestinian soil.
IC.
The Palestinian Revolution aims at regaining
the lost rights of the Palestinian people,
After the liberation of our homeland, we
shell live with those who will live with us
according to our inherent belief in the
principles of oquality, justice, and humanity.
The Palostinian people hate war as much as any
other people, but the continued presence of Zionism
on our land and the continued political existence of
leras ? our country impose war on us because the
victory of Zionism does not mean peace. It means
pontinuous oppression and dangor. Likewise, it
encourages all racist movements ard ideologies to
ect viciously against truth and justice. This leads
to nothing but war. Therefore, it is imperativo
that we fight, and fight until victory. This is a
just struggle for the welfare of justico and true
peace.
The Zionist movement today is a now form of
Nazism; in other words, opposing it and fighting it"
are human duties, for the struggle is merely an
xtension of the world's struggle against Nazism and
NW 88296. Docid:32989574 Page 464

the continuation of the long chain of human struggle
against forces of oppression, injuctice, and racism.
The destruction of Zionism, of the political entity
of Israel, is essential; otherwise, all those who gave
their lives in World War II and in all wars of
liberation throughout history will have died in
vain, will have been robbed of their imperatives and
values that motivated these sacrifices.
Brothers: In spite of their dispersion and
destitution, the Palestinian people stard today
through their Revolution as the front line of defense
of their rights, the Arab nation's right, and the
rights of humanity at large.
The principles of the Revolution, having been
declared long before the June, 1967, War, aim at
more than merely removing the effects of that aggres-
sion. The Revolution's basic principle, "Revolution
till Victory," means that it is a movement aiming at
the liberation of Falestine and the world from one
of the most dangerous international movements
threatening man's humanity, dignity, and freedom.
Thus, exposing Zionism's dangors and fighting it
everywhere is as important as the military struggle
being waged by your brothers in the occupied areas,
though obviously it is no substitute for it.
'
Having clarified the basic principles and the
position of the Palestinian Revolution, we must now
proceed to analyze the present condition of this
revolution and its strength in facing the future.
The Fedayeen vanguards of the Palestinian
people who began their commando activities against
the enemy on January 1, 1965, were, and still
are,
fully aware of the difficulties that lie ahead of
them on their road to revolution and freedom.
The phase through which we passed prior to
June, 1967, was that of preparation for the revo-
lution, preparation for it through steadfast.""

Now comes the role of the Arab governments.
Now comes the role of whoever grasps the
future implications of the Fales-
tinian Revolution, its needs, and
demands within the Arab realm.
The tremendous amount of Arab administrative,
intellectual, and executive efforts required by the
Falestinian Revolution are now clear.
"
It is also clear that at the present the duty of
the ab people is to direct their efforts within
th rab realm to serve the Revolution; solidify it;
aid it; fulfill its moral, financial, and material
needs...
This needed work in the Arab realm must be
carried out with complete dedication based on abso-
lute conviction that one's duty is to support and
to strengthen the Revolution, not to compete with
it by creating new organizations, then calling for
their unification on the pretext that, "unity is
preferable to division." One should protect the
Revolution by not creating differences within it and
then ask for their resolution on the grounds that
"such differences weaken the Revolution."
na
Brothers: It is necessary to believe in the
for strengthening the power of the Revolution
as a Falestinian national movement, not to weaken it
by introducing into it internal Arab contradictions,
be they regional, political, or ideological.
If they accept this concept of the Revolution,
the Arab citizen, the Arab political party, and the
Arab government can participate in the Revolution
just as much as the Palestinian. If fact, their
participation, emanating from such a clear undor-
•standing, is critical to the ultimate success of the
Revolution. For only. Chon would all the requirements
and needs mentioned ova be adequately met.
NW 88296.'Docld:32989574 Page 468.

Brothers: These are the basic tenets of the
Palestinian Revolution, the validity of which has
been unquestionably confirmed by the actual active
experience of the last four years. We must in all
honesty work to make this Rovolution more and more
successful until victory is attained. This is all
the more importent since the "honeymoon period" we
are experiencing with some Arab governments may come
to an abrupt eni in the near futuro, and this means
that the future holds possibilities and dangers
that can only be met by adopting the concepts and
strategies we have just discussed..
Brothers: Your responsibility here is not
less than that of your brothers who boar arms on
the field of battle in the occupied land. The
Revolution is a complexity of complementary efforts
nooding intellect, specialization, organization,
furris, and military capabilities, cach in its own
place, within a general framework emanating from a
clear vision of objectives and a clear understand-
ing of the underlying tenets and realities.
You bear a responsibility that your brothers
back home cannot bear and vice versa. Through
this basic complementary work, we must proceed to
our victory through our Revolution: Victory for
the Arab nation; victory for humanity.

resistance and in a manner drowned in secrecy due to
the tremendous pressures and limitations imposed
upon the Falestinian people by the Arab states,
These constraints and the concomitent secrecy were
the two prime obstacles preventing the creation of
a widespread cadres among the Palestinian people and
obstructing the cohesion of the vanguards and the
people. This, in turn, slowed down the growth of
the Revolution, for the organic development of the
ent requires a total merging of the Palestinian
P e with the revolutionary vanguards. They, in
turn, should unite with the Arab masses, for then
and only then will the Revolution come into its own
as a revolution that is Palestinian in inception,
Arab in depth, capable of effective action and con-
tinuous growth to meet the enemy's challonge.
MOV
After the June War, however, the Falestinian
Revolution moved from preparatory stage to the actual
launching of the revolutionary struggle. The June War
proved the validity of the operational and theoret-
ical Joundation underlying the Palestinian armed
struggle. The War turned opponents of the Revolu-
tion into supporters and to a great degree effectively.
silonged the doubters and the skeptics. In general,
a widespread shift in the attitude of the Arabs as a
W ; and the Palestinian people in particular,
occurred. Some changed because of their true belief
in the principles of the Revolution; others for
emotional reasons. We believe, however, that con-
tinued action, continued mobilization and organi-
zation, and continued struggle will alleviate the
dangers inherent in such an emotional allegiance,
and reinforce a principled commitment, which leads
to fusion between the Palestinian Revolution and the
Arab people in a conscious organized struggle.
"
Therefore, the Revolution must succeed as it
gradually acquires its Arab and human depth, for it
is a revolution based on the masses. It aims to
NW 88296 Docld:32989574 Page 465

alleviate the injustice that has befallen the Fales-
tindans as the first victims of Zionism, to safe-
guard the Arab rights insofar as they are the ultimate
goal of expansionist Zionism, and to reaffirm those
human rights that the world community cherishes and
that are threatened by racist movements everywhere
starting with Zionism,
27
Brothers: Since the basic aim of the Fales-
tinian Revolution is the liberation of Falestine,
it is clear that it must mobilize, absorb, and
utilise all Palestinian and Arab potentialities
regardless of their social and econoric status. It
was therefore inevitable that we should raise the
slogan of "non-interference in the internal affairs
of any Arab state. " This does not mean that we do
not recognize the relationship of the Falestinians
to the Arab people. It simply means that we considers
the current phase of our struggle as one of rational
liberation; and, therefore, the interest of the
Revolution is best served by avoiding entanglement
in secondary fights and sido issues. This is parti-
cularly feasible since Zionism is not opposed to any
specific Arab doctrine, but rather aims at the Arab
lams which it seoks to occupy, the Arab nation
which it seeks to destroy, and the Arab individual
whom it seeks to enslave. This only means that the
Arab states are also living in a state of national
struggle, for they, too, are threatened by the same
danger regardless of their political orientation.
This fact of paramount importance gives opposition
to Zionism the primary position in any ranking of
Arab problems. Furthermore, protracted armed con-
frontation with the Zionist enemy is certain to pro-
duce greater cohesiveness and cooperation among the
Arabs and will eventually destroy many of the ob-
stacles hitherto encountered on the path to unity.
The newly born Palestinian Revolution was
conceived of the will of the Falestinian people to

These dangerous prospects transcend the
above-mentioned goals into a systematic
psychological warfare that uses the mili-
tary debacle to create a feeling of impo-
tence among the Arab vis-a-vis Israeli
military superiority and hence to entrench
even further the fear of Israeli expen-
sionism. From here, it is but a short step,
after imposing the peace settlement, to
justify ending the period of armed resis-
tence against the Israeli aggression which,
in turn, would pave the way for striking
at the Falestinian resistence movement
and embroil it in secondary disputes that
would weaken it and divert it from its
woll-marked course of action against Zionist
occupation.
Brothers:
The Palestinian Révolution rejects
all such proposals and rationalizations, for in
reality it is but a new way of presenting an uncon-
ditional surrender leading to the eventual destruc-
tion of the Palestinian people. None of these
efforts acknowledges the basic premise of the Israeli.
This is the basic strategic
political entity.
foundation upon which the Falestinian Revolution
based and for which it strives under its slogan
volution until Victory." For this reason, armed
struggle must be escalated to a degree that will
paralyze the forces opposing the Rovolution.
The current phase of the Revolution is the
most critical one in spite of the victories we have
so far achieved. It is imperative that we confront
all those counter-revolutionary attempts and stand
fast by the Revolution, protecting it from the
internal Arab contradictions and partisan fights,
allowing it to concentrate on its main task and to
avoid secondary struggle. It is our duty to exert
our utmost pressure on the Arab governments and the
NW 88286 Dould:32989574sPage 46pport the Revolution instead
of competing with it or attempting to contain it
under the pretexts of its "Arab nature" or of
"increasing its effectiveness."
Actually, increasing the effectiveness of the
Revolution occurs in two main fields:
1. In the Palestinian realm, which includes
the Falestinian people and the armed
struggle in the occupied areas;
2.
In the Arab realm, which includes the
Arab people, lard, and government.
The Palestinian Revolution needs both the
Falestinian people and the Arab people.
The Revolution, likewise, needs the Arab land
as well as Palestine.
Training must occur on Arab soil.
Movement
of armaments and supplies must pass through Arab
lard.
Storage of arms and supplies must be in Arab
land. Financial support comes from the Arab people.
Information and news must go through Arab channels.
The mobilization and organization of the
Palestinian people must be accomplished in Arab land
where they are located.
All this means that the Revolution is affected
in one way or another by Arab conditions and Arob
power structures. This highlights the extent of the
effort to be expended in the Arab countries in order
to harness all the potential in support of the
Revolution. .
Now comes the role of the Arab citizen.
Now comes the role of the Arab organizations.
Now comes the role of the Arab political
parties.

ADDRESS BY THE AL-FATEH DELEGATION TO THE
SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT
OF THE ARAB PEOPLES
Cairo, January 1969
Friends,
In the name of the people of Palestine, in the name of the
Palestinian Revolution, in the name of Justice and Peace for
which we fight, we thank you for your concern and the concern
of your people in Justice and Peace in our part of the world.
We are very happy to have the opportunity to meet with you,
because you represent people who fought for peace based on justice.
We can see among you people who fought the Nazi invasion
and the fascist terror in Europe.
We also find among you people who fought, and are still
fighting, imperialism and colonialism and racial discrimination
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
We honestly feel that we stand among friends and comrades
who believe in the right of every people to self-determination and
its right to enjoy liberty on its own land, free of oppression and
discrimination.
***
Our people were deprived of their rights to self-determination
and to the enjoyment of life on their own land without oppression.
This was the result of a serious racist aggression carried out by
- an imperialist organisation: Zionism.
The aggression of the 5th of June is one manifestation of this
basic aggression that had its roots in the 19th century, and whose
culmination was the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
.The major victim of this aggression was the Arab Palestinian people
who were forced to evacuate their homes and land under a reign
of terror and oppression.

separate and distinct phenomenon, and we refuse to accept any
solution focussed on the results of the last aggression without
considering the source of the aggression itself.
The Resolution of the Security Council, November 22nd 1967,
and all further proposals explaining or modifying it, are inadequate
and irrelevant from our point of view, and therefore are totally
and categorically unacceptable to us.
All such proposals skirt the real issue and avoid its core,
namely: the right of the Palestinians to liberate their country, to
enjoy ad and homes, and to have the right to decide how they
want run.it.
We, the people of Palestine, are carrying on an armed revolu-
tion in order to re-establish peace with justice in the Holy Land.
***
We would like you to consider the magnitude of our problem.
For 'we are facing a Zionist structure that had its roots in 19th
century Europe, at the heart of the imperialist movement. Zionism
is one of the most oppressive and aggressive forms of imperialism,
one that has as its major goal the total uprooting of one people
from a country to replace them by another.
The roots of the aggression lie in the Zionist ideology itself,
with its belief in the need to bring a select, chosen people without
a land, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people.
methods used to accomplish this objective are terror,
oppret and deceit.
Let me quote one of the original Jewish pioneers in Palestine,
Nathan Choʻshi, who wrote to the editor of the Jewish Newsletter
in February 1959:
"If you really wanted to know what happened, we old Jewish
settler in Palestine who witnessed the fight could tell you how
and in what manner we Jews forced the Arabs to leave cities
and villages...Some of them were driven out by force of arms;
others were made to leave by deceit, lying and false promises.
It is crea gh to cite the cities of Jaffa, Lydda, Ramleh, Beer Sheba,
and from ang number.ess others." Nathan Chofshi conti-
nued. Yere have people was lived on its own land for 1,300
years. We care and turned the native Arabs into tragic refugees.

name. Instead of being deeply ashamed of what we did ana of
trying to undo some of the evil we committed, by helping those '
unfortunate refugees, we justify our terrible acts and even attempt
to glorify them."
Professor Erich Fromm, the noted Jewish writer and thinker,
had this to add: "It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they left
the country voluntarily, and that they therefore bear the responsi-
bility for losing their property and their land. But, in general
international law, the principle holds true that no citizen loses hi.
property or his rights of citizenship, and the citizenship right is :.
de facto right to which the Arabs in Palestine have much more
legitimacy than the Jews. Just because the Arabs fled?" Professor
Fromm asks. “Since when is that punishable by confiscation of
property and by being barred from returning to the land on which
a people's forefathers have lived for generations? The claim of
the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a realistic political claim.
If all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their
forefathers have lived two thousand years ago this world would
be a madhouse."
***
The Zionists went ahead coldbloodedly with their sinister
scheme to vacate Palestine of its people, by the use of terror,
massacres and frightening rumors.
Arthur Koestler, the pro-Zionist author, described what
happened at Deir Yassin on April 9th, 1948, as the "blood bath
that was the psychologically decisive factor in the Arabs'
spectacular exodus."
On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvei
Leumi killed 250 men, women and children. After 1948 there
were other mass killings in occuped Palestine, c.g. Ikrit (1951), Al
Tira (1953), Abu Ghosh (1953), Kafr Kassem (1956), etc., as
part of the systematic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation
of the Palestinians, to be replaced by Jewish settlers from all
over the world.
These were the conditions that forced the Palestinians to leave
their homeland.
The Zionists did not come to a country without people. There
lived in Palestine a people with a civilization. They reacted to the

Moreover, this is a stage of "liberation struggle,"
where actions are more important than words, and
where efforts of all Palestinians are needed.
Fateh has its orientation, however, and in terms
of armed struggle against Imperialism, it is more
leftist than the Soviet Union and the Arab
Cormunist partios. Disagreement between Communist
parties and Fateh exist over proposals for "peace-
ful settlement" of the conflict, for Fateh rejects
aceful settlements" and believes in armed
as the only solution.

stri
At this stage of Arab history, Fateh ideas
are popular and represent a turning point in Arab
thought. They represent the bogirming of a now
Arab ro-awakening, an attempt at the re-definition
of the Arab being in terms of armed struggle.
Fateh spearheads this ro-awakening, it is the
vanguard of the revolution, and it leads by action
and armed struggle.
Fateh is thus the antithesis of Arab "revolu-
tionary" thought, which was limited to slogans
and devoid of any action in the form of armed
struggle. Fateh is action and armed struggle, and
the new synthesis between action and thought will
be free and liberated Arab human being.

This article is the product of an open dis-
cussion with "Abu Amar". I hope it represents a trus
and comprehensive picture of his ideas, which are the
ideas of the "Palestine National Liberation Movement
Fatch".
As I entered the cave, Abu Amar's voice
greeted me: "Welcoms." He then added, "We are in
a state of alert as you know, and this make it neces-
sary for us to cancel many of our meetings. I am
sorry for having made you wait this morning.
I shock his hand and greeted the men as I
walked inside. I sat on a chair facing his small
table. Abu Anar smiled as I looked at his small
face: his shiny eyes, his flat nose, and the natural
moustache. His clothes were simple, the same as what
other fighters wore.
I began with, "I have a number of questions
in mind, as do many people, about "Fatch" and its
ideas and operations. Much has been written and said
about "Patch" and its ideas and operations. Much has
been written and said about "Fateh" in newspapers and
magazines all over the world, and it is necessary to
explain and answer. $1
He said quickly: "I do not understand this
concern with Fateh. Everybody asks of Fateh; others
criticize Fateh, and every time the accusation is
different. Once we were accused of being "Moslem
Brethren", another time of being "Chinese Communists",
a third time "Ba'thists", and after June 5th it was
said we were "Nassorites", Others, of course, insist
we are a satellite of Saudi Arabia. Why? How can we
be all these things at the same time? We do not find
it necessary to deny these accusations because they
are not true and the contradictions in them are the

proof." He continued with a smile, before I asked him
a new question: "Now the situation is different.
Poems of praise are written about us. Those who
accused us before, now view us as heroes who have
given back to this Arab nation its confidence and its
hope for victory at a time when it was sunk in the
shame of defeat."

this what I have to do at this stage? Everybody
inquires about the social content of our movement
and our revolution.. Is this the time for defining
the social content? Are we not, still, at a. stage

to deprive many classes of the Falestinian people
of their right to participate in the struggle for
liberation?"
-
I said, arguing: "Let us define, at the
same time, the forces we are fighting. The enemy
is Israel, Zionism, and the imperialist powers that
supt it..."
Abu Amar interrupted me:
"Usually people
describe Israel as a fort guarding imperialist
interests in the Arab World ... I prefer to compare
Israel to the East India Company."
•
I then continued: "The battle then is not
only against the state of Israel, but against all
imperialist presence on Arab soil, Thus it is not
a battle for Palestinians alone, but for all Arabs.
Israel now occupies, in addition to Palestine,
Egyptian ani Syrian territorios, and its expan-
sionist designs include Lebanon, East Jordan, and
parts of Iran.)

expected of me to wait and slumber until the Arab
revolution explodes? I have to struggle to regain
my country. Others, too, need to struggle. The
Syrian people must struggle to liberate their
occupied territories, the Egyptian people must fight
to regain Simi. As for me, my battle is here, on
Falestine's land and for it." I said: "But you do
not exist in isolation, You move within specific
conditions imposed upon you by the imperialist
presence."
Abu Amar continued, as he pointed to his
Soviet machine gun: "For me, as a Falestinian, I
made the choice and chose to face the Imperialist
presence...with the gun alone I confront it."
-You are free in your choice, but you will cer-
tainly clash with the present Arab 'establishments'."
Abu Amar said seriously: "Yes, the clash did.
in fact, occur. Bofore June 5th, we were accused of
aiming at involving Arab governments in a war for
which they were not prepared. It was said that, as
agents of CENTO, we were conspiring to embarass the
progressive governments and preparing for their over-
throw. After June 5th, we were told, 'If you fire
one bullet we will consider you criminals and
traitors... your action now would be irresponsible,
and will lead to the destruction of the Arab nation,
so calm down and stop your play
or else."
Abu
Amar smiled and went on: "If our movemont was not
genuine and was not expressing the consciousness and
will of our people, we would be hanged in a number
of Arab states for high treason." He added: "When
they (the governments) saw the Israeli alarm about
our Movement; and the Arab popular support we received
because we refused to accept defeat and surrender,
they rallied to us."

Zionist challenge by education, economic and human mobilization,
and competed with the Zionists in the fields of management;
finance and technology.
With all their efforts, by 1947 the Zionists had only been
able to acquire 5.6% of the total area of Palestine. However, the
1947 U.N. resolution for partition allowed them 56% of Palestine,
and by terror and aggression they went on to occupy 80% in
1948. Today, after the June 5 1967 aggression, the rest of our
Palesti occupied, as well as Sinai and the Golan Heights.
***
For twenty years, the Palestinians were the victims of world
procrastination. While many resolutions were passed in the United
Nations, the Israelis continued to occupy more and more territory
while the world remained indifferent. Under such conditions, the
only alternative left to the Palestinians was armed revolution.

can visualize the conditions under which our people have suffered.
For twentyears most of the lestinians have lived in a diaspora
of shabb¦ents, misery and the humiliation of a meager dole. In
this schizophrenic world of the rights of Africans, Asians and
Polynesis were recognized and espoused, while Palestinian rights
were dis, rded and forgotten. Not even the tragedy of the heroic
Angolans; South Africans and Zimbabwans equalled theirs. For,

uprooted from their land and completely denied the right to live.
on it and enjoy its fruits.
Our people have risen to arms because all other means have
been exhausted. We refuse to accept misery and diaspora as our
fate, and we refuse charity and compromise as solutions to our
problem. We shall overcome: through a long-term liberation
'revolution to destroy the bases of colonialist aggression that frustrate
the exercise of our inalienable rights, and to bring an end to the
racist militarist regime that oppresses our people. We will fight so
that
peace with justice is restored to our land.

rusty weapons and against heavy odds, our youth embarked on
the revolution with all the determination and persistence of a long-
oppressed people. Now as we embark on our fifth year of struggle,
the fruits of our sacrifices are beginning to show. The Palestine
Liberation Movement has succeeded in awakening our people,
in rekindling its hope for a better future with dignity and respect
in our own land. We are forcing the enemies of peace to admit
their failure to extinguish our revolution, we are winning battles,
and we are starting to shape our destiny.. We are not swayed by
emotional appeals, we are not seekers of revenge, we are not
bloodthirsty terrorists. We are freedom fighters with clear and
mature goals. We are fighting today to create the new Palestine
of tomorrow: A progressive, democratic, secular Palestine in
which Christian, Moslem and Jew will worship, work, live peacefully
and enjoy equal rights. This is no utopian dream or false promise,
for we have always lived in peace, Moslems, Christians and Jews
in the Holy Land. The Palestinian Arabs gave a refuge, a warm
shelter and a helping hand to Jews fleeing persecution in Christian
Europe and to the Armenians fleeing persecution in Moslem
Turkey, as well as to Greeks, Circassians and Maltese among others.
Our Palestinian revolution still stretches its welcoming hand
to all human beings who want to fight for, and live in, a democ-
ratic, tolerant Palestine, irrespective of race, color or religion.
During the last four years, some 500 of our people have given
their lives on the battlefield. During the same period many more
than that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish-
ment and disease.
We are here to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to
your people, that our people will not lay down their arms until
Palestine is liberated and our rights restored. We will not accept
any settlement that denies us these rights, be it the Security
Council's resolution, or any other proposal or political settlement
ensuing from it. We will not accept any substitute to a war
of national liberation and will tenaciously hold to it regardless of
sacrifices and costs. Could anybody have asked you to accept
anything less than total freedom from Nazism, fascism or colonia-
lism? We are confident the people of the world will back our
struggle and will support our revolution, for it is the struggle of
man to achieve the loftiest of man's values: peace and justice.

Translator's Introduction
This dialogue was conducted with "Abu-Amar"
by Talal Salman, a Lobaneso journalist who visited
the fedayeen bases and wrote a series of articles in
al-Sayyad, a Lebanese wookly magazine. The first
article, "Dialogue with Abu-Amar", appeared in
al-Sayyad on January 2, 1969.
The article is an important document because
it presents the ideas and thoughts of the loader of
al-Fatch in a comprehensive manner. "Abu-Amar" dis-
cusses the ideas of the Movement in clear torms, and
attempts to answer critics by further explaining the
Movement's stand on certain ambiguous questions.
A number of important ideas are clarified in
this article. First, the emergence of "Falestinian
identity" as an independent force, adopting armed
struggle to regain the "land" and confront the
Imperialist presence. Second, Fateh's relation to
Arab governments is clarified. "Abu-dmar" stresses
that the movement does not interfere in the local
politics of the Arab goverments, It depends on
popular support and on the masses for protection.
Fatch seeks a certain independence and in that sense
it interferes in the affairs of Arab States; by
existing on their territory, by moving freely, and
by exercising the right to fight for liberation of
the occupied territories. Third, Fatch appears as
a unifying force, since its bases exist in most
Arab states and its ren move freely from ons state
to another. Fateh, therefore, works against
regionalism and promotes Arab unity in action.
Fourth, the question of idcology or leftist vs.
rightist contraversy is clarified. "Abu-Amar"
stresses that all Fatch men are of the wretched of
the earth since they lack the means for existence.

He continued: "Before, the Arab governments
could delay our struggle and prevent it, But the
situation has changed now. We have become strong,
much stronger than they think, and the source of
our strength is not guns or the number of mon who

to the clash between the Jordanian security forces
and the Resistance Movement)? We had 17 martyrs.

except when our own existence is threatened. What
is our basic demand from Jordan at this stage? Our
demands are: to exist on its territory, to move
freely among Palestinians, and to have the right of
dying for our land."
I asked him: "The relation between Arab
governments and the Falestinian Resistance Movement
could deteriorate...if a "peaceful settlement" is
reached the picture will change and the governments
would attempt to liquidato the Resistance Movement.
What then?"
But
Abu Amar answered: "That is possible, and I
assure you that we are in a state of alertness,
because we expect attempts at our liquidation anytime,

their international contacts, as a trump card in

the meaning of being a refuges? I am a human being
who has lost everything. I own nothing. Even my
country has been taken from me and I have been
kicked out. What is the moaning of Left or Right
in this liberation struggle? I want my country even
if the devils liberate it for me. As a Falestinian,
I do not, anyhow, have the time to spend on arguing
left or right. Am I.in a position to refuse the
participation and help of any human being? Do you
ask me to refuse money from Saudi Arabia because
they are rightists? But with their monoy, we buy
Weapons from China. How do you call this action,
leftist or rightist? The problem in my mind and in
the mind of other Palestinians is simple, and there
is no need for complications. We have been expelled
from our country which is being occupied by another
people through the force of arms and by the aid of
Imperialism. It is our duty and our right to work
for the liberation of our land and to regain it even
by force of arms, The confusion is due to extraneos

complications. If we deal with the situation in
simple terms, we can understand it better. Words
do not mean a thing. What is important is action
and results."
I said:
"But action is tied to thought
and Fateh, as a revolutionary movement, must have
a clear ideology. Not every person who carries
a gun is a revolutionary. In this complex battle
which was imposed on the Palestinian people and
* Arab nation, ideology seems to be the most
Asded instrument
11 Abu Amar calmly asked me
to explain what I meant exactly. I said: "Isn't
our battle against Israel and Zionism a battle
against colonialism and imperialism at the same
time?" He answered: "Yes, certainly ... $1
"Are Israel's designs limited to Palestine alone?"
"No, they include most Arab states. 11.
"Isn't the Zionist presence directly related to
imperialist interests in our area?"
-
-
"Yes.... "
"Aren't imperialist interests reflected in one
Y or another by Arab governments?"
"Yes... "
"Isn't then our confrontation with Israel, as an
imperialist base and outpost for the protection of
imperialist interests, a direct clash with all
imperialist forces?"
Abu Amar answered: "You mean from this
analysis that we should be in the 'leftist' camp.

Union itself, because the Soviet Union calls for a
"pracoful sottlement" and presents proposals for that
purposo. We refuse "peaceful settlements" and all
their proposals. Are the Arab Communist parties
more 'leftist' than us? Let me say frankly that
they are not, for Communist parties advocated at one
time, peace with Israel, which you call an imperialist
base in our midst, on our land,"
I said: "But I am not arguing with you from
a Communist point of view."
He then continued: "I understand that.. But
they have, until this time, reservations about the
Resistance Movement, and they (the Communists) say
that we are fanatics and oxtromists, driven by
religious feelings. The Soviets told me that; they
said that we are making matters worse, that we do
not understand the nature of our present struggle
and, therefore, we are overextending ourselves.

due to its military fascist regime? And if leftists
do reach power in Israel would that solve the
problem?"
I
I said: "Rest assured that there are no true
socialists in Israel, for socialism cannot survive
in an exclusive society based on religion and race."
41
Abu Amar continued: "Evon if you believe that,
it is still premature to demand that our new rovo-
lutionary movement have a social content. Do you
want us to specify the nature of the regime to be in
Palestine after its liberation, now? That discus-
sion would be too early. Moreover, to speak of a
social content for our Resistance Movement at this
time would reflect a leftist missionary zeal and a
leftist immaturity. We are now in a stage

differences which are a form of theoretical luxury,

must be forgotton until liberation is won. Then,
we can disagree among ourselves as much as we
like over leftist, rightist, socialist or liberal
ideas...
We are not a party. We are a group of
Palestinians who have discovered, before others,
that our country will not be returned to us unless
we fight for its liberation. So, we have carried
apons and begun the armed struggle without
ying to exhaust our thoughts over ideological
analyses."
I said: "But when you carry the gun, then
by necessity you are in the leftist camp.'
Abu Amar explained: "It is not fair that
you ask us to be more radical than Mao Tse-Tung.
Ho fought Chiang Kai-Shek who dofonded the bour
geoisie; but when Japan occupied China, Mao formed
an alliance with Chiang Kai-Shek, because the
liberation of the country was more important than
the ideological differences over the form of .

have to classify Falestinians? The only criteria

for judgment is dedication to the revolution.
Those who join the revolution are therefore
nationalists. We cannot refuse the financial aid
of those who provide it because they are bourgeois
or capitalists. Can you, anyhow, show me any
Palestinians who are capitalists? They do not
exist. Those who became wealthy had lived for
years in the Arabian Gulf and made their wealth
by hard work and by their own efforts; there are
no capitalists among us. The majority are homeless,

LEAGUE OF REVOLUTIONARY BLACK WORKERS
Also known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM)
A source advised on April 22, 1970, that the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW) is a black
extremist labor union, with headquarters at 179 Cortland,
Highland Park, Michigan, in the greater Detroit metropolitan
area. Source advised that the LRBW is attempting to oust
the United Auto Workers (UAW) from their position as
bargaining representative for black workers in the Detroit
area automotive plants. Source advised that the LRBW has
used threats of violence against both black and white
supervisory personnel and UAW leaders in an attempt to
intimidate them into an agreement with LRBW demands. The
LRBW has referred to the automotive industry and the UAW
.as "racist".
A second source advised that membership in the
LRBW is limited to Negroes only, by virtue of the LRBW
constitution which states "membership is denied to all
honkies due to the fact that said honkey has been the
historic enemy, betrayer and exploiter of black people.
Membership in the LRBW is less than 25 persons.
The second source also stated that the LRBW had
suborganizations operating at Ford Motor Company which was
known as the Ford Revolutionary Union Movement (FRUM) and
Eldon Avenue Gear and Axle Plant (ELRUM) as well as other
assembling and supplying plants, but that at the present the
LRBW is active only at the Dodge Main Assembly Plant in
Hamtramck, Michigan. This suborganization is known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement' (DRUM) . The other
suborganizations are now defunct.

also known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
According to the official newspaper the DPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
organized by DOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, EPP.
"
The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,
regularly states that the DPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.
The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:
"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun.
Kill the pigs everywhere."
i
The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government, We will overthrow it."
DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."
DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times, " issue of
* December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct
overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."
In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:
"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is... by taking
up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby.
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government:"
The BFP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA.

"INNER CITY VOICE'
The "Inner City Voice" (ICV) was registered
with the Wayne County Clerk's Office, Assumed Names Division
on August 4, 1967, by KENNETH JOHN WATSON, under Certificate
Number 203945.
A bulletin entitled, "Build Black Newspaper"
dated July, 1967, stated, "A group of black revolutionaries
in Detroit, Michigan, have begun work on the production of
a new newspaper. It is hoped that the first edition of the
*Inner City Voice', will appear on the newsstand in August
of 1957." According to the bulletin, the ICV's goal is the
building of a mass circulating revolutionary propaganda
program. The bulletin stated the newspaper was to concentrate
on local news, cultural and social events, as well as providing
coverage of radical politics.
A source advised on March 17, 1970, that the ICV
was published from July of 1967 through June of 1968, when
it was terminated. In the fall of 1969 a newspaper similar
to ICV appeared on Detroit newsstands which was called
"SAUTI", meaning Voice in Swahili. This publication, in its
first edition stated that it emerged from the ICV, and its
purpose, in addition to the above, would be to exist as the
official organ of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBW). In January of 1970, an edition of "SAUTI" stated
that it would continue publication under the old name of
"Inner City Voice" and would provide coverage of the black
extremist labor movement. In the spring of 1970, the ICV did
not publish the inflammatory articles which were common in
1967-68, but called for the overthrow of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) leadership and control of black workers at
Detroit area auto plants.
Source advised that the editors of the ICV are
KENNETH JOHN WATSON, LUKE SAMUEL TRIPP, GENERAL GORDON BAKER,
MICHAEL C. HAMLIN and RONALD LEE MARCH, all of whom source
identified as members of the Central Committee of the LRBW.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY
+
The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.
While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence.
Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three
were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

Location of Headquarters
On May 5, 1971, it was reported that JERRY LYNN
DAVIS, leader of the SAO, in laying plans for the formation
of the organization, wanted it to appear in several cities
at the same time. However, the headquarters would be at
San Diego, California.
(SD T-1, May 5, 1971)
On September 13, 1971, it was reported that, in
preparation for future organizational work, DAVIS had rented
several Post Office boxes in the San Diego area which would
be used for this purpose. These included Post Office Box
5791, San Diego, California 92105, which was rented in
DAVIS' name, and Post Office Box 503, Lemon Grove,
California 92045, which was rented in the name of "Artist
Supply." It was reported that "Artist Supply" was the name
utilized for a mail drop operated by TROY HAUGHTON, former
West Coast leader of the Minutemen (MM) organization.
(SD T-1, September 13, 1971)
The Minutemen (MM) is a paramilitant group

would continue to adhere to the tenets and principles of the
old MM organization.
(SD T-1, December 20, 1971)
Ori January 7, 1972, it was reported that the SAO
intended to conduct intelligence-type operations and to
offer training in urban guerrilla warfare to be used against
Left Wing groups and suspected enemies of the United States.
A leaflet entitled, "Join the Secret Army
Organization" was made available which offered the following
statements of purpose:
"1) To prepare the means of personal defense
and survival in case of enemy attack.
2) To resist and expose the spread of communist
influence and propaganda within our own national
boundaries.
3
. 3) To investigate by means of our own secret
memberships the infiltration of communist sympathizers
into American organizations of government, business,
labor, religion and education.
4) To resist by any and all means the passage of
laws which regulate the private ownership of
firearms or which detract from the individual's
ability to defend his own family and personal
property.
5) To promote knowledge and skill in the use of
arms by our own members and by the general
public.
6) To form in advance of actual need a secret
underground organization equipped to spy upon,
harrass and destroy troops of any foreign power
that might occupy United States territory.

absence without official leave; for being arrested by Sarpy County,
Nebraska, authorities for alleged larceny of automobile accessories,
for which he was fined $25.00 and court costs of $2.00%; for being
cited by civil authorities for loaning his vehicle operator's
license to an unauthorized person; for a civilian arrest for care-
less driving, for which he was fined $35.00 and costs of $4.00.

Summary of Overall Activities
On May 5, 1971, it was reported that JERRY LYNN
DAVIS was continually talking about the plans he was making
to start a new organization. According to DAVIS, he
considered the MM organization to be defunct, at least
in the San Diego area and in most of the Western states,
and felt. the need to organize a new Right Wing group to
fill the power vacuum which it had left. He indicated that
he knew people in Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle,
Washington, and Las Vegas, Nevada, who he wanted to contact
regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be
highly interested in helping to organize and get it going.
He said his plans included having Post Office boxes rented
for the new organization in all these cities and having
leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed
using the respective Post Office box numbers. On a pre-determined
day, press releases would be made in each of these cities
announcing the formation of the organization with the leaflets
and stickers being put up in the cities on the same day.
This would be done for the purpose of disguising the location
of the national headquarters, which would be actually located
in San Diego, California.
(SD T-1, May 5, 1971)
On September 13, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS
had become very interested in the National Socialist White
Peoples Party (NSWPP) as a possible answer to the need for a

The National Socialist White Peoples Party,
also known as The American Nazi Party,
American Nazis, and The George Lincoln
Rockwell Party, was organized on February 26,
1956, at Arlington, Virginia, based upon
the concept of an international "National Socialist"
movement as espoused by the German Nazi Party
headed by Adolf Hitler. The organization supports
and follows the line of hatred against Negroes,
Jews, and communists through various propaganda
media seeking a legitimate dominant political
: party in the United States and foreign countries.
H
On September 16, 1971, it was reported that,
while very interested in the NSWPP, DAVIS was still considering
going ahead with plans for the new organization.
In addition,
DAVIS indicated that he expected to obtain membership lists
and the necessary materials for setting up application forms,
bulletins and training literature for the new organization
' from BETTIE HAUGHTON, wife of TROY HAUGHTON. DAVIS said
he would attempt to have the bulletins, training materials,
and membership application forms printed in the near future
and that, tentatively, the responsibility for making the
monthly mail-outs would alternate between DAVIS and GODFREY.
DAVIS advised that O.A ALEXANDER of Alex Rapid Print, 7609
El Cajon Boulevard, La Mesa, California, had agreed to print
some of these materials. ALEXANDER was described as a former
MM supporter who had allowed TROY HAUGHTON to use his printing
facilities for the benefit of the West Coast MM organization.
Other plans for the new organization included
eventually setting up two membership lists which would be
recorded on microfilm. One of the lists would be maintained
by DAVIS and the other by GODFREY. _ The purpose in placing

the membership lists on microfilm was for easy destruction.
Two lists were to be maintained to guard against the
possibility of one being lost or destroyed.
(SD T-2, September 16, 1971)
On October 8, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS had
chosen the name "Secret Army Organization" for his new group.
In addition, it was learned DAVIS had had 1,000 copies each
of letterhead stationery and membership application forms
for the SAO printed up the previous weekend. DAVIS also
advised that he, GODFREY, and other associates would attend
the Annual Yuma Gun Show at Yuma, Arizona, on October 16 and
October 17, 1971, at which time he expected contact would be
made with people attending the gun show from Phoenix,
Arizona, and Seattle, Washington, regarding the SAO.
(SD T-1, October 8, 1971)
On October 16, and October 17, 1971, DAVIS, GODFREY,
and STANLEY DON MC DADE, a prospective member of the SAO residing
at 4114 Massachusetts, La Mesa, California, were in attendance
at the Yuma Gun Show. Following the gun show, a meeting was
held in a motel room at Yuma, Arizona, with persons in
attendance, including the above three individuals and EVERETT
MOORE and his wife from Phoenix, Arizona, and CY ANDERSON
from Seattle, Washington. The topic of discussion was the SAO
and those attending the meeting were in general agreement
that a new cohesive force was necessary among Right Wing
groups as a result of the power vacuum left by the disintegration
of the MM organization. MOORE and ANDERSON tentatively agreed
to having their respective groups join the SAO subject to the
approval of the members of these groups. Copies of printed
material of the SAO, including a leaflet entitled, "History
of the Secret Army Organization," a copy of the first bulletin
of the SAO entitled, "To Prospective Members of the Secret
Army Organization," and membership application forms were passed'
around among the group.
It was decided that subsequent contacts regarding
expansion of the SAO would be made and that the San Diego area

was addressed to the SAO, indicated that STEVENS was in
control of at least part of what was left of the former
MM organization on the East Coast. In the letter, STEVENS
expressed hatred for ROBERT BOLIVAR DE PUGH, former national
leader of the MM organization, and interest in establishing
future contact with the SAO. STEVENS also indicated that he
corresponded with several individuals in the San Diego area
and did not know who had furnished him information on the
SAO. According to DAVIS, this was done by STANLEY DON.
MC DADE. In addition, DAVIS advised he is known to STEVENS
by the alias of PATRICK MC DONALD.
"
A letter replying to the above correspondence from
STEVENS which DAVIS had written was also observed. In this
letter, DAVIS also expressed interest in making contact
with STEVENS' group. DAVIS indicated in his letter that,
even though the SAO was a new organization with a new name,
it would continue to adhere to the tenets and principles
of the old MM organization.
"
(SD T-1, December 20, 1971)
HP
On December 20, 1971, the SAO distributed several
hundred copies of a special intelligence bulletin which
it had prepared regarding PETER GEORGE BOHMER, a professor
of Economics at San Diego State College, and a well-known
figure in New Left activities in the San Diego area. The
information contained in the bulletin was obtained by the
SAO primarily from research of newspaper articles and
surveillance of BOHMER's activities.
•
(SD T-1, December 20, 1971)
On December 29, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS
had received additional correspondence from JESSE CLAYBURN
STEVENS. In this letter, STEVENS agreed to the formation of
an alliance between his group and the SAO. Guidelines which
were set up would have STEVENS' group in control of Right Wing
activities in the East and in the South, while the SAO would
operate in the Western states. It was also agreed that the two
groups should work on finding an individual in or near Chicago,

mail drop for the Phoenix group would be the address of
HOWARD FRANCIS CLARK, 1080 6th Street, Ramona, California,
*a former member of the MM organization.
En route to the gun show, CY, ANDERSON's automobile
had broken down some, place in the State of Nevada and it had
been necessary for him to hire transportation from there to
the gun show. After the gun show, DAVIS drove to Las Vegas,
Nevada, accompanied by ANDERSON, to make contact with people
known to him regarding the SAO.
It was reported that DAVIS, who is part American
Indian, had abandoned the idea of joining the NSWPP when he
learned in late September, 1971, that the NSWPP is adamantly
opposed to persons having American Indian blood, considering
them to be of an inferior race. It was felt that this fact
was responsible for DAVIS' decision to finally go ahead
and organize the SAO.
7
It was also reported that, in addition to the
letterhead stationery and application forms, several thousand
copies of the history leaflet and the first bulletin had also
been printed at the same time as well as a number of stickers
advertising for the SAO. The printing of these materials was
done by BETTIE HAUGHTON on an offset press which she had
maintained since the time her husband was in the MM organization.
Many copies of these printed materials have been sent out to
people known in the past to have been MM members or other
Right Wing sympathizers.
The meeting mentioned in the first paragraph of the
history leaflet is actually a disguised reference to the meeting
which took place in the motel room at Yuma, Arizona, on
October 17, 1971.

that arrangements had been made for the group he contacted
at Las Vegas to join the SAO. He further advised that
arrangements had been made to get insignia patches from
CY ANDERSON for the berets that SAO members would be given
to wear.
(SD T-2, October 26, 1971)
On October 27, 1971, DAVIS was reported to have
advised that ANDERSON had gone to El Paso, Texas, from
Las Vegas, Nevada, to make contact with people known to
him there. DAVIS advised he expected ANDERSON to be
in San Diego on October 29, 1971, for additional discussions
regarding the organizing of the SAO. DAVIS said he also
felt the need for him and GODFREY to travel to Phoenix,
Arizona, sometime in December, 1971, for the purpose of
recontacting EVERETT MOORE regarding the SAO.
:
(SD T-2, October 27, 1971)
.
On November 9, 1971, it was reported that CY ANDERSON
had spent approximately a day and a half at DAVIS' residence
discussing the SAO. Resulting from these discussions were
tentative plans for a trip during December, 1971, or January,
1972, during which DAVIS and ANDERSON would travel through
Arizona to El Paso, Texas, following which they would cross
the border at Juarez, Mexico, and drive to Mexico City.
Returning from Mexico City, they would travel to Las Vegas
where the individual named ED (Last Name Unknown) would be
picked up and who would then travel with them to Denver,
Colorado, and the State of Montana. The purpose of the trip
would be to contact people regarding expansion of the SAO and
to solicit support for that organization.

Illinois, to act as coordinator of Right Wing activities in
the Midwest area. DAVIS mentioned JAMES EVAN POTO as a good
possibility in this regard. POTO, an SAO member at San Diego,
is employed by a national restaurant chain and is expecting
to be transferred to the Chicago area in the early part of
1972 to open a new restaurant there.
In addition, arrangements were made between SAO and
STEVENS' group regarding the trading of information on
individuals of interest to these organizations who reside
in each other's areas. Furthermore, it was agreed that
members of their respective groups would be transferred from
one group to another if they should move to a new area.
STEVENS indicated that his group has microfilming
equipment and "secure" messages between the two groups will
be transmitted by microfilm as soon as the SAO acquires the
necessary equipment.

On December 29, 1971, it was reported that BETTIE
HAUGHTON will remarry in the near future and, upon doing
so, expects to leave the San Diego area. At that time, she
will give the offset press, which she has, to the SAO for its
use.

DAVIS has been very busy recently preparing the
next SAO bulletin. According to what he has said this
.bulletin will contain eight pages of technical information
dealing with explosives, booby traps and other weapons and
will have two pages of general information regarding news,
recruiting, and training.
(SD T-2, December 29, 1971)
On January 5, 1972, it was reported that the new SAO
bulletin had been printed and was ready for distribution. In

San Diego Union, daily newspaper at San Diego, California,
and reported that, on the previous evening, a young woman
at the residence of PETER GEORGE BOHMER had been wounded
by sniper fire from an unknown assailant. According to

SECRE, ARMIY ORGANIZA 1ON
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
Dear Fellow American,
Your letter of inquiry concerning the Secret Army Organization was
received a few days ago. We have had so many inquiries during the past few
months that it has been impossible to answer each of them promptly with a
personal letter.
We certainly appreciate your interest in our organization and we hope
you will join us in our battle for national and individual freedom. As you
learn more about the Secret Army Organization I'm sure you will come to
realize that we are not radicals, but are far more inclined to be quietly ded-
icated and clear thinking individuals.
Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its
history, objectives and programs. After you have given this material
careful study, we hope you will use the enclosed application form to join our
organization. When sending in your application, do not put your return
address or name on the outside of the envelope.
After your membership application has been processed, we would
certainly welcome having you work with one of our local units, or better
still, help you organize your own unit with our assistance after you have
completed preliminary training.

Dear Fellow American,
At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to
join the Secret Army Organization. Those of us who have been members for
some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-
serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our
forefathers handed down to us.
It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-
spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the
· American people cannot rely on this country's clected leaders to protect them
from communist domination and slavery.
We believe that the time will come when the American people will have
to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in
advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-
stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.
We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people
willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same
way, we invite you to join us.

History or the Secret Army Organizatiou
One early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and
imprisonment of two top Al nutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had
brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles
as Minutemen grpup leaders, others were meeting for the first time.
g
After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the
Minuten.en as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had
effectively been destroyed by the pro-cominunist elements inside the Justice Depart-
ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial
support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-
nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity
by communists in the United States.
With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of..
action to be followed. After a inccting that lasted all that day and far into the next
morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to
merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command
of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a
General Staff that would advise and assist the now leader.
While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was
decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a
completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-
tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach
would be needed. Never again could the arrest or death of a few leaders he allowed to
cripple the entire organization.
For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type
orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original
force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army
Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national
and individual breedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the
S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as
the freedom fighters of tomorrow.
The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have
no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a
strategy which we believe will ultimatelylead to victory. Only one thing is essential.
We met steel preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country
is worthy of any sacrifice. If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

The Serret y Organization is a national orgau-
jvation of patioue americans who are preparing theat
selves as a last line of defense against coe:munism. To
exemplify the ne ressity of such an organization, we quote
the 1960 Annual Report of the Committee on Un-American
Activities as follows;
"Eveats of the past year have provided convincing
evidence that the American pople e unot rely completely
on this coanary's armed forces to protect themselves
from communist domastica and slavery, This is not
because our military forec, lack the power or the wi to
defend this country, but rather because the nature of the
attacks being made on the United States by i's major and
only significant enemy are so desigurna as to reader con-
ventional military forces as ineffective as possible for
defense purposes."
Starting from nothing 50 years ago, communism
now rigidly controls one-third of the human race and has
subverted to varying degroes the remaining two-thirds.
In the past 20 years the communists have conquered 20
sovereign rations, one by armed conquest ord 19 by in-
ternal subversion or negotiation.
There is not one of these countries in which the
communists rale by the consent of the people. Every-
where they must perpetuate themselves by terror. They
remain in power only through the use of the most brutal
police state tactics.
The communists consider their party workers
not simply as an accessory to armed conquest but as the
actual spearhead of any invasion into new territory.
From this point of view the United States was "invaded"
by Soviet troops more than 30 years ago. It has been
authoritatively estimated that the communists now have
an army of 500,000 combatants already landed on Ameri-
can shores and already working by the most insidious
means to destroy our American way of life.
The cold war is very real. It must be fought and
woa. The only alternative is to lost and to lose means
that future Americans for generations to come must live
in terror and in slavery. Appeasement is futile. ive
cannot bargain with moral barbarians who never have and
never will know the meaning of honesty.
Communism must be defeated, not merely resist-
ed. We must rid our country of traitors and fellow trave-
lers. We must embark on a massive offensive turning
every communist trick - from propaganda to infiltration-
against our mortal enemy. This is the one and only way
to win the struggle for survival.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS
Many people that inqure about membership in the Secret Army Organization
seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.
Look at it this way, Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and
training until you had a hard bitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-
cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to
have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit
that you you knew little or nothing about?
Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-
ground project, he must undergo a period of training. Daring this training he will be
directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may
be observed by other members' without his knowledge. Only when a new member
proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate
effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate
with other unit members in a teamwork operation.
EXPENSES
Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every
effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you
must expect to pay your own way.
Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month. This money is
absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain
training areas.
Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is
engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and
other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to
buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During
this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,
marksmanship training, etc.
Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an
existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or become part of an underground network.
Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a
definite series of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be
expected of jou,
C
We hope that you can succeed in this effori because your country desperately
soods pabricts at this ume.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION
The Scoret Army Canization is the most active, most completely dedicated and
most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.
We are willing to make any sucrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a tinfo that your life would depend on how competently some other member had
learned his job.
Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political
situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the exports in our organization who have
developed and supervised our training program.
OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER
It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within mouths, our
nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we musi
know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what
they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.
THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development.
1) The Underground Network
2)
Active Guerrilla. Warfare
3) Open or Conventional Warfare
The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against
the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.
The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system
must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.
Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
clandestine fabrication of supplies, couniericiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member
of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of
all these tactics as well as the military tactics more comraonly associated with guéril-
la activities.

its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient
and able to perform any one of several missions. To attain these aims the follow-
ing elements ete essential:

. Equipment should be well-chosen und standardized as much as pos-
sible.
Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid
transmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with prime
emphasis on security.
Internal coordination should be automatic in response. Confidence
among members of the team must be developed.
Selection of each position on the team should be based on psycholog-
1.ical aspects as well as technical competence.
Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals
and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.
* The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple
and direct.
Each team will have a "leader" (Lieutenant) and an "assistant loader"
(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret
Army Organization at "leadership seminars".
Team "marshalling points" should be selected in advance and be
well defined. Practice "alerts" will determine the team's efficiency
in response and security.
Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the
team must be developed.
Weapons familiarity must be obtained through live firings at various
targets. Team action 'must be stressed as well as individual com--
petence.
The team loader should see that a constant flow of information is
provided to team members on the ideological struggle. This will
help induce the proper frame of mind in each member.
Team missions and targets must be identified and the proper train-
ing equipment made available for cach assignment.

Dear Fellow American,
"
Your application for membership in the Secret Army Organization has been
processed and approved. It is our profound hope that your membership in the
S. A. O. will prove to be a benefit to the organization and yourself as well. A
dedicated member will find that his association with our organization is a way of
life that is far more rewarding than the ordinary mediocre existence of his fellow
enlightened citizens.

correspondence addressed to the organization with this mmber. You need not list
your address unless it is different from the one in our records.
•
Avother security measure employed by our organization is the use of mail
drops. The mail drop is an address listed in a fictitious name of a person or
company not corrected with the organization. Each member is assigned one that
ho will use in sending all reports, correspondence, materials, etc., to the organ-
ization. Your assigned maîl drop is:
--
We have a tremendous job ahead of us. Certainly, none of us pretend to
know what the future holds for ourselves or for our native land. We do feel, how-
ever, that our freedom is gravely threatened. It is not always possible to know
the best thing to do. But we do know this - our forefathers have given us a life of
freedom and opportunity such as never existed before in all history. We must
strive to pass this heritage on to future gencrations intact.
Our organization is not suggesting or doing anything more than Americaus
have always done starting in 1776.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its history,
objectives, and programs. Your record has been turned over to our training see-
tion and you should receive your first training program within two weeks.
Sincerely yours,

TICAL SECURITY MEASURES
1. Use deceptive mersumes. Subscribe to one or more left-wing periodicals
or get on the mailing list of soine "peace movement. This will keep the postal in-
specotrs guessing as to which side you are really on. While doing this our members
can be ofʻgreat assistance in scorching this left-wing literature for names and ad-
dresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central Intelli-
gence files. We desperately need people to assist in this work. Please inquire as
to detailed instructions for such activity.
:
2. Always use two cuvalopes in sending nail to any patriotic organizations or
to any other member of our own organization. Do not put a return address on the
outer envelope. Put your return address on, the inside envelope with the words,
"return postage guaranteed.
3. Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between
the inner and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra- red
camera5.
4. Send all letters from corner mail boxes or from post offices where you
are not looWIL
5. Be careful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to known
members of the organization as much as possible.
6. Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection.
7. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about the
prospective recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify your-
self as a member of the organization.

A. Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement agencies
as members of the Secret Army Organization.
B. Those persons not known as nembers of this organization but who are
generally known as being patriots.
C. Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.
D. Members who profess tobe Dural for the purpose of infiltrating enemy
organizations.
All members should a very carebil maldag contact with persons in a
different category than the elves. For example, people in Class D should be

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT
Selection of w ons and supplies should give the bat Teer maximum
flexibility to meet any condition that may be encountered in either rural or urban
warfare. Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-
velop relating to both traditional guerrilla warfare and modern underground war-
fare techniques. It should be kept in mird that the Combat Team is a functional
part of a resistance notwork. It's activities should be coordinated with other
teams to take maximum advantage of its striking powers.
Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the
standard disifibunion of men and weapons could be as follows:
#1

The team ders will be responsible for mailcatuing the overall,
sceurity of the unit. Personal feelings should not affect decisions
involving reprimand or dismissal of men from the team for reasons
that endanger its operation er security.
Intelligence gathering as an important part of each team member's
duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-
ments of local communist and leit-wing euenies of the organization
should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.
The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with
higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.
ORGANIZATION
The "Combat Team" will consist of six men. These six men will be divid-
ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team
Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the
Team Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled
the unit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split
into sectious the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant
during missions. but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section.
In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.
TRANSPORTATION
Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-
riers. Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, iminobilize
the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.
Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their
purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are
owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes
their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The
model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.
Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools
should be stored in the vehicle.
TRAVEL PROCEDURES
Undorway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"
will vary with conditions. In cities close-aboard trailing will be used. Open road,
by day, will require an interval of approximately 300 yards. At night this will
be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especially
arms and aminunition) should be kept cu of sight. Special team equipment and
weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key
should be carefully hidden so as to make it difficult to search the trunk in ca se
law enforcement agents should stop the car on some pretext with the intention of
searching it illegally.

PROGRAM
PRELIMINARY
IMINARY TRAINING PRO
It would be a mistake to think that our enemies have one set plan for the con-
quest of the United States. They are maintaining many continuous attacks on many
fronts at the same time - political, education, business, labor, and even religion.
They are continuously probing for weak spots in the defenses of our nation. Daring
the past fourty years so many openings have been left to them by the stupidity and
collusion of our national leaders that they have been able to advance almost at will.
There is little we can do to change this situation at this time. Rather than
deplete our limited resources on futile attempts to do so, we must concentrate on
building a workable anti-communist underground army based on realities rather
than wishful thinking and organized on the tried and proven principles of underground
warfare.
The communists have fifty years experience in supressing anti-communist
underground acfivity. If we are to fight them successfully - if we are to hold out
until the final victory of freedom over tyranny - then our underground army is going
to have to be the most skillful and dedicated that the world has over known. There
is only one kind of member that can qualify for such an army · the very best!
-
This will require intensive training and practice. There is no short out to
perfection. By drawing on the talents of several of our more experienced members
we think we now have a training program that can develop that kind of underground
army.
In this program four different types of training will be involved:
1. Correspondence and printed material.
2. Tape recordings, picture slides, charts, etc., sold or loaned to S. A. O.
units or members.
16
3. Actual experience - "On the job" training by carrying out assignments
under supervision of more experienced members.
4. Training maneuvers
14
Due to the difficulty of keeping large training ses-
sions secret the General staff has decided that such training sessions will be hell
only for stall select groups that have already completed sufficient preliminary
training at the local level.

SECDEY ARKIV CORANIZATION
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
Dear Fellow American,
Enclored with this iter is your Preliminary Training Program. This
first program is only a brief outline of some of the material that will be cover-
ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Army
Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Recruiting, in that
order. Each program will cost the new member $3.00 and will take between
one to three weeks to complete.
The correspondeuse training program serves a number of purposes,
but the two major purposes are:
1. It lets us know which members of the organization have the patience
and determination to finish assignments given them.
2. It lets us be certain that the members have the necessary basic
training in intelligence, security, etc., which is essential to al-
most any important task which we could assign a member in under-
ground warfare.
Proper training in these four basic skills is absolutely essential for
every member of an underground army. A member in ay be an expert in sur-
vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warfare tactics and all the rest but
experience has shown that without these other basic skills they seldom do much
fighting they just commit suicide.
ms
For those of you who wish to become activo and trusted members of the
Secret Army Organization, let us emphasize again that the quickest way of do-
ing so is to begin and diligently completo the basic training programs.
After you have completed the five work projects listed in the Preliminary
Training Program send $0.00 in to your regular mail drop and we will send you
the first training program on Intelligence. ´In view of the urgent situation we
now face some of our new members may receive special assignments after
having completed the first two training programs. If this happens please try
to redouble your efforts so that your special assignments can be taken care of
while continuing to complete your regular training program.

Project II listed the end of this chapter máy mak a possible for the or-
ganization to contact you and render assistance should you ever find it necessary to
go into hiding with little advance notice.
Project IV is a first step toward learning more about your enemies and at
the same time, confusing them as to which side you are really on.
PROPAGANDA
Another essential function of the underground is to convincingly inform the
general public of what they stand for and thus gain (be support of the general popu-
lation. This must be done through propaganda, both writiea and spoken. Under
conditions of enemy occupation the spreading of anti-communist propaganda would
obviously be very dangerous. Even now there are certain phases of our propaganda
effort that is best done by surreptitious means. Thus, observation, communication
and propaganda are three elementary duties of every underground member.
Never before has propaganda been so important to the ultimate outcome of a
major conflict. The ulitmate object of any war is to force your desires on the minds
of your enemies. Our onémies are attempting to do this by the non-violent means.

preparation for adrance vaining in these three important tivities which will be
dealt with in greater detan further on in the training program.
INTELLIGENCE
Underground warfare, as we'customarily think of it, cannot succeed unless it
is supported by a woll developed organization comprising all the essential functions
of intelligence, security, propaganda, communications, supply, medical services,
etc.
Of all these, intelligence is most important. Let's consider one example:
Suppose you picked up a telephone book, oponed it up to any page at random, closed
your eyes and put your finger on one name. Now suppose you read that name for
the first time and said to yourself, "Sometime in the next 30 days I'm going to kill
this man."
☐☑
Consider the situation - one man, picked at random is marked for death. He
might be the most powerful, the wealthiest, the most influential man in that city but
none of thes things woul help him in the least. He would be defenseless. Why? Bo-
cause you would have one thing that he did not have - intelligence. You would know
his identity and he would not know yours. So long as that condition continued, there
would be no possible way in which he could arrangé an adequate defense against you.
:
Exactly the same situation exists hetween ourselves and our communist and
socialist enemies. Our success will be directly proportionate to our knowledge of
thom and inversely proportionate to their knowledge of us.
Whatever a member's principal job may be in the Secret Army Organization,
he must have a basic knowledge of intelligence techniques. This subject is there-
fore the firsɩ to be considered in our training program.
The word "intelligence", when used in a military sense refers to those
methods that can be used to gain useful information. We usually think of this as
knowledge of the enemy but it also includes information about the terrain, general
population, available supplies and all other facts that will help in planning future
activities.
Intelligence is roughly divided into three parts:
1. Observation. During a hot war this includes scouting and patrolling,
observation of enem; [reep movements, etc. On the cold war front this includes
shadowing of enemy personaal, surveillance of enemy officers, tapping of telephones,
interception of messages, etc.
2. Research and Analysis, Colleging and cataloging all possible useful
information fenni general sources, newspapers, radio, trade magazines,
Lene
etc.
then matching up isolated scraps of information dilan accurate picture is obtained
af some situation that world not therwise be knoẩm.

3. Espionage.
s involves the placing or recrui g of agents within the
enemy personnel where they can learn the onemy's plans first hand, steal the enemy's
documents or materials, influence or misdirect the enemy's plans or policies.
Suppose you had a chance to secsom important document for just a few
minutes. How quickly could you scan it for its essential content? How well could
you separate the important from the unimportzu? Could you record this informa-
tion in a written message that can be easily read and will not be misinterpreted?

develop the ability to put his thoughts on paper is such a way that they will be casily
read and unmistakable.
The first two projects are designed to give the new member an opportunity
to test these skills while learning (or reviewing) basic elements of espionage
activity. When these have been completed moto advanced material will be furnisbod
to the member directly. Useful intelligence projects of increasing complexity and
importance will be assigned to those wishing to specialize in this work.
SECURITY
It is obvious what a great advantage we can gain over our enemics by proper
information about their plans and activities. It is equally true that much of this
advantage will be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them.
This is the basic purpose of all security activities. Overall secruity operations of
an underground movement can be divided into five basic parts:
1. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their familics.
2. Keeping secret the location, movements and plans of underground units.
3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquarters, alteranto
hideouts and supply depots.
4. Protecting the identity of civilians, or individual members of the popu-
lation that are friendly to underground forces,
5. Maintaining secrecy of communications,
As we have already said it is difficult to even guess what forms the coming
conflict will take. Nevertheless, the strategy of all successful underground move-
monts must satisfy these three basic principles:
Fixet, is the "Principle of Deliberate Dalay". During this state, the under-
ground gathers ces, ciels its soucity, propants intelligence, establishes
its line of communications and waits for the enemy to became complacent and over-
confident.

--- Image 124-10179-10221_page_536.jpeg ---
Second is the "Pri ple of Provocation". At the begina. of this stage only
a few real patriots are willing to take part in underground activity. The vast major-
ity of the population is still wishfully thinking that they can "get along" with the
oppressive forces. They want only to be left alone and will not take action until they
are personally threatened. During this stage the underground conducts a series of
actions which provoke the enemy forces into making harsh repressive measures on
the general population. This turns the general population against the oppressive
forces and convinces them that the underground is readly their only hope.
Stage Three may be called "Principle of Natural Allies". When the govern-
ment's action against the general population becomes sufficiently brutal then large
numbers of people will be willing to help or join the underground. Their reasons
for doing so may be numberous and their idoolery man not always be the sanie as
the basic underground movement. During this stage minor differences between
different underground groups must be minimized and all of our natural allies must
be rallied to the cause of freedom.
The intelligence branch of our organization is well aware of the communist
infiltration and control of the presoni United States government. It can rightly be
said that we are now partially controlled by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are al-
ready engaged in Phase I of this conflict. How long this will continue until open
warfare breaks out is anyone's guess. Once again, the best prediction of our in-
tellignece department is that Stage II will last for several months, perhaps even
years. This will be a time of assessination and counter assassination, terror and
counter terror. During his phase the "average citizen" may avoid direct conflict
at the price of his dignity and individual freedom. Known patriots will be in ex-
treme danger,
For most people membership in the Secret Army Organization will not
materially increase their danger during this time. For many years our enemies
have carefully catalogued the name and address of every person who has ever
written a patriotic letter to a newspaper. The membership lists of the more prom-
inent "conservative" organizations have long been available to commumisi infiltrators
in these organizations.
Continued activity and membership in other conservative organizations by
members of the S. A. O. is desirable in muny cases but those individuals should not
identify themselves as membre of the Secret Army Organization. For most of our
own members it will be best if you do not take part in the activities of these other
organizations. Although any of you are already "marked" men a certain degree.
of security can still be achieved by quietly dropping out of other right-wing activities
and keeping your membership in the S. A. O. secret from all except your most
trusted fellow members.
There may come s time when the average American is still able to go about
his business with little regimentation but during which you as a known or suspected
patriot, may be sough out for arrest or assassination.

TRAINING PROGRAM
INTELLIGENCE
E
We are faced with a dangerous enemy who has repeatedly boasted of his
plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to enslave our poople.
For more than fourty years they have been infilt: ating their agents into
the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entertainment, education, law, comi-
munications, religion, industry and government. The degree of their success
is made obvious by our government's failure to oppose communism internation-
ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in their own preservation.
We already know a considerable amount about this enemy; their origin,
objectives, approximate strength, organizational structure and general meth-
ods of operation.
There are four areas where we especially need additonal information:
1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-
sion by individual agents, including the methods by which they control their
fellow travelers.
2. The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,
sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.
3. Working details of their short range programs either in operation or

4. The actual identity of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympathi-
zers along with details regarding their work, place of residence, cover opera-
tion, means of transportation, travel pattern, personal appearance, mental
characteristics, personal lives, business and organizational activities.
Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on our ability to obtain
enough of this vitally important information.
There are literally thousands of sources from which bits of valuable in-
formation can be obtained. These range from such extremes as the local news-
papers to documents stolen from the caemy's guarded vaults.

Write a brief outline of these two books and send it to your regular assign-
ed mail drop or to General floadquarters.
Project No. 3
Get in touch with one trusted friend that you do not ordinarily see too
often, Preferably one that does not live in your prosent neighborhood. Inform
him that he may, in the future, receive letters with an inner envelope with your
name on it. Make sure he will keep these envelopes confidential and will secretly
pass them ou to you or hold diam until you can pick them up. Let us know
this alternate address in case we need to contact you in extreme circumstances.
Project No. 4
Make necessary preparations to use a fictitious name for receipt of left-
wing literature and correspondence. An important part of cach members dalies
is to keep yourself and our organization informed on left-wing and communist
activity in your area.
A phoney organization that includes the word "Peace" as part of its name
is always a suitable cover. The address can be a P. O. Box, that of a friend, or
even your own address. Mail several otrs to the name and address you de-
cide on to get the postal employees accustomed to it now. Then you will be ready.
to use it for the real thing.
Project No. 5
While working in the brary, place the enclosed Secret Army Organiza-
tion leaflets in between the pages of various books where they will be found and
read by others.

The type of short ling or long acting poisons best su d for assassina-
std
tion under various condition, might be anticipated by a careful study of toxicol--
ogy: from "Chemical Abstacus" and Biological Abstracts"; from current niaga-
zines on pharmacology, as well as from such magazines as "Scientific Monthly"
and "Science Newsletter", all available from larger city libraries.
Information on explosives is available from ordinance journals, litera-
ture from manufacturers, technical books, mining and drilling magazines, etc.
Naturally, such special fields of interest arc best pursued by some por-
son who already has an aptitude in each particular ling.
This is one of the things that makes us feel that the American people are
uniquely equipped. to form a deadly effective underground. Nowhere else in the
world does any population have as many useful hobbies and avocations that could
be adapted to underground warfare. Many by products of these hobbies can be
used as sabotage instruments. Just one typical example - the dust from grind-
ing wheels in metal shops should be saved to mix with grease for the bearings
of enemy machinery.
3. Working details of their immediato and future plans and activities.
Advance information about "peace marches" and racial demonstrationa
can be had by subscribing to appropriate communist front publications. Details
as to the size of the demonstration and degree of violence anticipated must be
obtained by infiltrating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa-
ganda campaigns, subversion, espionage, blackmail of government officials,
etc., may be learned directly by infiltration or may be deduced from a close
study of their past activities.
4. Identity and personal information about enemy agents.
-
--
This requires the full scope of counter espionage activity; research and
analysis of enemy publications, monitoring of communist sponsored meetings,
surveillance of party offices, infiltration of enemy apparatus, recruitment of
double agents, interception of enemy communications, etc., etc.

TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE RESEARCH
-
-
1. Every researcher should be constantly on the alert for useful infor-
mation in the general news media - radio, TV, magazines, elc.
2. Each rusoarcher should have one field of interest to which he gives
special attention.

On August 17, 1966, Mr/ JOSE WILLIAMS, Probation
Officer, Mercer County Probation Office, Trenton, New Jersey,
advised SA NORMAN A. HENDRICKS that subject had been arrested
on various burglary charges in Trenton, New Jersey, during 1963
and 1964. He stated that DRAGER had Trenton Police Department
Number 20118, and New Jersey State Identification Number
758412. Mr. WILLIAMS stated that as to a sentence on March
6, 1964, for nine months for assault with a deadly weapon, this
particular crime was committed by DRAGER in a service station on
May 12, 1963. The owner of the station surprised him committing
a larceny at the station at 1:00 a.m., and DRAGER shot at the
owner, firing through a window, and thus making his escape. He
was later arrested and identified as the burglar by the owner
of this station. The subject later claimed he had fired the
pistol in the air. He received a two-year probation sentence
after the nine months for assault, and his probation ended on
March 6, 1966.

The methods of gathering intelligence are roughly divided into two
groups: 1) Research and Analysis, and 2) Espionage.
Espionage includes all the "illegal" means of obraining information, such
as wiro-tapping, intereception of mail, Stealing of documents, secretly photo-
graphing records, infiltrating spies into enemy organizations, bribing or black-
mailing individuals of the cuemy apparatus.
Research and Analysis includes the careful systematic search of all
newspapers, magazines, trade journals, house organs, political pamphlets,
books, public records, etc., to sift a few "needles" of valuable intelligence
from several "haystacks" of general information.
Professional intelligence organizations obtain about 95% of their infor-
mation from Research and Analysis and only about 5% from Espionage. When
espionage techniques are used, they prove most effcctive when a specific mis-
sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage of all possible
background information that may be obtained by research methods.
Let's examine how these various techniques might be used to obtain
additional information of the four basic types we need most.
1. Details of the techniques used in espionage, infiltration and subver-
sion by individual agents including methods by which they control their fellow
travelers.
-
t
An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage methods.
used by communist ágonis who have defected from the party and have then
written about their experiences. Beyond this they are of very little value. The
actual details of such techniques are uniformly neglected.
More useful information can be obtained from the study of past court
records in which evidence has hoon presented in espionage case::. Hints and
clues may occasionally be picked up from continuous and careful study of the
regular news media. Really basic information of this type, however, must be
obtained by infiltration and espionage techniques.
2. The equipment used for surveillance, communications, assassination,
sabotage, etc., by individual agents.

+E
Hints about the type of hidden mieraphones, short wave transmitters,
miniture tape recorders, te, used in surveilland mad communication by es-
pionage agents Pomietinies are mentioned by chance in the regidar press or
ņevs magazines, in connection with regated spy casom, Technical details and
construction plans cerasio rally are given in the chatanties or "Popilar Sulence"
type magazines. Other information may be requested directly from the mamu-
facturers of such opinient.

For example:
One researcher might read every book available on "oscape and evasion"
and all the storios or articles written on prison escapes, looking for ideas that
might someday help our members escape from a concentration camp.
Another researcher might conth wound catch the communist front
publications for names of fellow travelers; for Stucemento of future inect-
ings, rallies or ģimilar activities; for additional information that would tis
suspected communists to known communics organization; for friendships, bus-
iness comections and fanally telationships belecon kaova.communists and un-
known communists.
Each city should have one researche dat carefully reads the daily
papers to extract such information as; names of speakers at loft wing meet-
ings, names and addresses of both left and right wing letters to the editor,
social functions attended by known communists, names of persons who might
be potential recruits, news of coming "peace marches" and similar demonstra-
tions, expressions of either pro or anti communist sentiments by local public
officials, educators, businessmen, ministers, etc., evidence of communist
inspired violente, sabotage or blackmail.
There is an almost endless variety of areas that need to be covered.
Based on his or her own interests and abilities each researcher should choose
the specialty for which they are best qualified.
3. Be as specific as possible. Look for details. Include blue-prints,
drawings or photographs of all technical equipment when possible. Don't ex-
pect your analyist to be a "mind reader". Include all the facts, Continuously
ask yourself the questions: Would this information be of value to the Scoret
Army Organization? To individual espionage agente? To other members?
To our technical specialists?
4. Avoid editorial opinions and general mas items as these are of
little value and needlessly swamp our limited staff of analyst.
5. Do all the work locally that you possibly can. If the person is local,
look them up in the telephome buck or cross index. Double check to make sure
the address is correct and that they puli live ders. Typo cords if possible,
otherwise, pria' plainly. Include phone numbers and licence numbers of cars
whenever possible.
6. Une standerd 3 x 5 inch indah. for sending in information on
individuels. Clip pages of megambies of protosta, important articles. In
outlining books, be sure leuportand fuels pre fully con red.
7. Always state de source of all information reported to the organiza-
tion.

That I would the prog
No doubt most citizens of San Diego are awam of the controversy surrounding the not
ivities of San Diego State Economics Professor PETER G. BOFDIEN. For eny of you who are
mot, here is a brief run downs
Bohmer, age 27, is a self-proclaimed left wing radical professor out at San Diego Stato
who aroung other things has been teaching that the communist oconomic system is suporior
to our own free enterprize syrtem, That the tax peyers have to put with this kind of
reason is bad onough, but it does not end there. Bohrer, who has a long record of co-
munist activities behind him, has made it his policy to give lover grades to students
in his classroom who do not share his left wing views. (as of his students was a vétoran
the Vietnam War, with a fine combat record. This student was a special target of
Bohner, who never missed an opportunity to ridicule and insult this students balicfs.
A quick look at Pomer's record will show why he hated this student. In 1970 Bokcas
record will show 45 days in the pokey for anti-war protesting. This was when he was a
graduate student at KIT in Massachusetts. The demonstration that carmed him his jail
was against defence research conducted on the MIT carpus. He was also a meter of SD9
and a supporter of the Black Panther Party while at Harvard and MIT. It does seem
strange that San Diego State was not able to find another professor somewhere who was
hot a commuist jail bird.
For any of our readers who day care to look up this Red Sous, and say hello, here is
some information that may help. His address is 5155. Hair, Cocar Pesch, telephone numbar
Is 222-7243, he drives a dark blue 1968 FW Sedan, California license DKI 147. Just to
ake sure you talk to the right guy here is his descriptions he has dark brown shoulder
Length bair, green oyes, weight is about 160 lbs. and be is 5'10" tall. Now in case any
of you don't believe in hitting people who wear glosses, to be fuir I guess va will have
ve
to tell you he wears contact lences.
If you du run out to see Bohner one night here are a few other people you rey run into:
ichele Kensky, abe is boots girl friend and lives at the same address as he. She is
is agent at San Diego State. She is no doubt the "Torcher's Fet". One can bet she gets
good grades. She drives a bronze tro_door Corvair with the front crashed in, California
Licento KUZ 777. fost comes George Matifices, a good friend of Bohner's, Corgo come
from Boston a short time after Soluer, and lives at the Muir addoss' too, Rest in line
pauses Starl Antehead, she is Ceorge's girl friend and lives at the Muir address part -
Of the cinc. rest of the time you can find her at 302 Whiley, Oceanside. She drites
1965 two door Dodge Durt, number PG 420. And lastly we come to lizabeth aid of
#44 Indian St, San Diego, Her car is a Plymouth Valiant 1964 light blue, licone number

Virginia State Division of Motor Vehicles, Richmond, Virginia,
advised that she could locate no information in her files to show
that a motor vehicle is currently registered in the name of FRANK
AUGUST DRAGER, JR., in the State of Virginia.
On January 21, 1967, RH T-1 advised that DRAGER does
not own an automobile, but has, as a member of the ANP, access to
automobiles utilized by that organization. One of these automobiles
is a 1965 El Dorado bearing 1966 Virginia License CO 4364.
added that a 1963 Ford, four-door sedan, bearing 1966 Virginia

ADMINISTRATIVE:
For all receiving offices, DRAGER is presently
carried as an ADEX subject. Inasmuch as DRAGER has indicated
he advocates the violent overthrow of the US. Government and has
overtly been attempting to recruit personnel, arms and ammunitions
in efforts to accomplish this end, it is recommended DRAGER be
continuéd as an ADEX subject and his activities be closely
followed.
Information copies of instant report are being mado
available to designated offices, inasmuch as investigation has
revealed the subject has associates and contacts residing within
these divisions. Subject is believed to have travelled within
these divisions between September, 1973 and June, 1974.
Investigation by Newark Division has failed to identify
any members of a group called the National Revolutionary Army.
DRAGER and WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL have claimed to have recruited
disgruntled right wing patriots from the Ku Klux Klan, Minutemen
and Nazi Party.
Information copies are further being made available
inasmuch as DRAGER and CARROLL have been involved in extensive
criminal activities throughout these divisions in efforts to
support themselves while travelling throughout the U.S.

As noted before, on July 1, 1966, RH T-1 made available

Under a section of this application entitled "State In Your
Own Words Why You Want To Join The American Nazi Party, the
following was contained:
"I have tired of the unecessary and rediculous Negro
gains to overthrow the United States and dominate
the white race. I find it nealy impossible to locate
non Jew owned businesses and feel that the American
Jew is nerly in, control of our nations capitol. I
feel that it is time for something to be done. The
ANP seems to be the only organization combating the
existing racial problems in the U. S. and I want to
do my part.

organization was changed to National Socialist
White People's Party. The NSWPP supports
and follows the line of hatred against blacks,
Jews and communists through various propaganda
media, demonstrations, and other publicity-
seeking devices for the purpose of seeking a
legitimate dominant political party within the
United States and in foreign countries.
Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the
NSWPP is currently led by Matthias Koehl, Jr.

DRAGER did admit to past memberships in the American
Nazi Party, National Socialist White Peoples Party, Ku Klux
Klan, Knights of Constantine, as well as generally claiming
membership in all right wing organizations at one time or
another during the past 15 years.
He stated be was recently the self-appointed Acting
Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey. I felt the
organization nocded leadership and that he had the respect
of other loaders in the group, but did have some conflicts
with some other independent klan organizations in New Jersey.
DRAGHR statod that ho, in the past, has been
harassed by local authoritios and the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation but that he has never had any problems with any of the
leadership of any right wing organization.

had any communications with DOFUGH.

of the Aerican Nazi Party and worked in its national bead-
quarters in Arlington, Virginia. He worked closely with
GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL during this period as his second in
command although he would never accept any rank higher than

the United States Froasury bonartment and the Internal Rovento
Service, and such organizations to the Jowish Anti-Dofumtion
Loague, who although is not a Government agency, he feels
it receives, its authority to act from the Government.
DRAGER agreed that to succecal in the violent overs
throw of the country a supply of weapons and ammunition would
be necessary. I peated he knows of no right wing oranish-
tion who currently has a stockpile of weapons and adviced
that the source of weapons at the right time would ke' the
United States litzy establisbront, whose loaders and
white reubers he predicts will join his cause when it is
time for action. Although he has hond that the Minutemon
organization was stockpiling weapons, he has no evidence that
that organisation currently has any large supply of weapons
in its possession,
He stated that ho also felt that all the State
units of Government will join his cause at the right tino
and that they will revolt against the suppression pinced on
them by the Federal Government. He feels that ovon personnel
of the Fodoral Bureau of Investigation will join his cause
because of their basic concorvative beliefs and because of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's concern for the good
of the country. lb feels that the redoval Búman of Invosti-
gation is now only a "pawn" of the Justice Department from
which it receives its orders.

AMERICAN NAZI PARTY
OF THE WORLD UNION OF
FREE ENTERPRISE NATIONAL
SOCIALISTS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE
GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL PARTY
APPENDIX
In his book "This Time The World", copyrighted in 1961,
George Lincoln Rockwell identified himself as Commander, American
Nazi Party of the World Union of Free Enterprise National
•Socialists (ANP WUFENS), Arlington, Virginia.
•
The April 4, 1963, issue of "The Richmond News Leader"
a Richmond, Virginia, daily newspaper, reported that George.
Lincoln Rockwell had, on the previous day, again applied for the
American Nazi Party to be chartered in the State of Virginia, but
this request was turned down by the Virginia State Corporation
Commission. This action was taken pursuant to an act of the 1962
Virginia Assembly which prohibits use of "Nazi" or "National
Socialism" in a Virginia charter. This article further pointed
out that Rockwell's Party is presently chartered in the State of
Virginia as the George Lincoln Rockwell Party.
:
-
On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the ANP
WUFENS was organized by George Lincoln Rockwell at his residence
in Arlington, Virginia, on February 26, 1959, as an international
"National Socialist" movement based on the German Nazi Party.
headed by Adolf Hitler. He added that Rockwell is the dominant
force and personality in this party%3B that he is espousing a "line"
of hatred against the Jews and Negroes; and that he is seeking,
through speeches, distribution of literature and picketing, to
establish a cohesive and dominant political party in the United
States and in foreign countries.
According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual" an official
publication of the ANP, the phases of ANP struggle for power are
fourfold, namely, first "to make ourselves known to the masses";
second, the dissemination of our program and truth about the
Party"; third, "organizing the people who have been converted to
our propaganda"%; and fourth, "the attainment of power through the
votes of the newly-won masses".
On August 19, 1966, the source advised that George Lincoln
Rockwell presently believes that he has completed the first two
phases in his struggle for power and is well into the third stage,
to wit, "the organizing of the people who have been converted to
our propaganda". The source added that Rockwell had previously
believed that he would be elected Governor of Virginia in November,
1965, and when defeated, he made the statement that he was not ready
for stage four.

On March 1, 1974, DRAGER and CARROLL were released
on bond from the Sagamon County Jail. The subject's vehicle,
a 1970 Ford pickup truck, with a camper truck unit, was left
by DRAGER at the Sheriff's Impound Lot.

On March 6, 1974, NK T-2 advised he obtained information
that FRANK DRAGER had visited ROBERT DE PUGH, Titular, Head of
the Minutemen Organization, in Norborne, Missouri.
*
The Minutemen organization was organized
in 1960, reportedly to resist the spread of
communism in the United States by use of
guerrilla tactics. Robert B. DePugh, national
coordinator of the Minutemen, was sentenced in
October, 1970, for violations of the Federal
Firearms Act. At the time of his arrest DePugh
was in possession of documents concerned with
guerrilla warfare and other paraphernalia, including
hand grenades, gun silencers, and a machine gun.
DePugh was released on parole during April, 1973,
and in June, 1973, ‘indicated he planned to revitalize
the Minutemen into a "two-armed organization".
Arm number one was to be utilized as a political
front organization to sway elections and control
local and state political structures. Arm number
two was to be an underground guerrilla organization
made up of "strike teams". These "strike teams"
are to be under direct control of DePugh and their
existence is to be unknown to everyone, including
Minutemen State Coordinators.
After leaving Norborne, DRAGER was arrested in
Springfield, Illinois. DRAGER was scheduled to proceed to
Columbus, Ohio to meet with JOHN GERHARDT, Leader of the American
White Nationalist Party (AWNP) and was to continue to Reading,
Pennsylvania, to meet with ROY FRANKHOUSER.
DRAGER was supposedly carrying a message from DE PUGH
to GERHARDT and FRANKHOUSER. GERHARDT and his brother, ED
GERHARDT, are leaders of the AWNP in Columbus, Ohio. The GERHARDTS
and a JAMES THOMPSON were arrested for shooting the homes of
school officials in Columbus, Ohio. JAMES THOMPSON allegedly
turned stated witness against the GERHARDT brothers. The GFRUARƆT
brothers contacted the Indiana coordinator of the Minutemen and
ROY FRANKHOUSER to make plans to prevent THOMPSON's testimony and
have discussed possible execution. FRANKHOUSER allegedly advised

"I had originally planned for this communication to
be typewritten, but since I stole this tape recorder, I guess
it's just as appropriate as a letter.
Clarence Kelley, Director of the FBI,
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Kelley:
I had always praised the thoroughness of the FBI,
even though on scores of occasions you've permitted your
paranoia and your lack of human understanding could foul. you
up. Your drooling excitement and your paranoic stupidity and
your fruitless eagerness at having Frank Drager in your grimy
grubs in Springfield, Illinois, make super idiots of the
Federal Bureau of Integration. You now realize how many
foolish errors you made. In the near future you will be em-
ployed by the new natural government of America rather than
the Jew Justice Department and such stupidity will not be
tolerated. How ridiculous for a gang of trained investigators
to be fooled and beaten by a teenager. Have you idiots put
all the pieces together yet? Whether or not you have, we both
thank God for your paranoid stupidity for now we are free to
continue tying together the few remaining loose ends which
will permit the National Revolutionary Army to eliminate
criminal Jewish control of America. Now our armies can con-
tinue to join forces to eliminate this alien enemy government.
Continue your search for Frank Drager and Bill Carroll. It'll
be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to capture
one of our soldiers in the future, beware, there's a speeding
soft-nose for all of our enemies. Unfortunately, most fellow
Agents are mercenaries. They are actually with us in spirit
but they will still follow the orders of their Jewish superiors
to attempt to detect and capture our people and unfortunately
we will have to deal with these Agents ruthlessly until they
realize that they are dominated and controlled by alien enemies
of America and begin working on the side of right.
At one
time not too long ago we patriots were as useless as a bunch.

APPENDIX
RE: INTERSTATE KLAN,
KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
A source advised on June 12, 1966, that on that
date, FRANCIS XAVIER EDWARDS, then Exalted Cyclops of the
Wheaton, Maryland, Klavern of the United Klans of America,
Inc., Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (UKA), at an open meeting
of that organization at Camp Springs, Maryland, publicly
stated that his organization, the Wheaton, Maryland,
Klavern of the UKA would cooperate with but not merge with
the American Nazi Party (ANP) as they had a common goal.
At the above meeting, EDWARDS also announced publicly that
his Klavern was leaving the UKA and would be known as the
Maryland Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (MKKK).
A second source advised that EDWARDS' group was
expelled from the UKA, Junė 12, 1966; for cooperating with
the ANP. :
Subsequent to the above time, a third source
determined that the MKKK had changed its name to the
Interstate Klan, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (IK) with
national office at Post Office Box 185, Savage, Maryland,
and FRANCIS XAVIER EDWARDS its Imperial Wizard and highest
official.
The third source advised that the oath taken by
new IK members includes pledges of loyalty to the country,
the Klan and white supremacy.
The IK, according to the third source, claims
members in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and Washington, D. C.

Now our goals are within our grips and our armies are beginning
to activate. A large segment of the left and the right are no
longer shooting at each other. Yes, the fear of our enemies
is now realistic. The bullets of all pro-American revolution-
aries are aimed at the alien enemies in control and not at
each other. Summer is near. Federal Agents beware.
We mean
business and we have the facilities not to be stopped. Your
laws don't bother us%; your jails don't scare us; and your
bullets will be returned with more bullets. Your leaders have
bankrupted our people, have starved them, and caused enough
materialistic havoc that we now have the will of the people
with us. Even the stupidist in America see through the grain
shortages, fuel shortages, price gougings, meat shortages,
work stoppages, and various other criminal corruption by the
enemy aliens in control. America's masses are in the corner.
Now just stand back and watch them come out shooting. When the
smoke clears, America shall be the victor.
: White Power."
"The following portion of this communication will
be the only press release of the New Revolutionary Army. In
future months, as our movement gains momentum, I wish for the
press to understand what we are about rather than what the FBI
tells them. There is a brief but somewhat inclusive listing
of our program included.
The New Revolutionary Party herewith immediately de-
clares that the present Government of the United States of
America is an illegal confederation of aliens and enemies of
the people of America. The New Revolutionary Army, its officers
and followers henceforth secede from the United States of
America until such time we may be able to restore a Government
of the people, by the people and for the people and oust the
enemy aliens now in control. Through force and violence and
whatever means available to the NRA, we will totally, forcefully
and quickly restore sanity to our American republic. We have
adopted the American Constitution in its original form, revised

GERHARDT he had a man who was unknown and could take care of
THOMPSON. This individual is believed to be FRANK DRAGER.
•CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION-
On March 7, 1974, Mr. DANIEL JAMES BRODERICK, Staff
Quarters, Ocean Reef Club, North Key Largo, Florida, advised
DRAGER and he have been long time friends having met in Trenton,
New Jersey. BRODERICK stated DRAGER claims to be "acting dragon"
in the Ku Klux Klan and was known to him to have close links with
the United Klan Leader ROBERT SHELTON. He further advised DRAGER
did carry some type of firearm with him on his person at most times.
CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION
On May 16, 1974, BRODERICK was recontacted by Special
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the Ocean Reef,
Florida.

FRANKHOUSER and DRAGER have a small arsenal of weapons, primarily
automatic rifles. All or most part of these guns are stolen.
The arsenal consists of three satchels, one belonging to FRANKHOUSER,
the other :to DRAGER and the third to both. Apparently only
FRANKHOUSER knows their present whereabouts.
CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION
BRODERICK also stated that while in Florida City,
DRAGER told him that he and CARROLL had stolen the checks made
out to the Marathon Cay Sal Billfish Tournament and had been
cashing them in the Florida Keys area. According to DRAGER,
CARROLL committed the actual theft, while DRAGER waited in his
truck nearby.

On April 22, 1974, a tape cassette case with tape
cassette inside was received at FBI Headquarters enclosed in a
white envelope, bearing notation "20 April 1974; 85th birthday
of Adolf Hitler; thought you guys might like to hear from us.
FRANK DRAGER, WILLIAM CARROLL, National Revolutionary Army.
The speaker on the tape claims to be FRANK DRAGER. An examination
of the envelope by the Identification Division revealed three
fingerprints of subject, FBI Numer 405-550-E. Copies of this
tape was also sent to the "Trentonian Newspaper", Trenton, New
Jersey, and the "United Press International", in New Orleans,
Louisiana, as a press release for the National Revolutionary
Army (NRA).
This tape in transcript form is set forth below:

the Bill of Rights, and eliminated or revised all the amend-
ments to the Constitution. We have formed a national caucus
of the hundreds of known and unknown political leaders whose
present identity will remain anonymous, who at the time the
enemy aliens perish or relinquish control, will immediately
be brought before the American voter to seize popular control
of vacant political offices.
We of the NRA are the people, we speak for the
people, and we will violently eliminate America's enemies
with the haste of a speeding bullet. The NRA has chosen for
its spokesman a well-known adversary for the return of America
to a natural social order. The revolutionaries of the NRA are
ordered to maintain in every way possible or to avoid detection
by the enemy, but are ordered not to deny their association if
at such time they are detected by the enemy or captured. All
NRA members and associates are instructed that if captured they
are governed by the laws set at the Geneva Conference for cap-
tured soldiers and prisoners of war. This is by all means a
declaration of war. The enemies of white America will fall
like flies at a Raid party.
The following is a very brief synopsis of the goals
of the NRA once we seize power.

and prepare for repatriation.

The Federal Reserve will be abolished and all
illegal tender returned and it will be replaced with legal
notes once citizenship is confirmed.

DRAGER alleges to have traveled to various parts of
the country and has urged members of the right wing to commit
acts of violence on July 4, 1974, so that the NRA could take
credit for these acts. The source was advised DRAGER exhibited
four .45 caliber pistols, three .30 caliber carbines and one
bolt action rifle at this meeting.
The source was further advised DRAGER braggs about his

It is noted Special Agents of the FBI mentioned above are
possibly identical to SAS BURL E. CLONINGER and CHARLES F. MOFFETT,
who have worked Ku Klux Klan matters in the Trenton, New Jersey area.
FRANKHOUSER stated he accompanied DRAGER and they walked
to the vicinity of 3rd and Walnut Streets, Reading, Pennsylvania,
where a relatively new car was parked. DRAGER opened the trunk and
FRANKHOUSER observed numerous handguns and rifles and believed there
were explosives in the trunk. FRANKHOUSER could not furnish further
description of this vehicle. DRAGER showed FRANKHOUSER the weapons
to show them "we mean business".
FRANKHOUSER then stated that DRAGER indicated he had a
"caper" planned that would meant $100,000.00. DRAGER did not
further discuss the caper. FRANKHOUSER concluded on his own that
the "caper" was possibly a bank robbery. FRANKHOUSER denied any
specific knowledge regarding any bank robberies on DRAGER's part.
FRANKHOUSER stated he was contacted by DRAGER via telephone
call on one occasion subsequent to June 7, 1974 meeting. At this
time, DRAGER indicated two of his men had been arrested and the
"caper" was delayed. This contact was about two days prior to
DRAGER's arrest in New Jersey.

It is noted the New Jersey State Police made available
a xerox copy of a parking ticket in the recovered 1973 Pinto, stolen
by DRAGER on March 11, 1974, indicating he was ticketed on June 6,

of independent Ku Klux Klan members and several Indiana representatives
of the Minutemen. FRANK DRAGER was in attendance and discussed his
plans for the forming of a group called "NRA" and the source also
developed information that DRAGER was planing to blow up two city
blocks on July 4, 1974.
On July 2, 1974, Mr. ROY FRANKHOUSER was interviewed by
Special Agents of the FBI in the presence of his attorney. FRANKHOUSER
stated he met FRANK DRAGER on June 7, 1974, at the Coach House
Restaurant, 5th and Walnut Streets, Reading, Pennsylvania.
FRANKHOUSER was brought to the restaurant by a JAKE (LAST NAME UNKNOWN)
an associate of DRAGER's; however, JAKE was not present during this
meeting. During the meeting, DRAGER wanted FRANKHOUSER's help in
obtaining fuses for timing devices for explosives and requested
further assistance in several projects. FRANKHOUSER stated he
declined in both cases. DRAGER stated he had looked into the Gubow
matter in Michigan, and indicated he and his group were going to kill
Judge GUBOW. DRAGER stated he had been to Michigan and "cased"
the judge's home. DRAGER stated he tried to contact the wife of
Reverend ROBERT MILES, in Michigan, but she would not talk to him.
DRAGER stated the only reservation he had about killing Judge GUBOW
was whether or not it would effect the appeal of Reverend MILES.
It is noted Judge GUBOW is the Federal judge who sat in
on the case involving Reverend ROBERT MILES, who was tried and
convicted for the bombing of school buses in Pontiac, Michigan.
FRANKHOUSER stated DRAGER also stated he was going to take
care of two FBI agents and mentioned the names CLONINGER (phonetic)
and MIFFLIN (phonetic). DRAGER indicated he was going to "blow
them out" and kill them. DRAGER also indicated he needed enough
explosives to "level a one story building". DRAGER stated that at
one point he was going to blow up an IRS building, but did not mention
any specific location.

WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL, in-mate, Burlington County
Jail, was made known the identity of the interviewing agent
and the nature of the inquiry. CARROLL was advised of his
Constitutional Rights and indicated he understood these
rights but was unwilling to sign any forms indicating such
or to sign any statements. CARROLL was advised that the
interviewing agent was specifically seeking information
regarding the activities of he and FRANK AUGUST DRAGER and a
group called the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). CARROLL
related the following information:
44
He stated he met FRANK DRAGER in the presence of a
THOMAS MIDDAUGH prior to the summer of 1973. MIDDAUGH was
described as his close friend and they both attended a
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rally in Upper New Jersey, at which time
MIDDAUGH introduced him to DRAGER. DRAGER is known to be the
legal guardian for MIDDAUGH. He was much impressed by the
zeal and philosophy of FRANK DRAGER and immediately became
his close friend and associate. Even though it was later
learned by CARRQLL that DRAGER was a homosexual, he decided
to be tolerant of this fact and they would continue to travel
together and expound their right wing philosophy.
He stated he felt he had quite a bit to do with
FRANK DRAGER re-joining the right wing element. He stated
that they talked a lot about how the right wing could change
the country and felt they could work together as a highly
proficient team. He stated that many of their activities were
planned while they were high on marijuana.
Janez
Later that summer he and DRAGER were in Trenton,
N.J., where he was introduced to one of DRAGER's best friends
by the name of JIM BRODERICK. BRODERICK was known to have
an extensive criminal record and at that time was dealing in
marijuana. BRODERICK was also seen on numerous occasions with
stolen checks believed to have been taken from the Trenton
area businesses. He, DRAGER and BRODERICK left the Trenton
area inasmuch as BRODERICK was involved in some way with a
200 pound marijuana buy which involved a shooting. CARROLL
stated he did not know the specifics of this incident.

by DRAGER inasmuch as KEITH is a close friend of JAMES
BRODERICK and was known to be active in criminal endeavors in.
the Trenton area. He and DRAGER believed KEITH might be able
to financially help their cause.
CARROLL advised the NRA's philosophy was an incorpora-
tion of much of the thoughts of the KKK, Minutemen, and the
American Nazi Party. He stated they were more revolutionary
and would actively and ardently endeavor to overthrow the U.S.
Government and replace it with the National Revolutionary
Army. He expounded the philosophy that the NRA was anti-Jewish,
anti-Negro, and anti-Catholic. The NRA is promoting the
deportation of all non-native born Americans and the return
of the Jews and Negroes to their homelands. He stated they
were definitely against the Federal Income Tax, which is
what led them to decide to blow up the IRS building in
Washington, D.C. The NRA further advocates political assassinations
if necessary. He stated that DRAGER had considered killing
a Judge GUBOW in Michigan but decided not to inasmuch as the
judge's death might hinder the appeal of Reverend BOB MILES
who has been sentenced to prison by Judge GUBOW for the
bombing of school buses in Michigan. CARROLL stated he and
DRAGER have cashed numerous stolen checks throughout the U.S.
to support themselves. He indicated DRAGER was possibly
involved in an armed robbery in the Boston, Mass., area but
then decided he did not want to talk further about this matter.
DRAGER had obtained numerous handguns and rifles
while travelling throughout the U.S. Most of these weapons
were purchased in the name of FRANK DRAGER, using identification
DRAGER had obtained in his own name in Florida.
CARROLL was asked about his knowledge of a tape
-recording sent to ORVILLE LIPPERT in Florida, where DRAGER
requests LIPPERT's assistance in returning his camper truck,
which LIPPERT purchased from him, to his aunt EDNA GRABER
in Trenton, N.J. In this tape, DRAGER identified himself to
LIPPERT so that EDNA GRABER can purchase back this vehicle for
DRAGER. CARROLL stated LIPPERT purchased this vehicle from
DRAGER for $1.00. LIPPERT went to Springfield, Ill., and
obtained the truck from the Springfield, Ill., police authorities.
At the end of this tape, DRAGER makes reference to the fact
he killed "two pigs", in Atlanta and one in Miami Beach but
with zero publicity. DRAGER then states "watch out for the
third pig." CARROLL advised the word pig referred to the

DRAGER obtained bail money for them and upon their
release from jail they tried to obtain the camper truck back
but were advised by the local authorities it was going to be
used as evidence in their pending case.
Inasmuch as they had no transportation, they then
hitchhiked from Springfield, Ill., to York, Pa., where they
visited with AL LENTZ. They then proceeded to Trenton, N.J.,
and obtained a rental car which they did not return. CARROLL
indicated they then left the Trenton area and went to Boston,
Mass., in efforts to get him a driver's license. While in
Boston they tried to cash several more Captain Courageous
checks but were not successful, inasmuch as everybody
required photographic identification.
They
After having left Boston, Mass., they travelled to
Washington, D.C., and visited a SKYLER FERRIS (phonetic).
tried to obtain maps of the sewer system of Washington, D.C.,
from him. FERRIS was advised of their plans to bomb the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and at first FERRIS was not
agreeable. FERRIS was then guaranteed that the local authorities
would be advised of the bomb a half hour prior to its detonation
on July 4, 1974. FERRIS was agreeable to this plan and
supplied them with the diagram of the sewer system. FERRIS
is further known to be a right wing patriot and supplied
names of local patriots to DRAGER.
After departing Washington, D.C., they travelled
to Florida and visited with an ORVILLE LIPPERT.
They then proceeded to Alabama where they registered
the vehicle they stole in Trenton, N.J. They then travelled
back to York, Pa., and saw AL LENTZ again. They visited
several days with LENTZ and then returned to Trenton, N.J.,
where they looked up a JAMES KEITH, who is known to be a
close friend of JAMES BRODERICK. They requested him to find
them an apartment which they could rent for several weeks
prior to their planned July 4 attempt to bomb the IRS,
Washington, D.C.
KEITH, DRAGER, and he were going to the Florence
Motel in Florence, N.J., to move into a room they had rented.
DRAGER was dropped off at an Acme Market to buy groceries
inasmuch as there was not room in the vehicle for the three
of them and groceries. They were heading toward the motel
to deposit their equipment and clothes when they were arrested

by the New Jersey State Police for passing a stopped school
bus. He stated he was going to shoot it out with the New
Jersey State Trooper but became concerned when KEITH did not
appear to go along with the idea. They were going to stay at
the motel for approximately two weeks and then return to
Pennsylvania and get dynamite from some patriots in Pennsylvania.
If this plan was unsuccessful, they had planned to go to one
of the Western States and obtain dynamite under the guise of
future prospectors. He stated that the chemicals that were
in the car at the time of his arrest were experimented with
by he and DRAGER in efforts to make a bomb. These efforts were
not too successful and thusly they decided dynamite would be
a better method.
CARROLL advised the NRA is identical to the White
Action Movement formed by DRAGER in 1970 in Trenton, N.J.
He claims to have organized chapters all over the United States
and Canada and these groups are composed of disgruntled right
wing patriots who are not satisfied with the passive activities
of the KKK and the Minutemen Organization. He claimed to have
taken an oath and could not divulge who any of these other
members are. He claimed this group is storing weapons and
explosives and no chapter knows where the other chapter's
weapons are.
CARROLL stated the NRA believes in doing anything
necessary to support themselves while they are endeavoring to
overtake the U.S. Government. The NRA believes in bank
robbery, armored car heists, and cashing stolen checks.
He said presently the NRA has no plans for political kidnappings.
He stated all their members are instructed to die for the
cause if necessary. The NRA has devised a code system whereby
one member can contact another member without the Federal
authorities knowing this is being done. He stated they have
several training grounds throughout the East Coast and
Mid-West areas and their men are being trained in the use of
all kinds of weapons.
When specifically asked who other members of the
NRA were, CARROLL refused to identify any of these members
and it appeared as if possibly no members did, in fact,
exist.
-
CARROLL advised JAMES KEITH, who was arrested with
him in the stolen motor vehicle, was not a right wing Patriot
and could not be trusted. KEITH's services were requested

They then went to the Jersey Shore where BRODERICK
and DRAGER obtained employment at the Captain Courageous Bar.
BRODERICK and DRAGER were known to have stolen numerous checks
from the Captain Courageous Bar and passed these checks to
obtain money to travel to Florida.
In September of 1973, he, DRAGER and BRODERICK were
arrested in Toms River, N.J., in what he felt was a "set up"
He stated he believed the FBI had made their presence known to
the local authorities so the local authorities would arrest
and harass them for the FBI. The three of them made bail and
purchased 40 pounds of marijuana and left for Florida in
FRANK DRAGER's camper truck. They took several jobs under
assumed names, working as dishwashers and cooks. BRODERICK
then took a job at the Ocean Reef Beach Club in Key Largo, Fla.
He and DRAGER also worked there for a short time but were
fired.
: During this period of time, DRAGER purchased an
M-1 Carbine and a .45 caliber automatic pistol while in
Florida. He and DRAGER then travelled to New Orleans,
where they made a drug buy and stole a .32 caliber handgun
from a drug pusher on the New Orleans waterfront.
After making several right wing contacts, they left
New Orleans and, travelled to Springfield, Ill., to meet
other right wing sympathizers. On their journey, they had
met ROBERT SHELTON of the KKK and Roral full support for the
ROBERT DE PUGH of the
Minutemen. SHELTON and DE PUGH promised
NRA, which CARROLL stated was the same as the White Action
Movement founded by DRAGER several years ago at Trenton, N.J.
On their way to Springfield, they stopped at the residence of
DON ZINN in Michigan. CARROLL indicated that during their
travels they were constantly seeking weapons, ammunition, and
manuals on gorilla warfare.
While in Springfield, Ill., in February, 1974, they
were arrested for possession of marijuana, burglary tools,
and dangerous weapons. CARROLL again advised he felt the
FBI had something to do with this arrest and expressed the
thought that possibly DE PUGH was an informant or else the
FBI had seen them with DE PUGH and followed them to the
location of their arrest. CARROLL stated he used the identification
of THOMAS MIDDAUGH inasmuch as he thought the FBI and the
Florida authorities had warrants for he and DRAGER.

JAMES KEITH, in-mate, Burlington County Jail,
was made known the identity of the interviewing agent by
a show of credentials and was advised the FBI was inquiring
of him any information he had regarding the activities of
WILLIAM ÈRIC CARROLL, FRANK AUGUST DRAGER, and a group
called the National Revolutionary Army.
KEITH stated he has known FRANK DRAGER for approxi-
mately two years. He was introduced to DRAGER by a JAMES
BRODERICK, who was described by him to be his best friend.
KEITH advised he personally has no political philosophy, and
more specifically is not involved in any form or phase with
DRAGER or his right wing extremist activities.

WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL, known to him as JAKE, JAKE and DRAGER

stated BRODERICK had given DRAGER his address. DRAGER and
JAKE stayed at his apartment for one night. DRAGER stated
he needed a place to lay low for two weeks inasmuch as he
planned to travel to Washington, D.C., to blow up the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building at Washington, D.C.
KEITH advised he felt DRAGER was a braggart and did not
believe DRAGER would actually blow up the IRS Building.
DRAGER stated that they were presently operating a stolen
motor vehicle and were wanted by the FBI. KEITH stated he
found an apartment on the corner of Hamilton and Chambers
Streets in Trenton, N.J., but DRAGER refused this inasmuch
as it was on the third floor rather than the first floor.
That next evening, on the 12th of June, they visited a close
friend of KEITH's by the name of VINNY (RAMPONE, 545 Hamilton
Avenue, and requested of RAMPONE a garage in which to hide
the stolen motor vehicle. He stated he did not tell RAMPONE
specifically the nature of the request inasmuch as he felt
RAMPONE might call the police if he knew the car was stolen.
KEITH advised he knew DRAGER had numerous weapons concealed
in the vehicle. KEITH stated that he did not wish DRAGER

It is further noted ROY FRANKHOUSER, Reading, Pa.,
is believed to use the code name "RALPH". FRANK DRAGER and
JAKE had planned to rob a bank and had considered also an
armored car robbery.
JAKE had mentioned on several occasions a training
grounds used by the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) for
the purpose of the invasion of Cuba and the NRA claims support
from the Cuban underground. The NRA supposedly plans to
invade Cuba on July 4, 1976.
It was further learned that the camper truck, which
is a home-made camper and in the possession of ORVILLE LIPPERT, was
designed specifically to be used in smuggling guns across
the Canadian border. The walls of the camper truck have secret
compartments and DRAGER is supposed to have a gun contact in
Canada. Presently there are believed to be two 9mm. lugers
located somehwere in the camper body. JAKE also stated DRAGER
has a close friend who is affiliated with the Ford Motor Company
as an inventor. This individual is an excellent machinist and
has made numerous silencers for the right wing element.
KEITH advised he did not condone the right wing
activities of JAKE and DRAGER and stated he would help the
FBI.in any way possible.

efficiency apartment at the Florence Motel in Florence, N.J.
On the evening of June 13, 1974, he and JAKE dropped FRANK
DRAGER off at a grocery store in the Florence, N.J., area,
and as they were travelling to the motel they were arrested
by the New Jersey State Police on a traffic charge. At.
the time they were stopped, CARROLL reached under the front
seat and drew out a .45 caliber automatic and stated he was
going to shoot it out with the trooper. KEITH told him
he was crazy, inasmuch as JAKE did not even know why they
were stopped. The officer advised them they had illegally
passed a school bus and requested to see JAKE's identification.
JAKE then handed the trooper a driver's license and the
trooper evidently noticed JAKE had several other driver's
licenses in his wallet. The trooper then apparently became
suspicious and made them stand against the car while he looked
around. The trooper then spotted one of the guns, placed them
under arrest, and later determined the car to have been stolen.
KEITH stated he is a parole violator inasmuch as
he has been arrested. KEITH indicated he had no involvement
with DRAGER and JAKE and had requested he transfer to another
jail inasmuch as his involvement with JAKE might get him into
further trouble.
He stated that in his conversations with JAKE while
in the Burlington County Jail he has determined the following
information:
DRAGER and JAKE had received a map of the diagram
of the sewer system in Washington, D.C., from a friend of
DRAGER's who works for the Sewer Department in Washington, D.C.
JAKE and DRAGER indicated they were going to blow up the IRS
Building in Washington, D.C. It was also determined that
DRAGER has dynamite and guns buried on a farm, which is in
Pennsylvania. The name GEORGE HOUSER was mentioned in reference
to this farm. JAKE had indicated he and DRAGER had gone to
the Boston, Mass., area and possibly were involved in a bank
robbery. JAKE and DRAGER had pre-arranged plans to make an
escape at any courthouse the other one was to appear if
apprehended. A person by the name of DE PUGH was to have
gotten a copy of the sewer plans of Washington, D.C., from
FERRIS. A RAYMOND DOERFLER from Trenton, N.J., went to a
Ku Klux Klan meeting at Rising Sun, Md., in efforts to get
money for FRANK DRAGER's bail and further monies in efforts
to help DRAGER purchase his camper truck from a ORVILLE LIPPERT.

Mr. WILLIAM R. JENKINS 364 South Olden Avenue,
Trenton, N.J.I was interviewed regarding his knowledge
involving his identification papers being found on a WILLIAM
ERIC CARROLL when CARROLL was arrested on June 13, 1974,
by the New Jersey State Police at Columbus, N.J.
JENKINS initially advised he had no knowledge as to
how WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL could be in receipt of his driver's
license and Social Security Card. He stated he had lost
his wallet several months back and did not know its where-
abouts. At that time, it was pointed out to him that
CARROLL was a travelling companion of FRANK AUGUST DRAGER,
and that DRAGER had had his White Action Movement Headquarters
just two houses from the JENKINS' residence. At that time,
JENKINS advised that he knew FRANK DRAGER and related the
following information:
He stated that early in the Spring of 1974 he
saw FRANK DRAGER in a camper truck with Pennsylvania tags
across the street from his residence. DRAGER had spotted him
coming home from school and pulled over to talk to him. DRAGER
had stated that he was wanted by the FBI and needed phoney
identification. JENKINS advised he could not help him and
could not supply any information how he might obtain such.
"
JENKINS then advised that around the first of June,
1974, he again met DRAGER in the front of his residence and
DRAGER, at that time, was driving a green Ford Pinto believed
to have Florida license plates. Again DRAGER requested false
identification, and JENKINS advised he could not supply him
with any.
JENKINS then noticed his driver's license was about
to expire and asked DRAGER to take him down to the Department
of Motor Vehicles Trenton, N.J., where he could obtain a new
license. JENKINS then stated he must have accidently lost
his wallet in DRAGER's car when they were returning from the
Department of Motor Vehicles. Again DRAGER indicated he was
wanted by the FBI and local police authorities. He stated
he was only passing through Trenton and was not staying in
the area.

VINCENT RAMPONE, 545 Hamilton Avenue, was inter-
viewed regarding any knowledge he may have as to how WILLIAM
ERIC CARROLL was in possession of RAMPONE's driver's license
and Social Security Card.
RAMPONE advised he is a close friend of JAMES KEITH,
known to him as TEX, and on the evening of June 12, 1974,
KEITH and JAKE visited his apartment. They stayed there for
several hours talking about things in general.
JAKE then began to go off on a right wing tangent
and talked about "niggers and how they should be sent back
ts
to Africa. RAMPONE told KEITH that this individual was not.
welcome in his house inasmuch as he, RAMPONE, did not advocate
the right wing program. At that time KEITH stated a FRANK
DRAGER needed a garage to park his car. RAMPONE then
realized DRAGER was also a right wing extremist and declined
this request. He stated that at that time JAKE had access to
his bedroom and bathroom and possibly obtained some of this
identification at that time. RAMPONE showed his original
driver's license and indicated the only thing JAKE could
have obtained was an old temporary driver's license which was
probably laying on his dresser.

Mr. RAYMOND DOERELER, 549 Centre Street, Trenton,
N.J., voluntarily appeared at the Trenton Resident Agency
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and advised he
was a close friend to FRANK AUGUST DRAGER. He stated he and
DRAGER had been active together over the past several years
in matters involving the activities of the National Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan in Bucks County, Pa. DOERFLER advised
he is presently a leading officer of the Bucks County Chapter.
DOERFLER advised that inasmuch as FRANK DRAGER
has appeared ultra-radical in his right wing activities and
has been committing many criminal violations, DOERFLER felt
it was in the best interest of the Klan if they would
separate themselves from any of DRAGER's activities.
On March 12, 1974, DRAGER contacted DOERFLER at
DOERFLER's place of employment, The Pennington Furnace,
Pennington, N.J., and asked DOERFLER to supply him with
phoney identification. DRAGER stated the green Ford Pinto
he was driving was stolen and he had plans of leaving the State
of New Jersey. DOERFLER stated that DRAGER was in the company
of a young white male known to him by the name JAKE. It
was also noted that several weapons were observed in this
vehicle.
DOERFLER said to DRAGER he could not supply him with
any phoney identification, and more specifically could not
give him his.

DOERFLER was told by DRAGER that he, DRAGER, was
going to leave the area and head toward Penndel, Pa.,
meet a FRED SHAFFLER at the Lantern Inn in Penndel.

On June 27, 1974, Mr. SCHUYLER DAVENPORT FERRIS
H
D.C.
2903 Brook Drive, Falls Church, Virginia, was interviewed by
Special Agents of the FBI. He stated he continues his employment
with the District of Columbia Government, where he checks on and
takes remedial action concerning sludge buildup where sewage
pipes enter the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in the Washington,
D.C. area. FERRIS related anyone claiming to be an engineer or
to acting on behalf of an engineer, may obtain free copies of
diograms of water and sewer systems of Washington, D.C. area,
by contacting Third Floor of the District Building, 12th and
Pennsylvania Avenues, Washington, D.C. FERRIS denied having
furnished any such documents to anyone and emphasized that anyone
could obtain these diograms. FERRIS was asked if he had knowledge
of any plans to disrupt water or sewer systems in any major cities
and he denied knowing of any such plans. On June 30, 1974, FERRIS
telephonically contacted the FBI and advised Special Agents that
he desired to provide additional information in connection with
his interview as conducted on June 27, 1974. He stated that the
defense plans for the City of Chicago, Illinois, are available on
request from that City Government and that they show the water and
sewer systems. FERRIS stated he has maps of Washington, D.C., water
and sewer systems which he uses in his work for the District of
Columbia, but has never furnished same to any individual or group
nor has he ever been requested to obtain this information.
FERRIS was asked if he had recently had any personal contact
with persons from out-of-town who share his same political beliefs.
FERRIS then volunteered he had seen FRANK DRAGER earlier in June
1974. After DRAGER telephoned him at his home, DRAGER requested and
obtained from FERRIS a list of names and addresses of persons
described by FERRIS as "patriots". He would not elaborate further
on this but described DRAGER as a worthless "bragger and fink", who
was recently arrested in Illinois and was thereafter released on
personal recognizance whereas ROY FRANKHOUSER, described by FERRIS
as another patriot, had to post $100,000.00 bond for his release from
jail. FERRIS stated that DRAGER made no reference to any proposed
distruction of any city on or about July 4, 1974 and FERRIS denied
having any such discussion with DRAGER or anyone else. FERRIS stated
he does not know if DRAGER would participate in any such scheme and
felt certain that "no right wing patriot" would participate in any
such act of violence.
On July 2, 1974, Mr. JAMES C. ROBERTSON, Director, Engineering
and Construction Administration, Department of Environmental Services,
District of Columbia Government, Room 309, Prudential Building,
415 12th Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., was interviewed and it

destruction or killing. Regarding DRAGER's claim to bomb the
city on the Fourth of July, LENTZ advised he never heard such
plans and regards DRAGER as a blow-hard. LENTZ said he has a
news letter from DRAGER dated 1972 where DRAGER claims to be
underground.
On June 13, 1974, a search of the 1973 Pinto, stolen
by DRAGER on March 11, 1974, produced the following type pages
apparently prepared by CARROLL describing the NRA, the formation
of an NRA cell, a message to the Left, though CARROLL speaks,
Commandant Reports, official position on non-whites, and letter
to the Director of Federal Bureau of Integration.

We will bring their tot

ip
knees and replace it with a healthy system as prescribed by
our founding Fathers and return to the Constitutional free
Republic that this was meant to be.
We will not rest until every traitor to our system is eliminated
and the Communist and Zionist World conspiracy to dominate the
White Race is rendered useless.
When we see the Communist clenched fist, we will cut it off.
When we see the Zionists star of david it will enrage us to
attack. When we see the jew nose, we will be looking down
the sites of our rifles.

When we find a Government enemy within our Range we won't
hesitate to lite our fuses.

was determined that ROBERTSON's office maintains for distribution
1/1000 scale maps of the entire District of Columbia sewer system
and 1/1000 scale maps of the entire District of Columbia water
system. These maps are for persual and available free of charge
to persons having a valid reason but are not given away indiscriminatly
because of the cost. These maps have no dimensions and show no
detail except in a very general way. There is no record maintained
of the distribution. ROBERTSON advised the system is coded to the
map described above relating to detail map with scales of 1 inch
to 100 feet and 1 inch to 50 feet, showing the exact locations of
the water mains, the connections and valves. The maps are available
primarily to architects preparing building plans. He stated to
obtain copies of the detailed maps, the District of Columbia
Government requires a release to limit the liability of the district
in the event of a law suit.
On July 30, 1974, Mr. HASKELL L. COUNTS, Chief,
Construction and Engineering Division, Department of Environmental
Services (DES), Government of the District of Columbia, Washington,
D.C., was interviewed. Mr. COUNTS stated that DES maintains for
its own use and the use of a limited number of others having a
need for them, 1 inch to 1000 feet scale maps of the overall water
and sewer system of the District of Columbia. He said that blueprints
scaled 1 inch to 50 feet or 1 inch to 100 feet can be obtained from
DES for specific locations throughout the district. The blueprints
show exact locations of sewers, water mains, valves, connections,
etc., and generally are available to contractors and others having.
a need for them. COUNTS advised that SCHUYLER DAVENPORT FERRIS,
who is employed by the Construction and Engineering Division, DES,
as a member of a survey party concerned with the city water and
sewer system, would have access to both maps of the overall water
and sewer systems and detailed blueprints for specific locations in
the District of Columbia.
On September 3, 1974, Mr. ALBERT PA LINTZ was interviewed
at his employment, Quaker City Paper, 300 North Sherman Street,
York, Pennsylvania, by Special Agents of the FBI. LENTZ stated that
DRAGER stayed with him at his residence 330 North Street, York,
Pennsylvania, during the first week of June. He stated that DRAGER
had several guns in his possession at that time. LENTZ advised that
there were other Klan type individuals from Indianapolis in attendance
while DRAGER was there, and they and DRAGER held secret discussions
towhich LENTZ was not privy. LENTZ advised that he never heard
DRAGER talk about bombing but knows that DRAGER was talking big
about going underground. LENTZ advised that no one in his group
favors "weatherman tactics" and that if he had learned of a bombing
plot, he would have contacted Captain MC CAFFERY, of the York,
Pennsylvania, Police Department, before he would have allowed

While on a National tour visiting various leaders in both the.

some degree hindered our.Revolutionary efforts but our accou-
plishments in the past several months have been overwhelmingly
satisfactory to us and alarming to the Feds.
In the very near future you will begin to hear much more about
the National Revolutionary Anny. You shall hear of and read
about Revolutionary exploits and many co-ordinated efforts in
several States at the same time. We are boy capable to set
in nearly every State at the same time. We have the weapo38

occur with more frequency.

Some of our feats (Such as killing pigs in Satans Temple)
appear to accomplish nothing but we do still need the enemies
paranoid fright to essist us to reach our und goal.
The Revolutionaries in the N.R.A. do not consider themselves
the new leaders of our holy movement, we are merely Actionarice
who will co-ordinate the inevitable Revolucion.
Our Soldiers will operate in total secrecy and anonomidity
except for such times they might unfortunately be detected
by the enemy and at that time they shall openly proclain
the very same things that we publicly proclaim..
We are operating in "calls" of between 4 and 10 men and women
and no "cell" knows of the existance or leadership of another
"cell". There are 5 persons in 5 separate sections of North
America who know all the "cel1' leaders and are capable to
co-ordinate Action if any of the National Staff are captured
by the enemy.
We will gather our financed by taking by force the enemies
money. We will rob banks, kidnap, forge checks. float credit
cardo and generally extort our financial existance from our
wealthy and influential onery. Our enemy in the jey oRI
present Government is the jew.

Through the many prai
no-one
failure for the Right
has succeeded in stoping the Zionist-jew-Communist Revolution
that has taken place throughout the World. In this time the
Politicians have deserted us, our Presidents have sold us out
for more power for themselves and our money has been consumed
by the very sows who are chewing away at our society.
Our cities are almost completely destroyed by junkies, queers
and degenerates of in-imaginable sorts. There is the smell of
a hospitol in the air, as a conglomeration of sick people
gather in the hearts of our once beautiful cities.
Most young people have just dropped out. They're not Communist,
they are just nothing! what have we offered them for a re-
placement for Communism for Capitolism which has become sub-
seviant to free enterprise and the master of our people rather
than the vehicle to maintain freedom.
Our Youth are locking for something, as we all know, but they
are right in the middle of a hugh power struggle in which every
side is saying, "This is what you are looking for". Each side
knows that Victory lies in the Youth so they must give the Youth
a reson to fight and toll them who should be opposed. They
are constantly hitting our Youth with negatives and rarely, if
ever anything positive or constructive.
Now that our Youth have been supplied with nothing but negative
philosophies and solutions from all sides, they've come up with
a logical conclusion: That the World or at least Cirilication
as we know it is coming to an end so "To hell with it all and
lets get what we want while we still can"
The common attitude of American people 'is; Who cares what is
happening as long as it doesn't affect me personally"?
When
a group robs a bank or absconds with large sums of money, one
might hear a la aviding citizen make the following statement:
"Boy, what will they do next, wish I had all that money, I hope
they don't get caught because it was a well planned robbery and
so forth". Usually no cry of stop the theives, only sympathy.
Recent noisy groups of anti-Civilization Reds have gotten the
attention of the youth but not their sympathy because our noise
-making Reds do not have anything to offer them. Our Youth want
more than noise and WI WILL GIVD IT TO THINE We pledge to
eliminate such noisy criminal Red gangs that now abound the
entire state of California.
We must eliminate certain pradujuces in the Right Wing. I
constantly hear Right Wingers paralelling Reds with long hair.
If a youth group began calling all short haired people Nazis,
few people would think much of that groups opinion. Because
long hair came about due to a hugh left win; Campain, aces
not mean that all long haired people are kods. Haking such
rash statements not only separates our Youth from the Right
Wing thus eliminating the remotest possibility of creating
a conversation with the Youth but it also drives them even
further from the Right side.

MESSAGER TO THE LEFT
We have recruited into our ranks many persons and some leaders
I who have over the years worked for the so-called left in the
United States. Once they looked into our philosophy and found
that the philosophy that has been pumped into their brains over
the past several years, they could not resist finding out more.
Once the so-called leftist found out that they were lured into
the leftist (Red) encampments with drugs, sex-and generally
nothing philosophies, they were ready for us.
Once they lived with groups of non-Whites and drug addicts,
they found that they wanted nothing to do with the Reds. Most.
dropped out, began to wonder, returned to Nature and health
food diets and kept their ears and eyes open. Then they finally
. discover the real Natural elements such as the great outdoors
and what could be done for them by sticking to a health food
or Natural diet, they never again could think seriously about
the so-called leftist philosophy.
•
They became potention recruits for the Natural Kovement. The
movement which desires to return to the Natural State of things.
The Government had become their enemy, The regular foods their
poison, the left became a negative and impossible philosophy.
What next? They became Racists, dropouts and began to wonder
in search of their next "high" Finally a "high" wasn't enough
and the entire drug culture began to become a shadow of their
past. Is thera
Is there any hope they began to wonder, Then finally
we came along. They read itlers Hein Kampi, Rockwells white
Power, they talked to Nationalists and they found what they
have been searching for for so long.
We invite people with so-called leftist leanings to thoroughly
study our program--0BJECTIVELY. We invite leftist Revolutionarys
to study cur Positive Constructive Progran and campare it
with their negativ destructive program.
Revolution without cause must cease. Join the Right side.
and fight for the Natural freedoms all mankind should desserv.
Why should the alien jew be the leader you follow? Why should
the Spocks, Bellingers, Rubins, Hoffmans, Apthekers, Hailers,
etc., tell you, White America what it is all about? Do you
need the jew to lead your Revolution?
The left is not our enemy, the Right is not your enemy, The
-Government is OUR enemy and we must bring this jewish conspiracy
called the Republicans and Democrate to its knees and replace
it with a government of the people, by the people and for the
people.

TUXMATION OF CELLA
·
If you are of a true "
htist" Revolutionary nature, do not
hesitate to form an MRA cell of your own. Committ Revolutionary
Acts, Rob Banks and if it was done in the spitit of the White
Racial Movement, we will accept credit for it and in all prob-
ability contact and recruit you into the "inter-circle" of our
Movement.
It will be rather difficult from this point on to contact us
because we are already in permanent hideouts which we refer
to as Camps. We don't mix with the public and only leave our
Camps to commit a Revolutionar act.
But if you should decide to be one of us, in all probability
some one in your area is already a member and we could arrange
for a contact.
We have a code system set up throughout North America so that
we can stay in continual contact with our Conrads and I rather
doubt the Feds will ever be able to break our system.
Beware if you are an enemy agent yourself, We have in our
possession a lie detector, sodiu ponethol, the technoligy
to use this equipment and the ways and means of eliminating
enemies.
We have many automatic weapons and chemicals for making high
explosives and the technology for doing so. We have explosives
which have been stolen over the years fror various enemy cempo
We will buy and steal more automatic weapons and explosives
and we will recruit more persons who have already stored away
cashes of such. We have scopes, silencers and the contacts
to get more. We have acids and other horifying goodies.
We don't intend being stopped and we have the materials nec-
essary to avoid capture and to kill the enemy.
We are presently working on a device which can be remote con--
trolled over a great distance which will horify the enemy with
gigantic explosions. We are attempting to perfect a sound
device which will blow up the enemies war devices at a safe
distance. We are looking into the production of lazer equip-
and shall have answers soon.

We are working with an anti-Communist group and shall perhaps
have a safe foreign base within the next several months.

from the council for planned activities. Four men busted
for non-political charges, they'll be OK. Slight problem
with two Connecticut units--seems like they've been infiltrated.
South Eastern:
No problems, giving the Feds hell. No new
units this month but existant units are all ready for action.
Lets get going.
Central: Lots of Federal activity out here and we haven't
been able to do much. Waiting for word on Nationally co-
ordinated effort. Eleven new calls formed, find information
enclosed. Good meeting last month, keep up the good work.
North Western: Apparently little or no Federal harassment.
I think we are really in the clear out here. They still
have little of no knowledge of the existance of our section.

instructions to lay low until we can get out hands on the

are anti-Pot, the probability of the two getting together
is remote even though they might have the same basic political

we will surely loose. We cannot afford this. The Revolution

les that
on-whites
The New Natural Governent of America fully reco
there has been conside uble mis-treatment of the
in America. We don't take any blame for it but we al no do
not get upset at our ancestors because of it.
It is our firm opinion that the cultures of the White and
Non-Whites will never mix well. There will always be race
hatred on both sides. Segregation did not work, Integration
is not working which leaves us with one solution: Separation.
We think that the majority of Blacks would approve of separ-
ation and we hhow that the majority of whites would also.
The only real problem in a Separation program is, where are
the Separtees to go. There are Black movements who want a
part of the United Statés and there are those who favor re-
patriation to Africa.
There are White organizations who approve of either or both
plans and there are white organizations who favor genocide
of the American Blacks.
We think we have come up with a plan which will eventually
gain the support of both Blacks and whites. We must remember
that in a situation like this someone must always get hurt
but we would like to do it with as little suffering az poss-
ible.
**
It is a known fact that the majority of our penal institutions
are overwhemingly populated by Blacks. It is a known fact that
the majority of our Welfare program goes to the support of the
Black Community. It is a fact that there are scores of Govern.
ment agencies whose total financial allocation goes to the
support of Blacks. Because of the amount of Black crime, at
least a large percentage of our police are only necessary
because the Blacks are there.
If we took the Billions of a tax dollars which now is
allocated for the support of blacks and put those tax dollars
to a constructive use, we could solve the problem without too
much pain and suffering on either side.
If we would ernestly undertake the following project 1 think

appear as they are. The blacks have been the tools of the
jewish conspiracy to foment Revolution for their eventual
otal military takeover of America.
The Blacks woke up when great men like Malcom X.began telling
them like it was. The great. Malcom X was a thinker. He looked
around and saw a jew at the head of every Black organization.
He saw the do-nothing Black organizations were financed by
the jew. He saw that these groups were going no-place. Then
he looked at the Ghettos and discovered that the very same
jew who was preaching Black freedom and equal rights was the
liquor store owner, the owner of the rat infested tenenents,
The parasite who was sucking the Black blood while at the same
time pretending to help them.
Yes, Malcom X saw it, the Blacks of today see it and even the
Whites are beginning to see it in what the jew calls alarming
numbers. Oh where ch where will you jews hide this time?
We've got to reach the Black, we've got to top shooting at
each other. The Black and White are not each others enemy
in America. The Government is our enemy and the jew has
taken over our Goveinment.
Black Revolutionaries, this is an appeal to you to turn your
guns toward the aliens in control of this screwed up society
and work amoung your Ranks to adopt our program for the good
of all Whites and Blacks in America.

ADMINISTRATIVE
As set forth in the initial New York teletype,
interview of UN employees was prohibited by the Secretary-
General's office until 8/20/74. Since that date, however,
the (Legal Department of the Secretary-General's office
has advised the NYO that it will authorize the interview
and appearance for testimony of all UN employees necessary
to the successful prosecution of the captioned matter.
All interviews, however, must be held outside the UN
premises.
The suspect in this matter, MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN,
FBI #313 717 E, previously known to the Los Angeles and
Alexandria Offices as a former member of the American
Nazi Party in 1966 through 1967 and a one-time bodyguard
of GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL, founder of that organization.
Los Angeles files indicate that in 1969 BROWN was identified.
as a member of the Iron Cross Motorcycle Club, a pro-Nazi
motorcycle group in Glendale, California.
The Louisville Office has obtained, by subpoena,
the suspect's toll call records for the period covering the
captioned incident. Initial investigation tends to support
theory that after departure from Berea, Kentucky, BROWN
contacted pro-Nazi associates in Falls Church, Virginia,
Hicksville, NY, and the NYC area during the period
of the captioned incident.
Initial opinion of AUSA confirmed by separate
communication.

and
and the news
The new Revolutionary Army herewith immediately declares that
the present Government of the United States of America is an
Illegal confederation of aliens and enemies of the people of
America.
The National Revolutionary Army (HRA), its officers and followers
nenceforth Seceed from the United States of America until such
time we may be able to restore a Government of the people, by
the people and for the people and oust the enemy aliens now in
control.
Through force and violence and what ever means available to the
NRA, we will, totally, forcefully and quickly restore sanity to
our American Republic.
We have adopted the American Constitution in its original form,
revised the Bill of Rights and eliminated or revised all of the
Amendments to the Constitution..
We have formed a National caucus of hundreds of known and some
un-known political leaders whose present identities will remain
anonomous, who at the time the enemy aliens perish or relinquish
control, will immediately be brought before the American voter
to seize popular control of the vacant political offices.
we of the RA are the people. We speak for the people. And we
will violently eliminate Americas onemies with the haste of a
speeding bullit.
The MRA has chosen for its spokesman a well known adversary
for the return of America to a Natural Social Order. The
Revolutionaries of the N.R.A. are ordered to maintain secrecy
in every way possible and to avoid detection by the enemy,
but are ordered not to deny their association if at such time
they are detected by the enemy or captured.
All N.R.A. members and associates are instructed that if cap-
tured they are governed by the laws as set forth at the Genèva
Conference for captured soldiers and prisoners of war:
This is by all means a Declaration of War. The enemies of
White America will fall like flies at a "Raid" party.

The maitional Revolu nary Army is the militen
faction of an already istant Government who is lady and
capable of seizing immediate power in the United states at
the very moment the N.R.A. is successful in eliminating the
enemy aliens now in Power.
The .R.A. pledges destruction of the existant Government of
the United States and a full return to a truly represented
Government of the people, by the people and for the people.
•
There has already been a Revolution in America in the past
50 years but it was a silent Revolution. The Zionist jew
and Russian Communist (usually one in the same) have told
us repeatedly that they were going to take us without firing
a. single shot and they have succeeded to do so.
1
"
Yes, a world wide conspiracy of Communist atheistic jews have
blatently crepted into the Government of the United States and
with their power and money have continually brainwashed America
into believing that they should rightfully maintain high
Government positions. Iven now there is a movement to eliminate .
still another portion of our holy Constitution and permit a
foreign born to seek the Presidency of the United States.
Of course we know the foreign born these creeps have in mind,
it is that globe-trotting Israel born jew Zionist traitor to
America Henry Kissinger
•
These foreign born jew, Communist and or Zionist creeps have
almost totally brainwashed America with their Television and
Newspapers. It is not unknown even to the average citizer
that the .V. and Lost newspapers are owned and or controlled
by these alien enery parasites.
These minipulators of money have taken total control of our
economy and have created a depression like State whereas we
are now so economically enslaved to them that they now run
our every day life. The average working man is making much
more money than he has ever made before but he is finding it
increasingly difficult to put food on the table for his fam-
ily. A created gas shortage has put the fuel prices so far
out of reach that Americas working masses can no longer drive
for pleasure and is cold in the Winter. Their created meat
shortages put beer so far out of range that Americas families
had to change their diets considerably. Of course they found
they had to relax their rapid rising prices because the meat
was rotting as America started shifting diets. Everything
in our Economic system depends upon the jew minipulator.
'
Even our National debt has climed to a rediculous astronomical
figure of 472 or more Billion dollars. Our gold reserves have
dwindled to an all time low of 9 Billion whereas the interest
on the National debt is several times higher than the money
we have in reserve. Our interest on the National debt is
higher than our National budget was in 1933. AND WHO DỤ #
PAY THIS INTEREST 10? To the damnable jewish world bank of
course which is owned and controlled by the parasitical and
egotistical Rothschilds.

Washington 25, District of Coons
Dear Mr.Kelly:
I've always praised the thoroughness of the F.P.I. even
though, on scores of occassichs you've permitted your paranoia
and your lack of hunan understanding to roul you up. Your
drooling excitement, your paranoid stupidity and your fruit-
less eagerness at having Frank Drager in your gring grips in
Springfield, Ill. made super idiots of the Federal Bureau of
Integration. You now realize how many Toolish errors you made. ·
•
In the near future you will be employed by the New Natural
Government of America rather than the jew Justice Department
and such stupidity will not be tolerated. How rediculous for
a "gang" of "trained" investigators to be fooled and beaten by
a t: enager.
Have you idiots put all the pieces together pott
Whether or not you have or have not, we both thank God for
your paranoid stupidity, for now we are free to continue tying
together the few retaining loose ends which will permit the
National Revolutionary army to eliminate criminal jewish con-
trol of America. Now our Armies can continue to join forces
to eliminate this alien enery goverment.
Continue your search for Frank Drager and will Carrol, i±±
it'll be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to
capture one of our soldiers in the future, --BEWARE!!!, there
is a speeding soft nose for all our enemies..
Unfortunately, most Federal Agents are Mercenary They
are actually with us in spirit but they will still follow the
orders of their jewish superiors to attempt to detect and
capture our people and unfortunately we will have to deal with
these agents ruthlessly until they realize that they are
dominated and controlled by alien enemies of America and begin
.working on the side of "night".
At one time, not too long ago, we Patriots were as useless
as a bunch of foolish "boobs" with nothing going for us but
our idealistic goals. Now our goals are within our grips and
our Arnies are beginning to activate. A large segnent of the
"left" and the "right" are no longer shooting at each other.
Yes, the fear of our enemies are now realistic. The bullits of
the pro-America Revolutionaries are aimed at the alien enemies
in control and not at each other.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION
"
The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely
formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date
has been small and it appears to have the same basic terets as.
the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO
were formerly active in the Minutemen. The mail drop for
this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in
Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and
white-hate activities in the past.
This ultraconservative paramilitary organization
was recently involved in extremist activities in San Diego,
California. Members of this group reportedly made threatening
telephone calls to a local college professor who is active
in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the
forthcoming Republican National Convention. Following these
telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-
mobile into the professor's home, wounding a guest.

without touching any part of the device, locking the door
behind him and notified his immediate superior, Sergeant MITCHELL,

manner, an automobile could be stopped, a pistol
stuck in the face of the occupant and the occupant
forced to drive BROWN and other members of the group
to any destination in New York.
JAY STAFFORD advised that BROWN, apparently
in an attempt to impress he and his brother, related
to the fact that if they were interested in involving
themselves in this type of scheme and could 'þerform"
well, that they would acquire a number of influential
friends and might even be able to see Governor GEORGE
WALLACE. BROWN related to the fact that the STAFFORD
brothers would have no expenses if they involved them-
selves on the trip to New York City inasmuch as he,
(BROWN) had a number of friends and associates who
they could lodge with to and from New York. JAY STAFFORD
advised that BROWN repeatedly referred to the term
"performance" and STAFFORD interpreted the word
"performance" to mean or identical with pulling off
some type of job. BROWN related that he had not 'þerformed"
in several years and needed to perform" at this time
in order to regain influence or re-establish himself
with prior associates.
:
BROWN further briefly discussed religious
philosophies with JAY STAFFORD and his brother, relating
the fact that the Bible had been misinterpreted. BROWN
stated that the Bible referred to or authorizes man to
have at least seven wives and also related to the fact
that the destruction of statues in the United Nations
building would be accomplished for religious as well
as political reasons.
BROWN then asked of JAY STAFFORD and his
brother, if they were aware of anyone in Kentucky who
could furnish him dynamite. JAY STAFFORD advised that
he might have given BROWN information concerning a
younger brother of a person known to JAY STAFFORD as
GLENN LYNN DEORTING, of Lexington, Kentucky. JAY STAFFORD

| BROWN advised that he was going to plæe the
explosives at the United Nations building whether or
not JAY STAFFORD and his brother wanted to go along.
BROWN gave the impression that he was committed to do
this some time around the first of August. BROWN told
the STAFFORD brothers that it would have to be done and
that he would do it alone if necessary. BROWN told the
STAFFOTH 3 5at he had proposed this scheme to some of
his associates which he had for ten years and that
they had refused to go along with it. BROWN discussed
the fact that he had been charged on a number of counts
in the state of California, but had never been con-
victed. DROWN also alleged that he was using an alias
and that if he used his true name, he would not be
able to get employment. BROWN also exhibited to the
STAFFORD brothers, a motorcycle magazine, which DROWN
suggested he was publishing or some how inviived in
the publication of this magazine. JAY STAFFORD fur-
ther advised that he observed four high powered rifles
in one of the upstairs rooms of the CROWN residence.
STAFFORD described the upstairs of BROWN's residence
as being an attic which had been converted into utility
space containing two rooms, one of those rooms being
walled with a paneling material and unfinished and the
other room used to store what appeared to be personal
items.
JAY STAFFORD advised that neither he nor
his brother LAHKY considered DROWN's proposal to be
legitimate at the time and that their visit with
BROWN was terminated with the understanding or feeling
that JAY and LAINI would recontact hin if and when they
were interested in involving themselves in the type of
activity which DROWN had described. JAY STAFFORD stated
that he felt that DOWN trusted he and his brother,
probably basing this trust on the fact that JAY and
LARRY had been involved in a burglary-safe cracking
attempt. JAY STAFFORD advised that he and his brother

advised that he at one time was a friend of DEORTING LAT
and believed that DEORTING's' younger brother had
experience with nitroglycerin and had perhaps attempted
to, or had in fact, produced nitroglycerin in the
garage of DECHTING's's residence in Lexington, Kentucky.
STAFFORD advised he could not say for certain whether
or not he gave BROWN DECRTING'S - name. BROWN dis-
cussed the possibility of using dynamite on the
statue that was in the basement of the United Nations
building.
JAY STAFFORD advised that BROWN exhibited
a box upstairs at the BROWN residence and this box
contained some bags of white powder. BROWN described
these bags of powder as being ingredients which were
to be incorporated in a chemical composition, this
composition being capable of producing extremely high.
temperatures if it was ignited. BROWN expressed the
fact that this composition would completely melt any
bronze or steal item and that it would acquire a
temperature of 50,000 degrees. BROWN estated that
he was expecting a shipment of another ingredient
which he did not have at the time, and once this
ingredient arrived, he would be able to manufacture
the heat producing product. JAY STAFFORD advised
that BROWN called the name of this ingredient and
that it either had something to do with, sounded like,
or incorporated aluminum.
JAY STAFFORD stated that BROWN made a number
of references to "swine pigs". BROWN then asked
JAY STAFFORD and his brother if it wouldn't be more
rewarding to let the "swine pigs" know that their days
were numbered than to be rich. BROWN suggested that
the STAFFORD brothers could involve tlanselves in
activities that he had in mind, and if they 'performed"
well, they would not have any money or other problems.

brother JAY in a conversation which was interpreted
by LARRY STAFFORD as designed to produce LARRY'S
and JAY's feelings or attitudes concerning the
possibility of the STAFFORD brothers' involvement in
burglary or unauthorized lock picking activities.
LARRY STAFFORD advised that neither he nor his
brother JAY gave the impression that they would be
interested in those type' of activities and BROWN

closed to the STAFFORD brothers that he felt that
they were his kind of people. LARRY STAFFORD advised

using dynamite to destroy statues in the United Nations
facilities. STAFFORD stated that BROWN was attempting
to convince he and his brother, JAY, to involve then-
selves in placing explosives in the United Nations
Building, the STAFFORD brothers' involvement being that
of causing a disturbance while BROWN placed chemicals
around the base of the devil type statue on the main
floor of the United Nations Building. BROWN further
discussed alternative methods of getting into the building,
one of the methods being the use of an individual in
a wheel chair who would sit on explosives to conceal
them. BROWN further discussed the possibility of exiting
out the rear of the United Nations facilities which
BROWN described as being built adjacent to or over a
freeway. BROWN discussed the use of ropes to rappel
walls and the possibility of an escape method wherein
the freeway would be reached, and then a passing motorist
would be flagged down. Once the passing motorist stopped,
a pistol would be shoved in his face and he could be
forced to take an individual or several individuals
anywhere they wanted to go.
LARRY STAFFORD advised that BROWN claimed
that he had contracted to destroy statues at the United
Nations building and that his orders or contract came
from a retired Colonel or General in the Army. BROWN
talked about having $250 expense money which would be
used for the purchase of explosives and travel to and
from New York State. BROWN discussed the fact that
little money was needed inasmuch as he had associates
or friends in route to New York, who would provide
food and lodging.
LARRY STAFFORD advised that BROWN continued
to use the expression "performance" and advised that
he would travel to New York and complete this contract
assignment whether or not LARRY and his brother partici-
pated. BROWN also discussed the fact that a friend
