Dear Mr. Diaz:
10
This will confirm our previous discussions with you
wherein e agreed to employ you at the rate of $210.00
per month to commence March 1st. As was explained to you
at our last meeting we are engaged in a study to determine
the effect of large scale migration on given communities
and the dislocations that result therefrom.
We feel that the Miami area is unique in that the dis-
locations caused by the influx of so many of your fellow
countrymen furnishes an excellent opportunity to conduct this
study.
It is anticipated that you will spend a large portion of
your time in our New York offices, however; it will also
require a substantial amount of travel on your part.
If you are still in agreement with this proposal please
advise me as soon as possible. I would like to begin this study
on March lat.
Very truly yours,
i
