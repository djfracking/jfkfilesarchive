ONTO:FD DESK
(CAN REAR BENING
1. Your assistance is requested in interviewing the Salvadorian citizen,
Luis E. GUTIERREZ, for information which would be helpful to this Government
in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by
Herbert L. ITKIN. Mr. ITKIN is a prime witness in legal proceedings presently
underway in New York City involving the Mafia and related underworld organiza-
tions. ITKIN lives under the protection of U.S. Federal Marshals,
2. The following data is for your information. It should not be used in
dealing with GUTIERREZ or outside of this Organization. ITKIN has been an
FBI informant since March 1963. He has now claimed to have worked for this
Organization during the period 1954/55 to 1960. ITKIN asserts that his contact
during these years was one Philip HARBIN. This inquiry is concerned solely
with ITKIN's claimed relationship with this Organization from 1954/55 to 1960
when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be seen, GUTIERREZ, ITKIN
alleges, also knew HARBIN during that time and that fact, therefore, is
material to the credibility of ITKIN's story.
ITKIN's first contact with Philip HARBIN was in 1955 when he claims to
have been contacted pursuant to a mecting he, ITKIN, had in Philadelphia with
a leading personality of this Organization and another high-government official
late in 1954 or early 1955. According to ITKIN, HARBIN never made the
specific claim of being from this Organization but that was ITKIN's assumption.
ITKIN describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 (in 1955), an American.
He had receding hair, combed back but parted. He was about 5'8" in height,

well-built with little evidence of fat. He always wore a vest. He spoke fluent
Spanish and could have been of Polish or Russian family background. HARBIN
always drank tea, never coffee. He appeared affluent with a professorial air
about him.
Following an initial meeting, ITKIN alleges that he and HARDEN HEI
periodically in New York City. ITKIN alleges that he passed to HARBIN copies
of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Delson, Levin and Gordon,
dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India. ITKIN left that law firm in mid-1957,
presumably thereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he
passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was informa-
tion he picked up from a friend who worked at the United Nations for the
Government of El Salvador. This friend was Luis E. GUTIERREZ (see biographic
sketch, Attachment A). ITKIN claims that he became very friendly with
GUTIERREZ, who was studying either at New York University or Columbia
where he prepared a master's thesis on El Salvador's economic position.
HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished
HARBIN notes of GUTIERREZ' monograph.
=
Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he
knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work. ITKIN recalled GUTIERREZ,
who meanwhile had moved to the position as Consul General of El Salvador in
New Orleans, Louisiana. HARBIN--ITKIN says--accepted the suggestion and
ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent to GUTIERREZ
in New Orleans. ITKIN asserts that HARBIN--according to his own statement--
went to New Orleans and made the "new contact". ITKIN claims he last saw
HARBIN in 1960.
3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as summarized
in the immediately preceding paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and
E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in
ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to GUTIERREZ.
We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirma-
tion in our records of any relationship between this Organization and ITKIN during,
the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or anywhere in
government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial that there was
any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITKIN and the high officials he
nominates. Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli-
gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN. This case, however, is
of such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have GUTIERREZ' own
statement for the record.
4. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach
GUTIERREZ. It is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover,
perform the interview, but it may well be that a consular or embassy officer
might be the best person to do the job. We repeat that we are concerned in this
matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically
the allegation that he introduced HARBIN to GUTIERREZ in New Orleans and
that as a consequence GUTIERREZ would be in a position to identify and describe
HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if he exists. The request
for GUTIERREZ' assistance in this matter is in no way predicated upon hostility
towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed
evidence is found to back them up. If GUTIERREZ indicates that he is willing to
provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is
solely for U.S. Government use and will not be made public by us at any time
without his expressed consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to accept
his decision to give no assistance in the matter.

5. We have compiled a short statement that might be used by the interviewer
to explain to GUTIERREZ, the purpose of the interview. (see Attachment B). A list
of questions, which should be given orally, is elaborated in Attachment C. You
will note that these questions concern the larger as well as narrower elements.
of GUTIERREZ' relations with ITKIN. We are willing to settle for a specific
answer to the narrower question of Philip HARBIN in preference to generalizations
about the whole relationship. If, as a consequence of your handling, GUTIERREZ
is willing to talk in depth, we will be grateful.
6. Attachment D is a copy of a New York Times article concerning ITKIN and
one of the completed federal cases in New York City. This item is attached for
your background reading. This may be shown to GUTIERREZ, of course,
Attachment E is a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from GUTIERREZ to
ITKIN. Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that ITKIN's
story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is a fabrication. While possibly based
on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology
and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved. Also included in this
attachment is ITKIN's answer to the letter. We feel in retrospect that
GUTIERREZ might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular
interview. We, therefore, suggest that this not be shown to him. However,
there is no objection to an indication that the U.S. Government is aware that
GUTIERREZ was in perfectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on
business matters.
7. We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre-
liminary indication by cable of GUTIERREZ' response, if one is forthcoming, on
the questions concerning GUTIERREZ' knowledge of HARBIN. If there is anything
unclear in this dispatch, Headquarters would welcome any questions by cable.
All correspondence should be addressed Chief, WOMUSE, via Chief, WH.

Suggested Statement to GUTIERREZ
1 understand you have a friend named Herbert ITKIN, a lawyer, now living
in New York. Mr. ITKIN is under the protection of United States authorities
because he is the prime witness in very significant legal cases presently pending
before the Federal court in New York City. Mr. ITKIN, in private testimony to
U.S. authorities, has indicated that you were a friend of his; he met you in
New York while you were at the United Nations. He has also indicated that sometime
in 1957 he sent a letter of introduction to you in New Orleans, presenting one
Philip HARBIN whom ITKIN claims did go to New Orleans and introduced himself
to you. Your answers to questions relating to the above would be of great help to
the U.S. Government in determining the veracity of ITKIN's statements.

MAN HALVADOR,
KL HALVADOH, Ɑ ▲
Doar Herby:
It was a real good surprico to receive your letter of
February 15, 1965. I had written you twice in the last three years,
and I had no answer. I went to New York to the C.I.O. Convention
in September 1963; then I looked for you every where, but I found
you nowhere. So I realized that you had disapeared from New York
and moved to another place. But what a relief now; You still are
in the Empire State kicking around and thinking about your old
friends.
As you probably remember we do not see each other since
1952. Let me give you a rough breifing on what happens during this
timo. In November 1952 I was appointed Consul General of El Salvador
at New Orleans; in 1958 I rosigned and came back to my country and
was appointed Comptroler of the Bank Inspecting Bureau; then in

Although, as you can see, I am in the High Brass category
I belong at the same time to the low income bracket group. For that
reason I have been looking for a more juicy business, but so far I
have found nothing. That is why I would say you are just on time
offering me to do some business with you. I hope you will write and
tell me more about what you have in mind. Also I will be waiting for
you in April or any other time; the sooner the better.
There is something elso I must tell you. I want to go
1 back to New York and I nood your help very badly. You know that in
order to work in the States one must have a resident visa and to
obtained such visa one must have an affidavit from an American Citi-
zon. Could you be so kind giving me such a help? I hope you will say
YES.

Chief, WH/FI
: Herbert Itkin
1. There has been no Agency contact with ITKIN. Ray

the results of his meeting with DEJOIE, BOLTE, FIGNOLE and
Luc STEPHEN in their formation of the Provisional Haitian

as a Foreign Agent for this group adding that he made a
personal loan to DEJOIE of $15,000.

Department of State sets forth the results of an informal
meeting (possibly held on 28 April 1963) attended by Forrest
E. ABBUHL (Officer in Charge, Haitian Affairs, State ARA/CRA),

other than to say that they were not the same persons who had supported
TYLUSH/1 who had been counting on the support of Masferrer. This
support had not been forthcoming due to the fact that certain of the
Maitions and Cubans that Masferrer was supposed to provide, refused to
work with Masferrer. IDEN's Coban supporters' aim is to use Paiti
as a base against Cuba. He agrees this should be done.

any source.

(I
IDIN-A had wanted to bring these matters to the attention of
IDEN-B. He has no selfish arbition. In outlook, he is a Catholic
and a capitalist who wants to do what he can for his country. This
is his sole reason for wanting to be President. I explained that his
views would be made known to IDEN-B and other interested senior officials.
IDFN-B regretted not being able to talk to him personally, but was
prevented from doing so at present due to the rany demands on his tire
caused by the present critical situation in the Caribbean.
10. Car parting was cordial and IDEN-A said that when he
returned to the DR in the next few days, he would be glad to establish
| contact with one of my associates should we desire to do this. I
told him that should it be necessary to get in touch with him, the
person chosen would identify himself as my friend.

MULTE
1.
I called on IDEN-A at the hene of his son-in-law in ZENITAL.
INN-A Te¬ethered me from our previous recting in May of this year, and
his greeting was cordial. He said that he was in ZEITTAL and was reing
to New York for the purpose of raking the situation of his followers
knour and to see if he could obtain support for maintaining his activist
following in the DR.
2. IDEN-A believes that it has now been proven that no reliance
could be placed on any of the Haitian military: EVLUSH/1 is obviously
finished; EVLIFE/1 is unsilling to act without positive marantees of
CDYCK support; Colonel Arrand is able but leak; and Ceneral Toucicaut
lacks courage.
Colonel Riambi is a good ran but is being supported by
the Forinican government. If anything effective is to be done, it
rust be done through non-rilitary personalities. Only a national
leader who has the support of the people can do anything effective.
Had he been in charge of the EVLUSH/1 effert, the peasants would have
rallied to the invading forces, but they will not do so to a force
under the command of a military van.
3. IDEN-A's camp is still in existence in the DR and contains
about 70 pen at present. Among these are EVLUTE/4 and Henri Clermont.
He said that EVLUTE/4 is able but somewhat erratic and he (IDEN-A)
Icars that he would accept support from any source including the
Communists, though he knows that EVLUTF/4 is not himself a communist.
- He likewise mistrusts the EVLUTE group because it's leadership is too
far to the left. Again, he does not believe that the merbers of
EVLUTE are themselves Communists, but they attempted to obtain support
from lexican Communists.
$
4. IDEN-A concerned at the moment in obtaining support to enable
him to continue feeding the men in his camp. He said that he has been
informed that the former followers of EVLUSH/1 are now flocking in,
thus placing an intolerable burden on his slip resources. He needs a
few thousand dollars for food supplies and hopes to get some help in
New York from CARE or sore other philanthropic organization.
5. IDEN-A regrets the overthrow of the bosch government.
!c says
that he is aware of Bosch's shortcomings as an administrator, but that
he had the interests of the Dominican Republic at heart and had
demonstrated his sympathies for IDEN-A and his followers. Nevertheless.
