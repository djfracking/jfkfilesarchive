He stayed
in the background and accompained the unidentified Russian during most.
of the tour. RALEI was introduced to him but little conversation
passed between them. He appeared a little stiff, more the Russian
stereotype of the reserved, social-ill-at-ease person. But this
chance for an indepth
was just an impression as FURNIE had noz
conversation. GOLOVICV seemed to possess decent spanish.
GOLOVICY was, as previously cited, more reservad.

He stated
he was from the comercial section. Hopefully subject will attend
other Corps meetings and FanALE: Will have an opportunity to speak
to him at greater length.

En un reporte del dia 12 de Diciembre de 1964, en el que 5 y 14 vieron a LOGINOV acompañado
esta
un hombre tipo mexicano caminando por un puente de peatones del viaducto Miguel Aleman que
a la altura de la calle Eje Dos. Y que despues este último se fué en un Renault negra

S fué el martes 31 a la tienda Seara de Ejercito Nacional y le pareció que el detective de
está tienda es el mismo que se vió con LOGINOV.Llevamos a 14 para que también lo identificara.
Dice 14 que se parece mucho, però que no es. 5 dice que está seguro que si es.
En la descripción que dieron ellos ese dia dijeron que en la cara se le veía como que había
tenido acné, y este no tiene ninguna marca de esas. De todas maneras lo fotografiamos.
Buscamos el Renault en el estacionamiento y no estaba.

He could not help feeling nervous while in the bookstore, and later cried
when he got home. (Due to the emotions he felt). At the first opportunitý
he began buying and reading all of the books he could afford. It took him

As regards to Cuba he has heard conflicting stories. He believes
that Castro has done some good for the Cubens (by raising their stenderd
cducation level), but that from stories he has heard, the Cubans had
a much higher economic standard of living (th-n Mexico) prior to the Castro

regime. He has often discussed these polotics with LOGINOV. In a crowd
LOGINOV tends to say good things about Castro and the Cuban regime, but
when slone with. Subject LCGINOV sneers at Castro and condemns the regime.

This attitude leads Subject to believe that the official Soviet attitude
(real attitude) towards Cuba is one of disgust. During discussions in e
groun, LOGINOV has stated that they (Soviets) are not in favor of Guerilles
operating in Central and S. America. He has repeated this while privately
telking with Subject.
During part of the conversation I began telling him about
the standards of living in the U.S. and what it might be like living there.
We discussed different parts of the U.S. in terms of Geography and what it
had to offer. Subject repeated that his wife always thought that it would
be devine living in the U.S. and that he still had hopes of going there in
the future to live.

I mention this in some detail because I
think it really would suit Gloria and would
help my business. If I used her, it would dro-
bably preclude her use wittingly Egainst the
Soviets. Further, before using hot, some thought
ought to be given to the possibility that she
might already be working for the Soviets (which
I doubt) and could be targetted against me.
Soviets interest in Gloria. I would not
attempt to explain why the Soviets might be
interested in Gloria as a target. My guesses
would be a waste of time considering that the
Soviet section has probably given this sort of
thing a great deal of experienced thought. I
do believe that Valentin and Gloria might be
having an affair for strictly personal and
non-operational reasons. I further believe
that Valentin might actually be paying his
own way at the French Club to pursue a sport
he is fairly good at and enjoys--and not as
an excuse to go to the French Club to find.
potential recruits.
Our interest in Gloria. I can see a possible
use of Gloria in recruited by false Mexican secret
service. The scenario would go something like this:
We (the Maxican secret service) have ob-'
served that she (Gloria) has been seen
in the company of Valentin. We know
Valentin to be a very dangerous and
destructive person to Mexico.
Would she be willing to report on Val-
entin, his personality, his views,
his activities as far as she is aware of
them.
(Later) Would she be willing to makce
comments which would encourage Valeno
tin to try to recruit her. Such comments
would be that she has met diplomats
from various embassy, knows students
who are anarchists and communists, is
growing more and more disappointed with.
the U.S. foreign policy, especially since
that imperialist Nitton has take over,

to the vicinity of Sanborns on Reforms and Tiber. At 2455 I called the
Language school where Subject teaches and was told that he had not yet arrived
for class. I called again at 1:05 and was informed that he was already in clres.
At 1545 I began waiting in front of the Language school for Subject to come out,
He came out at 1610 and we walked towards Sanborns. I invited him to go to.

from 1630 to 1800. Wo want to the Sanborns bar and had a drink. I told him that
I thought that two girls I had previously met wore going to meet me at the La
Mansion at 1700 and that I wanted him to go with me. After some discussion he
decided that he could postpone the class until Friday, but would have to wait
until 1630 for the pupil to arrive, in order to inform hor. We left the Bar at
1630 and encountered the student by the magazine stand. Subject mode his excuses,
and we started walking to his ear. (Subject had not wanted to miss his class.
and after some discusion in the bar, he offered me his car in order that I might
go to La Mansion and get the girls. I told him that I also wanted to eat, and
that there was a possibility that the girls would'nt show up. He finally corsented
after some consideration).
We arrived at La Mansion shortly before 1700 and went inside, lerving
the car parked in the Restaurant lot. After sitting down and ordering drinks
and a stoak, I told him that I would like to discuss a few important items that
had a lot do to with his future. (I had mentioned during the previous meeting
that I had some business to talk to him about). I began by telling him that
in our relationship I had neglected to mention something important. I told
that my meeting him in Acanules was not an accident. I had gone there for the
express purpose of meating in after consorming. Subject art

he scrented. When Rafael arrived, he was introduced to CHERNYSH who made
overtures of friendship which 1-ter led to the attempted recruitment,
meantime Rafael und Introduced CHIRNISH to ANDRIA and now regretted it.

other Soviets who are KGB during fast moving conversation but I did not take

towards that end. During the conversation Subject said that at one time his
mother had confided in him that they had tried to recruit her several times in
Moscow to work against Spaniards and Latin Americans who visited. The KGB

they told her to forget it. He said that she had known mary members of the NVD.
NKVD and now XGS. but that she still refuses to work for them in their business.
After considerable more discussion along the same lines. Subject finally
thought a bit, and said that he would agree to work with me on one condition
only. The condition was that I would not ask him to inform on, or work against,
ary of his friends or students, including CDIL, VENTURA or ANDREA in particular,
and that if any thing should happen to him as a result of his work for me, that
I would promise to take care of his wife and child. I agreed to his condition..
restating that my only concern was the KGB. I said however that in the future if
I could prove to hin, or convince him, that any of his local acquaintences were
directly involved with the KGB then I would expect him to help me,

what I would want of him. I said that I wanted him to work with me directly
against the KGB and that I had no interest in his friends or students at all,
If he was concerned about the KGB bastards bothering his friends, this was
his chance to help me do something about it. We can't operate alone. He has
the intelligence, the ability and the opportunity to do a great deal and he
should involve himself. if only for the ideals that he has previously expressed.
(He thought about it for a few moments and began to talk about Yuriy CHIRNYSE).
He said that for instance CHERNISE was another KGB man who had sporosened him
to report on Americans. LOGINOV had told him that he (LOGINOV) could'nt get along
with Americans and consequently was only interested in working with Mexicans, but
CHERISH tried to recruit Subject to work against Americans. Subject refused.
-CATANG
CHERNYSH however was trying to work on ANDREA (Subjects friend) and this made
him damned med. The girl ANDREA was only about 16 or 17, and a sweet little girl.
and they (KGB) had no business trying to pick on her. Subject said that he
was in the Plaza hotel one day waiting to make a phone call, and that he heard
the man in the phone booth speaking fluent Russion then the man got through

eyebrows, but never changed the expression on his foce. (From the look on his
face, one night think he was watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon). I said that our
files show that for some years he esconsiderable contact with members of the
Soviet NGS. Before I could go any further to stated that he was not a member
of the KGB, nor did ho over work for them. I said that that was what we believed.
and that was also why I wanted to talk to him. I had a proposition to make to
him. Before I could continue, he said that he had often been approached (Currently
and in the past) by the KGB to work for them. At prosent he is being hounded
by Valentin (LCGINOV) to report on his Mexican friends. He considers the KGB
to be a bunch of Bastards (Cabroncs) and that he does not believe in all of this
under the table spying, nor does he believe in what the KGB are trying to do.
and if I'm involved in this work, and I am asking him the some thing, then I'm
the same kind of bastard that the KGB aro. He said for some time now, LOGINOY

rospect, and that ho (Subject) prepare biographical data and other details
about their current life, and arrange for them to moet LOGINOV at partics, etc.
LOGINOV, during each meeting with Subject, brings on envelope with 500 pesos in
cash in it, and continually offers this to Subject. Subject says that he
does'nt say yes or no, but that to date ho has not furnished any informed
has not accepted any money. He likes his friends and students, and any cooperation
with LOGINOV (along these lines) would make him feel like a Judas. Besides.
these students are young, and nice people, and the KGB basterds should keen their
hands off them.

him an official I.D. card and declared myself, because LOGINOV did not ever have
the decency to do that, LOGOV has never shoved him anythinglet all (in 1.5.)

make him sick afterwards. I told him that we were not interested in his

students, but that we wanted to stop the NGB in their efforts to undermine
other nations and direct sabotage against the U.S. He might not like the idea
of under-the-table dealing, but it was a real fact of life. If it were not
for the current under-the-table conflict, the world would probably be rushed
into a nuclear war, and he know what that meant. What was going on in the
espionage field was actually a doterrant, and that the people involved were
composed of the best minds of two worlds. I recalled his (Subject) two world
powers opinions (previously expressed by him) and asked him what he planned to
do. He could'nt return to Russia; his current future prospects in Mexico were
not too promising, and he had previously mentioned that he wanted to go to the
U.S. If it's true that there are only two important powers in the world, then.
he had better seriously consider where he wants to place his marbles. Opportunity
does'nt knock every day, and he was talking to a representative of the U.S.
Government at the moment, who was making a proposition directly to him (Subject).
Subject said that that was all true; he at first wanted to return to Russie but
after sooing some things in Mexico ho realized that he could never be happy in
Russia again because of the oppressive regime and the lack of freedom. (He
cited the recent Russian invasion of the Checks and said that it made him sick
to see the Russiers do this). He said that he was not happy in Mexico but that
the could live hore O.X.

their U.S. equivalent. The first person he has to live with is, himself. ani
the replication that he is a spy against his own friends would be enough to
mentally ruin him, regardless of any money received. I told him that one
of our efforts is trying to bick the KGB when they go after people that term

that is far from the truth. He may not work for the KGB, but his associations.

with me and ask the results, and I'll tell them that Rafael is a nice guy. honest,
sincere, and I firmly believe that he is completely honest. This however will
not answer the question why he will not cooperate, and when it is put on paper
it will just be a cold report lacking personality, and the paper will indicate .
that he might be working for the XGB regardless of any opinions tacked on to the
bottom. In a case like this, protocol between the C.S. and Nexican Governments
require that we eventually turn over to them any reports on people in their

and
He wented to know what to
should do with LOGINOV. I told him to be very careful that he does'nt change
his attitude one bit, and to continue for the time being with LOGINOV Just as
if nothing at 11 pad happened. I said that the Soviets do have a dupertment...
at this he interrupted and said "SMERSH" and grinned. I said yes, they do
oporate now and then, and that the Soviets would not be very happy to discover
that their friend hid anything at all to do with us. I said that even though
we treat each other is gentlemen. they are capable of being tough at times.
Ho said not to worry, that he was an excellent actor, and LOGINOV would never
suspect a thing.
During the time I was trying to convince him, he said that I was
forgetting one thing. He assured me that he was SC Socialist and 20% capitalist.
and he firmly believed that Socialism was good for some countries. including
Russia. He said that because of that he didnt see how I could ever have any
confidence in him. I answered by saying that everyone was entitled to their
ideals. And I too believed in certain forms of Soci-lism. The encouraging thing
was that he believed in something, and that was his right as an individual..
we in the U.S are entitled to our beliefs, and are not restricted in our reading
metter or what we said on street corners. If he wanted to, he could stand on
the steps of the Lincoln monument and give a speach on socialism and no one
would bother him provided he did'nt cause a riot, disturb the beach or break some
local law. No have Socialists who are still good citizens. He then talked
2
a little about the restrictions in Russi in reading matter and talking. but
saw my point.
by 2115 we wore in agreement on his cooperation with me involving
the above mentioned conditions. I asked him to meet me on Wednesday, 5 Febriory,
at 1030 at CHALUPAS Restaurant on Reforma (just across the Poriferico). He
know where it was and agreed to meet mo. I cautioned him again to be very careful
in his dealings with LOGINOV and to take precatition he came to the meeting.

reflections on his frionis, (left or not) the Russian people, Republican
Spaniards in general, or anything else that he are expressed a de tite

back to the recruitment pitch. I thought the details could be obtained later
if he was recruited.
During the pitch the only one who was nervous was me. Subject displayed
a' "cool" which was amazing. When I presented my credentials and the pitch he
never batted an eyelashi..Just continued slightly smiling. I noted no reaction
at all. It could be that he still thought I was kidding, or playing some game.
In any case, either he works for the other side, or he is indeed cool to en
admirable point.
We (I) talked from 1700 to sbout 2030 without making any hendway.
Up until that time I had gotten an emphatic "NO". I almost gave up before
another approach produced a little result. I think that prior assessments which
state that he will do anything for money is entirely false. At the moment the
7
recuitment is still on thin ice, and subject is serious about involving his
friends. Perhaps after he gets his feet wet (if it lasts that long) and has
some experience he can be brought around to do almost anything.

up to his ears in financial woes, though he just discovered that
his position is not nearly as bad as he thought.
3. Subject said he thinks Polish Ambassador MAJCHRZAK XEY

not definite. I urged him again to get busy courting NAJ. a bit
more aggressively and not to let the relationship grow cold.
Subject said that the reason he has not been more active lately
is that Lolita is in the early months of pregnancy and has not
been feeling up to any large-scale entertaining.

LOGINOV (P-11,712). A. 8ov girl receptionist told him that LOG was not
in and told him that he could wait in the reception roon or wait for
him on the waiting room of LOGE office. L-1 prefered to remain with the
receptionist(girl). He left after 55 minutes without seeing LOG.
When L-1 came to the receptionist and asked for LOG she in
turn äsked him was he not L-1 ( by first name only), son of their language
tescher. L-1 answered affirmatively and in turn asked her what was her
name and how does she know him. She stated that her name was Allá LNU
and that she recognized L-1 by his voice from calling for LOG. (NOTE: 1-1
feels positive that at least 4 months have passed since a woman answered
the phone when he asked for LOG).
In the beginning of the conv I-1 found out that the girl was
mom Nosow which certainly pleased L-1 because he had what to talk about.
She complimented L-1 for speaking Russian without an accent, which was
not the oase with L-17 mother, the language teacher at the Sov Emb.

PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club
I saw Cloria talking to Iouri Tchernych. I joined
them. Gloria was turning on all of her not inconsiderable
charm. Invited Touri to her posada. Then asked whom she
should res at the Soviot embasuy about a business deal
who had. Was told this would be Ivanov. Gloria said she
knew him and described him as big and corpulant. Apparently
this was correct--according to Touri's reaction.
Gloria ankod Iouri where he worked and was told with
Valontin. lle added that this is the department you must
come to if you want to visit the Soviet Union.
Later I saw Iouri with his wife and son. She is rather
attractive, tall. Pavel, is about three years old, and
a very handsome little boy.

wife will be there. We accepted.

LIROBIN/2 reported that both of the LIROBINS attended a cocktail
Consul
party at the home of the Indian Embassy Counsellor (;), FKU PARASHAR,
at which they met the LOGINOV's (P-11712). LOGINOV again refused to
carry on any of the conversation in English even though English was the
common language used by the guests. At one point during the evening,
Mrs. PARASHAR addressed LOGINOV in front of all the guests and chided
him for not using his English remarking that" everyone here knows that
you speak English". LOGINOV stared at her icily, but did not comment
in either Spanish or English. LOGINOV spoke briefly with L/1 inquiring
what L/i's duties were with the newspaner and gave every indication that
he was unaware of L/1's column. Mrs. LOGINOV was quite cordial and
inquired if 1/2 had been to the film festival in Acapulco. L/2 replied
that she had not to which Mrs. LOGINOV countered by remarking that she
had seen 1/2's friends- the SARATOVS (P-13125)- at Acapulco. L/2 stated
that no effort was made to involve the LOGINOV's in polemics during the
evening and that LOGINOV did not appear to know the majority of the
approximate 16 guests who represented almost every nationality.
LIRCBIN's were the only Americans with the exception of Edward KENNDY
and his Nexican wife. LOGINOV did not spend in inordinate time with any
particular individual nor did they remain late.

Gloria is a very attractive and vivacious woman of
40 cr 45 years. She is the center of gravity of a croup
of tennis onthusiasts, rancing in age from Meche, Gloria's
daughter of 19 or 20 to Licenciado Preciado (a deputy from
PAN) of perhaps 65 years or more. It is doubtful that
Gloria would encourage an affair with Valentin. Her in-
terest in val is probably that of everyone else's, as a
Soviet, he is a novelty. He is also probably attractive
to women who like brutish mon. Gloria, is however, is
married to a very soft-spoken and considerate person.
:
EXTENT OF SOCIAL CONCOURSE. It seems likely that
Val and Gloria and their families have come together
socially at intervals. It is doubtful that they are
intimate friends, but likely that they (the Pintos)
are the closest friends that al has among the Nexicans.
VAD'S INTEREST IN GLORIA. Val's interest in Gloria
is probably more complex than her interest in him. First,
he probably has entertained the possibility of an affair ·
with Gloria. val has spoken frequently of Bis interest
in girls. Gloria could easily be a sexual target for Val--
sàlf-appointed, of course.
Further, Gloria organizes tennis groups and informal
tournaments. Through her val is likely to meet a number
of Mexicans.
It seems highly unlikely that val would try to re-in
cruit either Gloria or Pepe. They enjoy a fairly luxerious
life, Pere heing a fairly successful physician. Neither
Pene or Gloria take life seriously enough to become in-
tellectual communists. Philosphy is certainly not their
reading of choice during idle hours. Gloria is primarily
interested in sports. She was national champion of water-
skiing several years in a row. Now she is devoting her-
self to tennis which she plays reasonably well. Dancing
is probably her next great interest. In my opinion she
does not have sufficient tine left to devote to marxism
or economics of politics. She seems particularly ill-
informed about politics.

interest in Valentin Loguinoy. He recently made a date
with val to play tennis at the French Club. Tony ad-
mitted to baking quite an effort to keep his date,
despite other committments which had come up. Val,
however, did not show and did not call Tony. Tony

a good strip-tease performance now and then relating that he had seen
umber of them when he was in the States. SARATOV spoke nostalgically
of his life in the States admitting that he missed many aspects of his
life there. L/1 remarked that the conversation was largely centered
around comments by the BILGORES and L/1 and L/2 inasmuch as the CUDNEYS
were very reserved and seldom expressed themselves to any degree. L/1
commented that to the best of his knowledge the CUDNEY's ad SARATOV's
had first met and the dinner party held by the LIROBBINS. L/1 expressed
some surprise in that the CUDNEY's were invited as they are rather
shy and inexpressive. Toward the end of the evening, L/1 was able to
raise the question of the Soviet invasion of the CSSR. SARATOV staunchly
defended the Soviet and Warsaw Pact occupation claiming that it was a
necessary move because of the increasing aggressiveness of the West
Germans and that the avowed purpose of West German truculence was to put
pressure on both the CSSR and East Germany in hopes of reunifying Germany.
SARATOV did not become emotional over his defense, but left little doubt
that he wholeheartedly approved of the Soviet move into the CSSR. Neither
the BILGORE's or the LIROBBIN'S pursued the issue al though L/1 commented
to SARATOV that he was not convinced by SARATOV's defense of Soviet actions.
In short, L/1 felt that the evening went off smoothly and as the LIROBBINS
departed SARATOV walked them down the steps and solicitously inquired of
L/1 as to whether they (SARATOV's) had entertained properly and if all
had been satisfied with the SARATOV's production. L/1 found this vaguely
out of keeping with SARATOV's personality and somewhat gauche. L/1 noted
that the SARATOV apartment was modern and well-kept giving every evidence
of having been lived in. The SARATOV's possess a large European make
combination phono-radio set which was tuned to light FM music for back-
ground. SAPATOV stated that he had inherited this from his predecessor.
SARATOV's one child (age 9) was in bed when the guests arrived. Upon
departing, SARATOV inquired of the LIACBIINS if they planned to attend the

DATE OF MENTING: 14 November 1968
1. The undersigned met with LIROBBIN/1 at his apartment on:
14 November from 1500 to 1630 hours. LIROBINS/2 was ill in bed (flu)
and was unable to participate in this meeting. The LIROBBINS daughter,
Lisa, was present in the house during the meeting which prompted REIDEMANN
to inquire of L/1 if the daughter was XNXX aware of the type of re-
lationship which the LIROBBINS had with REIDEMANN. L/1 replied that
"they" had told their daughter inasmuch as she had come to suspect such
a relationship over the past year or so. REIDEMANN felt that it would be
of little purpose, at this time, to admonish the LIROBEINS and dropped the
subject. REIDEMANN has found the LIROBBINS to be woefully lacking in
general security principles and has strived, in a tactful manner, to point.
out past shortcomings and possible security hazards. especially with
regard to telephone conversations.

2. In response to REIDEMANN's question regarding attendance at the
7 November reception, L/1 stated that they had both attended. L/1 com-
To le
mented that there appeared fewer people this year than last.. As a matter
of fact, L/1 could identify only two people in the entire throng that he
had previously known. They were: the Indian Embassy Counsellor (?),
FNU PARASHAR and an American couple, Lulu Vargas-Vila do LEE (wife),
who is the correspondent for La Union (Valparaiso); La Prensa (Buenos
Aires); El Tiempo (Bogota) and resides at Platon 445 2nd floor,
Tel: 20-10-23. The LIRO3INS spoke briefly with both of the above
parties as well as SARATOV (P-13125)," SYCH!EV (P-11113), LOGINOV (P-11712)
and PRIMERO (P-2270). The conversation adhered to generalities such as
the Olympics, food, etc. 1/1 noted that the majority of the guests

appeared to be Mexicans - a large number of them clad in their every-
day clothes. There was also a sprinkling of Mexican student-appearing
types. For the record, L/1 reported that his automobile is a 1965
blue, two-door, Oldsmobile bearing Oklahoma license plates, ZS-8546
(1968 plates).
3. With reference to SARATOV's party on the evening of 13 November,
1/1 commented that he and L/2 arrived at the party at approximately
2000 remaining until ca. 0030, 14 November. The LIROBBINS were the
last to leave although they departed only minutes after the rest of the
guests. The guest list included: The LIROBBINS, Arnold Bilgore and
wife Johnne, Roger "CUDNEY (Radio VIP) and wife, and the Saratovs.
English was the common language spoken and L/1 noted that both the
Saratovs handled the language with ease although as the evening progressed
ar1 SARATOV¹ẻ liquor consumption increased his fluency and articulation
became more labored. L/1 stated that SARATOV pushed liquor very hard
the entire evening starting out with two pre-dinner drinks andthen
serving vodka in accompaniement to the borsch. Wine was served with the
main course, Chinese beef, prepared by Nataliya SARATOVA. Dessert was
accompanied with brandy and the evening progressed with long drinks after
dinner. L/1 stated that SARATOV drank with the group although 1/1 doubted
that SARATOV matched the men drink for drink. Mrs. SARATOVA appeared
at ease and seemed to enjoy the conversation. L/1 assessed her as a
woman who complemented her husband and made a charming and vivacious
appearance. L/1 seemed to be struck with SARATOV's apparent "sincerity"
apparent"sincerity"
in in his enjoyment of the evening and his "candor" in the discussions.
For the most part, the conversation edged away from any controversial
subjects; seemingly all were content to dwell upon "Old Mexico" of 20
years ago and the joys of simple living in the city. During a discussion
of the style of night life in Mexico, SARATOV remarked that he enjoyed

Chief of Station
C/IC
Consular Corps. Visit to Veracruz
1. The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 November
together with other members of the Consular Corps on an
official visit to that city. Although the Cubans were
scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them
guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them
showed up, including Lino SALAZAR Chia, who is stationed in
Veracruz.. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles for a number
of reasons also failed to go on this trip. Thus, the only
Communist representative was Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV,
with whom the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk.
It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption,
considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was accompa-
nied by his wife.
2.
The following were the main points of interest
discussed by LOGINOV:
a. The Soviet appeared very anxious to get.
the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which he
kept going back time and again during the visit:
the position of the Richard N. NIXON administration
vis-a-vis Communist China. Specifically, what
LOGINOV wanted to know was what the chances are
that the NIXON administration might attempt to bring
about a rapprochement between Communist China and
the United States. LOGINOV approached this topic
from various directions, and the undersigned had
the distinct impression that he had received a
specific query on this subject. At one point,
LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China
to his country, "indicating that his government is
becoming increasingly concerned with developments
there.

forthcoming Acapulco film festival. L/1 stated that he was not sure
if he would journey there and SARATOV stated that he and his wife planned
to attend.
4. LIROBBIN/1 stated that during a recent conversation which he
-had with Stratford JONES (US citizen representing AP in Mexico), JONES
commented that he knew both SARATOV and SYCHEV. JONES remarked that
he had been to a party at SYCHEV's during the Olympics. NIKT- - Further-
more, JONES related that he knew the RUCHEROV's (TASS) and that Mrs.
Y KUCHEROV had been sent home before the departure of KUCHEROV.
JONES strongly implied that security reasons wore behind the rather
abrupt departure of Mrs. KUCHEROV. L/1 did not press the issue any
further.
5. LIROBBIN/1 also reported that the Foreign Press Club in in a
chaotic state in that the president, Jose QUIROGA, has accused the club
director, Katherine MANJARREZ, of embezzling funds. The truth of the
matter, however, seems to be that QUIROGA is engaged in either shady
dealing or is guilty of sloppy administration of finances. At any rate,
L/1 commented that all members must pay cash for all services and that
the club's creditors are pushing for cash payments of all services.
"scandal" seems to have shaken the Club and many members are staying
away until the financial situation is corrected.
6. The undersigned inquired of L/1 as to whether he knew of any
US citizens who might be looking for an apartment. L/1 stated that
he was currently unaware of anyone desiring housing but that he would
keep his ears open and make a few discreet inquiries without revealing
that he knows of any vacancies.

b. Connected with the above was LOGINOV's
concern for peace in Vietnam. For the first time
that the undersigned can remeber, a Soviet stated
that the United States and his country had "a
common interest of utmost importance" in bringing
peace to Vietnam. That the Soviet interest may
be connected with their concern about Communist
China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter
indicated that peace should be obtained in Vietnam
as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.
This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual
noises in favor of the National Liberation Front
and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese
militarism.
C. While talking about the Middle East,
LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was in the
Mediterranean to stay and fully intended to give
such support to the Arab nations in that area as
to someday "get rid of Israel." LOGINOV specifically
stated, "The Jews have it coming to them, and the
day of reckoning is coming. The undersigned was
curious to know whether this was prompted on
LOGINOV's part by a dislike of the Israelis or an
anti-Semitic feeling. LOGINOV was quite blunt and
categorically stated that he for one "hated all
Jews," and did not hide his profound anti-Semitism.
LOGINOV added that Jews are parasites who have
little nationalism other than that generated by the
Zionist cause. He implied that those Jews left in
the Soviet Union are foreigners who have done little
to help the Soviet cause. The undersigned pointed.
out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian
tradition, dating back to before the Revolution,
and deplored this obvious discrimination. He added
that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the
party which not so long ago made mass murder of
Jews a matter of national policy.
d. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring up
the Sucesos para Todos article. The undersigned
jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or
Cuban sponsored joke, saying that rumor had it that
Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

of the Soviet Union. He said, for example, that
the Soviet intervention was very unpopular in Mexico.
This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV, as
he abruptly interrupted the undersigned and asked,
"Where is it popular?"

Cubans. LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff
of Sucesos could not be put by any stretch of the
imagination into the category of "Communists." He.
then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he
belonged to the organization mentioned in the
article. The undersigned laughingly answered that
if such trashy publications as Sucesos were believed
by anyone "of course he belonged to that organization."
LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how
Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name. The latter
replied that his name was probably selected at
random from stolen pages of the Embassy directory
or other such document. He added that if LOGINOV
had wanted his phone number he would have been glad
to have given it to him rather than see it appear
in Sucesos.
e.
The discussion the undersigned had with
LOGINOV in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently
not forgotten by the Soviet, for the latter pulled
out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating
some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had ·
mentioned to him. The undersigned has no idea of
the reasons for this gesture. One of the topics
which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the
number of visas he signs at the Soviet Embassy.
Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in his
provocations, the undersigned raises this subject,
with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and
no answer.
f.
LOGINOV indicated that he was aware that
the undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the
time of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia
and asked for his opinion of SVESTKA. The undersigned
made no bones about the fact that he had a long lunch
with the Czech. He said he had found him to be "muy
de la izquierda," adding that unfortunately SVESTKA
belonged to the very small minority of his country
which had wolcomed Soviet intervention. The under-
signed predicted that the Soviets would have con-
siderable trouble with Czechoslovakia and pointed
out that this serious error had tarnished the cause

the militarists of Nexico are planning to take over the
covernment of Nexico? Doesn't it make sense that if
the militarists are able to create a state of civil
disorder that they will be granted more power, to the
extent that they will become the acting government of
Nexico, like the governments which have recently come
into being in Greece and Peru? Couldn't the terrorist
groups like the "Yurro" and the so-called "Communista".
be in actuality employees of the militarist institutions
of this country whose purpose it is to frustrate a
situation which only the military-police state could
control?

SUBJ207: DIRCHEINS/1 and 2.
DATE OF MUSTING: 15 October 1968
1 1. The undersigned met with LIROEDING/1 and 2 at their apartment
on 15 October from 1600 to 1730 hours. The LIROBBINS were informed
that REIDEMANN would be out of the country for the next two weeks and,
accordingly, were requested to contact
should they obtain
information which they deem perishable and of urgency. The ROBINS will
contact
either at the Station or at home via telephone...
A supplementary report on the activities of Pearl, GONZALEZ is attached
to this Contact Report as a Nemorandum for the Record (sophrate).
2. LIRGDBIN/1 reported that on 2 Cctober Aleksandr PRICHOSO (P/2270)
delivered an invitation to the LIROBBINE to attend a reception at the
Soviet Embassy for the Soviet Olympic team. PRIKHODHO did not come in
and visit with the LIROBBINS but merely made out an invitation for the
LIROBBINS to attend. Both the LIROBBINS attended the function arriving
at approximately 1930 and departing about 2130. The reception was rither
poorly organized and thered were few people in attendance from the Mexico
City community. The LIROEDINS stated that they wore the only American
journalists and recognized no other guests with the exception of a Mexican
movie star/director, Amilio FERNANDIZ ("El Indo") and wife. During the
reception, LIROEBIN/2 saw GARUZOV (P-13125) who approached the LIRCEBINS
and apologized for the fact that he had not been able to hold his party.
SARAZOV said that he had been extremely busy with the Olympics which
occasioned him to go out to the airport every day as well as doing the
work of others who he implied had been shirking their duties. BARATOY
repeated his regret that he had not been able to organize the promised
party, but assured the LIROEBINS that as soon as the Olympies were over

SUBJECT: Julio PLATAS Urbina, born 10 October 1941 in Empalme,
Sonora
1. It has come to our attention that Julio PLATAS Urbina,
an agent of the Soviet KGB, is presently living in Bacobampo,
Sonora. PLATAS has been known to us since 1961, when he was in
contact with Aleksander BROVKIN, a KGB officer who was then.
and still is attached to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City as
a Third Secretary. In 1965, PLATAS was in contact with Valentin
LOGINOV, a KGB officer who is a Third Secretary and Consul of
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.
2. The exact nature of PLATAS's KGB assignments is unknown
to us, but he is believed to be a courier, carrying both money
and drugs in behalf of the KGB. His courier duties are also
believed to have brought him in contact with the Communist Party
of Mexico.
3. PLATAS is believed to have traveled considerably through-
out Latin America, and is known to have been in Argentina and
Great Britain in 1967. According to our information, he has just
received a new assigumont, a courier mission which may begin as
early as 1 August 1968.
4. We would appreciate receiving the results of your inter-
rogation of PLATAS particularly since he is alleged to have
knowledge of Soviet attempts to recruit personnel of the U.8.
Embassy in Mexico.

Just after 5:00 PM last Friday, Sr. Higinio Gómez Jr.
jreviously unknown to me but whose calling card Indicatos
that he is employed by the Weyerhauser Paper Company here,
brought to the Protection and Welfare Office a blue canvas
bag containing two book-length manuscripts. Sr. Gómez
statel that he had found the bag containing the muscripts
the elevator of the office building in which he works, at
Reforma No. 308, opposite the Embassy. He said that he was
ignoment as to the identity of their author, as well as who
it might have been who had left them in the elevator. He
had examined then briefly, he said, and then decided that th
they ought imediately to be brought to the Embassy.

The cardboard cover sheets of both manuscripts identified
the author as Forton Slone, and one of these shoved his
address to be "General" Horton Slone, c/o Hr. J. Edgar Hostar,
Chief of the F.B.I., Pn. Ave. at 9th Street, N.W., Washington,
D. C. The books were entitled "Swords along the Shoro," and t
"Konotan - Folklore of the Incas." A cursory examination of
the former revealed a clumsy hate theme, charging minority
groups in the United States with selling out to the comminists.
The latter was apparently a romantic treatment in moval forms 11
of Pizarro's conquest of Paru.
As you are aware, the manuscripts were delivered to you
on the same day for storage and subsequent disposition.

LOGINOV. Not hearing from LOGINOV after their telephone
conversation on 10 May, Subject called him on 30 or 31 May.
Subject told LOGINOV he couldn't remember who was supposed to
call whom about setting a date for the LOGINOVS' visit to
Subject's home, and he just wanted to check to see that they
hadn't gotten their signal crossed. LOGINOV said that it wasn't
that he was waiting for Subject to call, but simply that a free
date hadn't opened up yet. LOGINOV said that it didn't look as
thought he was going to be able to get to Subject's home for
the next couple of weeks, but that he be definitely wanted to
take Subject up on his invitation and would call him just as
soon as he definitely knew he would have a free Saturday or Sunday
when he could come.

contact to LOGINOV,

DALMA is the general manager of "MEXAMA "

„Subject's knowledge, DALMA was born in Hungary and came to
Mexico about 10 or 15 years ago. He is a member of the
"Industrial Club" in Cuernavaca, and Subject occasionally meets

about her that he couldn't just dismiss the idea. Moreover, his
wife had learned about Velia, and although she was accustomed to
Subject's philandering, she recognized that Vella was a little
different from Subject's other girl friends and was extremely
upset. Subject asked my opinion and advice, and for what it
was worth, I told him I thought he was crazy to even think of
breaking up his family and his marriage with a woman whom he
ally and his
claimed to still love and who was tolerant to the point that
Subject was able to have both her and all the routine extra-
curricular activity he wanted at the same time. I pointed out
that this certainly wouldn't be the case with Velia, who would
probably poison him if he even looked at another woman. After
batting this around for some time, Subject finally said he
agreed with me and that if he couldn't simply keep Velia on
the string, he'd have no choice but to drop her. This is
hardly to say, however, that this is what Subject will do, and
I suspect Valia will continue to disrupt Subject's personal life
for some time to come.
9. As for our possible use of Velia--and she does seem to
have the credentials to be one of the great female spies--there
are clearly two considerations which should be mentioned. First,
any attempt to use Subject in her exploitation (at least at this
point) would further complicate his relations with her and
presumably further disrupt his personal life. Second, based on
what I know about her from Subject and from personal contact, I
am afraid that if we did succeed in recruiting her for whatever

in New York City, a house in Mexico City, and a second house
in Acapulco, where she also had a sizable piece of undeveloped
land. Subject described Velia as both extremely intelligent
and a tremendous sexual partner, and speculated that because of
her excellent political contacts, she might from time to time be
able to provide some interesting information on the Mexican
political scene.
7. I was in Acapulco on 6 and 7 April, and at Subject's
invitation spent the afternoon of 7 April with him and Velia
on the beach at the Pierre Marques Hotel. Subject introduced me
(by phony name) as a business contact from the States, and I had
the opportunity to talk with Velia at intervals throughout the
afternoon. As Subject told me, she is attractive, well-built,
intelligent, polished, very sharp, and evidently very shrewd.
She also speaks very good English. She told me she had just
returned two days ago from a shopping trip to New York with the
wife of MARTINEZ Dominguez. She said the señora is really just
a country woman and had asked her to go with her to New York to
help her pick out a new wardrobe, which she needed for her new
role as the wife of the leader of the PRI. We later drove to
Vilia's house for a drink, and from its size and location
(overlooking the bay between the socalo and the Caleta Hotel, it
would indeed appear she had a considerable amount of money.
8. On 3 June, Subject told me that his romance with Vella
had gotten out of hand, as she was extremely demanding and
possessive and wanted him to divorce his wife and marry her.
The problem, Subject said, was that he felt just strongly enough

him there. Subject said that DAIMA. has tried to be friendly
with him for several years and has many times invited Subject and
his wife to his home. Subject said he has never liked DALMA,
however, and has always found a way out of the invitations.
One reason he didn't like DALMA, Subject said, was that he always
seemed to have something good to say about Communist Hungary
About nine months ago, DALMA tock a trip to Hungary, and whenever
Subject has seen him since then, he has made a point of telling
Subject how good conditions are in Hungary and how happy everyone
is there. Subject said he thought we should therefore have the
follow's name in our files.
5. BESABER'S PERSONAL LIFE
LIFE. In late March, Subject told me
about a woman he had met on a business trip to New York earlier
*
in the month. Her name is Velia SANCHEZ Belmont, Mexican citizen,
age approximately 33. Subject happened to sit next to her on the.
flight to New York, struck up a conversation, and ultimately
spent a few nights with her in New York...
*
6. Subject told me that Velia was once married to an
American singer, but had been divorced and subsequently become
the mistress of Julian RODRIGUEZ Adame, a former Mexican-
Secretary of Agriculture (under LOPEZ Mateos) and currently the
President of the International Cotton Association. Subject said
that through RODRIGUEZ Adame, Velia had gotten to know many of
the top people in the PRI and had become particularly friendly with
*
the wife of Alfonso MARTINEZ Dominguez, the new head of the
PRI.
Subject said that Velia had become fairly wealthy as the
result of her influential contacts and now owned an apartment

his Frendh girl friend's apartment and have a blast replete
with girls and boose. VIDIELLA then asked if Subject thought.
BRIGGS would mind if a Soviet Embassy official came along.
Subject said he was sure BRIGGS wouldn't mind, and they agreed
to make definite plans at a later date.
3. Subject said that VIDIELLA mentioned that his mother
had taught Spanish to Valentin in Moscow.

CICARD also boasted of the moral necessity for the Cubans to
help free Latin Americans from the drudge of misery and
oppression. When the undersigned jointly asked whether this
included Mexico, CICARD said that the Cubans had to watch.
themselves in that country and would do nothing there. The
undersigned, by way of conclusion, warned him that any effort
in Mexico was doomed, as the Cubans would get nowhere in that
country even if they tried. At another point of the visit
both CICARD and SALAZAR denied vehemently that Cuba had
supronted any opposition movement in Mexico or that it had
backed guerrilla movements in Guerrero and elsewhere. Both
CICARD and SALAZAR several times joked in the presence of
their Soviet friends that any American aggression against Cuba
would probably mean Russian reprisals against the United States,
but that Cuba in any case was ready for any alternative.
While at the Hilton Hotel, where the group stayed in Guada-
lajara, the undersigned, who was looking out a window over-
looking the garden in the back of the hotel where the pool is,
spotted CICARD, SALAZAR, and CHERNYSH late on the evening of
18 May, just prior to leaving for the railroad station,
engaged in an animated conversation. While CICARD looked
over his shoulder, SALAZAR scribbled something on the paper
which he handed CHERNYSH. The same day, about half an hour
before going to the Station, Reynaldo CEPEDA Hernandez and
his wife arrived at the Hilton, where they were eventually
introduced to the undersigned by CICARD as "our First Secretary."
The undersigned later asked CICARD what, CEPEDA was doing there
since he was not part of the group and since the Cubans, have
no consulate in Guadalajara. With a broad smile CICARD said
he was on "vacation." At one point of the visit, the bus
used by the group left without the undersigned, the Cubans,
and the representative of Ecuador and his wife. It was agreed
to proceed to the banquet which was to be held at Chapala,
some 55 kilometers away, by taxi, if the taxi could not first
locate the bus in the city. The bus was not located, and the
little group proceeded to Chapala, where to the undersigned's
amazement CICARD paid for the entire taxi trip and refused
money from the others.

Among the 30 odd members of the Mexico City Consular
Association who traveled to Guadalajara for a semiofficial
visit to that city on 17 and 18 May 1936 were Valentin
Servojevich LOGINOV and any CHIWYSH, representing the
Soviets Jiri SVESTKA, representing the Czechs; and Enrique
3 Labrada and Lino SALAZAR Chia, representing the Cubans.
SALAZAR was a surprise to everybody since he is stationed in
Veracruz. It must be said, however, that at least one other
representative of the Veracruz Consular Association (a Guate-
malan or Dominican) also traveled with the group. Travel to
and from Guadalajara was by train, giving ample opportunity
for a variety of conversations. The undersigned also found.

of interest listed in the official program of the visit.
2. CICARD certainly made an effort to be as sociable as
possible in his dealings with the undersigned. By the end
of the visit, as a matter of fact, and in spite of several
rather pointed discussions, CICARD appeared to have become
the undersigned's good friend, walking about with his arm
around the undersigned's shoulder and calling him by his first

he was a Communist. The undersigned then pointed out that

with the Vatican, to the point where it had an Ambassador to
the Vatican and had celebrated some months ago some distinction
accorded by the Pope to the Papal Nuncio in Havana by lighting
up the churches at government expense. CICARD readily admitted
that there were many "good Communists" in Cuba who were also
good Catholics, even, he said, among people fairly high up in
the government. He, CICARD, was a dedicated revolutionary,
however, who did not give any part of his loyalty to the regime
to any type of religion. CICARD went on to emphasize that
the close CASTRO relations with the Vatican were a demonstra-
tion of the democratic nature of Fidel's regime. On several
instances the undersigned joked about Raul CASTRO's recent
spech which brought about the nationalization of every last
small enterprise and further rationing in Cuba of such things
as beer and soft drinks. On one occasion he also told CICARD
that the latter's country was at the end of its rope economically,
with hard currency reserves at an all-time low since the CASTRO
Revolution. CICARD agreed that the "economic situation of his
country was bad," particularly as far as hard currency reserves
wone decerned. He naturally attributed this in part to the
so-called American blockade and in other part to the efforts.
that had previously been made by the government to buy as much
machinery as possible to go on with its plan of industrial
expansion. When the undersigned mentioned shortages of meat,
fruit, et cetera, CICARD readily admitted these were being
sold to purchase badly needed equipment. As far as the sugar
crop was concerned, he also admitted that the one of this
year would not much that of last year, but he would not agree
that it would not go over 5,000,000 tons. He and his colleague,
however, repeated time and again that they were convinced, as
Fidel has promised them, that by 1970 Cuba would have a
10,000,000 ton harvest of sugar. As a matter of fact, the
date 1970 came up in the conversation about other matters,
is if that date were that from which Cuba would have no more
economic problems. Someone in the group mentioned to CICARD
that there had been rumors in the press of rapprochement
between Cuba and the United States. CICARD said he did not
think so because, he said, relations, between the two countries.
were at present "very bad. The undersigned jokingly asked.
CICARD about Cyrus EATON's visit and the purpose of it. All
CICARD would say was that EATON had a meeting with Fidel
(photographs of EON and CASTRO appeared in the local news-
papers). As to the reason for the trip, CICARD rather

sarcastically pointed out that that was up to the Ministry
of Information and claimed to know nothing about it. On the
roturn trip to Mexico City CICARD bronched the topic of the
cight beatniks who had recently been arrested by the Mexican
police as they were about to board the plane for Cuba and
deported to the United States. The undersigned kept a
straight face throughout this and told him he knew nothing:
about it. CICARD protested that news of the arrests and
deportation had reached the press. The undersigned told him
that he had seen nothing of the sort. CICARD then went on
to blame the incident on the American Embassy, which, he said,
was behind the arrests and deportation. The undersigned
pointed out that the Embassy had other things to do than to
concern itself with, according to CICARD's own description,
beatnik-type students. This was, in any case, a Mexican
matter and it was not surprising that the people were arrested.
and deported, as the Mexicans had arrested and deported many
other beatniks of all nationalities. During a rather heated
exchange. the previous night in which Yuriy S. CHERNYSH and
Jiri SVESTKA were also present, CICARD boasted that Puerto
Rico would soon find its freedom.. The undersigned really
opened up on him and blandly told him that the United States
had held a referendum in Puerto Rico, during which it had
offered statehood of independence, but the Puerto Ricans
preferred to maintain the status which they now enjoy with
the United States. He also told CICARD that the two or three
bombs that had blown up on the island in recent months and
were no doubt the work of the Cubans were probably one of the
worst pieces of stupidity that the regime had committed.
The undersigned went on to blast. CICARD in front of his
Communist friends for the policy of aggression pursued by
Cuba in Latin America, even against the advice of the Soviets
and other foreign Communists. He said he could not imagine
how Cuba could continue with such a program after the rout
it suffered in Bolivia and Peru. CHERNYSH and SVESTKA, who
were listening to this, remained silent during this exchange.
CICARD. th a sarcastic laugh, said that solivia and Peru
were one thing, but what about Colombia, Venezuela, and
Guatemala? The undersigned told him that these so-called
revolutionary movements had badly suffered in the last few
Honth. The control the Cubans claimed to exercise over these
novéments was also doubtful, as some of these movements had
openly criticized the Cubans. The previous day during a visit

this: LIRENO-1, incidentally, has pointed out in his reports
that SALAZAR is extremely active in Veracruz and that he has

others. The general commanding the area, who is a source of

deported. This Section will see what it can do to oblige him.

4. There was no doubt from LOGINOV's statements to the
undersigned that the Soviet had made at least some mental
notes before he went on the trip about subjects he should
raise with the undersigned. Vietnam, of course, was profusely
discussed, but LOGINOV also wanted to know about the state of
the election campaigns in the United States and about the
March of the Poor on Washington. Ono afternoon that LOGINOV
was with CHERNYSH, the undersigned told him that he could not
imagine how the Soviets could favor the candidacy of Bobby
KENNEDY, an aristocrat and millionnaire who had never worked
with his hands and was liberally spending the family fortune
to influence people's minds, when t HUMPHREY, for example,
was far more to the left in the American political spectrum
and obviously had the support of the labor unions. No matter
What the undersigned said, the Soviets found something good
to say about KENNEDY, who appears to be the candidate the
Soviet Union would most like to see as the next President.
The two Soviets laughingly remarked that the undersigned's
apparent dislike for KENNEDY might one day cost him his job.
The undersigned said that fortunately the American Government
was not at the mercy of the prevailing winds as were the
governments of "other countries." The manner in which LOGINOV
went about collecting his "information" was interesting and
amusing. For example, on the way to Guadalajara, when the
undersigned and LOGINOV were alone in the corridor of their
coach, LOGINOV mentioned the armistice negotiations in Vietnam.
The undersigned, as he has done many times in the past,
emphasized that this opportunity to find an adequate peace should
not be thrown away, as a backdown in negotiations might increase
the tempo of the war to the point where a much larger conflict.
could result. LOGINOV agreed that no one, including his
country, wanted such a conflict and indeed a maximum effort
should be made to find peace in Vietnam. The undersigned
reiterated that much depended on the Soviets, as the latter
obviously had some influence over the North Vietnamese Govern-
ment. He then said that peace was possible providing that

Negro-type accent that it is, almost impossible to understand

As a matter of fact, both LOGINOV and CHERNYSH told.
the undersigned that the latter seemed to understand SALAZAR
far better than they did. At every possible moment he could
squeeze in some Communist propaganda SALAZAR throw in a
CASTROist tirade, whether it was relevant to the conversation
and the moment or not. He tried to embarrass the wife of the
South Korean representative who was with the group by asking
Her whether every Korean woman had a wart over her lip as
she did. Fortunately, the wife of the Korean representative

launched into a tirade about South Korea, which the undersigned
cut off by telling Irim that he did not know what he was talking
about and that North Korea was the bottom of the barrel as
Tar as nations were concerned. SALAZAR said that in Veracruz
the Americans avoided him, but that this was all right with
him since he had no business with them. He boasted that he
was at the battle of the Bay of Pigs, which, he said, was one

member of the group so obviously that the undersigned walked

The undersigned said he
had not. LOGINOV then said that he was a bachelor. The
undersigned said that if he was it was probably because in
his 40 years as head of the FBI he had had an awfully lot to
co. The undersigned then pointed out that the FBI was a
Choroughly respected organization in the United States which
had the support of the people. LOGINOV then switched to the
CIA, but the undersigned told him that unlike the FBI, on
which quite a bit was known to the American people, very little
filtered out about the CIA. LOGINOV made one more crack about
the periodic changes at the helm of the CIA and dropped the
subject. A somewhat similar conversation occurred a little
later between the undersigned, LOGINOV, and CHERNYSH when
unexpectedly LOGINOV mentioned something about the KGB and
its dedication to the protection of the Soviet people and the
Constitution. The undersigned asked LOGINOV for a sample of
the stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the KGB.
Neither CHERNYSH nor LOGINOV seemed to know that such a stamp.
existed but launched into praise of the service which assured
the protection of the Soviet people with such a light hand.
The undersigned returned that the KGB was an organization
with a terrible reputation overseas, where, contrary to what
the Soviets had just told him, they appeared to maintain
numerous stations. LOGINOY then pointed out that the United
States police did not have a light hand and, as he put it,
cracked heads any time they had a chance. The undersigned
said that, on the contrary, when a firm hand had to be used,
the police had a very bad time of it during everyday life, as
recent decisions of the Supreme Court made law enforcement a
very difficult business because of the emphasis given by the
Court to the respect and protection of human rights. Sur-
prisingly enough, neither the Soviets, nor the Czechs, nor
the Cubans had much to say about recent race riots in the
:
States other than to confirm for themselves that quite

was a young one and on occasion claimed to know more than
those who have been purifying Communism for 50 years and
more. The undersigned joked about the fact that the Soviet
Union would have to give the Cubans petroleum free if the
sugar crop this year was as bad as it appeared to be. LOGINOV
had a good chuckle over this but did not comment.
5. The undersigned, who has already had the feeling that
Jiri SVEJKA apes the Soviets, copies their line, and mimics
their comportment, had confirmation of all this during the
trip. SVESTKA was one of the first to raise the topic of
Vietnam and pour oil over the fire. During dinner in the
dining car on the way to Guadalajara, where he sat with the
undersigned and the two Soviets, the topic of the Red army
came up. The undersigned, who had previously told the Russians
that he served for a brief time with that army, said that he
had great admiration for the military feats of the Russians.
This led SVESTKA to say that the Red army was never beaten.
The undersigned then gave SVESTKA a short refresher course
in what had happened in Warsaw in 1920 or 1921, when a Franco-
Prussian army led by Gen. Maxime WEYGAND and Gen. Jozef
PILSI'DSKI beat an invading Soviet army, which had, among
other things, Joseph STALIN as its commissar. SVESTKA tried
to dispute the fact that this took place, whereupon the under-
signed offered to buy him a history book. That seemed to
pre ent SVESTKA from making any other expeditions into history
during the remainder of the trip. Most of the discussions
with the Czech, Soviets, and Cubans were on extremely friendly"
terms, in spite of their pointedness at times. During the
night of 18 May, during the train trip back to Mexico City,
a particularly heated discussion took place in a compartment
where CHERNYSH, SVESTKA, and CICARD were present. This
discussion will be reviewed in the next paragraph. Suffice
it to say that at one point SVESTKA intervened in the defense
of CHERNYSH to say something about how indebted Czechoslovakia
was to the Soviets. The undersigned then told him that if it
had not been the decision of President Franklin D. ROOSEVELT,
at the urging, apparently, of STALIN, to stop the advance of
the United States army into Czechoslovakia to allow the
Russians to liberate Prague, the armistice would not have,
found Soviet troops occupying Czechoslovakia, and "things
might have been completely different for the Czech nation."

undersigned even more blandly asked him if he meant to say
that Czechoslovakia would have become a Communist power had
the Soviet armies not occupied the country by the end of the
War.
SVESTKA said that there was no doubt about this, that
the coming of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia had
been inevitable because of the historical and social background
of the Czechs. The undersigned expressed horror at a statement
like this, which did not take into consideration the fact
that such anti-Communists as Jan MASARYK and Eduard BENES
were the fathers of the Czech state. SVESTKA then went on to
say.that indeed neither MASARYK nor BENES had been Communist,
but that neither had any deep knowledge of the inborn desires
of the Czech people. The undersigned told him that this
was enough to make both MASARYK and BENES turn over in their
graves. He pointed out that there had been a violent exchange,
according to the Mexican press, between the Czech and Soviet
papers over MASARYK, with the Russians saying that MASARYK
had participated in an attempt to kill Nikolai LENIN. CHERNYSH
said that this was a pack of lies, that he had reviewed the
Soviet press for that period and found nothing about MASARYK.
This was quickly endorsed by. SVESTKA. When the undersigned
once more stated his belief that people who had known better
would take the first opportunity to overthrow Communism, both
The
CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time.
undersigned pointed out that the Russian people had never
known anything other than a curb on personal freedom and very
strong central government, but the Czechs, the Poles, the
Hungarians, and others had known differently. Such people
were thirsty for personal freedoms and direct control over
their destiny. When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the under-
signed reminded him that it was Russian tanks that had crushed
the students and workers' revolt in Hungary in 1956.
pointed to the recent quiet but radical revolution which had
taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example, the
day after the right to strike had been re-established practi-.
cally all workers struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement,
poor housing, and lack of freedom. From that point on SVESTKA
remained silent, apparently having been shaken up. The
undersigned allowed himself to think that in several years.
at least the Czechs; like the Rumanians before them, would be
governing themselves without having first to check with Moscow.
This discussion ended about 1:30 in the morning. At 9:00 the
undersigned saw LOGINOV, with whom he had a chat about various

two main conditions were met. At that point somcone came by
and interrupted the conversation for a good two or three
minutes. Rather than renew the argument he could see LOGINOV
wanted to develop, the undersigned started to talk about the
cattle in the fields, Mexican agriculture, et cotora. LOGINOV.
listened to this for one or two minutes and then reminded
the undersigned he had said something about conditions for
the armistice. The undersigned said that the primary condition
for peace was for North Vietnam to pull out all of its troops
from South Vietnam. Before he could mention the second
condition, someone again interrupted the conversation, handed
the undersigned and LOGINOV drinks, and remained for a good
five minutes. After his departure, the undersigned again
talked about something else, but again LOGINOV, after one or
two minutes, doggedly went back to the original discussion
and wanted to know what the second condition was. The under-
signed then told him that this condition was that really free
élections be held in South Vietnam. About half an hour later,
LOGINOV opened up on the March of the Poor, whereupon the
undersigned referred him to a recent article in the U.S. News
and World Report listing the salaries of various workers in
the United States. Electricians, for example, are listed as
making $7.50 an hour. In short, the undersigned pointed out,
to be really poor in the United States takes a lot of doing,
or rather, a lack of doing. He said he wished the United
States could do as the Soviets do and send people without a
desire to work on the will to assume responsibility to re-
education camps in Siberia and elsewhere. LOGINOV confirmed,
in fact, that that was what the Soviet government was doing.
LOGINOV also touched upon the search for the assassin of
Martin Luther KING, whereupon the undersigned told him that

and the heavy state controls over the population so that ft.
was difficult at times to find a man in that nation of more
than 200,000,000 people in one or two days. He also told
"LOGINOV that it remained to be seen who put the assassin up
to his act. The undersigned, of course, mentioned that the
assassination was an abominable deed, as KING was probably
the most reasonable of the black leaders. He said that had
the white extremists, as LOGINOV called them, been behind the
assassination, it is probable that Stokeley CARMICHAEL or
Rap BROWN would have been shot. During the ride on the bus
and out of the clear blue, LOGINOV asked the undersigned

in all of CHERNYSH's arguments. The undersigned scored a
little more during the previously mentioned discussion during
the night of 18 May. He then had a better chance to compare
the American Constitution with the Soviet one, underscoring
the elements of centralism and curbs on personal choice.
The discussion of the role of the Russians in World War II
permitted his question of whether the Russians had fought for
their country or for their regine. The undersigned told
CHERNYSH that his contact with Soviet soldiers during the War
had no doubt in his mind that the latter had fought for
their country and families first, and much later to back up
their regime. Both SVESTRA and CHERNYSH naturally argued with
this view, particularly SVESTKA, who at times can be more pro-
Soviet than the Soviets. As pointed out above, CHERNYSH seems
to like the undersigned's company, and the farewell between
him and the undersigned at the station in Mexico City appeared
to be particularly warm. This, of course, is not viewed by
the Cubans or SVESTKA with a particularly good eye.

things. He inquired about SVESTKA. LOGINOV said he had
brielly seen him on his way to the dining car, but commented
VESTKA looked mighty unhappy about something. It was
obs to the undersigned that, as mentioned above, the
ious night's discussion had really shaken up the Czech,
who was worrying about how things would turn out in Czecho-
slovakia and about his future. SVESTKA, as a matter of fact,
mentioned to the undersigned when he saw him a few minutes
later that he had felt that part of the previous night's
discussion had been conducted in what he phrased as a rather
cool atmosphere. This feeling was obviously not shared by
CHERNYSH, despite the heat of the discussion, who warmly
greeted the undersigned the next morning, and unless the
undersigned is very much mistaken, appeared to have a sort of
liking for him.
On
6. The undersigned finds CHERNYSH a fairly easy man to
talk to. Not that CHERNYSH is not a dedicated Communist, but
He seems to enjoy a good discussion, probably because he
finds this a good oppertunity to pass on typical Communist
views. Before the discussion] the night of 18 May mentioned
above, during which CHERNYSH was one of the main participants,
the Ukrainian and the undersigned had previously discussed
such things as Western-style elections and the right to strike.
On both topics CHERNYSH obviously was not on the same wave
length as the undersigned. He appeared to believe his state-
ments to the effect that a strike was unnecessary in a society
dedicated to the well-being of the workers. It would only
cripple an economy struggling hard to meet local demands.
the subject of elections CHERNYSH was even further away from
the Western view. He pointed out that some Americans, and
perhaps the undersigned, did not have any particular liking
for any of the candidates for presidential elections. This
made the element of choice a very marginal benefit, if benefit
it was. The picking of a president and a political leader
inside the government where these men could be thoroughly
tested and screened was a much better prospect. The under-
signed naturally explained at length that, according to the
old cliche, "variety is the spice of life," and that choice
is a born right. The undersigned said that he would never be
able to live in a place where he could pick his close
friends, his family companions, or the people scheduled to
represent him in the republic. That seemed to make no dent

Chief, SB
Chief of Station
Celebration of the Czech National Day,
9 May
1.
The celebration of the Czech national day on 9 May
was held at the residence of the Czech Ambassador, Karel HANUS,
in Polanco, where the undersigned estimated that the crowd
numbered at least 150 people. The only other Americans
present were Mr. Wallace W. STUART, head of the Political
Section, and Mr. David N. WIESLEY, Honorary Consul of Iceland.
The undersigned was a little bit surprised to see Rodolphe
BABOUN, the new Haitian Acting Ambassador, in attendance with
a colored Haitian. BABOUN, as a matter of fact, spoke briefly
to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.
'
2% The undersigned had several little discussions with
Jiri SVESTKA, Czech Consul and known intelligence officer.
When he casually reminded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakia was an
industrial power before World War I and that Czech products.
flooded Western Europe, SVESTKA, sharply commented that his
country was still an industrial power. When the undersigned
mentioned that MASARYK was very popular in the United States,
SVESTKA countered that that was no doubt because he had lived
as an exile in the United States. SVESTKA cut short a remark
by the undersigned about the effort currently being made to
throw light on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt
that he committed suicide." SVESTKA showed himself on this
occasion a rival of LOGINOV as far as provocations are
concerned. After the undersigned answered comments on the
Negro problem and forthcoming urban terrorism and guerrilla
warfare in the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the "overt
letter" to the American Ambassador which appeared in various
local newspapers. He hinted that the incident "described"

3. Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV
including references to the open letter against the Ambassador,
the war in Vietnam, the Negro problem, the difficult financial
position of the dollar, et cetera, was a reference to this
Station. LOGINOV at one point asked the undersigned where
he worked (not the first time he has asked this). The under-
signed told him that he worked in the Consular General's
Office. LOGINOV then said, "What about the fifth floor?"
The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both
the Ambassador's Office and the Political Section. LOGINOV
went on to say something like, "I know about the Ambassador
but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRM?"
The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously
found it very funny. He proceeded to pay back the Soviets a
little later by counting on his fingers the number of visas
issued at the Soviet Embassy each year, the number of cultural
exchanges handled by the Embassy staff, and "all the work
done for trade promotion with Mexico." The undersigned felt
tha the Soviets probably issued some five visas a month, if
that many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had
practically no trade with the Mexicans. What, then, he asked,
were the 40 odd "diplomats" in the Soviet Embassy doing in
Mexico? LOGINOV laughed, but he laughed green and promptly
broke off this conversation.

4. The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any
length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy at the
reception. The Ambassador, however, greeted him warmly and
gave him a prolonged bear hug as he left. The undersigned
had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which he
exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom he had not met before.

to be about 12 years old.
40 LOGINOV and his three companions shopped for about an
hour while Subject worked in his office, and in the end bought
450-500 pesos worth of merchandise (at wholesale prices, of
course). Subject and the four Russians then left together,
got into their respective cars, and drove to Subject's home with
Subject leading the way. When they were driving into Subject's
driveway, Subject, in view of his wife and two children and the
four Russians, accidentally ran over and broke the back of one
of the BESABERS! beloved dachshunds. Chaos reigned for the
next ten minutes as Subject went into the house, got his pistol,
and returned and shot the dog, while the children screamed, Mrs.
BESABER tried to suppress her own tears and shoo away the children
at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car
and watched. LOGINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to
console Mrs. BESABER and Subject. Mrs. BESABER recovered quickly,
however, and soon had all the adults seated in the living room.
Subject served the first round of drinks, and within a half hour
everyone was at least reasonably relaxed again.
5. LOGINOV wa's the only one who did not take an alcoholic
drink. He wore dark sunglasses all afternoon and explained that
he had to stay away from liquor because he was taking antibiotics
for an eye infection. Despite this ailment and inability to
take a drink, LOGINOV was nevertheless more sociable and friendly
than Subject had ever seen him. He also struck Subject as being

hadn't called or visited him at the Embassy, addressed Subject
only as "tu" (where he had formerly mixed "tus" and "usteds"
with Subject), enthusiastically toured the BESABERS' new house,
and patiently translated for the two Russian women, neither of
whom spoke Spanish or English. The conversation was generally
dull, however, and nothing even mildly controversial was
discussed. The Russians finally left about 1700.
6. In the course of the conversation, Mrs. BESABER asked
LOGINOV when they were ever going to get together to play tennis.
(Mrs. BESABER had of course previously invited LOGINOV to play
tennis with her sometime at the home of a retired American
gentleman in Cuernavaca (1.e., Col. Lawrence HIGGINS) who was a
good friend and who had an exceptionally good court.) LOGINOV
replied that he still wanted very much to play, but that it was
always a question of time for him. "Why didn't LOGINOV come down
to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning (11 May)?" Subject interjected.
He (LOGINOV) and Mrs. BESABER could play tennis in the morning while
Subject was working, and then they could all spend the afternoon
at home relaxing. LOGINOV replied that that sounded great, but
asked what he was going to do with his wife and child. Mrs.
BESABER answered that of course they expected him to bring Mrs.
LOGINOV and the child with him. LOGINOV said that would be

DATE OF MEETING: 16 May 1968
1. I met Subject in his room in the Del Paseo Hotel from
1415-1630. The next meeting will be arranged by telephone.
2. LOGINOV. Subject reported that LOGINOW called him at
his factory in Cuernavaca on Friday, 3 May. LOGINOV said he
had some visitors who would like to buy a few things to take
back with them to Russia and asked if it would be convenient if
he brought them down to Subject's factory on Saturday afternoon,
4 May. Subject said fine and invited LOGINOV and the visitors to
come back to his house for a few drinks after they finished
shopping. LOGINOV. gratefully accepted and said they would be
there at 1330. (Per LIENVOY--see attached transcript--LOGINOV
called BEWEEP on 3 May to ask for Subject's telephone number.)
3. LOGINOV arrived (in 19 DA, a dark blue Chevy) at the
factory at 1345 with three other persons:
(a) A big, fat, plain. peasant-looking woman by the
name of "IGOROVA." "IGANOVA." or something similar. LOGINOV
introduced her as a commercial representative, but did not
elaborate..
(b) A second Russian woman whose name Subject couldn't
remember. She looked to be 33-35 years old and wore glasses.
LOGINOV did not mention her profession, and she seemed simply
to be a friend of the first woman.

call you?" Well, replied LOGINOV, why didn't they leave it that
if he didn't hear from Subject, he would call Subject, and
vice versa.
Subject agreed.
:
7. Subject said he waited until Friday morning, 10 May,
to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called
LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENVOY). LOGINOV, according to Subject,
said he was afraid he was not going to be able to make it, after
all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico and he would
be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested
that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then.
LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then,
but, again, he couldn't say for sure just then. "But anyway,'
LOGINOV added, "we're going to be seeing each other more often
because we've (i.c., the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calla
Umbolt (in Cuernavaca) for the summer, and I'll be coming down
to Cuernavaca every weekend." Subject expressed pleasure at
this and said that he'd expect to hear from LOGINOV sometime
soon then. LOGINOV assured Subject he would.
8. BEWEEP. BEWEEP called Subject in Cuernavaca about 1400
on 10 May. He said he wanted to tell Subject that a Polish musical
group was about to open at Bellas Artes and would be playing some.
of Subject's grandfather's music. (Subject's paternal grandfather
was a pupil of Franz Liszt and, according to Subject, is generally
regarded in Poland as the second greatest Polish composer next
to Chopin.) BEWEEP asked if Subject was going to be in Mexico
City the following week and if he'd have time to accompany
BENFEP to Bellas Artes for a performance. Subject said that
unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to go, but suggested that

in the open lotter was not only a blunder on the part of
Ambassador FREEMAN, but also indicative of the superiority
"complex of the United States. At one point, when Valentin
LOGINOV had joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted
that the man who had written the article was a fourth-class
writer without a dime who somehow had found the thousands of
pesos necessary to place his editorial. When the Czech and
the Russian laughed, the undersigned continued that if the
Soviet Union wanted to give money to the Mexican Communist
Party to ongage in such shenanigans to amuse the local members.
of socialist countries, it was fine with the Americans, as
this is just about all it could hope to achieve.
and LOGINOV naturally denied that their countries had anything
SV ESTKA
to do with the Mexican Communist Party, not to speak of the
overt letter on the Ambassador. The undersigned, tongue in
cheek, thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for
their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.
Perhaps the most interesting reaction of SVESTKA came towards
the end of the party just before the undersigned left.
During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV, one e of
the Soviet military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair),
another Russian, and a youngish, short, and chubby member of
the Nexican Foreign Ministry the undersigned expressed a
thought that the two systems of government, the capitalist and
the soviet, were gradually inching closer together. When
SVESTKA allowed himself to doubt it with a nasty little laugh
the undersigned naturally could not resist telling him to
have a look at what was going on in his country. The reaction
of SVESTKA was both immediate and noticeable. He sort of
straightened out, jerked his head back, opened his mouth,
dropped the ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviously
bit his tongue as he said nothing. From the above and from
the fact that SVESTKA plans to drive to the next Consular
Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,
the undersigned feels that SVESTKA is not only a lackey of the
ex-NOVOTNY regime, but very probably in the employ of the
Soviet KGB. He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has
lately mouthed the same provocations in the same techniques,
showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he
was not a year ago.

Subject, if he knew any Boviets. Subject answered as casually
as he could that he had known one casually with whom he used to
go fishing and changed the subject. Subject didn't feel that
VIDIELLA was fishing for information but I am not so sure.

SUBJECT: Soviet Cultivation of British Subjects
1. It has come to our attention that the Soviets, specif-
ically KGB officers, have been looking around for English language
instructors. One KGB officer, Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV, is
notorious for using this tactic to assess contacts who may be of
use to him.
2. Among the persons in whom LOGINOV is reported to have
shown interest are two British subjects:

1. Subject is a 26 year old Mexican citizen (although he
looks to be in his 30's). He is a Spanish teacher at the Mexican-
North American Institute and since the fall of 1967 has held a
second job as the director of the Community Services Program
at the American School. In April 1967 he married an American
citizen from the Chicago area named Donna WEINTHALLER (phonetic).
They live at Juanacatlan 15, which is just around the corner
from the Soviet Embassy. Home phone is 15-28-49.

1. On the occasion of the visit of the local Consular
Association to the "Home Fair" on 28 March the undersigned con-
versed on and off with Jiri SVESTKA (P-7111), Second Secretary
of the Czechoslovak Embassy and known member of the Czech Intel-
ligence Service. The undersigned asked SVESTKA what was going
on in his country. The Czech launched into an explanation which
sounded like a recitation. The essence of his comments was that
when leaders have lost touch with the people, they should be re-
placed. The recent changes in Czechoslovakia would ensure more
democracy for the people and would more closely represent their
views and take care of their needs. Fifteen years in power, ho
said, is a long time for a leader. The undersigned pointed out
that the recent changes in Czechoslovakia might not please
"everybody", SVESTKA agreed that this was bound to happen, but
that his country had the right to do what it wanted without
worrying too much about the opinion of some of its neighbors.
The undersigned then went one step further and pointed out that
ULBRICH from East Germany for one seemed to be worried about
possible repercussion of the Czech reforms on his regime.
SVESTKA said he did not care what ULBRICH said or did and repeated
that the Czechs are masters of their country. When the undersigned
pointed out that the new president was not a member of the Com-
munist Party but had headed a Czech Division that fought with the
Russians SVESTKA agreed that this was a good choice that should
please a lot of people. Throughout his talk with the undersigned,
however, SVESTKA tried to play down the degree to which things are
going to change in his country as a résult of recent reforms.
2. Just to test SVESTKA a little further, the undersigned
asked him what he thought of the U.S. elections. With a broad
grin SVESTKA stated that Senator KENNEDY would undoubtedly be
the next president. When the undersigned replied that he hoped
not, SVESTKA said, "If I were an American I would vote for him.'
Valentin LOGINOV of the Soviet Embassy joined the conversation
at this point. The two went on to say that KENNEDY was the only
candidate for peace and social justice, that be had their moral.
support and sympathy (this given reports for an intel. report)
etc. SVESTKA added that the war in Vietnam was good for the U.S.
economy. The undersigned told him that the USSR manufactured
more rockets than bathtubs and more machine guns than cars.

certain things."

LOG: "OK, until the next then."
6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was
probably talking about Subject, since:
:
(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North
American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had
GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted
with GAZIYÉV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject
an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although
Subject told me he had not gone).
!
(b) Subject had gotten married that month.
(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.
(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.
(e) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800
to teach evening Spanish classes.
7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had
considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEV,
but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was
developing into something more than occasional chats between
classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject
before this with there the idea of having him deliberately
cultivato a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject was living

4. Subject and I from the beginning have had a very friendly
and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a

Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union.
We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong
anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in
the United States. The brother is married to an American and
lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business.
One of the sisters is also married to an American and lives in
California (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.
The sister in California is a naturalized American citizen. The
brother and the sister in Chicago are not.
5. On 24 April 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call

from GAZIYEV to LOGINOV:
GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday."

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very little out
of him. Prior to his marriage, he was keeping such a hectic
schedule between his Institute and private classes that he
wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing
problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
job with the American School (although he gave up most of his
private classes).
8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's
relations with the Soviet's look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about them from Subject. For a number
of reasons, however--including my going to the States in June--
we were not able to get together until 11 July. On that date
I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little
Spanish restaurant downtown.
+
9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would
voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had
developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation
around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV
was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,
as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that
they never talked politics. In reply to an offhand question
about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject

I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been

never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.
10. On 1 November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother
Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a
quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and
would like my advice. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to

El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security"
department” about his predicament. What did I think he should
do?
11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that it was entirely his own business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a
"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know
how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S.
Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of

13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our
home on 27 November, but the evening was not meant to and did
not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.
Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the
7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by
assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he
felt it was simply safer to stay away from the Soviet Embassy
altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for
lunch sometime in the near future.
14. For various reasons, including the poor state of
Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did
not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I
played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisfied he answered
my questions to the best of his ability. It seemed to me, and
still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject
had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on
11 November (i.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and
on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that
he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting
the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too
hard (which I didn't on 11 July), he felt more comfortable
ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits
and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was
genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

When I
15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to
Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place
about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find
only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third
person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV
introduced the third person as Valentin "something."
asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted
and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description
of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV: GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was
with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and
described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually, with LOGI NOV expressing interest.
in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.
LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject if
he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to
start with, etc. Subject replied that he'd be happy to, although
it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
LOGINOY would drop around to the Institute sometimo soon.
LOGINOV, who took the lead in the conversation most of the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject

with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to feel Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember
most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory
remarks about the extent of American influence in Mexico. Subject
said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
# 100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely
no sympathy with Communism. (While this sounds awfully blunt
and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
in my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be *** a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,
I would not put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
said that LOGI NOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the Soviets were
up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda.”.
16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics
were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.

Subject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him, but
on the whole kept his composure very well and treated Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subject remained. As Subject
was leaving, LOGINOV again said he'd come by the Institute to
see Subject in the near future, but he never did. One day in
late 1967 Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by

name.
17. Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically..
related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject
returned to Mexico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner (this would place the second dinner in
about mid-May). This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only
others present, and the evening passed without any reference
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes
across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV between
evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been
to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his
home.
18. Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose
in meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem
to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for
LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I
spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV
was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I
also explained that it was very possible GAZIYEV was using the
Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Embassy
refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.
After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to
the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very
serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the proper Embassy
department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had
told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.
i
12.
Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject the
invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYEV was
now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartment

that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
(Subject) got married (Subject was married about mid-April
1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he
and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. Subject finished
eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had
his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's
activities and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said
that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself
at the Institute and did not have any particular friends there
whom Subject knew about. Subject said he would keep his eyes
open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would
let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to" GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance
if I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions
of appreciation.
;
19. The question that remains unanswered after all this is,
of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject
over the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while
LOGI NOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took
place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the
truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV
told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV
concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-
Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on
24 Aprii, it would appear that it was finally decided that
GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife
over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase
the memory of the first dinner.

French Club. My wife talked to Loguinov at the French Club. There seemed
to be considerable doubt about their communication. Loguinov might have said
that she had just played tennis, or was about to play tennis, or plays tennis
occasionally. It seems likely that she did not play and was not about to play.
The probably came to the club for the stean bath. She was in a hurry, possibly
to leave the club.

COMMENT
It is possible that Mrs. Loguinov and Mrs. Small are part of a communications
channel. Loguinov's haste night have been due to the unexpected appearance of
my wife and the risk that Small might arrive while my wife mata was still in the
vicinity.

Valentin's friends, June 30, 1967.
Contact. My lawyer celobrated his 40th birthday on June 30.
Jin and Connie Pollack offered their home at Calero 76 in San
Angel for a party for my lawyer. Of the 12 to 14 people at the
party the following are part of a group who have organized a
Great Books type club. At least once, and possibly twice or
three times they have invited Valentin Loguinov.

in the directory. He since has moved back to Aida in San Angel
and lives one or two doors from Timmie Davis. He is listed
as vice-president of Jeffrey Manufacturing. He is reported to
have studied at Oxford.
My lawyer, who is one of the more brilliant humorous-type
intellectuals in Mexico has described Werner as the most
brilliant person he has met in Mexico. Werner's friends are
agreed, behind his back, that Werner is "ill-cuployed", that
he is earning far less than he deserves. His standard of living
stikes his friends as austero.

2. During the week of 3 September, PRIKHODKO came to
Subject's office to announce that he was back from home
leave. Subject asked him about the status of the proposed Soviet
tourist office. PRIKHODKO said that the Mexican Government had
turned it down. Specifically SALVAT had told the Soviets that
the tourist exchange between the Soviet Union and Mexico was
so insignificant that it did not justify a reciprocal exchange
of tourist offices (Comment: Evidentally the Mexicans used
the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet request.)
3. PRIKHODKO also said that Oleg NECHIPORENKO (P-7442)
would arrive in Mexico in October and that he would have a
job in the Embassy, not in the consulate.

Subject: Valention LOGINOV Bio Sketch by LIPACON-1
Remarks:
1.
-
Concerning the problems which Log has with his colleagues
LIBACON-1 was not able to offer specific examples. In at least 3
instances LCG spoke to 1-1 that the psychological atmospher within
the Sov Embassy is horrible and depressing. LG stated that there was
not a single person in the Embassy in which one can confidet everybody
is ready to cut otherones throat just to advance; if there is nothing
the colleagues can pin against a person they start intriguing hoping
that one might lose his temper and commit something stupid which
would be sufficient to harm the person involved: if ones asks for
advise he would in no time find out that he was considered incompetent.
In Fall 1963 L-1 invited LOG to attend a party and told him
that Yuriy CHERNISH (P-13,042) would be there. LOG stated that he
would not come, because it would mean or getting himself in trouble
or getting CHERNISH in trouble; to keep away from Sov colleagues is
the only of keeping out of troubles, concluded LCG.
2.
With regard to the statement that LCG was commiting errore
by exterting pressure on other people L-1 stated that he reported
LOGB renewed attempt to recruit Niguel Angel. In doing so LCG abandoned,
his tact and ignored the sensitivity of the other person; LOG talk
to L-1 in Cuautla tock place in less than a month from LOG's pitch to
Miguel Angel; the way LCG spoke to L-1 made it evident that LOG dis-
regarded ops security rules. Such things did not happen before and
I-1 concluded that 101 rent all out to achieve some success Wefore
he leaves 305 "cost what it may".
When: 1-1 stated that he believed that 10 would be a good
perron Ander normal conditions, he meant that he believed that 10 ie
basically a good person and would be acting and behaving as a good
preson in his normal environment, i.e.. if he remained as a musik on

felt it was highly overplayai. My opinion was that this was a

1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo from 1415-1530.
Subject will call me a day in advance to set the date of the
next meeting, which as usual will be in the Del Paseo.
2.
Subject had not seen or talked with CHMYKHOV or any
other Soviet since he and CHMYKHOV were out together on the evening
of 4 August. At that time, CHMYKHOV suggested that he and Subject
have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City.
Subject agreed and told CHMYKHOV he'd call him the next time
he was in town. Due to Subject's tight schedules on his visits
to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called
CHMYKHOV. When Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told
CHMYKHOV wasn't in. He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved
to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and
sounded very pleased to hear from him. He stated that he had
had a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August),
but was now swamped with work. He added that he had planned to
call Subject as soon as he got things under control. Subject
thereupon said that he was actually calling for CHMYKHOV, because
he didn't think LOGINOV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied
that CHMYKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd both very much like
to visit Subject in Cuernavaca. Subject said that he'd like to
have them, but suggested they hold off for a week or so until the
weather got better. LOGINOV agreed and said he'd talk to CHMYKHOV

not their affair and would be handled by Gobernacion.
6. David KLEINMAN, ca 55 yrs. old, born in Russia recently
made reservations to go to Moscow during the celebration of
the 50th anniversary. He will go in a private capacity as
tourist. Subject described him as an orthodox Communist and

with nothing and ended up very wealthy. Several years ago
he attempted to negotiate trade between Mexico and Rumania
but without results. He died of a heart attack about two years

a wine and cheese importing company. On ca. 1 September she
left Mexico to some "bad" in Austria for a month. At Source's
suggestion she added 2 weeks in Israel to view the conquest.

only be to get their business. She would not find Soviets

3. Subject had lunch with LOGINOV on 31 August.
brought him caviar which Subject had requested and paid for.
The following Subjects came up:
a.
LOGINOV volunteered that NECHIPORENKO (P-7442)
will return to Mexico in the fall. Subject asked if NECHIPORENKO
would return to Consular work. LOGINOV said that he would not
but would have other work in the Embassy. (Comment: I will
bet that he replaces YATSKOV).
b. The larger part of the lunch was devoted to
LOGINOV asking Subject about his trip to Israel and Subject's
gleeful lists of captured Soviet equipment.
C.. LOGINOV said he has reports that Mexican right
wing youth groups are planning to sabotage the celebration
of the 50th Anniversary of the Revolution and asked Subject
for information. Subject said he had no information on, or,
contacts with groups of that nature.
3. The following Mexicans have booked travel to the USSR

Thus,
LOGINOV is also in charge of making up a duty roster
for appointing a Man on Eity who would be responsible for
anything that took place at the Embassy on that particular
day. No one, except the ambassador, seems to be exempt from
that duty. On a few ocessions LOGINOV encountered hostility
to his arbitrary manner of making up the duty roster.
when a Man on Duty called Nikolay Sergeyevich LEONOV. Press
Attache and a (former?) Cultural Officer, and told him that
LOGINOV put his name down as the pesponsible Man on Duty for
the Embassy for that day, LEONOV said that he was very busy

HITN is also quite active in consular affairs and does most
of the leg work for LOGINOV. He is also very active in
Hesthom functions, where he is in charge of the Children's
section. KORMUSHKIN is quite an energetic and
pushy individual and can be quite rude and nasty at times.
Undoubtedly, he is looking forward to boing a full-fledged
consul in time to come. The impression of KORMUSHKIN'S am-
bition and pushy trait in his character is intensified by the
sound of his rapid and energetic but pleasant baritone voico.
A curious pict should be sited here. Shortly after his
arrival, KORUSHIN purchased a tape-recorder for 185 dollars
or 70 dollars more than the one bought by his "boss" LOGINOV.
Why?
It seems that in the futuro, KOPMUSHKIN may slow down
somewhat, but his innor drive and energy will nevertheless
make him a more adroit and skillful individual. His further
progress should be watched with interest and caution.

With such a seeming-scarcity of work for the Congulate,
it would be sufficient to have only one man forit. But the
Soviet Embassy has to have three men handling consular duties.
The Consulate is open to visitors twice a weck and only two
hours a day. Even that is too much for an occasional person
who desires a visa for visiting the USSR. However, in addi-
tion to their regular duties, the consuls have to arrange
various matters relating to visiting Soviet cargo vessels,
artistic and cultural groups, etc. On several occasions,
they had to do iz errands outside of their overt field of
activity. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why, in many
instances, they cannot be reached on the telephone. All
three of them speak fluent Spanish and have no difficulty in
getting around and acquiring Mexican friends. Given below
are their respective character sketches.

His positive reaction to the idea of talki 05 Me older"
can would seem to be confirmation of this.
(p. 6) While no future meeting was scheduled, Subject and CCHARY
pusted on the 16th with the mutual understanding that Subject would get in
touch with GOHARY either to discuss further COWARY's'business future or to
arrange a meeting with Subject's American friend.

that Mr. HIGGINS would return to Xexico sometime during the week of
5. Subject said that he thought a sizable amount of money--such
as $1,200 U.S. per month, would be a vital, although not the primary, factor
in recruiting OGOHARY to remain in place. The prime incentive, in Subject's
view, would obviously be the opportunity to help Egypt.
4. Contact with the Soviets. CHAKHOV called Subject at home about
1000 on Sunday morning. 16 July. CHRHOV said he was at the Soviet dacha
in Cuernavaca and that he and LOGINOV had gone to Subject's factory about 1700
on Saturday, the 15th, in order to present Subject with three bottles of vodka,
but the guard had told them Subject had left. (Subject said he left the factory
about 1630.) CHURCHOV said that LOGINIOW had left Cuernavaca because he was
leaving for the USSR on vacation, but he (CHAYAHCY) was still around and
could Subject come over to the dacha. And oh, yes, CHARHOT's child was
sick with some form of dysentery and could Subject recommend a pediatrician?
Subject said that desnite the uncivilized hour, he got dressed and went over
to the dacha about 1100. CHOKHOY was overflowing with friendship, kept
urning everyone from the smallest child to the oldest woman to go up and say
hello to ir ER, and neckly presented Subject with one bottle of vodka.

Subject by the time I saw him to lead him to decide to tell CIDNIGHT, when he
called him at the Embassy, to come to the Del Pasco (Subject's hotel) rather
than the Presidente, where clients and acquaintances might frown at all his
Soviet friends. I told Subject to handle it the way to wanted, but just
not to bring no a restaurant bill for six balleiras and their escorts.
told Subject that his near-term objective should be simply to establish es
much rapport with CHOV as possible, with the view to finding out what
kind of pebson he is and what he has on his mind. I said he should consider
CHMINHOV his main target for the present time and urged him to take advantage
of any opportunity to get together with him alone.

MEDRANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telecon with LIROBBIN-2 on 12 July 1967
P-11665
1. LIROBBIN-2 called the Station at 1345 on 12 July and left a message
for me to call her. I reached her about an hour later. She said she had
meť LOGINOV at a party at the Indian Embassy on the evening of 11 July.
Puring a brief conversation with him, he told her he was going to the Soviet
Union on vacation on 16 July. He also said that PRIKHODKO was going to
the USSR on vacation on 26 July. A minute later, he said PRIXHODKO was
leaving on 29 July.'
2.
Subject said he had had no other contact with any of the Soviets
since March. (It' will be recalled that she invited PRIKHODKO to dinner'
on 31 March, but he did not come.) Subject said she would call PRIKHODKO
in a few days, mention that LOGINOV had said he was going on vacation, and
invite him over before he left. She will let me know what happens.

that they had drunk the other two bottles. At 1115 or
so, Sorists benan suriving at the däcka in droves; Subject estimated 20 men and
15 women arrived in all. One of the newcomers to walk in was ANDREYEV,
ho seemed to be greatly surprised to sec Subject and to learn that Subject and
QHXIDOY knew each other. Subject stayed for about 40 minutes in all. CHAHOV
stayed with him the entire time and talked incessantly--mostly about nothing
and often so rapidly that Subject had a hard time understanding his faulty
Spanish.
5. In speaking of LCGINOV, CHMYKHOV did say that LOGINOV is responsible
for "matters inside Xexico," while he (CHMYKHOV) "supervised Latin American countries
outside Mexico." CHIAHOV did not elaborate on or give any hint as to what kind
12 "matters" he xas talking about. As Subject was leaving, CHAHOV urged
him to come to the Exbassy the next time he was in Mexico City and they would
have a few drinks. CHERHOV then said that as a matter of fact he was coming
back to Cuernavaca the next weekend and would like to see Subject then.
Subject said to give him a call. (NOTE: Subject is unusually busy right now
because of his approaching trip to the U.S.--in about two weeks, but told me
he would try to get together with CHAHOV for a drink. I urged him to do
this.) In all, Subject said he had the impression from CHICKHOV's general
deportment that LOGINOT had told him to look after Subject while he (LOGINOV)
was gone.
6. Communist Activity in the State of Morelos. Subject said that Cesar
IR, the Jefe de Investigaciones of the Policia Judicial in Cuernavaca
came by his here on the evening of 17 July to ask about a room-divider screen
made of the turquoise mosaic material that Subject's factory specializes
in. I told Subject that he'd prefer "not to pay too much for it," and
Subject being Subject and also hoping we might make it up to him, obliged

de complexion atlética, alto.
Fisicamente
Juega muy bien al tenis. Recientemente
quedó en segundo lugar en el campeonato del D.F. que tuvo lugar
en el Clue Francia, donde practica este deporte.
Cuida muchisimo
su condición fisica y más que nada su apariencia. En este sentido
es muy vanidoso. Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una hija de
16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tiene hijos hable solo de su
hijo de 11 años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es
muy amable y buena, porque se ve de mis edad que él. No fuma, toma

muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasion requiere de tomar mucho agucenta
y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amable en el trato. Nunca trata
de imponer sus ideas, pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las

rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto.

En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Union
Soviética y la última, linea a seguir del Partido. Eso quiere decir
que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue fidelisimamente la "linea" porque
sabe muy bien què es la única formá rápida y eficaz de escalar en
su carrera Le gusta muchisimo la vida buena, tipo occidental,
aunque antes se dejaria cortar un brazo que confesarselo asi mismo.
Es muy ambicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus compañeros de
trabajo. Habla despectivamente de ellos. No le gusta nada la idea
de teper que permanecer en Mosco lcs dos años que vienen. 2 dijo
que haría lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de
preferencia otra vez a México. Su ilusión mas grande es trabajar
en España. Adora a los españoles. La forma de ser de los mejicanos
no le gusta. Por eso si quiere regresar, quiere decir que prefiere
cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos Rusia. Creo que precisamente

Valentin invited our tennis group to be his
guests at the final performace of the Ballets Ruso
at the Arena Mexico. The total group was about
15 persons.
Alexandra not present. Val's wife, Alexandra, was
not among the group. Val made no comment about why
she was not there. No one else asked, that I know of.
Czechs. Three Czechs were among the group. The
introductions were badly handled and I wasunable to

Odila Mauricee. (Spelling not certain for last name).
Odile was invited by val. She is Canadian, about 35, not
unattractive, but careless in her dress. She struck me
s being slightly masculine. She is a teacher of French
the mornings at the University of the Americas. In
the afternoons she teaches at an Institute for Transla-
tors and Interpreters on Rio Tiber.
We were waiting for a mutual friend of Odile and val,
a Rafael. He never arrived, I asked Odile who Rafael was.
She explained that he was a teacher and her drinking
buddy. Every afternoon around 4 -5 she and Rafael can
be found in the bar across the street from the institute.
Odile had been drinking beer, probably quite a bit,
prior to joining us that evening. She has lived in
Mexico for 15 years. Her French, English and Spanish
are fluent. She seemed to prefer French, though I felt
her English was better.

the Boviet Embassy. Two men were in it whom I did not recognize.
6. LILYRIC has LOGINOY and BARANOV leaving the Soviet
Embassy in LOGINOV's car at 15:36 on 8 March. Neither were
back by 18:30 when LILYRIC secured. I instantly recognized
BARANOV's photos as the Soviet with the camera.
7. Also per LILYRIC, LOGINOV left the Embassy in his car
at 09:41 and returned on foot at 10:51. This was the period we
were waiting for Subject. However he could not have seen me
at the Hotel Prince since I left there at 09:50 the first time
and at 10:40 the second time.

noticed nothing unusual. I was outside the Hotel Alfer from

2. I checked the Hotel Prince at 16:50 and saw two women
and two men (Soviets) talking in the lobby. Then at the Hotel
Alfer from 16:55 to 17:40. Nothing except a man at 17:30 who
looked very European. This mau looked into the lobby of the
hotel, then into the adjacent garage, then back to the hotel
then out of the area. He definitely was not a local Soviet.
S.
At 17:40 I went back to the Hotel Prince to see if the
entertainers were there. At 17:50 two men left who could be
Soviets. I followed them to ses if they were speaking Russian.
I turned the corner from Luis Hoya onto Juarez going east, I
almost bumped into LOGINCY who was coming west on Juarez. I
recognized him immediately and I felt that he recognized me.
I continued along Juarez for a bit and then came back to see
where LOGINOV weat. I then stood on the other corner of Juarez
and Luis maior 3 or 4 minutes. At this time I noticed a
Soviet across Juarez (at the west side of the Juares monument).
He looked like KOLONYAKOV but with too much hair. This Soviet
was taking panoramic shots across Juarez. As his camera
approached me, I stopped behind a kiosk. However, in the minutes
before I noticed him, he could have been photographing as. A
moment later I noticed LOGINOV about 10 yards from the Soviet.
Both saw that I had spotted them. The Soviet with the camera
then drifted west, photographed the Juares monument and went
further west. LOGINOV then went off in the same direction. I
then went to report the above to CLASTONBURY at the Hotel Alfer
after checking that I was not followed. I got there at 18:02.

Same place, same time, 19/2/68.
No administrative matters discussed.
5. Information/Instructions Passed to Agent:
Rowton advised LINEALM/1 to continue his same. line
with his friend Valentin Loguinov. He agreed with
LINEALM/1 that since Loguinov did not bring up the
matter of his "boss" since his first reference to it
at 27/1/68 at the French Club, Loguinov probably has
not given further thought to the matter. (Loguinov
had two opportunities to bring the matter up again
with LINEALM/1 and did not do so).
Howton also advised LINEALN/1 to continue to push
LINELIC/1 into the PRI but agreed that in the light
of the current uncertainty as to whom might emerge
as the future leader, LIRELIC/1 should not attach
himself too firmly to any one individual, but rather
await the outcome of the 27/2/68 convention.
6. Information/Reports Given to Case Officer by Agent:
LIREALE/1 gave Rowton his reports 050/JF and 051/JF,
attached herewith, together with the latest LIRELIC/1

know of is the ROESTROM couple that Len asked the policeman to
check on. Is the case active? What requirements are being given to
the policeman by LGINOV? Are any Americans involved? Have any other
Soviets been involved? LOGINOV specialises in US operations. He
may be giving the policeman assignments in support of his US operations.
Please check this with 12 and 4 and let us know what the status is.

DIZES OF MEETINGS: 11 and 19 January 1968
1. I met Subject in his room at the Del Paseo Hotel from
1415-1545 on 11 January and from 1415-1515 on 19 January. The
next meeting will be arranged by telephone.
2. The Soviets. As of 19 January, Subject had not seen or
talked with any of the Soviets since his telephone conversation
with LCGINOV on 28 September. Subject did, however, receive a
Christmas card from LOGINOV. With my agreement, Subject sent
inexpensive gifts along with Christmas cards to LCGINOV and
CHRYKHOV, but they weren't delivered until the week of 15
January. Subject explained that before Christmas, he assigned
his salesman the job of delivering a score of Christmas gifts,
including LOGINOV'S and CHMYKHOV'S, around town, but shortly
after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any
of them. This discovery caused Subject to fire the salesman,
who had been increasingly derelict in performing his job over
the past few months and who, Subject had recently learned, had
begun taking dope. Subject consequently wrote "better-late-than-
never” notes on the cards accompanying the undelivered gifts and
had his new salesman deliver them. I have instructed Subject to
leave the initiative for the next contact up to the Soviets.
3. Soliman CCHARY. Subject ran into GOHARY on the street

24 August 1967
C/SB
Policeman Recruited by LOGINOV
1. In reviewing LOGINOV's SPR which WEENING has just
completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited this policeman
1519 months ago and that his first requirement was on the
BOESTROM couple. At that time we gave LITEMPO-8 traces on
LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer.
LITEMPO-8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued
and that he, himself, was directing it.
2. If you think that LITEMPO-8 will cooperate, I would
like to know the following about this case;
3.
(a)
Is it still active?
(b) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV
on the BOESTROM couple? If so, what?
there any follow-up?
(c)
Was
What type of requirements has LOGINOV
given to the policeman? Are any Americans
involved?
(d) Have any other Soviets been involved with
this case?
Wino
(e) Who is handling him while LOGINOV is in the
USSR on vacation (he left Mexico on 16 July 29 and returned.
5. A.)
>
As a basis for discussing this case you could mention
that we are especially concerned about LOGINOV because he
specializes in US operations. He tried to recruit a chauffer
at the Embassy and tried to develop a female Foreign Service
Officer (true). You might also say he is running a sensitive
case into the US (false). Thus many of his requests to the
policeman may be in support of American operations although
this would not necessarily be apparent. Therefore we would
like to know what he is asking for. Our traces would help
both ourselves and LITEMPO-8, etc.

4. Depending on LITEMPO-8's reaction, you might even
suggest that LITEMPO-8 take advantage of LOGINOV's absence from
Mexico in the USSR to request Relacciones not to give him a
new visa because of his intelligence activity as detailed by
LITEMPO-8.

Source stated that Subject is the sister-in-law of
his old friend Lic. Juan #SALDAÑA who used to be in Relac-
ciones and is now Sub Director General of Accion Social of
the Departamento del D.F. Subject is the sister of SALDAÑA's
wife, Fernanda and is 24 years old.
3. A few weeks ago SALDAÑA brought Subject to Source
asking the latter to give Subject a job. Subject told
Source that she had formerly worked at UNAM and had been
arrested in a group which had bombed the Bolivian Embassy in
Mexico. She was held and interrogated but because of SALDAÑA's
influence, she was released after 2 months without charges.
However, the police refused to let her work at UNAM and told
her that they would have to approve any job she undertook.
She still has to report to the police every 3 days. Subject
told Source her story because she know that the police would
check with him.

arose between KORNYUMIN and HAZANTSEV over what the official Soviet
position was during the 1964 Cyprus crisis. (I/1 could not recall the
substance over what they differed on). 1/1 then queried them as to what
the official position was on the propent crisis. They both replied that

Oporntional Meeting/1 (P-1)
DADE OP HORING: 24 November 1967
i. The undersigned met with moc/1 on 24 November from
1200 hours to 1545 hours at an in-town safe house. From 105 to
1245 the meeting was conducted in 1/1's car inasmuch as the safe
house was occupied during this period. The next meeting is scheduled
for the same safe house on 8 December at 1500. hours.
2. The following meetings between 1/1 and the below named Soviets
occured during the months of October and November:
2. Classes of 3 October: BEDRIN (P-9037) and CONCHARENKO
(P-9379) studied on this day from 1530 to 1700. KAZANTSEV (P-880)
studied from 1700 to 1800.
C.
IKO
b. Classes of October: In the morning of this day, an
unidentified Soviet phoned Mrs. ROCKET (L/1 was out of the house) and
requested her to inform L/1 that there would be no classes that day.
No reason was given, either then or subsequently, for this cancellation.
Classes of 10 October: BEDRIN & Concharenko studied from
1530 to 1700. KAZANTSEV came at 1610, interrupting class, to pick up
several pocket books which he had previously asked L/1 to procure for
him. L/1 selected them from his own library. KAZANESEV stated that
he did not care what subjects were chosen; he wanted them only to improve
his reading ability. He did mention, however, that he preferred not to
read books which had either violence or pornorraphy as their central theme..
1/1 brought a book on science fiction (Kaz. was not particularly interested
in this), a book on ballet, and a book on the FBI/Which KAZÁNOSEV seemed
very interested. NANOLY said that he would not be taking class today
and that they would all discontinue clitses after 12 Oct.

b. Classes of 14 November: 1/1 met GOLOVCO who gave him two
tickets for the Ice Ballet, BIDRI and GOTCHARIZIKO entered at 1530. At
1620 HIZANTSDV entered and interrupted the class to announce that he would
not study that day. Iiitely BIDRIN wheeled around and told IAZANTSEV
very explicitly that he should remain and study. To this KAZAITSEV replied
in English, "See the pressure my Chief puts on me!" It was quite apparent
that DEDZIN was in charge of the language lessons and that KAZANİSCV was
seemingly very hesitant to defy DRIN's challenge. (C.O. note: This

ALIZANTEDY finally remained during the rest of the class, although his
presence was a somewhat disruptive factor. CONCHARZIKO, who had remained
silent for the most part, became somewhat bored and dispirited by HAZANTSEV's

6'1" in height, 160-165 pounds, grey hair and thin-faced (angular).
11/1, emboldened by a few vodas, requested two tickets for the Ice Ballet
from GOLOVCO. COLOVCO politely acquiesced and said he would get two of the
best seats. I/1 was then introduced to the assistant director and the
director of the orchestra by COLOVCO who translated in a seemingly suave
manner. With this show of friendliness on the part of the Soviets, W/1
decided to invite them all to his house for a buffet supper within the
next few weeks. GOLOVC and his associates were visibly pleased and
L/1 also extended the invitation to BODRIN. BODRIN said he would try and
make all the arrangements and a tentative date of 9 or 10 December was
agreed upon. 1/1 was then introduced to the Ethiopian Ambassador,

Tennis. Logunov and I played doubles with two women. Everyone sound to
permit themselves to tease Loguinov about the embassy's celebration of the
50th anniversary and about the mumerous requests that everyone seemed to
have made for gifts and souvenirs fron Russia. Val has singel up for a tourna❤
ment of mixed doubles which begins tomorrow. I too have been invited and accepted...
Attitude. Loguinov seemed very friendly and anxious to continue our friendship.
His motives, however, seem strictly for tennis.
Companion. Earlier I saw Loguinov playing tennis with a rather tall and
heavy sot person who left when Loguinov approached my wife and se. Later,
when dressed, this person passed by to say goodbye to Loguinov, in Russian.
He is obviously an embassy type.

1.
The meet was prearranged and S came on time. The purpose of the
meet was to debrief S on his meet with 100 which took place the pre-
vious evening and proceed with the filling of the PAQ as well as to
give necessary opt instruction. The purpose was achieved.
2.
•
Next meet: August 19 at the same time end place.
The fact that LOC started the meet with a talk about books
appeared to S to be curious. No doubt that LOG was peddling some Communtt
ideological tid bits, especially, justification of Sov International
policy. Friefly, too much freedom is not good: Americans and their foreign
policy is naive: they worry more about the world opinion than about
their national intercet; if they meat to in something they consult every-
body and everything to find out an ages old 'act that no by can satisfy
everybody; Nixons trip to Rumania was outrigh a provocation aimed at
Sov Union, except, if it was a product of naiveness.

other to appease his (5) own fear from the mere possibility that something
might go wrong and he would have nowhere to turn to. F told him that
going to TANG ONLY in connection with the matter of publishing the orticle
could do him no harm; denying having contact with LCG recently is not
sufficient; TANG could bring up the question for an estensive purpose
of wanting to send a message to 9 Sov friend and the fact of not seeing
each other during the past 2 3 weeks means nothing messe-nothing, be-
cause S is supposed to be able to reach a friend; S must be ready to
meet any question by TANG not by denying previous statements but by
emphasizing that he was thinking carefully about what he told TANC and
he reached the conclusion that that would gettixx him in a situation
in
he was never before, and, consequently, knows nothing about possible con-
sequences; therefore, he decided to keep out a field he is ignorent in.
As for as the other requirements concerning the chinese are
concerned, 7. told to do nothing for the time being and, especially,
to keep way from trying to ascertain the armes of Mexicans working in

and they spoke about the book. LOG promised to give 8 another book, witten
a a British, titled "USSR 1941-45" or similar. LOG wants 8 to be
familiar with the suffering of Bcv people during the WW II.

TANG was a member of the Ohinese Emb staff here, because he did not find
his name in the diplomatic list. Further, he told S that he was doing a
good job, which he appreciated, but he must be very cautious because the
Chinese are clever people and extremely suspicious.
6.
In reply to S'question LOG stated that h for anyone of them (Sov
Emb official) would meet with TANG, because that it too dangerous. $ que-
ried what was dangerous about it and LOG stated that there was always
a chance that they (TANG and LOG or another Sov) might be seen together
and that would be very bad. S went on to tell S that it would be his
job to develop friendly relations with TANG ot possibly another Chinese
official and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and his embassy needed;
LOG will guide him as to how to go about it and if they show confidence
in S he will have it made and Sove (LOG used the expression: WE ) would
pay him very well for that job. & commented that he had believed that
what he was doing he did out of personal friendship with LOG and not
for money. LOG smiled at $' statement and added that in addition to meney
they (Sovs) enable S to travel to Eov Union and have a vacation on the
Black Sea.
7.
While 6 was thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, LOG
told him that the next time he went to TANG he should limit his conv
to the publishing of the article about Nat Ohina and if needed deny
that he had any contact with his Sov friend (LOG) since he met TANG; S'
job is to win TANGS confidence and that is a slow process with the
Ohinese. Then, in answer to LOGB question 8 stated that there were to
Mexicana ( a woman and a man ) working at the Chinese Emb. LOG told him
to get their names and addresses. $ commented that this was not se simple
as it mounded, because one cannot just ask a person what was his name
and address. LOG commented that even this was a matter which cannot be
rushed, first get their names and later obtain the address:

There was another thing & should dot find out how many Ohinese
live in Mexico Oity and detereined whichones were the influentialone and
among the latterones determine which are the most influential; he can
start working on this by dropping in a better Chinese restaurant and

forward to the fact that his son will be obliged to speak english all

her and Josephine to understand each other. S promised to be there.

Subject mentioned near the close of the meeting that he owed me
$600 (US) for the TV set which COIGNE had obtained for him. I said
that I thought this was a gift but Subject said no, he insisted on
paying for it and would do so shortly. Meanwhile, a part has burned
out and he can not obtain a replacement in Mexico because this
particular model is not made in Mexico. He will call in with the
details and I will try to get it for him.
6. Information/Instructions passed agent:

7. Report/Information received from agent: (use back if necessary)
Subject had been in Europe and Israel for several weeks since
our last meeting. Nothing of particular interest developed on this
trip.
Before he left, Subject was invited by NECHIPCRENKO (P-7442) to
celebrate the latter's birthday (which happens to be 4 July). Subject
tried to beg off but NECHIPORENKO refused to take no for an answer
and actually came to Subject's apartment with KOSTIKOV to bring
Subject to NECHIPORENKO's apartment. Since NECHIPORENKO's wife was
away, three girls from the Pianitsky Chorus were awaiting the three
men. Considerable drinking was done and Subject said it was obvious
why they had asked him since the third girl needed a partner. Her namo
was Nina BUCHAROVA. Subject said that all of the girls were quite
attractive and "available for anything." Subject said that he under-
stood that most of the girls in the Chorus fit this category and that
they would simply wait until their housemother was asleep before
going out and getting some action.
Subject and NECHIPORENKO actually have a good personal relationship.

usuallu influential. & agreed with LOG and expected LCG to tell him that
he would pay for the visiting of Ohinese restaurants, but LOG kept
quiet.
9.
S had no intention to skip the talk about money and he told him
that the publishing of the article about Nat China may end in a blind alley
if TANG does not supply at least a half a page of advertising. LOG did
not want that to happen and he told S that he (LOG) would give him
MN 1,000.- if the printing of the article should be held because of lack
of advertising. 5 brought to LOGS attention that half of page of advertising
brings to Pierre (RUDIAN) 1.500.- pesos. LOG felt that he would pay that
money as a price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for S. To
put some coating on the pill & added that he would try to obtain an ad
or two from Ohinese restaurants, but he daoubted that the owners would
be interested in advertising in a magazine which is far from being well
known. Just the idea that $ conteplated going to Ohinese restaurants
pleased LOG's ear.
10.
LOG was interested in the status of the Presidential race and
8 told him that it narrowed down to four candédates and that all the
indications were in the direction that ECHEVARRIA was to be the official
PRI candidate. S believed that by Aug 20 he would know the name of the
candidate. In reply to LOG's question S stated that the candidate will
be publically known Sept. 15-20.
11.
LOG wanted to give more time to be positive of the name of the
Presidential candidate and he decided that their next (business) meet would
be on Aug 25 at the same ring and place. LOG immediately added that he
did not forget that 9 birthday was on Aug 15 and that he believed that
it would be the best if they celebrated together in Quautla on Baa Aug 16.
LOG added that on that day his wife and son would be with him in Cuautla
and S should bring along Josephine; Log will bring a bottle of "Russien"
champaign and pic-nic style food; there will be bottle of Vodka for
Jisephine and a bottleof ( F does not remember what ) for 8 plus the
book he previously mentioned. LOG added some more description about
what a wonderful day they would have together. They are to meet in
Cuautla about 1000 hrs at the "hano8. LOG will be there without fail

The meet was prearranged and 3 came on time. The main purpose
of the meet was to have fill the PAQ on LOGINOV (P-11,712), which was
accomplished to a satisfactory degree, 1.e. 26 pages out of 53. Further,

On Friday Aug 1 at 1400 hrs 9 called on OHINAHSIEN TANG, Minister
Counseler of the Nat Chinese Emb at his office. The purpose of the
call was to explain that the magazine La Mision goes to press the latest
on the 18th of the month and it was too late to have anything published
on Nat. Ohina. In accordance with the instruction & received from Pierre
RUDIAN. & told TANG that in publishing such articles the magazine writes
them according to the wishes of the embassy of the country about which
they are written. Because embassies pay only the subscription, they
usually see to it that at least a half of page of advertising is in-
cluded in the same issue.

TANG expressed understanding for such a practice and stated that
he was interested in hevticle on the Republic of China and
probably one on Chian-Kai-Shek and that he would see to it that a proper
amount of ada be purchased.

TANG went on to ask which embassies are subscribers of the
magasine and which use it for publishing articles. S stated that prectical-

Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P-1612) who
is furious for the following reason: Formerly Soviets leaving Mexico
would take KLM or Sabena to Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot
the following day. KLM and Sabena would pay overnight hotel costs.
Now, however, the Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York.
Because of scheduling, however, they still must spend at least one
night in New York. The airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted
Subject to cover it. Subject refused for the very sound reason that
it did not make sense for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket
from which his profit was only $9. IVANOV became furious and Subject
yielded by agreeing to pay for IVANOV's accommodations and he said he
would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but
he would not do it as a general rule. While Subject was away,
however, his wife went overboard and got IVANOV four rooms (for two
people). Now Subject is furious.

On 31 July Subject was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came
in carrying a copy of Pravda or Izvestiya. Subject
Subject quoted the old
saw,
"There is no truth in Pravda and no news in Izvestiya,
" and
PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by
making anti-Soviet propaganda. PRIKHODKO was very serious. This is
probably as good and as accurate a thumbnail sketch on PRIKHODKO that
we are likely to get. PRIKHODKO, who said that he was leaving in
September, had visited Subject to find out what Subject knew about
a congress of Jewish intellectuals which is to be held in mid-September
in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union.

Subject told PRIKHODKO that

with someonw at the Israeliac Embassy the was bor:ified to learn
that word had gotten out since at this time knowledge of the congress
is confidential. Subject told me that he would tell PRIKHODKO that
he had been unable to learn anything, reasoning that to tell him about
it would get him involved with further requirements and would be working
against the best interests of the Jews. I told Subject that I.
agreed completely.
Subject said that the Sputnik group which was due in June never
did get Mexican visas and their trip has been cancelled. On the other
hand, a delegation of about a dozen Soviets is due in August for a
Congress of eye, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and still another
group of a dozen is due in September for a congress of soll mechanics.
Since these are official delegates as opposed to the sputnik group who
were tourists, they will have no trouble getting Nexican visas.
Subject himself will be going to Budapest from 1 to 7 November
for the IICA congress, Subject is world chairman of this group which
apparently is the International Convention Organization.

1. The undersigned attended the celebration of the
Polish national day at the Polish Residence on Insurgentes
Sur on 22 July 1969. The following points were the most
significant:
a.
The only Soviet the undersigned could
identify was Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV,
the Soviet Military Attache. Someone the under-
signed's wife talked to mentioned the presence of
the Soviet Consul, but this
Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy aly was neither
CHERNYSII, and the
undersigned did not meet that person.
b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not,
they were not in attendance.
C. Jiri SVESTKA, of the Czech Embassy, was
there. Per SB Section briefing, the undersigned
mentioned his departure and told SVESTKA that at
least he would remain in Mexico. SVESTKA said that
this would not be the case, that he is scheduled
to leave within 15 days for Czechoslovakia. The
undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his
Czech friend in which the latter told him that he
expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer.
SVESTKA denied ever having said this, pointing
out that he was glad to return home. The under-
signed made no further comments.

in. the Sov Embassy. 8 stated that he was on friendly terms with an
official of the Sov Embassy. TANG commented that this was unsual, because
Sove make frends with nobody. S stated again that he had no other way
of calling his relation with the Sow official than a personal friendship.
In reply to TANGS Question $ stated that he prefered not to mention the
name of his Sov friend and TANG asked what position did 8b Sov friend
have. S replied that as far as he knew the Sov official was quite high up.
(610). TANG continued his questioning: what was the nature of & relation-
ship with the Sov, was it a business type relationship; how often did they
see each other; where did they meet. S stated that he never transacted
any business with the Sov and they meet about twice a month for a dinner
or lunch in various restaurante. S added that the Sov plays tennis every
week-end and that he (8) sometime goes to watch him playing (Note: the
latter statement is not true). TANG asked did 8 play tennis and he an-
swered negatively.
6.
At this point 3 asked was he interested in meeting his Bov friend
and TANG stated that he was. Then, S asked tus TANG what should he say
to his Sov friend. TANG commented that this was a good question and he
told $ that he would think about it. Consequently, he asked 8 could he
pass by on Monday or Tuesday (Aug 4 or 5 ) and 3 said he would.

In reply to Fe question S stated that he intended to tell LOG
exactly what tranpired on his meet with TANG and that he planned
visiting TANG on Monaday so that he would be able to tell LOO did TAND
decide to meet LOG.

getting in a deeper and deeper mess by getting involved with the Nat
Ühinese, it was obvious from the attitued of Kr. TANG that he read him
through and was taking his time to find could he benifit. something out
of the whole scheme. Therefore, S should also take it easy and not
rush to see TANG on Monday. 1.e. before seeing LOG; further, he should
Stick to his previous decision that it was rather dangerous to be
meeting with LOC often.

8 felt that LOG would press for a moet with S as soon as possible
once he got to know that TANG had opened the possiblity of wanting to
meet with LOG. P considered this to be possible and impressed on 8 that

L-1 came to this meet in much better shape than he was last time
in spite of the fact that he complained of being tired. He wanted to
eat something, but he did not feel kes having a full meal. He had 4 drinks
(Rum and 29).

L-1 handed me a personality sketch which he prepared on DROV

In the course of debriefing I-1 on his reet with 100 I mede my
comments and gave him necessary instruction, which are covered in the
following parae.
6. ' As L-1 mentioned ICCS questioning about LIVAL-1 be inmediately
pointed out that the whole thing made no rence to him after LOGM repeated
etatements at the lart meet, that he was not interested in LiOWL-1. I told
I-1 that it made little sense to me, except, if 200ted to ascertain
was L-l selling him the truth. Then I added that I wished IL-1 had
made some statement which L-1 could relay to 200 to see what mould he
his reaction. I-1 commented that once in the past he told 100 that
TOVAL-1 told him that be used to kno: a Sov diplomat here whom he cou

it was up to him to stall.

At this point S asked P would we help him out if he got in troubles
on account of his association with LOG. F replied that he was trying to
instruct him how to keep out of troubles and it appeared that s did not
care much about what F was telling him. & reacted quite strongly to Fe
statement by saying that F was wrong, or at least incorrectly interpreted
S attitude; as far as he (S) is concerned he is willing to discontinue
meeting with LOG immediately, if we tell him to do so. P answered that
if we wanted him to drop LOG we would had told him to do it. Nevertheless,
$ as an American is certainly aware of the fact that the US Service and,
consequently, the US security is getting nothing out of & collaboration
with LOG; in view of the fact that LOG will remain here only about 2 mothe
more we felt it would be the best to leave the matter take its normal
course and find its natural end; we were and continue to be interested
in keeping out of trouble, but to achieve this the most important thing
was that he carry out our instruction as he received it, we badly need
that $ fullbeartedly comply with our instruction; if &' association
with the KGB (sic) continues after the departure of LOG we would probably
be willing to continue our relationship with S only if we were able to
count on his sincerety and complete complying with every instruction he
may receive from us. 8 stated that it was clear to him that he could
not count on any help from us if he got himself in trouble by acting
on his own. F left it at that.
11.
As the working part of the meet ended about 1040 hre 3 stated
that he was broke and did not anticipate to be in a better financial
condition for two additional months. 8 turned this theme one way and the
other until he came out with the request for about 50.- Dollars. F answered
that he would look into the matter and we left the INN Le Club and
started walking. 8, was obviously fearing that the meet would brak up
and he would go home without any money, and complained that the place
( the INN) was good for writing purposes but the food was lousy (true)

and told Subject that according to the plore verrege he left for F it
appeared that LCG did not come to the meet scheduled for June 25 end
not as he put it on paper. Subject repeated what he wrote and confirmed
that on June 20 et did not show up and on June 25 LOG
came
and Subject did not show up ( LIENERACE surveillance confirmed the latter
statement ). 7 observed that on his first meet with Subject on June 23
Subject said that he had a meet with LOG on June 25 and told him that he
had no time to try to get the directory. Subject showed no embarrassment
and he told ♪ that he must have misundertood Subject's statement.

☞ told Subject that he did not follow Fe instruction in speaking
to LOG about the directory, specifically, by bringing up a name of
Patricia which created a problem without which he would be much better
off. The fact is that Subject brows nodody in the U.S. Embassy. Subject
was of the opinion that we can always introduce him to a person in the
Emb who can play, the role of being his acquaintance. ŕ told Subject that
E
we were not cale pulling rabbits out of a hat and all our actions were
conducted within limits of security. What Subject was suggesting was
complete disregard for our as well his own security and the best thing
he can tell LOG on their next meet was that "Patricia" did not show up
88 yet.
6.
sind,
It may be noted that is attempt to debrief Subject on what
transpired at each of his sets with LOG did not tear desired results.
Subject stated the facts he mentioned to ? on their first meet and started
repeating himself as he was going on. Therefore, F decided to get as de-
tailed as possible description of the last meet and Subject was cooperative.
Although, Subject spoke about the last meet at the begining of our meet
be did not aina trying putting it in sequence as it took place. From what
Subject stated previous meats it may be worthwhile noting that Subject
had a party at his apt on June 10 and he asked LCG to come to the party.
LOC explained Subject that he did not like to be seen in large groups
and he sent Subject 2 bottlem of Votka for the party. Subject also
stated that in 3 3 instances te promised 100 to bring him a tennia ·

12. After the debriefing I asked 1-1 to start filling out the dAQ
and ±± 10 pages were completed. The work was going slower than I anticip-
ated because it is not only a matter of translating but also explaining
the questions.

1.
The meet was prearranged and L-1 was in front of the restaurant
4 min before LOG. The meet lasted about 90 minutes.
2.
THEIR NEXT MEET: Friday August 8 at LOGS Apt at Ignação Esteva
21/2 at 1900 hours.
No cocktails were taken before the meal and with the meal beer
was drank. LOG lead off with questions concerning L-le family, health,
work and entertainment.
3.
Ammong questions concerning L-l's work there were also questions
concerning LIOVAL-1: was Lel giving him classes regularly; was LIOVAL-1
asking L-1 questions about the USSR or Sov officiale; did LIOVAL-1 make
any statements which would show "how he breates politically" (sic). L-1
gave routine answer pointing out that LIOVAL-1 does not hesitate to speak
about his family matters and work, but he never seks questions of any
kind; he takes his language classes regularly; there were no statements
concerning political matters.
4.
I-l told LOG that July 24 or 25 a young man Victor I RAMOS
called on him in the evening at home and told him that he needed a trans-
lation of about 20 pages of Russian text into to Spanish and that he
was sent by LOG and he asked him who was the person. LOG stated that he
did not know the person and since it was a matter of translation he (LOG)
sent him to L-1 hoping that he may earn some money by making the translation
L-1 asked LOG did he know that RAMOS spoke some Russian which he learned
at the IIORM. LOG stated that he was not aware of that fact. L-1 will
make the traslation if he can handle the terminokoły dealing with economy.
5.
L-1 told LOG that he spoke to B, MUNOZ about the Sov film and
that MUNOZ was pleased with the offer. Due to the fact that NUNOS is
presently undergoing a treatment he was not able to make arrangements
for showing of the film. In reply to LOG's question I-1 stated that
MUNOZ wanted to show the file in the Communist Party Centro (slo) at

nover invited him to his house, while at the time he had met BROVKIN
he was invited to BB house after they met the second or third time.
LOG told L-l he had no intention of keeping L-1 away from his house,
but he wanted him to know that since the time BROVKIN was here certain
things had changed: previously the Sov Embassy was paying the rent for
the apts of their officials and now the officials have to pay the rent
from their salary. Consequently, LOG lives in a small, modest apt and he
does not feel that it is adequate for receiving people. L-1 commented
that LOGB statement made him feel bad because he believed that they were
friends and that formalities were not necessary among them. LOG counter-
acted that by saying that I-l and his wife were invited to his apt on
Wed July 30, but he did not want L-1 to be surprized to see in what kind
of apt a Sov Aipl officials was living. L-l thanked for the invitation
and stated that it was impossible to him to come before 2050 hrs on Wed
because he had late classes. LOG felt that 2030 was rather late and they
agreed that I-1 and his wife would come to LOGa for dinner on Friday .

LOG'S statement that he knew nothing about RANCS, especially, in view
of the fact that RANOS ought to be attending the IICFM for some time to
be able to speak some Russian and prounced well. 2-1 is willing to
make the translation RAMOS wants if he finds no difficulty in handling
the terminology.

LOGS reaction on to plan to show the Sov film at the
CP center at Versailles appears to be interesting..

-1 was again puzzled with LOG's hints that I-1 should do something
for the Socialist cause genuinely dislikes the idea of getting involved
in the KGB work. I told him that I also did not want him to set involved
in spying for HGB but I did not want him to be cast aside by Sov offcials;
there will be things I-1 can do to show the good will and what he does
dr amount to nothing as is the care with the showing of the Sov film:
the rost important is that he does nothing without checking with mo.

According to I-1, LCG never before remealed his political.

excessive freedor in the USSR and other Socialist countries.

question of not being invited by LOG to his apt, because on the previous

Versailles, LOG exclaimed that for Heavens sake he did not anything like
that; he wanted this to be entirely on private and personal basis without
political elements involved; to show the film at Versailles would be
stupid, it would just enable the imperialists to blast in the papers
that the Sove were getting involved in internal political matters of
Mexico; in view of the coming Presidential elections this could be blown
up into a scandal. L-l remarked that he saw no difference in showing the
film in the OPCentro or in the Centro Asturiano as LOG wanted originally.
LOG explained at length the difference and L-1 promised to have another
talk with MUNOZ.
6.
L-l told tha✯ LOG that quite recently he saw in the press some-
thing written to the effect that there are presently in the USSR 4 types
of detention ( concentration) camps and he wondered whether that was
an indication that the freedom in the USSR was being trimmed again. LOG
stated that "this was pure imperialist propaganda". He went on to say
that in the USSR the cafes are full of people and that one can hear them
even critisizing the government. He added that in his opinion there is
too much (demasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Socialist countries
If Stalin was alive it could not happen that while the people in America
are openly protesting against the war in Vietnam and against imperialism
a Socialist country as Ozecho rizes its people in favor of American and
West Gernam empirialism. "Too much freedom in the USSR results with still
more freedom in other Socialist countries; this is no longer freedom, it
is a shameful betraial of Socialism; I hope that it will be realised soon
that Stalin was right", said LOG.
7.
-
At this point LOG worked in a hint to L-1 that he should do
something for the Socialist cause. L-l sounded his old tune saying that
he saw nothing he could do and added that now when LCG opened him the
door to the American Intelligence Service through Victor RAKOS (actually
working for The Economist Intelligence Unit, S.A., Reforma 116 801 B)
he would find out would they pay him well and if they would he would
work for them, because anyway the Sove never gave him anything. When LOG
asked him what the hell he was speaking about, L-1 stated that he was
km joking and LOG commented that L-1 had never done anything to help
the Sov effort and consequently, they were not able to pay him anything.

evening to which S did not come. In the course of the morning of July 22 ·
I tried to reach S by phone at his office but he did not come there. In

Next meet: August 1 at the Chez Le Club at 2000 hrs.
S did not go through much of trouble to explain the reason
he did not code to the meet the previous day. He said that he did not
write in his notebook the time of the meet and he went to the Reffaello

I ment to the debriefing of S on his meet with 109. Most of the
aspects of that meet are self explanatory. Nevertheless, there are new
inter-sting factor concerning future meets with 500. It may be noted
that S requested less frequent meet on basis of suggestion I made to
hie during the brief meet of July 18. Another factor is the rattling of
big money.
5.
There are facts which are naive and contradictory as for as
LOG is concerned. LOG will work out a plan which is to provide recurity
to their personel meets on one hand and on the other he invited S to
come to the French Club..... 100 did not appear a serious operator if
he felt that I was able to lead in convs about military strength of
Red China.

JS believes that he made his first phone call (FI): the one
recorded by LIKIVOY) about 1100 hrs. Be mes told to call in an hour.
and he DID CAIL more or less an hour later. Then, he was told that
LOS wee still busy and that he should call in 30 minutes. 55 QAILED AS
HE HAS TOLD and after quite bit of waiting ICG came to the phone.
Consequently, JS made THREE calls to the same phone number.
3.
All THHLE calls which JS made were anmered by the same nale
voice. There was no indication that the male answering the phone recognized
JS voice in any of his two back calls.
4.
JS recalls that when he made his second call and stated that
it was "Vladimir calling" the operator understood that "calling" was the
second name and he asked JS show to spell it, which required some explain-
ing.
5.
JS is positive that at no time during his 3 calls he mentioned

Keet with LOGINOV (P-11,712) on July 18 at SEPe-Paris
1.
The meet was prearranged and it lasted about two hours. The prevo
viously used procedure was followed: S and LOG met in front of the re-
staurant and they entered it together. As usually, LOG was sharp in sp-
pearing on the spot.
2.
THEIR NEXT MEET: On Aug 4 at Samborns Insurgentes-Tasquena at
2000 hrs.
Course of the Meet.
LOG asked S why he did not come "to play tennis with him" at
the French Olub on July 12. S explained that he was not feeling well
and that he did not recover completely from the flu which he had all
week. S added that only for the reason of keeping the word given to a
friend (LOG) he came to this meet. Nice words by LOC who concluded that
he brought 8 2 bottles of Votka which can be used as " a medicine" for
colds and similar disconforts.
3.
As it could be expected after such an opening of the meet LOG
was interested was $ able to accomplish something for him. 8 told him that
he had done what he promised and gave LOG the written report which LOG
read. When he finished the reading LOG remarked that 8 did not sign the
report. When 8 said that he was willing to do it right there, LOG said
that it was not necessary and that he was only joking.
LOG spent considerable amount of time in questioning 8 about
the reasons, consequences which the cancellation of PEMKY contract(s)
with some US oil companies. At certain point the questions lacked clarity
and eaked LOG point blane what was he driving at. 100 stated that 8
should realize that the USSR is the second largest producer of oil in
the world (slo) and that he was interested in finding out was it possible
for the USER to step in where the Americane kicked out (sic). 8 told LOO
that it was difficult to go more wrong than LOG was in his thinking.
because 18 Noxioane de did not want Americans involved in their oil
business it was positively certain that they wanted no foreigner, 84-

to bring his relationship with TANG to a point that LOG could meet TANG
in a friendly unofficial manner. LOG concluded that for such a job he
was willing to pay 8 in terms of thousands of Dollars. After the dust
of verbage settled LOG told 8 that he should try to feel out TANG was
he willing to speak about the military stregth of Red China. LOG ex-
plained to S that presently the Sove were completely in dark as to the
military strength and operational organisation of the Red Ohinese army;
they have no way of acquiring the info because even if they had friends
in Red China none of them dared to maintain contact with Sov officials
nor officials of other Socialist countries which are known to be on the
Sov side; Nat Ohina has many spies in Red Ohins and they are well infced
on all aspects of developments in Red Ohina, it is possible that TANG
would be willing to make arrangements with his government for exchange
of info, especially, military info between the USSR and the Rep. of Ohina
and this would be beneficiary to the USSR and the USA. LOG went on to
tell 8 that he should think in terms of using RUDIAN for getting to
meet TANG out of his embassy; be that a party or whatever might be
needed, the expenses will taken care of by LOG, because money is no
problem.
7.

Then, LOG stated that 8 should arrange something to enable LOG
to meet RUDIAN in a small, family type, oirole. 8 was cought by surprise
and told LCG that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing
each other. LOG stated that he knew RUDIAN well and was in may instances
with RUDIAN at receptions and other formal social functions, but he never
had an oportunity to be with RUDIAN in friendly and unformal circumstances.
$ commented that the only problem he found in trying to make such an
arrangement was in the fact that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice in a
week, drops in to see 8 at his (Josephine's) apt but he never announces
hia visits in advance more than an hour or two before he comes.

LOG asked 8 what happened to the US Emb phone directory: did the
girl (friend of 3) return. 8 answered that he did not have the slightest
idea what was going on, "because in his condition (of health) he did even
go to check did the girl return".
9.
LOG was proposing that they meet in the course of the next week
but & told him that he felt that they were meeting too often and in view

of his status of a tourist it may be secumbed that the Gobernacion carry
out spot checks on him; if he was to be seen by the Gebernacion or Security
agents in company of LOG it is prety certain that they would take him
in and interrogate him; he thinks that this can be avoided if they do not
see each other so often.
10.
LOG agreed with S reasoning and added that he himself realised
that they were getting together too often and he also cannot be 100 per
cent sure that he is not tailed some-time. Therefore, he will out a plan
by which they will be able to see each other whenever it is needed and
will limit their regular personal meets to twice per month. He went on
to tell S that he would pick up an apropriate spot on which 8 will place
a chalk sign when he needs to se LCG urgently: LOG will pass by the place
every morning and if he see the sign he will erase it which will assure
S that he und rstood his request and they would then meet the same evening
at a place (restaurant) which they would select only for this purpose.
SOG concluded by stating that this was the general idea and that he would
work out the details which he will explain to S on their next meet which
they would hold in two weeks, i.e. August 4.
11.
$ commented that the plan looked good and if LOG was sure that
it would work then there was no need for them to meet more than one a
month. LOG stated that 2 meets per month were needed in spite of the
fact that he was positive that his system was dependable.
12.
$ told LOG that he did not spend any of the MN 400.- he gave
him for the purpose of establishing contact with an official of the
Hat Chinese Emb and consequently wanted to return the money. LOG told
him to keep it for himself and that he would give him money, as much a8
needed, if he had an oportunity to entertain TANG.
13.
There was some unconsequential talk and LOG told S to come
to the French Olub any Saturday and that he would teach him to play
tennis. LOG explained that he was going to the club every Saturday
about 1000 hrs: S will be allowed to enter if he says that LOG was
waiting for him.

LOG commented that the USSR was very much interested in establish-
ing strong economic interchange, especially trade, with Mexico and were
not finding the right atmosphere nor proper response in Mexico. He asked
8 what, in his opinion, sould or should be done to overcome this situation.
S answered that he believed that the Bove ought to change their mentality
if they wanted to trade with Mexico, naimly, in the field of trade they
should forget about Socialism and adapt the Capitalistio mentality: to
trade with Mexico 50vs would have to establish industrial plants here
which
and to do it Mexicane must have 51 per cent share in each case,
means the controling stook; in reality this does not mean that Nexicans
would invest 51 per cent of the value....

LOG went to the other item of the written report and he asked
8 how he went about in contacting Ohin-Hsien TANG, counselor of the
Nat Chinese Emb. S told him about posing as a reporter for the magazine
La Mision and going there on reccommendation of Pierre RUDIAN ( See
FERNALD's previous contact report). S added that in the Sept issue of the
magazine there would be an article dealing with Nat China and the
Poiking Moscow coflict and if needed another article on Ohing-Kai Shek
would be published. LOG told 8 that he was pleased with the manner in
which 8 handled the task he gave him. LOG did not discuss the contents
of this part of Se report and he questioned 8 about CETANG: he wanted
to know was 8 in a position to keep this acquaintance alive and develop
it in to a sort of friendly informal relationship; he (LOG) knew TANG from
some formal diplomatio gatherings and he liked the person. S believed that
he was able to keep alive the established acquaintance and was not able
to guess as to how far he would be able to develop it. LOG suggested
that B do not allow too much time to pass until his next visit to TANG.
8 said that he could call on TANG on Fri July 25 to explain him that
he did not succeed in getting the article in the Aug issue of the magasine
and will publish it in Sept issue; at the same time S will make it known
that ho wee interested in getting the material for an article on Chiang-kai
Shesk which should keep the doors open for another visit.... 8 was in
hie element when he was describing this and LOC was not finding enough
word to praise & and at the same time to encourage him to all he can

Subject asked ? what type of a reception will be given on the
4th of July by the Emb and was there something arranged that any American
could drop in, as signing the book at the Emb. - promised to phone to
Subject in case there was something like that.
8.
After covering the ground as contained in the 3 attachments
P asked Subject was he willing to back his statements with a polygraph
test ( used the expression 'lie detector test' ). Subject reacted by
asking when did we want him to take the test. 7 commented that he did
not say that Subject would be given one, he only asked would he be willing
to take one, if we asked him to do it. Subject stated that he was willing
tà take the test at any time. Then, he started asking questions about
the test, especially, who usually gets it and how it works. With regard
to who gets F stated that anyone involved in matters having hearing on
the security of the U.S. and as to how it works, there is nothing to it:
it registers when a person sers à lies the stemach digests automatically

Comment by FERNALD:

This meet enables us to have a better insight of
Subject's personality.
b. There are valid indications that Subject is not
withholding importent info concerning his personal
history nor his activity.
c.Hic claim to have numerous and to an extention influent-
ial contacts appears to be acceptable.
d.He also appears to he cooperative, but has a tendency to
deviate from the instruction given to him concerning
his attitude toward LCCINCT. It is possible that thin
is due to his convinction that he knows I better than
Z06
me do and that we are too dogmatic and not enough
flexible. At the same time this may be due to the fact
that be loves clandestine activity for the sake of
pleasure he gets out of the game as such on one hand.
and on the other, he might fear that our proposed cource
of action late from him, which case
may
in
he would be left without a came he likes."
e. It expearate culous that ethnal
conditions are not ropy, but, experently, he hae
a shelter, it rell drenged and So not love to worry
About being cry. Therefore there is left enough rese
for him to lead the life ne pleoron.

such an official. S said that we could count on him.

S stated after some thinking that he had connections in practical-
ly every branch of the Mexican government, but definitely had none in
the Seguridad de Estado. F commented that this was understandable because
the Security keeps itself separated from politicking which enables, this
organization to carry out it duties without interference of politions.
F added that the Security people are excellently trained and
fre
amazingly efficient in their work. It was evident that it statements
left S worried. F took advantage of the silence and added as an after

Ya que los Estados Unidos es un cuen-
to viejo y que no amenazan sus fronteras, el mía logico es la Un-

en el añã 1847 Zar Nicolás I logró anexar Rusia la cuenta del
rio Amur y en el año 1853 arrancaron a China la margen norte del-
mismo rio. Mao Tse-tung ya so fué más allá de lo que pensaba y pa-
ra el ya no hay retorno. Si se recresa, pierde tanto al Ejercito
Rojo asi como la uniton del ble blo. Akera tiene que sequir

Le pregunte a que lado estan ellos en este problema y el ma respon-

2.
S apologized for not bringing the copy of the report he gave
to ABDIEHARD: he did not think of it this meaning when he left the hotive.
3.
I told S that the fact that DEDIEHARD would remain here at iust
five adesional month did not please me, becuase I was not able to lui
the things go the way they were going until now and be just an observer.
In reply to my questions S stated he was ready and determined to anything
we tell him to do: he is willing to drop the association with ABDIEHARD:
he is equally ready to do or tell AEDIEHARD anything we instruct him
even if it was certain that AEDIEHARD would drop him; he is willing to go
through any doings we consider necessary. I believe S was incere in
his statemente.
I told S not to call & under any circumstances before their next
meet (Sept 10); keep away from the Chinese Emb; if he gets the ad from
Luau Restaurant S can advise OS by phone; take proof of the article
as was promised but avoid any conv watsoever; if Josephine feels like
going to the French Club on Sat (Aug 30) S can go with her, but I sus
no point in him going alang alone. S stated that he understood what he
was told an³ he would not do a move without checking with me.
5.
S asked in a matter of fict tone that he would like to know
where le stood with us; did we went him to carry out the work we request
for patriotic sons: do we intend give it a salary or make a worthwhile
juesent. I told him that he can rest sure that we realized that he was not
in a financial position to be able to work out of patriotic feelings, and
consequently he could be paid for bia work as much as it is worth to us.

keep in touch with WONG or TANG but make sure there is a bona fide reason
to go to see them, example, to tell them that the ad was obtained, show

while cell ecting info for A. 3 pretended he was hesitant to receive money
but did not drag the story long ( from fear that A might change his mind ).
7.
After the brief "ceremony" about giving and accepting the money
& asked S did he have any news about the US Embassy Phone Directory. S reminded
A that he told at their last meet that he had no way of getting it. A asked
S did he know anybody working in the USIS. When S answered that he did
not think so A told him there was a number of girls working for USIS, they
work on the 3rd floor (of the Emb building) and several of them live in
the Hotel Geneve; they carry out some propaganda; A is not sure "how far"
can one get with them ( in terms of having good time ), but there is no
problem of getting them ( although, the interst is limited to one girl) to
go out for dinner and dancing. This is something S should look into.
8 commented to the effect did A have an idea how much it tekee to take
chick like those for an evening of good time; such a bill runs about
MN 700.- A replied that money was no problem; if S lines up something
it is enough if he phones him a day earlier and he will bring him the
money.
8.
At this point A gave S the following instruction: If S ever
needs something from A, as money, or he has something for A he should
call the Emb and state that he wants to speak to Vladimir of the
Consulate and stress that it was Vladimir calling. If A is in his office
he will take the phone and there will be "just mucho gustó de saludarle"
from both sidess. If A is not there he(s) is to request to give the message
that Vladimir called. The call should be made in the morning if possible.
Regardless, whether S gets to speak to A or not he is to go the same
evening at 2000 hrs to their meet place at Samborne-San Angel.

that VI wanted first to know through which Swiss bank would the transaction

being the theaters most frequently attended. LOGINOV always made somet
sort of contret during these cutings, recording to ASMIDRIFF. She stated,

for some time. She did not know where the contacts were actually made
Once she and LOGINOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by
LOGINOV as "Col. Sergio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse himself
to have a private conversation with the Nexiean. "Col. Sergio" was de-
scribed by AMIDUFF as about 40, tall, no moustache or glasses, thick,
curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The woman with "Col.
Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife
(which AEMIDRIFF doubted because, as she put it, he didn't treat her es
One would a wife, but rather as a mistress). AMIDRIFF knew nothing more
about this Mexican and never saw him again.

Debriefing conducted 12-16 New 1970:
Concerning Soviet Contects in the Mexican Police: AEXIDRIFF
stated that she overheard GOLCUSOV end BYCMIN talk about many contacts which
they had in the police here. She said she had also overheard KOLCZAKÓV,
PAKULIN, AND CHRYCHOV talk about how many good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which AFMIDRIFF could give concerned
some non-operational favor which the Soviets could get taken care of, e.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get something through Aduanu; when sore Soviet
was missing and police cooperation was needed; getting advance notice when
some demonstration hostile to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting on what the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operationally in some way. However, AFMIDRIFF thought
the Sovicts probably have such assets.
Concerning Soviet contents in West German Police: AETÍDIFF
recalled that when she went to Germany as interpreter for Soviet surgeon
and textbook writer, Pablo ARSTV, in January 1960 (they went to Coloma

of Soviet safe houses or safe &partments. She stated that meny Soviet
visitors stayed at the Hotel Virreyes or in two other hotels near the
Soviet Embassy (che couldn't remember names). She did not know whether the
Soviets had any sort of special arangement or contacts in these hotels.
AEMIDRIFF stated that she had attended several parties at
which Nexicons also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the
homes of KOLONYAKOV, PAKULIN, LOGINOV) and in each instance the Soviet
officer, at some point during the evening, had a private conversation with
a Mexican guest. (Unfortunately, ARMIDRIFF was unable to recall the nomes
of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is
no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational
rectings.) AEHIDRIFF commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands all
ways went off together and tsiked business, and if wives approached, they
stopped their conversation.

AMBERTER stated that she
was told by Paniel Montiel (Daniel MINCZ Montiel, 201-258351), the Soviet's
chauffeur, that his brother, who is a Central Committee number of the PC:
and who worked on the PCM publication "La Voz de Mexico," was in contact
with KUPLASAKOV. In addition, ARMIDRIFF stated that she believed that
Armando VERDUCO (iden with Arcando MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-851726) had an
uncle, also named Armando VERDUGO, who is First Secretury of the FCM and
who is in contact with KUPLYAKOV. At least this was strongly inferred by
Montiel, according to AMIDRIFF. (Editor note: Arnoldo MARTINEZ Verdugo,
201-054254, who is brother of Aruando, is First Secretary of PCM).
AEMIDRIFT stated that KUPLYAKOV always seemed to be very interested in and
knowledgeable of what appeared in "La Voz de Mexico" and in the PCR publi-
cation "L3 Epoca." She stated that, in general, KUSLYAKOV paid so much
attention to local politics and seemed to be so well informed on FCM
matters that she felt certain he had something to do with the PCM.
AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKC7's wife was a good friend of
Salvador GONZALEZ Marin, head of the Fondo de Cultura Porular. GONZALEZ
wife works in the Museum of Anthropology. CONZALEZ sold a lot of Soviet
books, according to ATMIDRIFF, and for that reason was in contact with
KUPLZAKCV, but she commented that GONZALEZ may also have been utilized
by KUPLYAKOV in sore other operational way. Host of HUFLYAKOV's contacts

in relation with the student disopters, any mention of the level of in-

Soviet guidance to the student movement, financing of the student movement,
or the like. She really doesn't know that the Soviets had any contacts
with direct access to information to these activities, but she strongly
essumes that they did, based on their level of activity and the strong
tenor that LOGINOV and other case officers gave to the idea that the contacts
they were making were dangerous ones for them to be seen with during this
period..
Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970: AEMIDRIFF questioned
re 1958 student disorders again, for clarification previously reported
details. She stated that the Soviets had some different types of rifles
in the Commercial office which served as samples of guns which they were
trying to sell commercially in Mexico. One night about 11 o'clock, during
the period of student riots, LOGINOV come to the Commercial Office with
MITOPOESKI (AEMIDRIFF was there witching TV). They got "some" rifles
AEMIDRIFT could not see how many or what kind. They took then cut in some
· sort of bags: The next morning "some" rifles were returned to the Com-
mercial Office, but AFMIDRIFF doesn't know whether all of them were
brought back. She doesn't know whether or not LOGITO might have teen

afternoon. Instead of commenting on the fact tha A left without even
indicating to S that he might leave, B stated that this situation was
giving him an opportunity to find out for us who was As replacement.
Ab
F told him that it was a common knowledge as to who was Ab replacement
and that the only thing to ascertain positively was whether A had dropped
him (8) or the developments prevented A from meeting with 8.
6.
Therefore, F suggested to S to phone to the Sov Emb by using
the duple talk (code) which A gave him and see what happens. If ahother
person tells him that A left Mexico, 8 should sek how was he to go
about a transaction he intiated with A. If the answering person insists
in knowing what was it about, which is doubtful, 8 should limit himself
to the statement that it is a commercial matter involving large amount
of money, and it reached the stage that an action should be taken.

Subject: Jimmy SABORI
(P-13,830)
Date/Place of Meet: Expex Oct 7 at Chez Rene Rest at 1414 hrs.
1.
The meet was arranged by phone and 8 came about 14 min late.
NEXT MEET: Oct 10 (Friday) Insurgentes Sus & Extremadura
at 1100 hrs.
2.
According to S his last meet with AEDIEHARD was on Aug 25. A had
arranged a meet with S for Sept 10, but A did not come to that meet. Two
days later,i.e. after he did not come to the scheduled meet A phoned to
8' apt in the afternoon when he was not home and after exchange of nioe
words with Josephine he told her that he was not able to keep his ap-
pointment with 8 two days ago and he wanted to apologize for not showing
up and that he would ring up 8 in a day or two. Because there were no calls
from A for few days (sic), 8 decided to give him a ring and advise him
that he had something for him, namely, S had in his possession a duplicated
copy of an "Agreement" concerning the Platinum deal. As it is evident
from the mentioned copy of the Agreement the same was signed and the
Buyers Agent signature, was legalised by the U.S. Consul in Mexico City
on Sept 25.
3.
Although, this story lacks acuracy in terms ± of dates, it is
subtantially different from the one gave to FERNALD on Sept 12, the
date of their last personal meet. Inspite of the vagueness concerning
the dates and absence of detaile, this story appears to be much closer
to truth, than the version of Sept 12.
4.
S gave me for copying a technical copy of the above mentioned
Agreement concerning the Platinum transaction. As is evident from the
wording of the Agreement 8 would have nothing to do with Buyer or Buyers
Agent. The Agreement places 8 on the Sellere side or at the beat makes
him middle man between the notual Seller and Buyer's Agent. P did not
read the Agreement in the restaurant (during the meet) and made no com-
ments with regard to the Platinum transaction as such.

the building: Subject is married and has 2 children, but he is presently
separated from his wife; as the children finished the High School his wife
wanted them to continue their schooling in the U.S.; Subject avoided
specifying what school his children attended here and called the school
"the American High School: Subject has been in Mexico 4 years and his
wife only 2 years; as much as he love, lexico so much his wife did not get
used to Nexico and cid not want to remain any longer here; the fact that
he did not want to leave Mexico resulted in their physical separation;
according to Subject it is only a matter of days that his family left for
San Jose, California, which Subject called his home town; Subject claims
that his family ( paternal side) comes from Milan, Italy; his great grand
father came to New York, NY, and followed the gold rush to California where
he apperently did well; for reasons unknown to Subject his grand father
moved from California to Arizona and then to Mexico (Sinaloa) where
Subjects father was born; in the same breath Subject stated that he, too,
was born in Mexico and when F commented that it would be logical that he
have a dual citizenship, Subject did quite bit of talking to confuse the
the previous statement: during the revolution all the records were burned
and he has only the certificate of baptism issued by a Mexican church and
in fact it was possible that he was born on the U.S. side of the border;
Subject claims he could not care less about the possibility of claiming
Mexican citizenship, he is an American and it suits him well to live in
this country as a TOURIST: in the Fraccionadora de Pajio he works with
a partner, who entered the company as owner of 2 large chunks of land;
Subject had no money but he is the person who through his connections
obtained from a Mexican bank a decision that the bank would mortgage
up to 90 per cent every structure he and his partner complete; now he
is in the stage of obtaining American investment capital to carry out
the construction of low income housing (F does not recall the location

It seems that the neighbor with whon he had planted to leave his child

2000 hrs. Sub arrived at the Embassy at about 2020 hours where he was

Ente/Place of Meet: Oct 3 at Rest. Hoyo at 1330 Hrs.
2.
Prearranged meet to which L-1 came 10 min. eorly.
Next meet: October 16 at the same place at 1430 hrs.
2.
Since our last meet (Sept 19) L-1 had not seen LIFACON-1 who in
two instances apologised (2-3 days after the clash was due ) for not
holding the gatx class "because he was not feeling well". In bath, cases
it was obvious to L-1 that he was dead drunk when he phoned. In view
of the fact that LIBACON-1 did not phone to L-1 for a whole week, L-1
gave him a ring on Cot 2 and he promised to give a lesson to I-1 at 1630 hrs
of Cot 3.
3.
L-1 explained me that his working schedule in the new scholar
year keeps him busy in the morning and the afternoon, except, Friday
afternoons, which makes it difficult on him to be txix tieing himself
twice a week for LIPACON-1's class which most of the time does not take
place. L-l felt that nothing would be lost if he reduced the Russian
language classes to one per week, which would be more than he ever actually
had in the past. I told him to go ahead and suit himself.
4.
I told L-l that AEDIEHARD was scheduled to leave in about a week
end it would be interesting to ascertain whether LIBACOK-1 knew it. I-1
will show to LIBACON-1 the Excelsior of Sept 25 in which the Sox Emb
farewell party was announced.L-1 felt bed about the fact that he did
not even have a chance to see AEDIEHARD face to face.
5.
L-1 asked could he remind LIBACCH-1 that he promised to make
some arrangements which would enable 1-1 to meet Alla (GLEBOVA /F-13,482/).
and suggest that AEDIEHARD departure was opening the possibility to do
something along that line. I told I-1 that there was no resson to expect
that LIEACON-1 would accomplish anything, but L-1 should be after his on
the basis of his former promise.

SISTONE had two main purposes in attending the
reception: 1) to determine LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to
meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count SISTONE
was successful. Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally
introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by Mr. KAZANTSEV,
the Soviet Chargé. On the second count SISTONE was not
successful. The only Cuban present that he recognized from
mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obviously
avoided any contact with SISTONE, rather furtively staying on
the other side of the room at all times. In all, SISTONE
talked to some nine Soviet Embassy officials that he could
recognize from the mug book and had somewhat extensive con-
versation with three, LOGINOV; KAZANTSEV, the Chargé; and
Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, TASS representative.

obviously a forced chore for her. (Later in the evening she
busied herself pointing out what she thought to be the choicest
items on the buffet table.) Valentin LOGINOV invited SİSTONE
and his wife to visit him in Russia. SISTONE answered to the

effect that this would be wonderful someday if he or the
Russian Government would pick up the tab.
LOGINOV replied
that that was not necessary because all Americans are so rich
they can afford a trip anywhere. Later, talking to SARATOV
(see paragraph 9 below), SISTONE was told that LOGINOV would
be spending three days in New York City. Later in the evening
LOGINOV had his picture taken, probably by a press photographer,
with SISTONE's wife, and he was in general quite gallant with
her. In the little speech following the buffet, LOGINOV thanked

I told I-1 that he should tell LIBACCH-1 that a person he know
quito xixl well 3-4 years ago returned to the US Embassy and that this
Arerican Embassy official was a very close friend of a dear friend of
his (L-1). I explained to L-1 that such news would certainly plense
IIRACON-1 for several obvious reasons, but it was more important to a8-
certain whether LISACON-1 would relay such news to some of his Sov
ecquaintances. If it happens that AXDIEHARD' replacement or another Sov
official attempt to contect 2-1 through LIBACCH-1, it would be an indication"
that LIBACON-1 got the news of L-1's US Embassy contact. "L-1 liked the
idea and will give the story to LIBACON-1.

Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV, the Soviet Military

BOGATYREV seemed to have a forced grin on his face. He
exchanged pleasantries but provided nothing of significance.
3. In the reception area inside, SISTONE greeted Valentin
LOGINOV and his wife, who readily recalled SISTONE and wife
from the excursion to the Ford factory in July. LOGINOV also
recalled that SISTONE was Raymond A. FRADYER's replacement

SISTONE said that he understood that FRADYER probably had
arrived by now. SISTONE asked LOGINOV when he was leaving

Consular gift of a silver plate. He ended his speech by
saying, "Thanks on my wife's behalf and mine. You all have
been very attentive to my great country." About the only
times that LOGINOV seemed reflective and serious during the
evening wore during this little speech and later in saying
good-by to SISTONE (accompanying this with an abrazo).
LOGINOV's last words to SISTONE were said with much real or
imagined feeling: "You Americans and we Russians have to be
real friends in these days of the world."
4. Negatively, $ISTONE did not see LIREALM-1; SAO's
friend, Yuriy VANOVSKY; or Chief, SB's friend, Boris CHMYKHOV,
at the Soviet reception. Since there were over 100 people
milling about, SISTONE, of course, could have missed those
people.
5. prior to the buffet, SISTONE met again Leon (Spanish
version of Lev) N. GOLOUZOV, a member of the Soviet Commercial
Staff. SISTONE had met GOLOUZOV on the Ford excursion as
well, and the two chatted briefly about that trip.

which he obtains from the Mexican press. He added, with a
smile, that he, of course, has to supplement such newspaper
accounts with information from his own contacts. SISTONE
asked if this meant, among other things, getting handouts from
Government offices. SARATOV dismissed such sources as
unimportant. He said this daily resume which he sends home

the TASS office in San Francisco is somehow connected with
the establishment of the Consulate. In speaking of LOGINOV's
three days in New York, SARATOV said he would recommend
three things for him to visit: a good steak house, a good
Chinese restaurant, and Rockefeller Center Music Hall.
10. Somewhat after the despedida ceremony, SISTONE noted
the Chargé, Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV, alone and intro-
duced himself. From a distance KAZANTSEV looks extremely
young for his high position; closer up he looks a little older.
KAZANTSEV was extremely affable when he learned that SISTONE
was a new member of the Cuerpo Consular. He said he is a

member of an equivalent organization among the diplomats and
in that context knows Mr. Wallace STUART quite well. He said
he was extremely privileged a couple of nights previously to
be able to shake Astronaut ARMSTRONG's hand and talk to him.
He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our
countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between
the American Atomic Energy Commission and its Russian equivalent
in working out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy.
While affable, KAZANTSEV does not impart any feeling of
sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, and
reminds one of a second-rate American politician. After the
above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican
airport official, for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached

9. Possibly the longest conversation SISTONE had with
any Russian was that with Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, the TASS
representative. SISTONE was introduced to him by Findley

HOWARD, local Pan American representative. SARATOV was the
only one with whom SISTONE spoke in English. All other con-
versation with Russians and other non-Americans was in Spanish.
SARATOV is a very smooth, gallant man-about-town. He seemed
to really enjoy talking to Americans and other non-Russians at
the reception, and bowed and established rapport with the ladies
of all ages.
He said he has been in Mexico two years,
married, and has one son in the fourth grade, who is naturally
attending the Embassy school and who will be sent next year
to the Soviet Union for his further education. He asked
SISTONE how many children he has and commented on the answer
five, by saying that in his business it is not practical to
have many children.

SISTONE asked him how he gets his news to
send home. SARATOV replied that he is obliged to send home

SISTONE and said to him and the Mexican that he hoped there
would be a rapprochement soon between the United States and
Cuba.

SISTONE cannot figure out why KAZANTSEV made that
remark at that particular time unless 1) he thought the Mexican
airport official was, a Cuban, or 2) he had been briefed by
LOGINOV not only on the fact that SISTONE is FRADYER's replace-
ment, but that FRADYER had somehow been connected with Cuban

11. SISTONE only met Yuriy CHERNYSH, Soviet Vice Consul,
very briefly to shake hands near the end of the evening. He
was easily recognizable from his very light gray hair.
12.
SISTONE was only sure of one Cuban's being present,
Rafael MIRABAL. At one time; SISTONE thought he saw a gentle-
man who looked a little like Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas,
but at second glance he did not think so. There was no doubt
in SISTONE's mind that MIRABAL was avoiding him. On one
occasion) MIRABAL was quite close, within earshot, and may well
have heard SISTONE either talking English to a fellow American
or his wife, or discussing something American.
Thereafter,
every time SISTONE tried to work his way toward MIRABAL, the
latter would shortly move further away. Twice SISTONE talked
i
to people that vaguely looked like they might be Cubans from
the mug book, only to discover in both cases that they were
Mexican.

He is almost baby faced, has sort of a pug nose,. is perhaps
5' 9" tall, is of medium to slim build, and has light hair.
PETROV said he had only been in Mexico two weeks and was
terribly confused by the vehicular traffic, which is much
noisier and extensive than that of Noscow. Although he
speaks Spanish quite well, he said that this is his first tour
in Latin America.
7. Also early in the evening SISTONE met Vladislav
Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, Soviet Vice Consul. He is a fairly
tall, heavy built, athletic-looking young man with a very
strong handgrip on being introduced. KORMUSHKIN was almost
the only Russian with whom SISTONE talked who did not even try
to be friendly. He just stood around most of the evening,
listening and looking very ill at ease.

This man looks very Latin and could mix in a crowd on the
street without any difficulty. He stayed very much in the
background all evening. During the little ceremony in which
he was introduced by the Chargé as LOGINOV's replacement, he
was asked when he had previously served in Nexico by the latter.
He replied he had been in Mexico from 1960 (or 1961) to 1965.

means that if F saw Subject robbing a bank he could not care less because

which concerns and the service he is working for. In view of the
well established fact that LOGINOV is a spy and Subject is his friend (sic)
this matter is of concern for the American Counter Intelligence. Therefore,
would appreciate if Subject stated clearly what was the purpose of his
visit to the U.S. Embassy. Subject answered without hesitation nor
embarrassment that he believed that he made himself clear even at the
Embassy that he wanted to cooperate with the U.S. Service and be of help
as much as it stood in his power. I commented that he would probably ask

Mexico 14, D.F., and his telephone number is 17-88-85. This
man is the husband of a lady he described as Press and Cultural

his recent arrival. SIBAJA claimed that he is a good singer

the kind of man who might be used as a fairly nonsuspicious
access agent to either the Soviets or the Cubans. He obviously
circulates in their social milieu. SISTONE intends to follow
up on this man. He said he lives in Colonia Lindavista, where
SISTONE's wife's relatives are concentrated. He has a son
going to Colegio Tepeyac in that area.
14.
The only Americans SISTONE was aware of at the
reception were 1) Clyde SNIDER, Chief of the Visa Section of
the Consulate, 2) Findley HOWARD, of Pan American, and 3) David
WIESLEY, American businessman and Honorary Consul of Iceland.
15. Considering the fact that SISTONE was only in the
Soviet Embassy a little over one hour and had to spend a good
part of his time talking to SNIDER, VOURVOULIAS, and that real
pain-in-the-neck, Sra. JIMENEZ, he considers his contact with .
Soviets about the maximum that could be achieved under the
circumstances.

Below is translation of document written by LIB C 1 re his friend
HERES who lives in San Juan del do.
"HENARES
A Spaniard born in the province of ASTURIA. During the Spanish Civil
War was taken to the USSR with other children. Completed his elementary
schcaling in Spanish childrens' schools. Entered Leningral University majoring
in history, and following graduation was a given a chair in the sama
deartment. Arrived in exico, I believe, in 1957, with the aid of his sister,
who lives in San Juan del Rio. Is a manager of a restaurant. Henares is a

font of nature and animals. Daring periods of vacation from the elementary
schools, instead of just fooling around as did the otkids, he would work
as a shepherd, water boy, in vineyards, took long walks, read, stran, ani
always tried to be a loner. Therefore, he was not very well liked, was teased,
and once, knowing that he was not a good suim er, was thrown from a steep
bank into the river ALYAZ mother dragged him out. He always loved her,
and to this day has great affection for her. Whenever he visits vexico he
never fails to call on her. Peing acquainted with his character and sentiments,
I would say that now, living in a dead city, he suffers greatly. I suppose
that because of his loneliness he impregnated a stupid, old fashioned, indian
girl. His colitical views are the most liberal, and being an intelligent
fellow, he was never placed in an unconfortable position, altough he was
not fully trusted.
:
I think, that were it possible to use these characteristics, we could
use him to our great advantage."
I toli Subject that we would make no nove whatsoever, until, and perhaps
not even then, he provided me with personal biographic data re the above
individual.

spoke to Subject in a heavy accented broken English
and was delighted when Subject ruggested that they
speak Spanish. LOGINOVS general line of conv was that
the essential thing in the life is understanding and
to be able to understand others one must get to know
them; this in turn calls for having as many friends
as possible. The same applies to countries and nationa.
Before leaving the party LOGINOV stated that he would
like to become friendly with Subject and asked hin
would he be willing to meet with him. Subject agreed
and they met next Friday at the Tecali Restaurant.
b. The conv at the Tecali was to an extent dealing with
the theme of friendship and understanding with an
added emphasis that if there was understanding and,
consequently, friendship between the U.S. and Soviet
Union we would be living in a much better world.
Subject stated his agreement with LOG's views. In a
further part of the conv LOGINOV was interested in
knowing whether Subject had many friends in Mexico'
Subject claims to have stated that he had many good
friends here. (NOTE: It is quite likely that he
bragged about the number of influential friends he had
here). At the end LOGINOV told Subject that he would
like to see him again and Subject asked him to come
to his house. According to Subject, LOGINOV asked
would not the fact of receiving a Sov official con-
promise Subject or lead him into some kind of troubles.
Subject assured him that the receiving of a Soy or
any foreign official could not affect him in no way.
Then, LOGINC asked Subject would they be alone and
Subject answered affirmatively. (Note: At this point
Subject indicated that he received LOGINOV at the
apt at the Ieibits 297). Finally, LOGINOV agreed to
come to Subject's ept.
c. In the apt LOGINCY did not feel at case for some
tice. Intinlly, he did not drink from the Votka which

Without any prelėminaries to speak of, Subj toli me that he had
interesting news for me. As he hesitated for a moment I aksed him if he
had been invited to the despedida this evening. He was a bit shocked and
probably disappointed, busts with a "who, what", but recovered quickly.
and admitted that this was to have been the interesting news - yes he had
been invited and was going. He explained that he had made a phone call to
the Embassy to invite LOGINC7 to his house for a farewell party, but the
latter turned the tables and invited Subj to the despedida. Subj claimed
that he toll LOG that this in reality a "dirty deal", but LOG countered with
the clein that Mesopx Manta in to return urgently and now he was too busy
to consider personal invitiations. (Subj did not appear to be unhappy with
this turn of events.) Subj promised to keep his eyes and ears open and

said, to be better acquainted with alla GLEBO (works at Sovemb), whon he

don't believe he is a nosition to to much about this. I believe he is
cabable of seducing a lot of girls, but I don't see how he could work up
much access to this woman.)
Subj gave a copy of a short caper (ritten in Russian) he worked
up on his friend HENARES who lives in San Juan del ko, near eretaro .
Subje is very andous to have us help this individual but I still don't see
much point in it. I asked Subs is acquainted with anyone at the

amusing.

According to people who may be considered as knowing about

did he know what region of Moscow the street was in. Tanya further explained
that KIRASOV was engaged in some unspecified underground work, possibly.
xit anti-government activity, and that one morber of this group was actually
employed by the KGB. He was not further identified.
4. Subj then went on to relate two other 8 "odd" experiences he had had
prior to his coming to Mexico. They are not worth repenting here.
I told
Subj I would try to locate the afore mentioned street on the Moscow map but
that I did not take any of this very seriously. Although Subj realised that
I was amused by this tale he was not dangered by my attitude saying
he did not know what to make of it himself.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief SB
IFO
SUBJECT
: Chief, CUBA
: Relationship Between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO
1. In response to a conversation between Chief, SB, and the under-
signed, LIREALM-1 was questioned in detail on 25 September concerning
the relationship which exixts between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO with a
view toward possible embarrassment of AEDIEHARD before his superiors.
-2. LIREALM-1 and his wife both believe (but have no proof) that
.It is probable that Gloria PINTO is having or has had an affair with.
AEDIEHARD. Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO's
and know that Gloria is strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD who is both
physically and intellectually superior to her busband. Due to Gloria's
continued friendship with AEDIEHARD at the French Club and other places,
LIREALM-1 feels sure that Gloria's husband, Pepe, does not yet know of
the affair.
3.
LIREALM-1 characterized Pepe PINTO as: aweet, slow-witted and
below average in intelligence. He is a physician specializing in lung dis-
orders, born in the Canary Islands. He considers himself a Spaniard with
the Characteristic Spanish lack of respect for women. He attempts to
tightly control Gloria's activities while, according to Gloria, having
as many affairs himself as he can. Gloria greatly resents Pepa's attitude
toward her. Pepe is basically defensive and would not want anyone to know
if Gloria were having an affair with another man. He would probably deny
it if anyone said so, even if he were aware of it. He would take it out on
Gloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her movements even
more closely.
4. In view of the above, it would certainly appear that there would be
nothing to gain, and perhaps much to loose, by any attempt at exposing her
supposed affair with ABDIEHARD. Since she now appears to be in contact with
SHEVCHENKO, much better to hope for better developments in this case.

was a communist sympthyzer, despite his wealth. He became famous
some time back: by successfully sowing bick: on a hand that was
arpatated in an accident. He is a doctor with Seguro Social.
Mexico since has shown his' tff to the world as Mexico's great
hand surgeon. Ho travels around the world attending medical
conventions and is the principal host to modical conventions
here in Mosco. An elaborate book was published by Seguro
Social on surgery of the hand and Luis' work in that field.
I mention the above since it seems to set the stage for s030023
who might believe that socialism and socialized medicine is
good, because ho himself has profited so greatly from it.
Further, Luis and Sylvia had made it knom for quite some
time that they wanted to have the farewell party for DECHARD
in their home. I always felt that this was due to communişt
sympathy. Now I don't Imow. And I an at a loss to explain why
they insisted upon holding the party. They do not seem to be
close friends of DIEHARD, are sorcahat different in social
and intellectual status, and no longer seen to me to be con-.
nunist sympathyzors.
Luis commented that I DIEHARD's son would probably come
to the prty since they have no raid. Incidentally, he did not
core. He then stated that the boy still ppoaks no Spanish at all.
He added that the boy has lived in Mexico for five years and
before that for several years in Cuba. Luis explained that
the Soviets are afraid to have their children see how the world
really is. Luis added that. Kruschey saw a super-market in
Los Angeles and simply couldn't believe his eyes. Luis was
frankly critical of the Soviets and their intellectual isolation-
ism.
7. DIEHARD MIGHT RETURN. DIEHARD and his wife both con-
ceded that there was a good chance they night come right back
to Mexico. She told no that if she did, sho woul like to teach
me Russian. We had exchanged a fow elementary words during the
evening.

DIEHARD was disappointed when I said I would not attend, but
that this was no reflection on my friendship for hin. I stated
that I folt it unrise for an American to visit the Soviet en-
bassy. I was afraid that the FBI or CIA would learn of my visit.

speeches were rado, or at least semi-formal comments and wishes
of goodluck to DISHARD and his wife..DIEHARD said that his re-
placement would be at the farewell party at the embassy and he
hoped we would all sect his. Ralph Wieganit stated that he
wanted DISHALO's replacement to know that he, the replacement,
would be welcome in our group. Our group is somewhat inter-
ntional and has given us all a chance to exchange views. We
would regels tact with the Soviets. DIEHARD then
mentioned that his replacement is something of a sporstaan..
4. Iuri Schornish. I told DICHARD that I hadn't soen Turi
for a long time. I asked whit had happened to him. He answered
that Yuri hdd been on vacation for a while. This does not account
for the many months, perhaps five or six, that I have not seen
Yuri. I did not press the issue.
5. DISHARD FLIRT. DISHARD seemed to be indifferent to
Popo's procenes. When he danced with Gloria he often secued
vory intimate--dancing close, whispers and girls giggles,
soulful looks. Gloria did not try to control this situation,
but rather participated. By wife later reported that while
dancing with DINHAD to also tried to fit with her, but on
a pore discrete level, holding her too close, squesting her
hand morningfully, etc.

Subject states that he had complained to KAZANTSEV (P-880) about
the shoddy treatment he had been getting from LOGINOV (P-11,712).
Never before had he been forced to "stand in line" for Soviet visas
for his clients. In the past, he had been able to sent passports
to the Soviet Embassy any day--never mind the office hours--and get
the passports back with visa the same day. Subject says that
LOGINOV himself finally admitted that this was because Subject-had-
been uncooperative (meaning that he had refused to let LOGINOV
recruit him). Subject says unequivocally that LOGINOV is leaving
PCS by the end of October and that he is not being replaced by a
newcomer. Subject understands that NECHIPORENKO, who in a former tour
had worked in the Consular Section; will take over as Chief of the
Consular Section when LOGINOV leaves.

Subject says that KAZANTSEV is about to leave (in fact, Subject
thought KAZANTSEV had already loft) and that both a replacement for
him and a now ambassador were on the way. I told Subject that as
far as I know, KAZANTSEY was to be replaced by another concierge Cr
consejero
who would be Chargé, but Subject insisted that an ambassador had
been named and would be coming soon. He did not know who the
ambassador would be.
NIWIFORI
Subject remarked that both IVANOV and NIKITOPOV had left and he
said that NIKITOROV was, he thought, a very decent person.
Subject said that PRIKHODKO (P-2270) had come to see him to say
goodbye. PRIKHODKO had said, almost with tears in his eyes, that
Subject had been a very good friend and that he would never forget
him. He invited Subject and wife to come visit him in Moscow.
Then when Subject asked PRIKHCDKO for his address, PRIKHODKO hommed.
and hawed and said that he didn't really have an address yet but
that Subject could write him in care of Latin American Dopartment of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Subject remarked that PRIKHODKO
was undoubtedly being sincero, but when you came right down to it,
he was just as hemned in and afraid as anything of the others.
Subject said that it was a real tragedy that the Soviet system
made such robots out of good people,

every action and statement of his is recorded from
the moment the transmitter is strapped on him.
b. SABORI should go to such a meet with experession of
a person who is in exceptionally good mood, because
of a business success and he was given a substantial
advance on his commission: After A and SABORI have
their routine two drinks, SABORI will state to A that
he would pick up the tab for the evening ( after being
treated by A so many times ) but he would want to
celebrate the occasion. It would be desirable that A
agrees on e drink or two to please S, but even if that
does not take place, it is anticipated that A would
want to accompany s in his good humors. What ever
be the case, the situation lends itself to a free
talking, critical commenting and some bitching, juất
to play it big. It will be up to us to prepare S as
to how to run the conversation to get out of A a few
statements which he would not like his superiors to
know about.
c. As far as S is concerned I believe that he can be
persuaded to carry a transmitter on his person and
as a reason for requesting it we could tell him that
it represented a complimetary element to the PAQ which
he made on A, because the psychologist who reviewed
him PAQ consider it essential to have a tape covering
one meet. There is no way of hiding the fact that we
will be recording what is transmitted, but we will
not have to give any explanations regarding how it
will be done.

he is ruthlessly ambitious to get ahead. If we are willing to burn SATORI, it
might be advantageous to insert senior Russian speaking staffer as suggested in this
paper (but without transmitter) who will make A offer to think over on long cold
Moscow nights prior to his arrival at a new post. Our offer will consist of first,
sewing seeds of discontent on fact that he is now 42 years old and has not risen
to the heights in his professions that he could have. (He is only listed as 3rd
Secretary while younger men ere 1st and 2nd Secreteries) I don't know his KGB'
rank but it can be intimated that we know his renk could be higher. Telking fast.
that
we could then suggest to A that we will work out a olen in his absence whereby
we can aid his future career by pitting kim in his neth adventegeous situations
such as allowing him to "recruit" a U.S. official at his next post. In return, he
would service our requirements d'ring his tour. Our working relationship with A
could have a time limit with control factors on both sides. "No answer is wanted
now. Report the approach if you wish. The offer will be good upon your arrival
at the new post whereever it is. (A, of course, will thing the talk is recorded

Memorandum
TO:
RIZZUTO through ARCHBÖLD
FERNALD
From:
September 23, 1969
Subject: AEDIEHARD (P-11,712) * Thoughts Ro possibility of Pitching Him
1.
Assuming it was agreed that A should be pitached before his PCS
departure, because there are no indications that he would be more suscept-
ible later to an approach later when he comes to a new post abroad in few
years and, to the contrary, it is more likely that he would be still more
daring, more selfconfident and more determined to advance and solidify
his position within the KGB, I wish to add some views of mine to the list
of possibilities as to how a pitch could be carried out.
ible
2.
My views and thoughts on this subject will be based on the possible
use of existing assets and means. I am fully aware that there will be
plenty of room for improvements, additions and modifications of what will
be said in the following paras.
3.
As far as I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which
we could put our teeth, i.e. we do not posses worthwhile mention-
ing material which we could use to exert a desired pressure on A.
4.
I am inclined to believe that we are in a position to make a
serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing
assets which are targeted against A and that it can be done without taking
an undue risk.
5.
As a nove in this direction I was thinking in terms of having
recorded a SABORI-A meet for which we would prepare SABORI. To be more
specific I have in mind a situation along the following lines:
with

questions before opening the letter of Credit and that
it was essential that the person who arrived here see
A, because that will strangthen S' position in the deal.
I mentioned the platinum deal because it would give
some common ground to the new person being introduced
on the scene, but some other story might be as good.
The new person showing up under the platinum deal
or any other pretext would be a case officer of ours.
I feel that such a person should at first sight show
that he was a Yankee, that he be versed in platinum
or what ever the pretext may be and that he should be
a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe
that after some business talk and after creating an
atmospher of mutual understanding there would be no
problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.
If A takes this fact in good mood and the business
conversation continues in Russian, S would be in a
position to excuse himself as a person who was no longer
needed. It is almost impossible to anticipate what
would be AB reaction to the fact that S wanted to leave.
If insisted that S stay, we will have to accept it.
Nevertheless, S will be instructed to "go to the bathroom'
for a while and the case officer will have to use this
opportunity to drop his cover and go on with his job.
He will have in his pocket a reel of tape to counteract
Ab emphatic refusal ( which we must anticipate ).
f. It may be mentioned that S will not have to know
anything about the existance of the tape and as far
as the case officer is concerned S may have to be
satisfied with the explanation that the c.o. was the
psychologist who decided that he wanted to meet A in
person. Of course, may not bear out this cover, but
that will be at the stage of developedats when we
could not care less.
C. There is no doubt that S will be burned whether the

6.
the things turn out right orwrong, but S will be left
only with guesses as to what transpired between the
case officer and A in Russian.
h. It is the fate of any officer making the pitch to
be burned if the exersice ends in anything less than
a. success. Therefore, it would be worthwhile considering
to get a suitable laguage speaker case officer from
Eqs for this purpose.
I am aware of the fact that that the above discussed scheme has
a quite certain weakness in as much as it is built on and around an untested
asset as S is. Nevertheless, in terms of security and protection of Agency/
***** Station assets the scheme is advantageous, which is selfevident.
7.
It should be assumed that S might come up with some objections
when it comes to introducing another person to A from fear that he would
deal himself out of the game and terminate his usefulness to us. I do
not consider it difficult to put him at ease.

Oleg said that val had not arrived ts far as
he knew. I said I had been training to get ready for
val. I wanted my revenge for last week.
Oleg seemed amused by this and immediately asked
if I would like to play with him since Val was not
here. I agreed. We found a court and played for about
one hour. Olgg won 6-3, 6-4.
Oleg is very athletic in appearance and played
and excellent game for someone who has played for
only two years (if this is true). He has enormous
muscular thighs. It escapes me what sport would.
produce this, other than weightlifting. Weightlifting
is out since his upper torso, though muscular, is far
less developed than his legs. Basketball does not seem
likely to produce his particular kind of development.
Oleg is pleasant. Speaks excellent Spanish. Has
not made any political comments (yet!). Seems more
intelligent, but less extroverted than Val.
Oleg asked if I were with the American Embassy.
I answered"no, I have my own business". It was then
that he asked if I knoew another "Bill" who is in
private business ana who ix has an army rank. Oleg
Khongxxxxxx thought the other person was a major.
.
I left at this point. Oleg stayed on to play
some nore. My wife could not see him and it is not
therefore, known with whom or how much longer Oleg
did play. Val was not seen during the course of the
morning. The Pintos are in San Francisco.

"Eet me (or provide me with) the info I need and I will

there very many other inor questions concerning the

Prearranged meet and S came 10 min early.
NEXT MEET: Friday Sept 12 at Chez Rene at 2000 hrs.
Instead of receiving the Agency Contract from the Moon Valley Corp.
Dallas, Texas, he received a phone call (his phone was connected) on
Sept 10 in the morning and was requested to sign the contract immediately
and return it by registered mail. The caller (Leater MacGhee) told S that
the contract was mailed "Registered-Return Receipt" on Mon Sept 28 ". S con-
cluded that he expected receiving it on Sept 11, but more likely on Sept. 12.
3°
S was disappointed because he counted on showing the contract to
AEDIEHARD that evening and the absence of the contract will necessitate.
another meet with A when the contract arrives. FERNALD repeated to S that
he needed a Xerox copy of the same and decided to meet with S on Sept 12
to debrief him on his meet with A and get a copy of the contract.
4.
S will not have much to report to A when he meets him that evening.
S went to the Hotel Geneve where a friend of his used to be a manager and
was disenchanted when he found out that he no longer worked there. The new
manager did not want to show him the register of guests and his attempt
to spot a girl or girls who lived in the hotel and appeared to be working
bore no results, because all he was able to see or exchange few words were
tourists. S spoke to TANG by phone to inform him that the Luau manager.
wanted to check with the embassy on the size of the add he was to place
in the monthly HISSION. TANG stated that he would take care of that and
he reminded S that WANG wanted to see the article before it was printed.
Other, than to capitalize on the info that Echevarria would be the next
President of Mexico and speak about the platinum desl S had practically
nothing to report.
5.
F repeated the instruction he gave S on Sept 8 with regard to
stalling IS activities with A and as far as the platinum deal was concerned
it was made clear that his fair and square will determine our attitude.

9. Supervisor's comments (continued)
3. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he has been asked to step in where Val failed.
That is, as an American friend, I never invited val
: to my home. He never met other Americans through
me. Note, however, that he never invited me to his
home either--though he did invite us frequently to
various events which were under the auspices of the
Soviet embassy. We did not but rarely accept, One
such occasion was the Moscow circus.
4. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he wants to assure his acceptance by our tennis
group where Gloria Pinto is a possible target. Oleg
has gotten to Gloria, but I, the American who is
somewhat and sometimes hostile to soviets, might be
considered a stumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg, will
try to reach all the other members of the group in-
dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of
our functions will meet with general acceptance.
SCENARIO OF CONTACT
I arrived about 0900 and took an instructor.
About 0950 Olegk arrived to play with and in-
structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to
greet me. He had been pointed out to me by val, but
I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge-
though it is certain that Oleg and val must have
discussed the "players" in their"game" and counted
me as possibly on the other team. That is, I am sure
that val has pointed me out to Oleg, but Oleg would
not have wanted to acknowledge this.
At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor
I was through--I did not want to continue for another
hour. As I was paying my instructor I noticed that
Oleg was paying his. It is very unusual and possibly
even had form to take an instructor for less than
half-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be
free to contrive an accidental meeting with me.
I set a course for one of the several gates
from the courts we were using. I could see that Oleg
had headed for the same gate (this could have been
perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some
thirty yards would bring him to the gate at the same
moment as I (this was not entirely natural).
Since I had an excuse to greet him, having had
him
pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto the preceding
week, I did so. I ask said Good Morning and asked
if kal were here. He looked very pleased (I kthought
possibly relieved) when I took the initiative and
recognized him.

about 3 hours.
2.
NEXT MEET: Sept 10 at 1700 hrs at SAMBORNS-La fragua if 8
does not request to see me earlier.
S was advised by phone from Dallas, Texas, that the Moon Valley
Corporation was able to meet the Sov requirements concerning the platinum
deal and that they mailed on Sat Sept 6 a contract (agency contract) to
S which enables him to purchase 10 ounces of platinum per month from the
Sov seller (an export company ). According to the same phone message
the contract provides for a US$3.00 commission per ounce.
3.
S hopes to receive the contract before he meets with AEDIKHARD
on Sept 10 at 2000 hrs. On his own intiative S decided that he would
want to show the contract to FERNALD before taking it to A. That was the
reason for arranging another meet with F before the scheduled meet with
A.
4.
The generous commission provided for by the contract enables
8 to offer to A US$1.00 per ounce. Even if the minimum required by Sove'
is purchsed a³ 1.- commission per os. would still net $20.000.-, according
to S'estimates. S anticipated that the purchases would go above the
required minimum. 8 was taking in consideration the possibility that
A would not want to accept any commission.and Therefore, 3 came up with
a scheme by which there would be a bank account for A and the money would

and only the copy of the Moon Valley Agency Contrat with S will clarify
many questions one would like to ask right now. Nevertheless, it appears
to be probable that an Agency Cohtrat was promised to S..
6:
In spite of the fact that at the time of this writing one can
deal only with "ifs", it is worthwhile mentioning that S believes that
A would like to facilitate S to get the deal, because in that case S would
be on one hand morally obliged to him and on the other S would had
collected a nice sum of money. In turn this would make A feel that he
obtained a satisfactory control factor over S and the rest is quite ob-
vious. Other than reccurring to methods which are quite rarely used gainst
people an 8, we in a situation of a very inconfortable spectator left with
a hope or a which that A might go for the commission.
7.
As far as S'willingness to give to A the attractive chunk of
money is concerned he is doing it for a double purpose: to please us
(indirect protection of his interest) and to protect his interest directly
by assuring A willingness to help him in getting the deal.
8..
Although, our situation is not pleasant ( if the deal is to
materialize) we are not helpless onlookers. S mentioned that if it comes
to closing of the deal he will have to travel to Zurich, Switzerland, and
for that he needs a passport. How much S is aware of our control positiion
( by enabling him to get a pessport fast or dragging its granting) can be
best illustrated by the fact that he told P that he would certainly put
aside a worthwhile sum for F. Needless to mention that F gave him a dan
dern good lecture when he made his silly statement.
Nilly-willy F was obliged to turn weakness into stregth and S understood
that he could as well forget about the deal ( if it comes his way) if
he would not play it fair and square with us..

SUBJECT:

SECRET
6 September 1969
Recent and Proposed Contact Between LIREALM-1 and AEDIÉHARD
1. : At the 5 September 1969 meeting between LIREALM-1 and Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, the following information was received from and discussed with
LEKEALM-1:
a.
after
f
LIREALM-1, following Station advice in the the recent
incident where AEDIEHARD approached LIREALM-1 with an offer to pay LIREAИM-1
for any information he could obtain from the U.S. Embassy, has avoided
contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club. LIREALM-1's wife, an almost
daily visitor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM-1 to note AEDIEHARD's
activities and associates and report anything interesting to LIREALM-1.
b. Mrs. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-1 that for a number of
consecutive Saturdays, AEDIEHARD had brought a young lady, whom MRS LIREALM
thinks to be German, to the Club as his guest. Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt
to determine the identity of the female, but reported the information to
her husband. She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD'a
pattern of activities at the Club. He has not seemed to single out any
individual as a tennis partner, nor is be frequently seen socializing with
anyone in particular while at the Club.

LIREALM-1 was advised that the Station had learned that AEDIEHARD
will not return to MHHARSH immediately as originally thought, but he will
probably remain in Mexico for another five months. LIREALM-1 was told that
this information was not yet public knowledge, but the Station would like
LIREALM-1 to confirm this if possible. This led to a general discussion of
LIREALM-1's association with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM-1
was instructed that it was not the Station's wish that he avoid contact with
AEDIEHARD, but rather that he not single out AEDIEHARD for special attention
or closely court his friendship. It is the writer's opinion that a rufficient
time has elapsed since the last incident for LIREALM-1 to again renew some
association with AEDÌEHÁRD, and a particularly opportune chance to do so is
available: LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previously been reported)
to a group of tennis enthusiasts at the Club who take turns entertaining each
other in their homes. To date, all the members of this group have given parties
except LIREALM-1. Mrs. LIREALM, following the incident and thinking that AEDIEHARD
was soon to depart, has stated that she did not want to have ANDIEHARD in her
home since he represents a government so opposed to the principles of her govern-
ment, etc. Based on AEDIERARD's extension in Mexico and the fact that the LIREALM's
owe their friends a party, LIREALM was instructed to plan a party for the group
and to include AEDIEHARD and his wife in the group invited. At the party,
LIKEALM-1 should not focus an undue amount of attention on AEDIEHARD, but should
take advantage of the opportunity to renew their general friendship and let the
matter, more or less, take its own head from there. As a first step in this
general direction, LIREALM-1 plans to go to the Club over the weekend of 6-7
September at times when AEDIEHARD usually playa tennis to at least say hello.

3.
A second reason why both LIREAMH-1 and his wife plan to go to the
Club is to see if they can identify the new "girl-friend" of AEDIEHARD.
LIREALM-1 says he almost always carries his camera with him when he goes to
the club and frequently takes pictures of his wife and their friends. Under
this pretext, he will try and take a picture of the girl friend if the oppor-
tunity presents itself where it will not come to the attention of AEDIEHARD.
4. LIREALM-1 is preparing a written report in some greater detail
concerning AEDIEHARD and his relationship with him since the incident. He
will also attempt to see if his can get any more details about the girl fri-
end from his wife.

5. The substance of the above including the idea for the party has
been verbally reported to C/SB and he is in accord with the plan for the party,
which will be, at least in part, paid for out of Station funds.

deeply concerned over the danger Rea China represente
to the world; he advocates that the U.S and Sov Union
Shouldesign a rutunl defense fact and liquidate the
China until there is still time; he believes that
Sov Union and the C.S. are entitled to act in defence
of their own interests and no hell with what the
rest of the world says", he admires the determination
and dyneñisa of Americane
After getting through thi Portion teld Subject does he still
feel that he should get end give LOG the Fab Fiore Directory. se stated
that he wee willing to do what we tell him to do, but he believed that
was
if he came to the nee with Leg on june 25 mithout the directory,
would consider him as worthless, since was not able to obtain something
which he can get in some other way. When commented that the diredory was
a tightly controled matter and to get one would practically mean to swipe
one from somebody desk, Subject stated that be was convinced that LCG.
would not care for a directory which no stole, because he is interested
in subject having a friend in the embassy through whom he would have
access to info, and presenting the directory would be an indication that
Subject had a friend there.
10. Then Subject replied negatively to a theoretical possibility o
obtaining a directory "legally", told him that he must necessarily be
aware of the fact that 10 rould not be satisfied with a statement that
he obtained the directory from a woman or man friend; LOG would insist
in knowing the name and the redress of the person who is his friend
tect pretended not to be convinced about this but did not try to
argue about it.
114
Then told fut
hother head-its/l to
self or not
what he was trying to maneuvre himself into was a double agent role which
is by no means an envious role. A person who is offering his cooperation
to the U.S. under such conditions should be arare that every piece of
info passed to the opposition, in this case LOG, must be cleared end
approved by an U.E. officer which, if nothing else, is a time consiming
proposition. Subject smiling said "time is money". commented that
only productively used time is money.

LTOVAL-1 fet certain that IIBACON-1 was very nervous during the
class and, especially, when he spoke about his most with AMDICHARD AHO
the forthcoming dinner. He went to the bathroom 4 times in an hour and
a half (he usally goes twice when served the sire smount of liquor)
This lead I-1 to sṛeculate that there might be something fishy in the
connection with the dinner, including the roscibility that ABDIEHARD
requested to meet I-1 at IIDACO-18 place and that his wife spoiled
the plans by limiting the number of people.To keep the matter from
developing into wishful thinking I told I-1 that it was possible that
LIRACON-1, felt imbarrassed for not being able to invite him to the
dinner. L-1 cormented that LIBACON-1 had no reason to tell him any-
thing about the dinner and if he kept it to himself there would had
been no reason for embarrassment. We agreed that there was no reason
to speculate, but to wait and sec. I-l stated that his hopes went high
because LIBACON-1 told him that AFDIEHARD tul? stated that his departure
was lostroned and that he did not count on leaving before the end of
December '69. Difficulty in finding a suitable replacement was given as
reason for postronement of departure.
7.
Requirement: In view of the fact that LIFACO-1 is used to
see at I-1s place wisky which doed not have the tax tags (stamps),
because he normally gets his from Octavio ( a Customs inspector in
Natamoros), I-1 requested that I supply him a bottle of wiskey which
entered the country tex free. ( L-1 usually has the Old Far ).
8.'"
For his personal use L-1 would like to borrow a John Flain
catalogue, the issue valid after Aug 18, 169.

space and could not afford to spend the amount money the additional
number of guests would cost. He went on to state that even this way
he was in a quite embarrassing situation because he would not have
money to buy more than a bottle of Castillo rum.

L-1 thanked LISACO-1 for thinking of him and added that he would
not have been able to come for dinner that evening because he had to
give a class which he was not able to cancel. LIRACOK-1 felt releaved,

The ex-Haitian Ambassador, Julio Jean

left before he could talk to him. In view of the
fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN ceased to be Ambassador.
of Haiti a long time ago, the undersigned feels
that his presence at the Polish national day
celebrations has some significance. He remembers
that PIERRE-AUDAIN was also present at the cele-
bration of the Czech national day this year. In
other words, the Communists have made it a point
to maintain contact with him, probably in view of
the fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN may return to Haiti if
something happens to DUVALIER and may secure a
position of some importance in his country.
2. The President of the Consular Association, VOURVOULIAS,
told the undersigned that he would contact LOGINOV at the
Soviet Embassy to see whether the latter would agree to a
joint celebration of both the undersigned's and LOGINOV's
departures in a party to be held for both of them at the same
time. LOGINOV is not scheduled to leave Mexico until
September 1969, a departure postponed from the original
schedule of late July or early August.

Dear Valya,
(LOGINOV)
Mexico, 2 Nov. 1970
It doesn't seem to be true, but it is. I am writing a letter ((to you)).
Several times I got ready to write, but couldn't because of either laziness
or too much work.
One and a half years have gone by since you left. My wife and I remember
you often, more so, because there are practically all new and some very serious
faces in the Embassy ((now)). I went to the reception on the Red Army Day, but
since I didn't have an invitation, they didn't let me in, even though CHERNYSH
and NECHIPORENKO tried to help me. As you see, my brother, times change. In
our days, i.e, when you were here, everything was simpler and I would say even
gayer.
The most important

news, at least for me; is that Tege is expecting. We are waiting for the
"Parisien package" approximately in February. It would be nice to have a son,
since we are not going to produce more children. But if it is a girl, that too
would be nice. I will feel as though I am in a harem.

1. As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to
why they had included Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-0285412)
in their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd or expelled from
various countries in the past five years.
:
1
2. In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the
periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader's Digest
of 1 January 1972, of a book fatitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by
John Barron. From this article it was learned that the KGB officer
LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students at the time of the
student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968. In March 1971, when
five Soviet officials were PNG'd from Mexico, it was believed that
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV was among those ousted.
3.
:
Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy'
in Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel from August 1965
to October 1969, INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV's
name erroneously appeared in their list of Soviets who had
been PNG'd.

Date of Heet: June 21 at the Cafeteria J at 1100 hrs.
This meet was held in lieu of the prearranged meet for June13
which L-l cancelled by phone. Due to tue peculiarities of L-18 working
habite I was not able to reach him by phone until June 20 at 1600 hrs
when this meet was arron ei

previous pick up
On June 18 1-1 was without car and he felt obliged to cancel
the meet. He stated that he felt happy to have made up with his wife
and to be living again home. He told me about his arrangement to go
to the Russian show with LIOVAL-1 and wife. He described me the develope-
ments as LIOVAL-1 reported them to me.
*** With regard to his 2 "contact" with LOGINOV which he hinted by
et
phone, there was nothing to it. 1-1 was at a party given by Andrea
CATAÑO (P-13,546) on June 14 at her house and YURIY CHIPNISH (P-13,042)
was there and they exchanged few words about LOGINOV ( see the attachment).
L-1 stated that he was not with LOGINOV since the encounter in Cuautla
and did not speak to him since the attempt to reschedule the lunch which
was missed on May S. Therefore, the story L-1 gave to LIOVAL-1 on June 13
ahout TCGINOV being disappointed with the fact that he had to return
home, etc has, quite likely, no connection with any recent develo
ther, it.
aeftare obvious that I-1 did not know then about the fact
is
that LOGIN was postponed 3 4 months.

1-1 stated that A. CATAO and her mother told him that they
had expected BOGATYZREV (P-11,351) to attend their party, but he neither
came nor excured himself by phone. L-l did not know how it came to the
point that ECGATYRE was invited to the party. L-1 considered it as
a significant fact that CERNISH came to that party with his wife. L-I
interpreted this fact to the effect that CHARNISH Cave up the iden of
having a remence with ANDREA CATANO, but wanted to preserve and maintain
friendship with her and her family. According to I-1 it is quite certain

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: James SABORI
1. At 1300 hours on 20 June Subject, on the recommendation
of Bob JOHNSON (formerly with LNERGO in Guadalajara), came to the
Embassy and contacted COS. Subject apparently has known JOHNSON
and had asked JOHNSON to whom he could talk in the Embassy about
a delicate matter. JOHNSON had recommended COS, identifying him
only as a First Secretary
2. Subject identified himself as an insurance salesman who
is in Mexico as a tourist and who apparently hopes to do some
business here. He is of Italian origin and apparently has lived
in Texas and California. At the present time, he is living at
Bahia de Santa Barbara #20, apartment 308. Telephone number is
31-53-93.
.
3 Subject's story was that he has been in contact with
Valentin LCG INOV (P-11,712) (he showed COS LOGINOV's care) and,
as a matter of fact, has had no less than 12 contacts with him.
He is scheduled to have dinner with LOGINOV tonight (20 June) at
2000 hours but he would not say where as he was afraid that COS
would contact the CIA people and surveil him. He is also scheduled
to have dinner with LOGINOY on 25 June.. In the past, they have
had dinner at such places as La Cava and the other Tecali Restaurant.
contact with LOGINOV. His reason for conta which c
4. Subject refused to say very much about the nature of his
COS was to get a
copy of the latest Embassy phone directory
had
asked him for. He wanted to bring it to LOGINOV so that LOGINOV
would do things for him He did not say exactly what LOGINOV
could do for him except that LOGINOV had invited him to visit the
Soviet Union. LOGINOV has also given him several bottles of vodka
He was not worried about what LOGINOV could get out of him beca
after all, he was just an insurance salesman. In other words, he
seemed to be enjoying playing games with LOGINOY and was not
particularly ready to cooperate with us. COS said that he would
have to contact the "proper people" to see about the phone book.
Subject asked COS to do that and said that he would call cos at
1800 hours on 20 June to get the answer. He also said that if the
"proper people" were interested, they could contact him at the
address and phone number given above

Impresión general de sus hábitos de comer y fumar. (Marque la
descripción más apropiada).
Persona de enorme apetito y preferencias bien definidas.
Come y fuma con bastante fruición, pero tiende a ser un
poco rústico y tosco. Es fácil imaginarlo comiendo grandes
emparedados y tomando cerveza con sus amigotes on la taberna
del barrio.
9.03.02.
Persona de enorme apetito y preferencias limitadas. Come
y fuma con fruición pero sus modales son definitivamente
toscos y rústicos. Es fácil imaginar su aspereza con el
camarero que le sirve comida extrafia o preparada de manera
desucada.
9.03.03
Persona de comer sensual que conoce todos los restaurantes
y sus especialidades. Se empeña en que otros prueben los
platos que 61 ha descubierto. Come con visible placer,
saborea sus cigarrillos, y aunque raramente se muestra tosco,
se preocupa más de su comida que de sus modales. Es fácil
imaginarlo cocinando y sirviendo platos especiales a sus
amigos.

Persona de comer rutinario que generalmente hace lo que

de lo que le gusta o no le gusta. Fuma cada vez que
puedo, pero más mecánicamente que con fruición. Por lo
general trata de adaptar sus modales a la situación pero
posiblemente con alguna torpeza y sin disimulo. Es fácil
imaginarlo comiendo algo a la carrera en algún puesto.

se achispa o embriaga. Mende a decir a otros lo simpá-
ticos que le son y a veces les pregunta si lo hallan sin-
pático. Da la impresión de poder hacerse muy repulsivo si
se pone muy beodo.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LIREALM-1 CONTACT WITH AEDIEHARD
The attached report from LIREALM-1 was received on 16 June 1969.
LIREALM-1 verbally added the following comments to the information in the report:
8.. Although they have at attended any social functions together
since their last encounter, it is LIREALM-1's opinion that AEDICHARD is
generally avoiding direct contact with him. Only once since LIREALM-1 told
AEDIEHARD that he was insulted by PEDIEHARD's request that LIREALM-1 work
for him has ADDIEHARD asked LINEALM-1 to play tennis. LIREALM-1 has seen
AEDIEHARD on various occasions at the French Club, but neither have made any
effort to speak to the other.
.
AEDIEHARD requested permission to bring a Mexican couple to
the 21 June quards dinner. This was a strange request since the party was
intended to include only those who had participated in the tennis tournament
at the Club. Permission was granted, however, and LIREÄLM-1 will attempt to
determine the identity of the Texican couple at the party.
Both LIREALM-1 and his wife ane convinced that AEDIEHARD is
avoiding introducing his Soviet friend to the friends of LIREALM-1's wife.
She has placed herself in a position, on a couple of occasions, where AEDIEHARD
had to be almost Impolite in not introducing his friend to LIREALN-1's wife,
but, he has chosen not to do so.
2%
Based on the instructions given
between him and AEDIEHARD, he has not gone REALM-1 after the last incident
out of his way to engage AEDIEHARD
in conversation or cultivate him socially. This night explain AEDIEHARD's
standoffishness and/or his apparent unwillingness to introduce his new friend.
More information on this subject will be available after the 21 Juné dinner.

that he usually left his seat about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby
for some time. She did not know where the contacts were actually made..
Once she and LOGINOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by
LOGINOV as "Col. Sergio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse himself
to have a private conversation with the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was de-
scribed by AEMIDRIFF as about 40, tall, no moustache or glasses, thick,
curly hair, appeared to be of Spanish descent. The woman with "Col.
Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife
(which AEMIDRIFF doubted because, as she put it, he didn't treat her as
one would a wife, but rather as a mistress). AEMIDRIFF knew nothing more
about this Mexican and never saw him again.
On another occasion, LCGINOV and AMIDRIFF met an American in
front of the Futurama theater. LOGINOV introduced him to her as "Cal.
Michael." AMIDRIFY stated that he was dressed in civilian clothes. He

GOLGUZOV - ADMIDRIFF stated that COLCUZOV used her in the
same manner, i.e., took her about 3 times in all to Cine Chapultepec, then
left her during the movie to make some sort of contact.
Debriefing conducted 12-16 May 1970:
Concerning Scrict Contacts in the Mexican Folice: AEMIDRIFF
1
stated that she overheard GOLCUSOV and DYCMIN talk about many contacts which
they had in the police here. She said she had also overheard KOLCYYAKOV,
BAKULIN, AND CHAYKHOV talk about how many good police contacts the Soviets
have. However, each specific example which ARMIDRIFF could give concerned
some nou-operational favor which the Soviets could get taken care of, c.g.,
when the Soviets wanted to get something through Aduana; when some Soviet
vas missing and police cooperation was needed; getting advance notice when
some demonstration hostile to the Soviets was about to take place, etc.
She was not able to recall any hints that Soviets had operational contacts
in the police; agents reporting on what the police were doing; assets who
assisted Soviets operationally in some way. However, AEMIDRIFF thought
the Soviets probably have such assets.
Concerning Soviet contects in West German Police: AFMIDRIFF
recalled that when she went to Germany as interpreter for Soviet surgeon
and textbook writer, Pablo AMASOV, in January 1963 (they went to Cologne

AIMTIRIFF stated that Igopoldo ARENAL, whose wife is the
daughter of David Alfaro SIQUIEROS, is another Soviet asset who is handled
by KUPLYANOV (she heard VANOVSKIY talk about this). AFNIERIFF said that
ARENAL works with Eduardo MAUJO (econcile consultant for "Minera Conti-
nental; S.A.", mentioned in Commercial Office). She also stated sho
know that ARAMAL went at times to the Embassy to see KURLYANOV. AFMIDRIFF
said that ARENAL goes to Moscow every year or so.. (ARENAL identical
with Leopoldo ARENAL Easter, 201-117999).

Possible PCX Contact - ALMIDRIFF stated that she
was told by imniel Montiel (Daniel MENDEZ Montiel, 201-230951), the Soviet's
chauffeur, that his brother, who is a Central Committee mumber of the FCM
and who worked on the PCM publication "La Voz de Mexico," was in contact
with KUPLYAKOV. In addition, AEMIDRIFT stated that she believed that
Armando VERLUGO (iden with Armando MARTINEZ Verdugo, 201-851726) had an
uncle, also named Armando VERDUGO, who is First Secretary of the FCM and
who is in contact with KUPLYAKOV. At least this was strongly inferred by
Montiel, according to AEMIDRIFF. (Editor note: Arnoldo MARTINEZ Verdugo,
201-064254, who is brother of Armando, is First Secretary of PCM).
AEMIDRIFF stated that KUPLYAKOV always seemed to be very interested in and
knowledgeable of what appeared in "La Voz de Mexico" and in the PCM publi-
cation "La Epoca." She stated that,

AEMIDRIFF stated that
LOSTROV went out at nights often during this period and told her it was
to make "
pooram also stated that his working this period
was some of the most dangerous he had ever donc. ADMIERIFF was certain
that these "contects" involved in student riots. AMIDRIFF related that
once at Auto Cine, LOGINOV made a meeting with a group of youths who came
in another car (Falcon). Another time, some 2 or 3 days later, LOGINUV
had MITOPOLSKI give him some shotguns which MITOPOLSKI had charge of.
LOGINOV got the guns about 2200 or 2300; the guns were returned the next
during
morning. Others who seemed to be going out all the time at night
1 the student riots (and talking about their meetings in general the next
morning) were EOLSHAKOV, KORYOUSHKIN, NIKIPOROV. ADMIDRIFT never heard
mention of money being passed during this period (i.e., to Soviet accets
involved in riots) nor any mention of any names or positions of assets
(This not in agreement with some of Pan James info). CHMYKOV seemed to be
involved also.

"Pax
West Germany en Comercial Ministry usines), the Soviet Ambassador in
West Germany stated that the Embassy, hed sore paid agents within the West
German police who helped them to protect the Sovicts (in context that it
was dungureus theres some Soviet official could be kidnapped by the enemy,
etc.) AMERIFF noted that AMASOV was quite old and very.pro-regine.
Miscellaneous operational notes
-
ADMIDRIFF had no knowledge
of Soviet safe houses or safe apartments. She stated that many Soviet
visitors stayed at the Hotel Virreyes or in two other hotels near the
Soviet Embassy (she couldn't remember names). She did not know whether the
Soviets had any sort of special arrangement or contacts in these hotels.
AEMIDRIFF stated that she had attended several parties at
which Mexicans also were present (she recalled specifically parties at the
homes of KOLOMYAKOV, EAKULIN, LOGINOV) and in each instance the Soviet
officer, at some point during the evening, had a private conversation with
a Mexican guest. (Unfortunately, AFMIDRIFF was unable to recall the names
of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is
no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational
meetings.) AEMIDRIFF commented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands all
ways went off together and talked business, and if wives approached, they
stopped their conversation.
Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970:
KORMUSHKIN
-
AEMIDRIFF commented that she thought KORMUSHKIN
made operational meetings in the Bremen Bar, since she often say hía
sitting in that bar, wearing dark glasses and trying to lock inconspicuous.

when he met with sque "youths" in private conversations.
However, AHIDRIFF
stated she did not ever hear any mention of may n of Coviet contacts
in relation with the student disorders, may mention of the level of in-
volvement of these conitats in the student organizations, any mention of
Soviet guidance to the student movement, financing of the student movement,
or the like. She really doesn't know that the Soviets had any contacts
with direct access to information to these sctivities, but she strongly
assumes that they did, based on their level of activity and the strong
tenor that LOGENOV and other ease offieurs gave to the idea that the contects
they were making were dangerous ones for them to be seen with during this
period.

Debriefing conducted 1-6 June 1970: ADIDRIFF questioned
re 1958 student disorders again, for clarification previously reported
details. She stated that the Soviets had some different types of rifles
in the Commercial office which served as samples of guns which they were
trying to sell commercially in Mexico. One night about 11 o'clock, during
the period of student riots, LOGINOV Came to the Commercial Office with
MITOPOLSKI (AMIDRIFF was there watching TV). They got "some" rifles
ABMIDRIFF could not see how many or what kind. They took them cut in some
sort of bags. The next morning "some" rifles were returned to the Con-
mercial Office, but AEMIDRIFF doesn't know whether all of them were
brought back. She doesn't know whether or not LOGINOV might have been
duty officer for the Embassy for that night.

AMIDRIFT stated that ECHIPOREDO's trip back to the USSR
during the 1958 riots day well have been to report on the riots. However,
she didn't know that this was the case and noone specifically told her so.

: 11 June 1969
COPIES MADE
1. As arranged last month, I picked Subject up on the corner
of Nilo and Melchor Ocampo lateral at 1100. We drove to the
Tastee Freeze in Polanco for coffee and met until 1300. Next
meeting will be on 9 July at 1100, same pick-up place.
2. Subject seems like a real diamond in the rough with
earthy and sensible philospohy. I was surprised at his promptness
and the fact that he doesn't forget meeting dates, even though
they're arranged a month ahead and there's no 'confirmation. He told
me that he frequently gives away candy and stuff to the little Sov
kids who come in, feeling that they'll remember it years from now
when they're fed a line of propaganda about the West and that this
will make an impression and help offset all the bad things they
hear.
3. I brought with me the Soviet mug flash cards to have
Subject identify those who come into his store frequently and
whom he refers to by his own personal crypts (since he usually
doesn't know their names). Following is the key to identifications:

The following comments from CAS/HEX on References

"George", CAS/HEX obtained the following information from
reliable sources concerning the 3 and 4 October 1969 mecting

Soviets at the Soviet Embassy on the morning of 4 October
1900, which is when the debriefing of Subject took place.
Although the presence of some of these Soviets have been
reported previously in Reference A, the context of the ob-
servations could indicate that possibly one or more of these
individuals was involved in the interview of Subject on
October 1939.

Notes from the Debriefing of AEMIDRIFF - 20 to 23 February 1970
1969
10) Valentin Sergeyevich LOCENOV: He left on the 6th of October for
Moscow, six months before the completion of his tour.
He was head
of the consular section and the lover of "aya: Apparently the
causes for his sudden return were 1) having been "aya's lover; and 2)
not having had good results from his work and, according to Faya,
some kind of failure. He was in "exico on two different occasions.
i
She states that during the time she was having an affair with Valentin
LOCINOV, who was chief of the consular section, he occasionally took
her out at night to places where she knows he nage contact with persons
who scored to be Mexicans. She says that she doesn't know with which
persons he made contact, nor if they were "exicans or not, because she
never saw them, but that he, on several occasions took her to these
places: the Cinc Mod on a Lomas de Tecamachalco, the Cinc Futurama
in Colonia Lindavista, the drive-in theater called Autocinema del Valle,
the drive-in called Autocinera Satelite and the fine Tlaltelolčo.
When
she accompanied him to those places, he left the car and she remained
in it; that he would no for 10, 15 or 20 minutes to converse with those
people. He never told her who these persons were nor what they talked
about.

Subject had the following comments and observations to
make as we went through the cards:
SOLOMATIN (P-7452): departing PCS on 25 June 1969. He's suffering
with an ulcer. He takes sleeping pills constantly and has been
complaining about the great amount of work he has. Said his
mother in the USCR (who neither smokes nor drinks) is very reli-
gious. She keeps a picture of Christ hidden at home and many of
her women friends come to pray in front of it. SOLOMATIN did not
come to Subject's house for dimer on 1 June as planned because
he couldn't get permission. SOLOHNTIN's wife will have 3 months
off when they return to the USSR in order to rest up from her
work here, but SCLOITIN will have only 22 days off. Ha's going.
to take charge of some wood working shops with lathes and other
machinery.
PODI SHOY (R- 1368): aile, speaks very little Spanish.

The two Personality Assessment Questionnaires on AEDIKHARD

A wero unfortunately not received until 30 September, by which
date we knew from a visa cable sent the State Department by the
Babassy in Hexico City that AEDIFHARD was departing PCB one week
thereafter, on 7 October. Reference B confirmed that departure.
2. Since but one week was available for the completion of
the MKCRUSH assessment, and its transmittal to the Station, we
decided not to go ahead with it. The PAQ's have been made a part
of ARDIKHARD's file, and should he appear in the future outside
the USSR, an assessment can be made at that time.

2. Per Reference cable, Subject was scheduled to replace
Valentin Bergeyevich LOGINOV (201-285412). Subject will be
replacing LOGINOV in slot but apparently not in position. Oleg
Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO (201-305870) was introduced at LOGINOV's
farewell reception at the Soviet Embassy as LOGIROV's successor
as Head of the Consular Section." Since we do not have passport
coverage on Air France flights, we were unable to obtain Subject's
passport, which would indicate his title.
3. Subject was escorted into the Soviet Embassy on his first
day in Mexico by NECHIFORENKO.
4. Photographs and further information on Subject will be
forwarded when received.

VIA
SUBJECT
1. The undersigned attended the celebration of the
Polish national day at the Polish Residence on insurgentes
Sur on 22 July 1969. The following points were the most
significant:
The only Soviet the undersigned could
Identify was Col
was Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV,
the Soviet Military Attaché Someone the under-
signed's wife talked to mentioned the presence of
the Soviet Consul, but this certainly was neither
Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy CHERNYSH, and the
undersigned did not meet that person.
b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not,
they were not in attendance.
C
Jiri SVESTKA, of the Czech Embassy, was
there. Per SB Section briefing, the undersigned
mentioned his departure and told SVESTKA that at
least he would remain in Mexico. SVESTKA said that
this would not be the case, that he is scheduled
to leave within 15 days for Czechoslovakia The
undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his
Czech friend in which the latter told him that he
expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer.
SVESTKA dented ever having said this, pointing
out that he was glad to return home. The under-
signed made no further comments.

Contact Report
Subject: LIBACON-1 (P-4805)
Date of Meet: May 21 at the Paris-Mexico Restaurant
Käy 22, 1969.
ATT)
This meet was held in lieu of the one scheduled for May 14
which L-l postponed by phone. Lal was at the pick up place 10 minutes
before the scheduled time but I was there still earlier and I observed
nothing suspicious in terms of stakeouts or surveillance. The meet lasted
75 min. NEXT MEET: Wednesday May 28 at the same pick up place.
2.
As we nett L-1 stated that he cancelled the last week meet
because he was seized by one of his nervous crisis of hysteria followed
by depression (sic). He immediately added that be prepared for me nothing
because in his condition he was not able to do any work.
3.
In the restaurant he kept on describing what effect the nervous
crisis has on him and he added that he still felt depressed. During his
description he did not indulge in dramatizing the matter.
4.
I asked him what happened to the lunch he was supposed to have
with LOGINOV and he repeated what he told me by phone on May 8 and added
that LOGINOV was to call him but did not do it. He added that if LOGINOV
had called during the past 8 days the phone would be answered only if
his wife was home. I told him that this fact was a reason for him to
ring up LOGINO7, because, es we discussed and agreed on the last meet,
it would serve no good purpose to L-1 if LOGINOV would characterize him
as a not desirable person from the Sov point of view. He commented that
be believed LOGIKOV was a friend of his to the extent that he would not
do such a thing to him. I countered by stating that he insisted in con-
sidersing LOGINOV to be his friend, but what ever LOGINOV asked from
him he turned him down with a NO; to preserve good will of a person it
is necessary to meet some of his requests and the best is to do it when
it does no harm to anybody and at the same time does not get L-l in-
volved in any of LOGINOVs schemes. He agreed with my reasoning, as he
did at the last meet, but it is to be seen what will he do about it.

To change the subject I neked L-1 Farel Wernal return. He said

Speaking about Karel he recalled the fact that Carola HIRSH
an Ecuadorian girl of 22 approx. returned to Nexico and she will be
taking an intesive course of Russian from L-1. He stated that he spoke
to KARTASUK about this girl: she was here and worked with the Olympic
committee as an interpreter; after the Olympics she went to Zcuador and
now she returned here; she came with her mother who found her an apartmant
in Rio Elba where they had a worming up party on Friday kay 9; her
father is a well to do phisician in Quito, Ecuador; she has no permit
to work in Mexico which means that her father will pay the expenses of
her stay here; in view of his nervous crisis he did not keep in touch
with her, but he believes that her mother had returned to Quito by now:
LOGINOV knows her from some of the parties Lal and his friends were
giving during the Olympics or briefly after them.
7.
He forgot to tell me that he was with Andrea CATANO (P-13,546)
after she returned from her trip to the US and Canada and she told him
that she definitely broke with CHERNISH (P-13,042) by telling him that
she had a boy friend about whom she is serious and who is a jealous type;
he (0) is wellcome to come to her (parents) home when he wishes, but
she is in no position to reet with him out.

I asked L-1 wes it possible that LOGINOV, who according to him

have attempted to recruit Juan Luis ALVARES, director of the language
school on Tiber, during the past 2 months. L-1 stated that he doubted
that JLA would even want to see LOGINOV because LCG in many instances
ignored JLA's requests through L-1 to pass by the school. L-1 went on
to say that if by incident LOG got hold of JLA and made an attempt to
enlist his services, L-1 was positive that JLA would had turned him down.

(NOTE: This leaves unsolved what was L-1 speaking about when he spoke
about the good time LOGINOV and JLA had together at unknown date).

I tried to explain to L-1 that he should do some writing for
us along the lines of max our previous agreement. He promised.

they held nine ops meetings.
2.
Bruce H. FERNALD took over LIBACON-1 on March 26 and

Further,
LIBACON-1 was SGSWIRLED with satisfactory results.
LIBACON-1 was motivated to work for us and he was mentally prepared
to accept another handler. During this period the condition which
LIBACON-1 had placed on his agreement to work for us was respected
(1.e., that he would not be asked to report on his personal friends
such as Spaniards, his students, or Mexicans to whom he wis
emotionally Fttached). LIBACON-1 did complete for KANTASUK a

C. HEMA-36881, 8 April 1969
Forwarded herewith is Bruce H. FERNALD's progress report
on LIBACON-1, covering the period 30 January to 15 August 1969.
2. As FERNALD's report indicates, steady progress has been
made in developing LIBACON-1 into a responsive agent. LIBACON-1's
credentials vis-a-vis the Sovieta are excellent, and be is learning
to use these credentials to the Station's benefit. He was
reluctant at first, possibly because he did not want to do the same
thing for RVROCK that he refused to do for AKKICK. Patient handling
by FARNALD seems to have overcome this reluctance, and LIBACON-1
now responds well to direction.
3. 80 far, there seems to be no reason to suspect the sincerity
of LIBACON-l's relationship with RVPOCK. He developed strong
personal affection and professional respect for both KARTASUK and
FERNALD, and his turnover to Douglas F. DITMANSON on 14 August 1969
represents an effort to strengthen the emotional attachment, which
seems to be so important to him, by providing him with a case
officer who speaks his native tongue. And, although LIBACON-1's
private life is a mess, we will match closely to see that this does
not cause any greater problem than occasional missed meetings and
delays in completing assignments.
4. In the next phase of LIRACON-1's activity, we expect to
concentrate on two things:
A. Strengthening the ties with AEDIEHARD (there have been
indications that ANDIKHARD's tour may not be ending shortly
after all, in which case he will remain a prime Station target).
b. Spotting additional agent prospects, as suggested by
Reference A.

when it comes to emotions he acts like a toon-ager. LIBACON-1
is aware of this fact and he ascribes it to the fact that he grew
under conditions of regimentation and moral terror; and when he
found himself in a world in which people live free and there are
no restrictions on personal activities, as long as they do not
violate the laws of the country, he remained possessed by the desire
to enjoy this freedom. Fortunately, his personal immaturity
affects his work for us only to the extent that he occasionally
may not complete an assessment; but when he does do a job he does.
it very well.
12. To conclude: Although LIBACON-1 has his problems,
there are restricted to the area which does not affect his reliability,
dependability and loyalty to us and our cause. It is felt that
LIBACON-1 will be still more productive and easier developed when
handled by a case officer speaking Russian;i.e., the language of
his formative years.

7. FERNALD succeeded in convincing LIBACON-1 that he should
maintain social or friendly personal contact with AFDIEHARD and his
colleagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his
or their demands, or at the other extreme, without saying no to
everything they mention or ask for. LIBACON-1 followed instructions
and went to AFDIEHARD's office to ask him why he had not called
him for ten weeks. The result was that LIBACON-1 had two luncheon
meetings with ALDIEHARD in July, and on August 8 LIBACON-1 and his
wife were dinner guests of AEDIEHARD and his wife at their apartment.
The AEDIEHARDS agreed to come to LIBACON-1's place for a farewell
dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD
will meet, for a luncheon on August 29.
8. FERNALD insisted from the beginning of his handling of
LIBACON-1 that the latter prepare bio sketches on the MHHARSHers
ho know personally and on Spaniards who had lived in the USSR.
LIBACON-1 prepared bio sketches, which are actually personality
assessments, on AEDIEHARD, IDENTITY A, IDENTITY B, IDENTITY C, and
IDENTITY D. The latter two reports showed that he would also report
on two Spaniards who are close friends of his, in spite of his
earlier conditions. Further, FERNALD instructed LIBACON-1 to contact
good friend of his (IDENTITY E) when the latter returned from a
longer trip to Czechoslovakia. LIBACON-1 carried out the assignment
well and reported (orally) about IDENTITY F's observations, impressions
and conclusions concerning what he saw and heard during his ster in
his country. IDENTITY F is also a good personal friend of LIBACONS
9. From the above it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has developen
into a person who has confidence in us, and he accepts without
reservation that we know what we are doing.
10.
Then,
In analyzing LIBACON-l's written reports it can easily
be seen that LIBACON-1 takes his assignments seriously and when he
makes a statement about a person he is scrupulous about drawing
only that conclusion which can be corroborated with facts. LIBACCN-1
17 equally serious and reliable when he reports about his mestifgs
with AEDIELAND: He first reports the course of the meeting and
reports ALICHARD's statements. verbatim, as much as possible.
he uses b- area knowledge and the knowledge of the person to relay.
the actual meaning of the statements. FERNALD not only believes
that LIBACON-1's reporting is reliable, but he also feels that ore
can depend or. LIBACON-1 to use his knowledge of the area and resple
to separe the appearance and verbiage from the facts, be they
good er bid.
11. An assessment of the moral and political reliability of
LIBACON-1, from the point of view of his work and activity on our
behalf can only be favorable. The same cannot be said when ore
views his procial life. In this field he has many problems, which,
generally spearing, are a result or the fact that while he is
intellectually mature (or at least adequately mature for his age),

As much as L-1 is a compulsory talker, during this meet be
was rather on the quite side,i.e., he spoke when he was asked something.
He had only 2 drinks and he tokk some food with them. He was interested
in leaving on time which was pleasant news to me.
11.
On the way to his car I asked L-1 what he thought about the
death of 16 Sov Generals in 15 weeks. He commented to the effect that
a publisized purge of big wheels is intended to silence to opposition
and this may be necessary in view of the fact that a number of soldiers
will start returning from Czechoslovakia and their stories would be
the opposite (what the government used us excuse for invading Czecho.

trying to determine whether LIRACON-1B statements to
L-1 may be an additional indication to that effect.
As far as we know LOGINOV it would be in line with
his recent behavior if he approached L-1.

e. If LOGINOV, or whoever it may be, disclaims knowledge
about L-1 - YATSKOV friendly relation, L-l will speak
in terms that this fact ought to be a common knowledge
in the Sov Embassy.
f. If the person making the approach accuses I-1 for
trying to buy a Sov official (PY), L-1 pretend that
the approacher is grossly mistaken and will open
barrage of questions to determine what was known
here about the PY case. If the correct sum involved
in that case is mentioned, or place the pitch was made
or other detail(s) indicating that the approacher is
cognisant of this specific case, L-1 will politely
ask what the approscher wanted from him and will not
hesitate to tell him that the same offer applies to
the approacher.
g. If LOGINOV makes the approach under the pretext of
wishing to maintain friendly relation with L-1 and
admite knowing PY and having heard about Pys friend-
ship with L-1 he will be treated friendly and L-l
will invite him to a dinner and let him talk. In
such a case it would be obvious that LOGINOV would
want to pass L-1 to somebody else.
h. When, whoever it be, would attempt to recruit L-1
he will stick to his guns of being an American patriot
and will turn him down by stating that he was able
to make a better offer to the recruiter.

Subject: Rafael VIDIELLA Riz (F-4805)
Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,712) ✓
ATTACHMENT to TURNOVER · Report
May 15, 1969.
Source: LIOVAL-1
On May 2 Rafael gave a language lesson to LIOVAL-1 and on
that occasion he stated that LOGINOY had taken Juan Luis, Director
of the language school on Tiber, for a day of having fun. It was not
olear whether Juan Luis and LOGINOV had a night on the town or they
went out of town for a whole day "to have some fun"."
2.
_
Rafael told L-1 that he did not understand such an attitude
of LOGINOV, because he considered LOGINOV to be a good friend of hist
he was surprized that LOGINOY did not invite him together with Juan Luis,
in fact, he could not explain to himself how something like that could
happen.
3.
Rafael went speaking about LOGINOV for some time about how
good he is basically àn a man; how pleasant companion he is and what
a good friend he is.
L-1 pointed out that there was nothing factual nor significant
in what he said about LOGINOV, but L-1 was puzzled by the fact that
"out of the blue sky" Rafael was speaking about LOGINOV and kept on
speaking and speaking.
5%
L-1 believed that Rafaelo pride was hurt that by the fact that
LOGINOV ignored him, especially, when there was a chance of having some
fun. Therefore, L-1 told Rafael that it was possible that LOGINOY wanted
to invite him too, but was not able to reach him by phone, which would
not be unusual in view of the fact that Rafaol is practically never
home.
6.
On this name occasion Rafael asked LIOVAL-1 if he would be
kind to pay him the lessons which he owed him. In view of the irregularity
of Rafael appearances to give lessona L-1 was not certain whether he
owed anything or not. Rafael corroborated his request by stating that

- 2 -
his wife writes down every payment Rafael receives and the book shows
that no payment was received Rince Jan or Feb 27 (P does not remember
which month was mentioned). L-l stated that if it so, then, Rafael must
be right. Because he was short of cash he paid him M 150.- and stated
that he would pay the remainder the next time, 1.e. the next lesson,
which was scheduled for Wed kay 7 at 1700 hrs. ( NOTE: Rafael had
A meet with RHP on the same day at 1620 hra, and it was him to pick up
this day and time. Rafael came to this meet on time ).
7.
The fact that Rafael did not show up for the lesson was no
surprise to L-1. Nevertheless, about 1830 Rafaels wife phoned to L-1
and asked to speak to her husband. When L-1 stated that he was not there
she commented that he was supposed to be there at 1800 hrs. About an
hour later she called again and L-1 had to state that he did not come
at all. Then, the requested I-1 to give to Rafael the sweater of her
daughter which was accidently left at L-ls place. Of course nothing hap-
pened, but since that moment L-1 did not hear from Rafael nor his wife.
L-1 pointed out that this was unusual, because if Rafael skipps a lesson
he calls the next day and never later than the third day to apologize.
Further, the sweater which Rafael was to pick up from L-1, according to
the wife's statement, was a part of their daughters kindergarden uniform.
L-1 concluded that he was inclined to believe that Rafael got angry with
him or because he questioned the correctness of the claim for payment
or because he placed him on a spot by telling his wife that he did not
show up at L-Ps place.
8.
L-1 was told not to take the matter so seriously since there
was still a chance that " and his wife were on a war path and they
had no time for anything else. L-l was requested to try to contact Rafael
or his wife as soon as possible. L-1 considered that May 15 (Teachers Day).
would be the best time to do it and there was no objection on his choise
of date Rince it offered a botter chance of finding. Rafael home.
9.
L-1 was also requested to bring to Rafaels attention that the
irregularity of lessons inconveniente him quite bit on one hand and on
the other Rafael loses the money........
10.
Comment by PHP: The fact that L-1 pointed out that Rafael talking
about LOGINOV does not mean that anything happened recently, still oalla

Briefs on Keet Held Hay 7 from 1630 to 2035 are.
When came I asked till that hour he can be with me. He said 1630.1
At 1815 I paid the bill, but he insisted that we stay a little longer
and for the the rest he would pay the bill: he had 2 additional drinks
while I had my third coffee and a drink.
As we got together he told me that he was on kay 3 with his
wife at Cuautla and as he was enetring the pool area LOGINCT was leaving.
ICG cornered him for a 15 minutes talk which consisted of pressurising
LIFACON into making some arrangements that LOG would be able to meet
LIOVAL-1. When LIBACON turned him down LOG insisted that they have a lunch
on Thur. Hay 8 at the restaurant El Perre Andaluse ( or similar ) at
the Copenhagen about 1230 hrs. LIRACCH accepted.
LISACON brought me a bio sketch on 10107, which was an
interesting paper. We discussed the paper which enabled me to obtain
explanations and facts on which LIBACON based his general statements.
LIBACON readily gave me info on Prof. E. WEAN. There was
not much, but sufficient to ascertain that he did not attempt to
-ithhold info from us.
(This was test- moglasher details mil)
He also gave me some info on KAFEL WENSEL tho is presently
conducting a tour of Mexicans through stope and was in Prague with the
"group a day before Dubcek was kicked out...
Re teachers of Spanish at the Sov bother then his mother
LIFACON did not know anything but promised to ask his mother on Sat

Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,712)
ATTACHMENT
May 8, 1969
:
Source: LIRACON-1 (P-4805)
1.
On May 3 Source went with his family to Cuautla to spend
day out of town. There, as he arrived he bumped into LOGINOY who was
leaving. They talked 15 minutes.
2.
LOGINOV asked Source was he still giving language lessons to
that American (LIOVAL-1). As Source answered afirmatively LOG told Source
that he would like to meet LIOVAL-1. SOURCE: stated that LIOVAL was not
only a student who pays his lessons but was also a good friend of Source.
Then LOGINOV became quite blunt and agressive : he outright demanded that
LIBACON introduce him to LIOVAL. LIBACON tried to reason out with LOGINOV
that by meeting LIOVAL he would achieve nothing because LIOVAL was
a good family man, a person conscious of his responsibility for 4 children,
liberal in his way of thinking but definitely a patriot and a person
who is attached to his way of life and could not care less about Socialism.
LOGINOV then insisted that he and LIRACON have a lunch together "next"
week to talk this matter over. LIBACON agreed to lunch with him on May 8,11
.., a day after he meets with me.
LIBACCH told me that he would stick to his guns and refuse
LOGINOVE request to introduce him to LIOVAL. One of special reasons for
doing so, in addition to his desire of not getting involved with that
gang (KGB), was that he considered LIOVAL to be a friend of his and
would not want to do anything which could make LIOVAL suspect that LIBACON
wae a KGB collaborator.
4.
1
Other, than the fact that LIOVAL exists I know nothing about him,
but the sole fact that he is an agent of our forced me to assume that
he was picked up for a good reason and that we must have an objective for
holding him. Therefore, I felt that it would not be wise to let LIBACON
shut the door to a possibility ( NEw as much remote as it may be ) that
we counted on the porribility that LIOVAL be approached orcontacted by
a Sov official. Purther, I kept in mind that we would not want LIBACON to
slip into a double agent role. Therefore, I instructed LIHACOH:

--- Image 104-10174-10065_page_63.jpeg ---

2 -
8. He wishes to be on friendly terms with LOGINOV, but
certainly it is not a friendly attitude af LOGINOV
asks him something impossible. (Try to get LOG to
do explanaing),
d. Repeat description of LIOVAL's personality as he • did
in Cuautla and ask what can LOGINOV possibly achieve
by meeting LIOVAL. It is anticipated that LOGINOV
may be brief and say that this would be his problem
and that all FILIED LIBACON had to do is to arrange
for an introduction.
c. LIRACON will insists that he does not want to get
involved "in that kind of business", especially,
because it was clear to him that even if LOGINOV
achieves nothing, he lost nothing, but LIRACON is
a sure loser because he would lose & friend and
possibly get tagged as a Sov spy.
d. If LOGINOY does not break off his insisting at this
point, LIBACON will state that he would agree on a
plan, if LOGINOV had one, by which LIOVAL would be
in LIBACON company, but no introduction of LOG ETOY
as a friend of LIBACON would be made. We played it
back and forth discussing various possibilities, but
important was that LOGINOV should come up with a
plan and that LIOVAL be given a possibility of saying
to LIBACON that he did not want to come
After the lunch LIBACON will go to his institute
and I would phone him there to find out at which point
the conv with LOGINOV ENTED.

Subject: Postponment of Valentin LOGINOV - LIBACON-1 Lunch.
Source: LIBACON-1 (P-4805).
1.
In accordance with the prearrangements I phoned to LIRACON-1
to the language institute at 1455 hrs to hear how did the scheduled
lunch go.
2.
LIBACON-1 stated that a student of his postponed his
lesson for a half of an hour and that he phoned to LOGINOV to come
to the restaurant they were to lunch about 45 minutes later than they
had agreed to meet there. LOGINOV told LIBACON that in that case he
prefered to postpone the lunch to the beginning of the next week and
that LOGINOV would phone to LIRACCN-1 to set the date and time.
3.
According to LIBACON-1, LOGINOV sounded friendly on the phone.

CONTACT REPORT
SUBJECT-
DATE OF MEETING
:
BESABER (P-8777)
10 April 1969.
1. In response to BESABER's phone call, I met him at
his hotel room in the Aristos from 1430 until 1545. Next
meeting will be on Tuesday evening, 15 April at home.
2. Subject had nothing new to report on contacts with
BENOXers, but said that he is now raring to go on any require-
1 ments I might levy. He said that all of his financial problems.
are now solved (as I surmised they would). Essentially, he has
sold 50% of his business (INZA) to a syndicate-group that is
paying off Subject's debts. They will construct a big new
factory complex in Cuernavaca to bring all of Subject's
manufacturing enterprises under one roof and double capacity.
They're also going to open up offices and a showroom on Insur-
gentes Sur. Subject figures he will probably stay active for
a couple of years more and then sell his remaining 50% for
about a half million dollars.
3. I told Subject again that I am now anxious for him
to establish a social relationship with SPYRA (P-6601) and
that I am no longer interested in his developing MAJCHCHRZAK
per se. I suggested that he might use MAJ simply as an entree
to meting SPYRA, ostensibly to work out a cultural program of
Subject's grandfather's music as mentioned previously. Subject
said that he would get on it right away and would try to call
the Ambassador on Tuesday when Subject is bad in town.

prepared to have Subject in a position to give them gifts in
the event Head-uarters approves the plan to bug some of
Subject's Trojan horses. Unless therd is some reasonably good
contact established in advance, his presenting gifts will
appear too contrived. Subject agreed and said that he would
give them a phone call soon to try to get together for drinks.
Judging from past history, CHIYKOV will be ready to see Subject
for a night on the town in August.

retainer for three months (Jan., Feb. and March) and agreed to
have the balance of $3000 for him on Tuesday. He gave me a
pile of hotel bills and other expenses which will be charged
against the $3000 revolving fund he has outstanding. He asked
me if I could get him a case of champagne, a couple of bottles
of cognac, a bottle of gin. I told him that I'd see if these
are available and that, if they are, I would charge them against.

val apparently waiting for me to make first move.
I saw that Val was not playing, but looking for a part-
ner white talking to Meche Pinto and an other girl. He
was two courts away from me. I finished playing with
my spikenk opponent. I couldn't see walking over to
Val and invite him to play. He knew I was finished.
He also owed me an opology for the cancelled luncheon
date.
I shouted loudly to a ball-boy to find my favorite
trainer. Val dashed over to say he would like to play.
Excuse for missed luobb. I "What happened to our
luncheon date", I asked with no smile. Val said that
Dimi had been bitten badly by a dog. I told Val that
I had already heard that story and that Dimi had been
bitten nearly a week before our date. Once again I :
did not smile and gave him little opportunity for
a gradious acceptance of a poor excuse. It was clear
that I was annoyed. I could see from Val's expression
that he was embarrassed and off-balance. He has a pecu-
liar facial expression when he has been put at a dis-
advantage.
T
val admitted that the bite had been much earlier,
but he explained that the would had become inflamed
and he had to take Dimi to a doctor. I saw Dimi and
he had one of the smaller Bandáids on his arm. He
seemed to be having no discomfort.
I accepted val's excuse tacitly.
We played. Unfortunately Hal won 6-3, 6-1. I
remind you that I switched to my left arm some time
ago and am still at a disadvantage. I still apologize
for letting the barbarian win. I had to leave at
1145. Immediately threeother men invited val to make
a fourth for doubles. I had hoped to talk to him when
we finished.
Conversation, I finally had to interupt val while
the men werd still warming up and take him to a corner
of the court.
I told val that I had honed to tell him something
at the lunch and on several other occasions but was
alvaya interupted. Now I wanted to tell him what I
had in mind. I wanted him to understand that his
nolitical jokes nad embarrassed me. That I did not
want to create a acono and had never commented on
them. But I would not tolerate them in the future.

PLACE ACQUIRED: Office of John Francis
REPORT BY: John Francis
Telephone call to myoffice. Gloria called to say
she was having some trouble finding clients for my
business. She asked when she could see me. I suggested
immediately and she arrived about one hour later.
Personal shat prior to business. Gloria followed
good Mexican custom in chatting lightly before getting
to the matter about which the meeting was called.
Meche and San Luis Potosin I asked Gloria if
she ware going to San Duis Potosi this year for the
Holy Week tennis tournaments. She said that the had
planned to do so but was unable to find some one to
go with her at the last moment. Pepe did not want to
go, and would not let her go by herself unless accom-
panied by several other women or by Meche. Meche re-
fused to go saying she would have no fun if with her
mother and planned to go to Corpus Christt by her-
self.
Pepe to Europe again. Gloria volunteered that
she was annoyed with Pepe. She deplores his Latin
attitude about the double standard. She has been
prohibitted to take several brief trips to various
cities in Mexico to see friends and family. She is
not welcome to accompany Pepe on his trips. Yet he:
will soon take another month off to travel either
to Europe or to South America. Gloria said that she
has been waiting all these years for her children to
grow up so that she could go with Pepe on his trips.
Now that they are grown up, she finds that she still
is expected to stay home.
•
Gloria watched carefully. Gloria must account for
her time very carefully to Pepe during the day. And
under no circumstances can she stay out after dark.
Pepe apparently disapproves of Gloria working for me.
He does not like the idea that she will be visiting
businessmen throughout the city both in their offices
and homes. He has expressed his disapproval, but
Gloria has chosen to ignore it.
Wants to send Meche to U.S. Gloria wants to fight
the attitude of superiority over women that Latin men
have, but on behalf of her daughter, not herself. Gooria
feels that she will never be able to enjoy anything
close to equal treatment and consideration with Pepe.
But she feels that her daughter should escape from
this Latin degradation. Two or three years working
in Now York or San Francisco is Gloria's dream for

I parked my car three blocks from the meeting site and arrived
in the re at 1255. Subject was already seated at a table waiting. We had
lunch and remained there talking until 1445. He mentioned how much ho appreciated
the two books (in Russian) which I looned him and said that he was nearly
through with the last one. He said he would turn them over to VICTOR. (I
had already informed him that he would be meeting a man named VICTOR during
-
my absence). He asked if we could obtain for him the three other books
written by the same author who wrote "Cancer Ward". He said "Cencer Vard" was
the second book written by the author. The 1st book was "First Circle",
2nd was Cancer Ward, the 3rd was "
Ivans", and the last was "Easter
He commented on how favorably impressed he was by the 2nd book. I said I
would give VICTOR this information and I thought we could probably turn up
with some of them.

No luck with business. Gloria seems very enthu-
siastic about working for me. Not so much to help me,
but to give herself an excuse to get out and do some
thing. Further, she wants to determine whether she
can actually do something other than raise children.
She was married when very young and has never worked.
She hopes eventually to start some business of her own.
She probably wants to have a shope of some kind.
Working for me is a trial for herself. She hopes to
prove to herself that she can succeed in business and
meeting people.
The approach she has been taking with my business.
has been unsuccessful so far. I have given her the one
which is most time-consuming and one which I would not
have been able to do by my self. There are other apporaches,
but I have not outlined these to her as yet.
We discussed her approach and some modifications
of it. We agreed to review her sales approach after
the Holy Week and decide whether to proceed along
different lines.
LOGINOV. P-11712.
Discussion of Val. Having completed our business
I raised the matter of Val. I reminded her that I had
explained to her some time ago that I was annoyed with
Val's treatment of me in public, namely his flagrant
attempts to recruit me in the presence of mutual friends..
I told her that I still hadn't had a chance to talk to.
val in private. I repeated that all I wanted to do was
make it clear to him that I held him in great esteem as
a person, valued his friendship, was not interested in
assisting his government, and wanted him to stop jeo-
pardizing our fttendship with his offensive approaches,
whether subtle and implied or direct and coarse.
I told Gloria that I had planned to have lunch
with Val today. I enjoy Val's company; rarely have a
chance to chat quitely; don't like to eat luach by
myself, and looked forward to explaining to Val my
position before he completely destroyed any chance.
for us to continue as friends.
Not aware of accident to Dmitri. I told Gloria
that val had excused himself from our lunch date due
to an accident to his son. She did not know of any
accident other than the dog bite the previous week.
Gloria said that his declining my invitation
might have been an afterthought. That he did not want
to hurt my by being seen with me in a public place.

i
Avoids "hurting" his friends. Gloria then told me
that val never accepted an invitation to have coffee with
her or Pene or to dine out. He explained to her that it
could hurt her to be seen with him. She gave an example
of when she was invited to the ballet with val and a
group of friends.
After the ballet, Pepe and Gloria invited Val to
join them for dinner. val declined. Pepe and Gloria.
went to the Hoyo 19. Shortly after they arrived, Val
and a large number of embassy officers also arrived.
Val steered them away from Pepe and Gloria. Shortly
afterwards a man arrived, sat at a remote table and
took notes while watching the Soviets.
Val works mornings only. Gloria mentioned that
Val is in the embassy only in the morning. This was
in response to my statement that I had tried to call
the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap-
pened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would call
in the afternoon. She added that he of course works
in the afternoon, but outside the embassy. I said "try-
ing to buy gringos". She said "trying to convince
Mexicans".
COMMENTS
It seems to me highly unlikely that val is
really concerned about the welfare of his friends
seen with him. It seems quite clear that he con-
siders Gloria and Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential
assets. He does not want to be seen with us because
we would lose our value to him. He told Gloria that
they should confine their contacts to the French
Club. This seems to confirm the suspicion that he
believes that this is a secure place to meet people.
It is possible that he checked with his colleagues
and they were of the opinion that my choice of the
Llave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed us
to too many Americans.
I feel that Gloria has served a very useful
purpose in this matter. If she is working for val,
which I doubt, she is in a position to see that my
business is indeed legitimate, time-consuming, and
with considerable financial potential. Further,
she is in a position to relay to val my unwillingness
to cooperate with him and his governemtn and my threat
to take the matter to the embassy if his harrassment
continues.

Concerning ANDREA CATANO: 1-13571)
About ten days ago ANDREA went to Commercial Mexicana to do the weekly
grocery shopping. Subject dropped by her house while she was gone. Shortly
after arriving at her house, she called home and he talked to her on the phone.
She said that she had some problems at the store and asked if he could come
down and bring, some money.. He went with her brother, and on arriving at the
store found her in custody of two managers and a Policoman. They had caught
her trying to walk out with a stolen jar of face cream (she admited it) and
she did not have the money to pay for it. Subject talked to the managers, telling
thom that she was just a young girl, etc., and convinced them to do nothing about
it Rafael paid for the face cream and they took her home. (Hafeel thinks
this is a very unusal side of her character that he has never seen before).
ANDREA has not mentioned CHERNYSH to Subject since my leat report.
Rafael said that he will begin to pump ANDREA for some further information (in
a discreet way). As far as he knows, she has not seen CHERNYSH lately. (perhaps
since the party on 1 March).

Concerning Rafaels MOTHER AND HER WORK AT THE EMBASSY:
"
(I asked Subject several questions about his mother, but he dodged them.
He seemed unwilling to discuss her, and after several tries I stopped pushing).
Rafael said that his Mother has one particular student in Spanish (at the Embassy)
who has repeatedly expressed the desire to meet and become friends with Rafael.
His Mother likes the man (her student) and said that she will shortly invite him
home for dinner so that he and Rafael can become acquainted. (Rafael by now is
suspicious of any Embassy official who wants to become friends). The man is.

t
season for meeting. I find it very difficult to
talk on the tennis court. Last Saturday was to exec
no
tion. We are either playing tennis or sumbundee by a
group of our friends. There is something I've wanted
to say to you, to make cicar, for several wooks, and
the only way I could be sure of having your undivided
attention, in private, was this lunch.
Several
Dr. Gonezi luncheon, your offer of money.
weeks ago, at Luis Gomez' house, you offered to dive me
a large sum of money if I could help you and your e-
Hassy. You made this offer in front of a number of our
mutual friends.
I realize that your offer was not entiraly port
but not enticaly an jest. The more I thought abou
offer, the more it bothered me, the madder co.
you did was put me in a very embarrassing position. You
suggested that I commit treason against my country, and
you made the offer in front of our friends. The fact that
I chose not to create a scane could have been inter-
preted by our audience as possible interest in your
offer.
Not interested in your offer. In the event that
you have any doubts, let me make it clear that I am not
interested in your offer. I find the offer offensive and
provocative.
Iffection for Val. Both my wife and I like you and
Alexandra. And my boys like Dmitri. We would like to
maintain your friendship with you. But you are seriously
jeopardizing that friendship.
Uninterested in politics. I am not interested in
politics. I realize that this is your business. Well,
that's your problem, not mine. I am a business man and
devote all my time to business. Even so, I don't have
time to learn all there is and all I need to know about
doing Business. Any spare time I have I will devote
to learning more about business. I cannot afford the
time to prepare myself for political discussions with
you or anyone else.
Avoid religion and nolitics. Even when a discussion
touches upon something about which I think I know enough
to comment, I will not discuss politics or religon h
friends. I do not believe it is possible to pursue those
tonics without upsetting someone. There are too many
other things about which one can call safely, tem
dony, viris, etc. Purthermore, I an ad

PLACE ACQUIRED: Telephone call to my office.
Telephone call. val called me at my office. I assume
the call was from a public telephone booth, since thera
was considerable background noise of traffic. He would
not identify himself in to my secretary, but said that he
was a friend.
Invited me to drink. Val asked if it would be con
venient for me to get together this afternoon for a
drink. I checked my schedule and said that today would
not be a good day. Instead I suggested that he be my
quest for lunch on Wednesday.
Luncheon date. I told him to meet me wednesday it
1400 hours at the Llave de oro.
There was much discussion about how to find the
Llave de Oro. He was not familiar with the restaurant,
nor with the passage with its restaurants and shops.
I had to explain that it was bordered by Liverpool,
Genova, Londres and Insurgentes.
Camera not the reason. I assumed that val's call
was going to be attributed to his interest in selling
his camera through me. Therefore, I referred to his
camera and reminded him not to forget it. He said that
this was not the reason he called and that he really
wasn't in a big hurry to sell it. He said he wanted
to chat with mel
I told him to bring the camera anyway since had
just this morning spoken to my friend who owns a bargra
store and was sure I could dispose of his camera for
him. He did perk up then and show some interest in the
camera.

I repeat, I am not interested in discussing holid
with you or anyone alse. I value your friends t
much to risk it that way. But there is something cloe
at stake.
Rick to American businessman. Your provocative
statements to me in public can make it difficult for
me to do business here. I think there is a great op-
portunity here to do business, and I want to take -
vantage of it. You are jeopardizing this. I have
studiously avoided political involvement here. You
make such involvement inevitable.
Threat to co to embassy. If you continue to
harrass me, I will go to the US Embassy and report
your harrassment to the Security Officer. I will
even ask to see someone in the CIA. And if I don't
get satisfaction there, I'll go to the Nexican.
Foreign Office and tell them my story. I'll ask
them to see that the harrassment is stopped and
that I be protected from further provocations.
Would prefer not to do so. There are several
reasons why I would rather not do all that.
1.
2.
First. It would probably put you on the
spot. This would serve no real purpose
since someone cisc would simply take over
your assingments. And I consider you a
personal friend, and would not want to
see you in turn harrassed by the Foreign
Service or denied entry to the United
States. I would hope some day you might
be assigned to the United States and
see it first hand.
Second. I have had very little contact
with the embassy. I have very little
confidence in civil servants. They usually
are working for the government because
they could never survive in private busi-
ness. This may or may not be the case in
your own embassy. The exception that
proves the rule is our economic section
which I have found helpful on various
occasions.
If I were to report you to the embassy,
I would probably be harrassed by all the
little functionaries far more that you
have been able to do..
☐
If the CIA knew that I ha
had a Soviet for
a friend, I am sure that they would have
all sorts of ideas about what should.
say to you. This one of the reasons
I have never invited you to my home--
and probably never will. I do not wai
the CA to know of our friendship and
to try to use it.

to
First. I don't think you people are raulle
Locomplishing anything of value. If the same
afount of money that is now spent on espionnage
were diverted to competitive free enterprise,
the standard of living of both countries would
rise to levels where no one would have the time
for the present suicidal foreign involvements.
As a businessman I know that if you can't
fcasure an activity in dollar profits, is
should either be revisca or discontinued.
Second. The end-result of doing business with
the CIA would be to get you to defect to our
side..
From what I know of you, and of life in the
United States, you would not be happy in our
country.
Oh, if you get in trouble somehow with youn
own peopl, by all means, offer your services
to the CIA, but, please, leave me out of it.
But just for money, don't come to the US.
They would probably offer you a fortune for
your little secrets. The government has no
idea of how to place a value on things and
are delighted to spend the taxpayers money--
fórtunately I no longer pay US taxes--\cki-
· can taxes are high enough. But don't do it.
You wouldn't be happy. It's a great country.
We have wonderful people. They'd probably
do everything possible to make you con
fortable, but you would never be happy.
If a CIA man ever offers you money to defect
or to give up your few secrets, tell him to
STICK IT UP HIS ASS. And that's what I'm
telling you to do! STICK IT UP YOUR ASSA
DON'T WISH LAIN LUCK. I realize that if you keen
trying, someday you'll succeed. That nothing ventured,
nothing gained. Someday you will find an American who
will be willing to work for you. There is nothing you
could ever give him that would make him really happy.
For his sake, I don't wish you any luck.

playing singles when I arrived. I had a singles tournament
myself and did not join them until an hour later. He then
formed a doubles group. I played with Pepe Pinto, and val
played with Gloria against us.
As is always the case, there is very little oportunity
for conversation during a tennis match. Val did make a few
stupid comments of apolitical nature, but entirely harmless,
such as, addressed to me, haven't you any control over your
friends the Whiz Chinese?
I did not get a chance to confront Valentin about his
sorvocative comments and how they jeppordized our friend-
ship.
val asked me if I had given any thought to his request.
the previous week. I could not believe that he was going to
open the matter about his offering me money for "secrets".
Therefore, I was genuinely stupid about what request. He
reminded me that he had spoken of a movie camera he wanted
to sell and which I had stated that I thought I could dis-
pose of it for him through friends of mine, on consignment.
I told him to bring me the camera and I would see what I
could do.
I then told Val that there was something I had wanted
to talk to him about anyway, land hoped we could get together
sometime scon to do so. He stated that he would not come to
the club tomorrow. He offered to take me to lunch sometime
during the week.:
This is not exactly what I had in mind for an informal
and not too pleasant statement of my position about his
apporach to me. But I feel it can be used and will achieve
the desired effect. Unfortunately, he might spend the text
few days wondering if I am about to accept his approach.

Commission acent. Gloria and I have been talking
for some time about what the might do to keep herbeir
busy and make a little money. I offered to discuss the
matter with her months ago in either to hire her my-
self or find a job for her. This luncheon date was to
explain to her what job I had for her.
Discussion of job. The first hour was narx spent
discussing the job I could offer m. This would in-
volve her following up on a list of Americans and
Englishmen in the D.F. to whom I sent some promotional
literature recently. These are potential clients for
ono of the services of my business.
I gave Gloria a looseleaf notebook with conies of
all my promotional literature to date, including bonish
translations of the pertinent literature. I also gave
her a couple dozen envelopes with a complete set cach
of literature and contracts.
She is eager to start. She wants to test her abil-
ity to deal with people. Once she has built up her self-
confidence she might leave me to start her own business.
We agreed that this would be best for her, but in the
meantime I was certain (and am certainl) that she would
be able to find some clients for my business.
Confidential. Gloria asked me if I had told anyone,
including my wife, about her possibly working for me. I
said that I had not. She prefers not to toll anyone un-
til she knows if she is qualified or not.
Since that time, in recent days, it appears that
she has not only told her family, but has been kidded
about the job. Pepa even scolded her, saying that
married women should not work. Gloria said she was
simply ignoring his Latin attitude.
Mention of val. Gloria mentioned val first in an
offhand comment about his departure soon for Motton.
My comment aboval. I told Glória" that Val had
annoyed me the last time I saw him, two Sundays aso.
I said I didn't know whether he was serious or jest
kidning. But the more I thought about it, the more it
bothered me. I finally decided that be right have been

CONTACT REPORT
FROM
SUBJECT
Samuel J. KARTASUK
Rafael VIDIELLA Ruis (P-4505)
A meeting was held from 1130 to 1430, 11 March 1969, in Chalupas Restaurant
on Ave. Reforma, one block West of Reforms and Prado Norte. The date and
hour of the next meeting will be established by telephone. Subject will pick
up Kartasuk on Reforma, in front of the Anthropology Museum at a specified time.
1.
I parked my car three blocks North of the Chalupas and walked to the
meeting site arriving there at 1125. Subject was waiting at a table reading
one of the Russian books I had previously given him. We met, talked, and conducted
our meeting over a period of three hours and then parted company.
2.
The initial conversation was general. He at first commented on how
well he liked the two books he had received from me, and made some statements.
on the truth of their context. We ordered some breakfast and I then asked him
if he would mind filling out the questionaire (PRQ) I had with me, explaining
that it was merely routine. He readily agreed and I gave it to him and helped
him fill it out. (PRQ submitted on 12 March). After completing the form I
brought out a list of questions I wanted to ask and began going through them.
He answered all of those he could, providing the following information:
Indy A. (FAU) MARTINEZ, OWNER OF THE PLAZA HOTEL:
Rafael does not remember MARTINEZ full name but promised to
obtain it at the first opportunity. MARTINEZ has a wife and son, The wife
originally comes from Santander, Spain. His son (no name remembered) is about
18 or 19 years of age. (8 years ago, now about 26) and at times was helping
around the desk of the hotel when Refsel was teaching his father Russian. (1960-
1961). Refael gave MARTINEZ Russian for about 6 months, during which time
MARTINEZ learned to speak, and understand fairly well. NAMAZ Niver discussed
why he wanted to learn Russion with Rafael, nor did they talk politics, either
Russian or American.

JUAN LUIS mentioned to Rafael that he liked LOGINOV, and they seemed fairly
friendly. It was at the end of this period that Rafael was introduced to
LOGINOY by JUAN LUIS en 101NCY terminated his lessons he no longer visited
the Institute. JUAN LUIS often sent his regards to LOGINOV via Refael, and
asked that LOGINOV come to see him. This was mentioned by Refael, but LOGINOV
1. continually told R-fael to "forget it", but did ask Rafael to return the regards.
Rafael never questioned LOGINOV on why he did not go back to the Institute, but
as far as Subject knows, LOGINOV has not been back. Rafael has had many
discussions with JUAN LUIS but he has never mentioned any other Sovietė in
Mexico. As far as his politics go, JUAN LUIS is a confirmed Leftist in ideas
but Rafael would not call him a Communist. Rafael believes that Juan Luis
was merely a friend to LOGINOV and had no direct relations with him other than
their association through lessons.
C. Andrea CATANO (P-13.546):
Andrea has mentioned to Rafael that she met CHERNYSH (P-13,042)

at the Space Exhibit while she was working there. She also met several other
Soviets there. She became friends with them and invited them to her house.
for a dinner party on two occasions. Rafael, invited by her, went on both
occasions. On the first occasions there was a Russian woman, blond, about 36
years old named VALENTINA (LNU) who spoke very good spanish; a man named
MISHA (LNU), supposedly an Electrical Tech from DUBNO Space Center near Moscow,
about 37 years old and tall, who spoke excellent Spanish and who later wrote s

about 37 years old, thin, nervous but with a lot of vitality and personality.
Boris spoke excellent Spanish also, and Rafael thought it very unusual that he
drank American Whis'soy and Coca-cola, (R-fael says this is unusual for Russians).

left shortly after dinner. Rafael said he drank a considerable amount and left

him over on other occasions. On one occasion CHIRNYSH brought another Soviet

When Rafael met PRIXHODKO (P-2270) at the Plaza Hotel, PRIKHODRO later mentioned
that he had some business with MARTINEZ concerning Tourists and Tourism, but
did not expound on the Subject. MARTINEZ never discussed his association with
PRIKEODKO and Subject did not ask. During the latter part of 1962 Rafael

lessons, but that he was very interested in learning German as soon as possible.
Martinez said that he was currently (then) taking lessons, but that he did not
like his teacher. (Did not say who his teacher was). Rafael offered to bring
a teacher from his Institute. Martinez mentioned that the German Olympic team

would be staying at his hotel. Shortly after Rafael brought a girl from the
Institute named Gerda (LNU) to see Martines. While there they were invited to
lunch and met three Mexican men and a tall German who waid he was a representative
1 of the german teem. They had lunch, conversed about general things, and Rafael
and the girl left. The girl later said that Martinez had continued taking German
lessons from his old teacher. This was the last time Rafael saw MARTINEZ,
Rafael could supply no biographical data on Martinez, or any further information
on any connections with Soviets. Subject has not heard any other Soviet mention
either Martines or the Plaza Hotel.

I chose this opportunity to manifest a certain
naivete on my part. I challenged ner statement about
Tchernych. I further stated that I doubted very much
that the published reports were true that 70 percent
of the Soviet embassy personnel were intelligence
officers.

I had met. I said that I used to play chess with a
Soviet quite regularly and that I knew he was not

A third report given to Rowton reveals what appears to have been
an TS approach made to LIREALM/1 by Valentin Loguinov on 2 February,
1939, at the home of a mutual friend, Luis Gomez. Loguínov arain
made reference to his previous allegations concerning LIREA M/1'3
affiliation with WORAGT but this time said that he was prepared: to
pay "a lot " of money for any information LINEAIM/1 micht obtain
for him. L/1 reported to Rowton that he finensed as bent he could
alleging that the only person he was close to in the WORADY complex
was an official in the economic section. LIRPALM/1 commented to kow-
ton that he felt certain at this point that Loguinov was bluffing
concerning his having actually seen 1/1 with NCFACT officers "several
times" in Canborns, and that this was à prelude to an approach to
LIRHALM/1 that Loguinov had been planning for some time.
5. Administrative:
LIRAM/1 gave Rowton an accounting for his 1,500 peso revolving
fund which shoved a total of disbursements of 12,078.75. L/1 oxblained
that this sudden increase in his expenditures was due to his now
operations, against the PRRUMEN target. No stated that he expected
the following recurring expenses every month:
C/4 salary

PLACE ACQUIRED; arty at the home of Dr. Luis Gomez.
Our tennis group meets occassionally at each others

invited us this time to his home in a Pedregal for
lunch.

After I had made a point of not sitting near Val,
several women wanted to change places and Val and
another person changed places putting Val next to me.
He opened the old issue by saying that he assumed
I was working for the company. He said that he had seen
me personally"several times" at Sanborns with American
intelligence officers. I asked who he saw me with. He
avoided the question. I then volunteered that it must
have been Bill Spruce, with whom I frequently have
lunch, He asked what section Spruce was in. I answered
the economic. He seemed disgusted, and said Spruce.
wasn't worth anything.
Val then said that he wanted me to know that ha
was prepared to pay a lot of money for any information
I might obtain for him. I said I'd talk to Spruce about
it and see if he had anything to sell so that I could
take my commission. I added that Spruce would probably
faint or tremble with terror--this pleased val greatly.
I then asked Val if the Americans had ever offered
him any money for his information. He averted my eyes
and answered "not yet":
COMMENTS
f
val is an assit
"Several
Ex
times" is, of course, inaccurate
and shows that he is guessing. It seems very unlikely
that he saw me even the one time.
Val probably regrets that we have not approached
him. But he is apt not so stupid that he does
not realize that we know he has no trade, profession,
skills, or talents which would make life for him ary-
where outside of Russia and government service possible.
Val is doing the only thing he knows how, and he knows
it, and he must realize that we know it. Hence, defection
for him is out of the question. He would only make a
short-term profit in doing so.
I have invited Bill Spruce to lunch this week. I
will develop him as my excuse and answer for any further
provocations by Val. Spruce, incidentally, is a very
clever and helpful person. My last meeting with him was
two years ago and I am still benefitting from his advice.
He has since transferred to the finance section, but
this should not affect his value to me and my cover.

Attached are five LIEMBRACE Soviet Target of Opportunity reports which
cover the period: 12 December 1968 which was the first surveillance to
four follow-up surveillance reports on the first one. On 12 December 1968
the LIEMBRACE team picked up LOGINOV in Colonia Buenos Aires in the company
of an unidentified Mexican man. The LIEMBRACE team followed the Mexican
who got into a Renault Dauphine with placas 350 HS. A LIKAYAK check
revealed that the placas were listed to

A further LIKAYAK check revealed that the VALLINAs did not live at this Adolfo
Prieto address and no further action was planned.
On Thursday, 2 January 1969, LIEMBRACE-5 went into Sears Department Store
on Bjercito Nacional and thought that the store detective was identical to the
man spotted with LOGINOV on 12 December 1968.
LIEMBRACE-14 said that although
the store detective looked alot like the man seen with LOGINOV, he was not
'identical.
Photos of this store detective are attached.
On Friday, 3 January 1969 the LIEMBRACE team went to Sears Store on Ejercito
Nacional to check out this store detective. The people at Sears said that if a
name were given to them, they would cooperate.
On Thursday, 9 January 1969, the LIEMBRACE team picked up the store detective
as he was leaving work. The store detective went to a house at Lago Chiem 142-A.
Prior to that he went to an address at Avenida Cláverfa 84-1.
On Friday 10 January 1959 the LIEMBRACE team gave us the result of a check at
These addresses.

SUBJECT: Valentin Loguinov
DATE OF INFORMATION: February 1, 1969. 1200 hours.
PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club
Interest in American School. Val asked me if I
could recall the address of the American school. He will
call me for ** it. He wants to have his son Dmitri par-
ticipate in some activities with the children at the
school in order to learn English. Dmitri finishes
school at the Russian embassy at 1400 hours. Val hopes
that maybe there are some afterschool activities such
as football for Dmitri.
COMMENT
This may be just val's inate stupidity. Maybe he
really couldn't find the American School in the tele-
phone directory.
Perhaps val already knows of some after-school activity
of which I am unaware. Maybe he already knows that someone'B
child is there, someone he wants to meet. Perhaps he wants
an excuse to wander about the school, meeting people.
Perhaps Val couldn't care less about the school. Per-
haps he is hoping for an excuse to call me, suggesting our
children practice English together. Perhaps he is preparing
the ground fox to go to someone else he already has in mind
to explain that there is no convenient program of after-
school activities for Dmitir. He might ask that person to
agree to have Dmittt play with his children.
•
It just occured to me that for the first time in many
months Valentin, spoke Russian to me. While I was playing
tennis he shouted to me in Russian, "You really are playing
with your left now". And later, "You look tired". When I
answered that I was and that I had a head-ache, He looked
particularly pleased. Normally he doesn't even answer my
Good Morning in Russian. Perhaps he is preparing the xxxxx
way for me to suggest an exchange in language lessons: he
helps me with my Russian and dix my boys play with Dimi
in English.
