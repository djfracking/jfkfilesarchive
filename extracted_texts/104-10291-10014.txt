At the end of a year of operations, Mr. O'Neil's record corresponds with his
previous achievements in the same class of work. He is an exceptionally steady,
industrious and conscientious officer. He obtains results and has proved his ability
to handle all aspects of the job assigned,
Since his previous report, he has not expanded his intelligence coverage to the
point desirable in an area of importance as that where he is working. This may be
due partly to an insufficient number of assistants; and an increase in his family may
also be a factor which has prevented him from increasing his output. In Ambassy

relations, however, he has scored great success and was the subject of a special
commendatory letter written by the new Ambassador, Honorable Walter Donnelly, to the
Department of State. His report writing is precise and clear but tends to be in-
clusive of too much detail. In this respect it is felt that be is following the
practice of his previous employment with the FBI and that his training in the methods
of our own organization was insufficient inasmuch as he departed for his post before
full completion of the training course. A temporary assignment in Rashington would
be profitable to him in order to get the spirit and methods of revised intelligence
operations and reporting.
He is a Chief of Station which this Branch particularly desires; and if he wishes
to remain at his present post on termination of his contract, it is recommended that
he be so reassigned-inasmuch as he has developed a keen-personal interest and corresponding
knowledge of this very important areas

ployees are prohibited from taking any active part in political
management or in political campaigns. These prohibitions

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Mr. Lawrence R. Houston
Goneral Counsel
SUBJECT:
Application for Admission to the Bar of
the District of Columbia
->
Birch D. O'Neal.'
1. You recall I spoke to you about my application for
admission to the Bar in the District of Columbia. The appli-
cation has been filed. You have been listed as one of three
persons connected with the U. S. Government in the Washington,
D. C., area with whom I am personally acquainted and who are
familiar with my work in the Department of Justice and other
Branches of the U. S. Government. The others are Mr. S. J.
Papich of the F.B.I. and Mr. Thomas C. Mann, former Foreign
Service Officer with whom I worked, Ambassador, and later
President of the Automobile Manufacturer's Association.
2. My application is being considered primarily on the
basis of education qualifications as provided in the rules
prior to admission to the Bar and reciprocity between the
states of Georgia and the District of Columbia on matters of
admission. They may not contact you but for your information
in case they do, attached are copies of Attachments B, D,
and F of the application for admission which I filed in the
District recently. You will note that in the last paragraph
of Attachment B that services performed since April 1954 is
carried in the capacity of a Foreign Affairs Officer. This
had been agreed upon with Central Cover and primarily at their
instance and I did not think it would jeopardize my case if,
in fact, I could otherwise qualify under the experience pro-
visions of the District rules. In any event, the information
herein may be helpful to you in the event you are called upon
to respond to an inquiry.
3. I am sending copies of this and the attachment's to
the Office of Security and Office of Personnel and I should
hope that any response from these various elements of the

SECRET
MEMORANDUM FOR : Mr. Birch D. O'Neal,
SUBJECT
CI Staff
27 NOV 1986
: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability
System
1
1
:
'
1
1. I have your memorandum of 27 October 1966 which refers to my
memorandum advising you that in the initial screening of personnel eligible
to become participants in the CIA Retirement System you have been deter-
mined to be ineligible because of an apparent deficiency in "qualifying duty"
It is important that you realize that such a deficiency is only significant in
the initial review of Agency personnel who have 15 or more years of Agency
service since the law permits such persons to acquire at their ption a
vested interest in the CIA Retirement System. At the same time, the law
requires a minimum of 60 months qualifying duty before one can possibly
qualify for retirement benefits under the CIA Retirement System. It serves
no purpose, therefore, to place a person permanently in the System if there
is a possibility that he may never qualify for benefits therein.
2. In paragraph 2 of your memorandum you indicate concern that failure
to contest the initial findings in your case may į rejudice the possibility of a
favorable decision with regard to your eligibility to participate in the CIA
Retirement System at some future date. It is assumed that you were referring
to the possibility that you may have some additional service that could perha pa
be considered as qualifying duty under the System. As noted in paragraph 2
of my memorandum of 28 September 1966, our initial determination of
ineligibility does not preclude reconsideration of your eligibility at some
future date.
3. As you know, Regulation 20-50 provides for an appeal to the Director
of any adverse determination under that regulation. However, the regulation
also provides an opportunity for an employee to present his case to the CIA
Retirement Board prior to the making of an adverse determination. Because
of the large number of employees covered in the initial screening of on-duty
employees to identify those eligible for participation in the System, this
procedure was not applied when, as in your case, the employee's Career
Service reported that he did not meet the requirements of Regulation 20-50 for
nomination as a participant. Accordingly, the procedure of notifying employees
of their non-eligibility for participation in the System: based upon the initial
finding of an employee's Career Service has been followed in all such cases.
This is contrary to the implication in paragraph 2 of your memorandum that
other employees in circumstances similar to yours were not so informed and
I would be pleased to look more deeply into that aspect of your memorandwa,
if you wish.

4. In the event that you have performed service which you believe to
be qualifying duty under the CIA Retirement System, you are most certainly
entitled to present the details of such service to the Clandestine Services
Career Service Board for review and formal submission to the CIA Retire-
ment Board. A copy of this memorandum will be forwarded to the Executive
Secretary of that Board.

3. I have questions with regard to certain
aspects of the law and in respect to my eligibility,
and this notification to you at this time is designed
to přèclude a loss of any right I right have under
the law to challenge the decision of non-eligibility
as given by you on 28 September 1966.
4. I would appreciate a formal reply acknowledg-
ing this communication with a statement as to whether
in fact the legal question of eligibility is now before
the CIA Retirement Board or any other authority of the
Agency, or is not. This request is intended not only
for the Director of Personnel to whom it is primarily
addressed and from whom such notification of non-
eligibility was received, but also is intended for
others receiving copies of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUN FOR:
SUBJECT:
1. au
2007
27 October 1966
Mr. Emmett D. Echols
Director of Personnel
Notification of Non-eligibility for
Designation as a Participant in the
CIA Retirement and Disability System.
1. Reference is made to your memorandum directed
to me, dated 20 September 1966, entitled as above, in
which it is stated that I may request that my case be
formally considered by the CIA Retirement Board and
that such request must be made within 30 days of the
date of the cotification. Other pressing responsibili-
ties have not permitted me to prepare for formal con-
sideration a challenge to the decision of non-eligibility.
My request, through the support officer of the Staff to
which I am assigned, for a reading on retirement benefits
which I might receive should I retire on 31 December 1966
or five years from that date, would not constitute a
formal rest of a decision as to my eligibility for
retirement under the CIA Retirement System. The figures
provided me in that connection were simply to serve as
a guideline for my own considerations as to possible
future retirement.
2. This memorandum is directed to you and to those
to whom conies are designated to preclude the expiration
of this day, 27 October 1966, without protesting the
notification that I must provide certain notification
within 30 days of 28 September 1966. I am informed that
other officers of CIA who have not qualified for retire-
ment have not in fact been given such notifications and
my inquiry concerning possible benefits should not re-
quire therefore a formal decision that I am not eligible
on any specific basis.

Sir:
I submit herewith my application for membership in the Career Staff of the

"The Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency is a group of
carefully selected and trained individuals who accept an obligation to
devote themselves to the needs of the Agency, and who intend to make

In accordance with this definition, I desire to devote myself to the faith-
ful performance of duty in the Central Intelligence Agency, and I accept the
obligations and conditions of that service which are determined to be essen-
tial to the furtherance of its mission.
I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue
of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will
be my obligation to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty
as determined by the needs of the Agency, and I have been assured that in
order to carry out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular
capabilities, interests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this applica-
tion for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured
that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part,
just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my
tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory com-
pletion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compati-
ble insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Birch D. O'Beal
THROUGH
Head of 3 Career Service
SUBJECT
Notification
Participant
28 September 1966
for Designation as a
Rett
and Disability System
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2.
In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of HR 20-30 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 20 July 1965, entitled "ublic Law 88-643. The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Acency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine
Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally
considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made with-
in 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

1. It is requested that Mr. Birch Dilworth O'Neal be appointed in
the Foreign Service with the title of First Secretary, FSR-3, $8, 330.00,
for duty in the American Embassy at Guatemala City, Guatemala. Mr.
O'Neal will receive from: CIA a basic salary of $8,800.00 per annum.
2. Mr. O'Neal, who is 38 years of age, received his A, B, and LL.B.
Degrees from the University of Georgia. He has had approximately
thirteen years experience as an attorney, investigator, and intelligence
officer in Government service. From September 1942 to August 1943
he was Legal Attache in Bogota, where he was responsible for all FBI
activities in Colombia. From August 1943 to December 1944 he was
Civil Attache in Mexico City, Mexico, where he was responsible for
all FBI activities in Mexico, having under his supervision more than
fifty special agents of the FBI. From March 1947 to December 1949
he served as Attache in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was OSO station
chief, having as his responsibility all CIA activities in Venezuela.
Since December 1949 Mr. C'Neal has served in a very responsible
position at CIA headquarters in Washington, in which position he has,
represented the Director of Central Intelligence in liaison with all
other Government agencies in connection with all matters relating to
aliens of interest to CIA. It is believed that Mr. O'Neal possesses the
professional qualifications for the duties planned for hiia and, in

3. A commissioned title as First Secretary is requested for
Mr. O'Neal in order that he may be enabled to carry out his duties
in a secure and efficient manner. The use of a commissioned title
In this instance, which has been discussed at length with appropriate
offices of ARA, is believed necessary in order to make possible the
appearance of a complete break between Mr. O'Neal and the previous
OSO station chief, and in order to provide him with adequate cover
which will integrate him completely into the Embassy in a country
whose present Government is noticeably hostile and vigilant with
regard to American intelligence activities. It is proposed that
Mr. O'Neal will serve in the Political Section of the Einbassy. He
will replace Mr. Collins D. Almon, who returned to the United
States in March 1951.
4. The proposed biography for Mr. O'Neal will be forwarded
at a later date.

O'NEAL, Birch D.
Reference to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject
sometime prior to 1 December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply
with your proposals. I might say that Mr. O'Neal has done a superior job
as Alien Affairs Officer for the Agency. There has been some thought
given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate
office of Mr. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of
his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles'
decision.
I feel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the
line of your proposal. The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDT, in
making Mr. O'Neal available has been sincerely appreciated.

Dear Mr. O'Nealt
It is the practice of the Organization to follow up with
former employeen aix months after their retirement. We hope
by such inquiry to obtain information on what our retirees
are doing and where they are located, invite suggestions for
improving the retirement program and to learn if the Organi-
sation might be of some assistance on any post-retirement
matters.
We should like very much to hear from you on the above
points and on any other topics you think would be useful to
UA.
For your convenience in replying, we have enclosed a
sheet somewhat akin to a form on which we have listed those
standard items of information we'd like to have on every re-
tiree. The remainder of the sheet, including the reverse
side, is for your comments and suggestions. We shall be
most appreciative of your fullest response to this inquiry.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours,

Mr. Mirch D. O'Neal
4703 Crescent Stroot, N. N.
Washington 16, D. C.
Dear Mr. O'licals
Several daya aro 1 had a call from your agency advising me that
an oxisting vacancy must be filled by November 1, and that a definite
comitment was necessary by October 1. Actually I had intended to be
in Washington during the early part of September for a further talk
with you, but two court. trials have prevented this.
if convenient to you, 1 would like to see you in Washington
this coming Monday morning, October 1. If that day happens to be
inconvenient, please telegraph or telephone mo collect. 1 will
assume this time to be agreeable unless I hear to the contrary.
I certainly appreciate the necessity for a positive commitment
on my part, and will be prepa md to give a definite answer when I am
in Machinton. Since our talk last June, quito a few personal compli-
cations have arison, which i have been attempting to resolve.
With kind personal royards,
Sincerely yours,
/a/ J. Y. Lorsett, Jr.
JKDjr/h
Mr. Dorsett conferred with the writer and Col. Sheffield wards on
1 Octob:r. He was still in a position of not being able to state that
ho would enter on duty on 1 November 1951. No mentioned various personal
reasons and the necessity of conferring with his father-in-law Sonator
Willis Smith. He later called me at my home at 9:00 P: 1 October 1951
and states Le could not enter on duty 1 November 1951, ut he continued
to be interested in the job and would probably be in contact with Col.
Alwards in the spring of 1952 to determine if there contined to be a
vacancy in which he could be placed.

However, I would not like to be restricted to the statements

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
->
February 1947 March 1947. In February 1947 I entered on
duty with what was known as the Central Intelligence Group, .
2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C., a government body
created by Executive Order which was a predecessor to the
Central Intelligence Agency. I was a legal liaison officer
with this group.
-
March 1947 December 1949. During this period I was
detailed to the U. S. Department of State, 20th Street and
Virginia Avenue N.W., Washington, D. C., where I was assigned
to the U. S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela, as Attache. In that
capacity I prepared reports and advised and counselled the U.S.
Ambassador on matters of a legal and political nature. In
this work I employed legal knowledge, background and experience
as related to the laws of the United States and the Republic
of Venezuela.
January 1950 to December 1951 - Central Intelligence
Agency, 2430 E Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. In this
period I was assigned to duties involving liaison on legal
matters with other departments of the U. S. Government in-
cluding the Department of Defense, Department of Justice
(Immigration and Naturalization Service and Federal Bureau
of Investigation) and the Department of State. Criteria
for the position included knowledge, application and
interpretation of U. S. and foreign laws. The establishment
of the position was at the instance of the General Counsel
of the Agency and my selection to the position was with his
concurrence. The assignment required close working coordination
and collaboration with the General Counsel of the Agency and
other governmental legal counsel. I discontinued this
particular work to enable me to again undertake further assign-
ment with the Department of State as a member of the Foreign
Service Staff Corps.
-
December 1951 - April 1954 U. S. Department of State,
Foreign Service Staff, Washington, D. C. During this period
I served as Attache, Political Officer, American Embassy
Guatemala City, Guatemala. In that capacity I gathered in-
formation concerning the legal system, laws, and enforcement
thereof and counselled and advised the U. S. Ambassador on
matters of a legal and political nature. In this work I
employed legal knowledge and experience as related to the
laws of the United States and the Republic of Guatemala. I
resigned from this position in Guatemala to return to the
U. S. for personal and family reasons.
