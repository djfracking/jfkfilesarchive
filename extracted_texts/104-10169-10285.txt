AMERICAN LEFTISTS FLOCKING TO PEKING: Communist China has instituted its own Open Door
policy for American leftists, some of them with long-standing ties to Communist parties.
A reception in Peking early this month provided intelligence agencies with a partial
glimpse of who is welcome, and the relative pecking order. Turning out to be greeted by
Premier Chou En-Lai and his two top assistants, Kuo Mo-jo and Keng Piao, were about 70
Americans, some permanent Peking residents and government exployees. Radio Peking listed
some by name, deliberately concealing the identity of others. Greeting Chou were "All
members of the delegation of Revolutionary Union" (Ụ is a fanatically pro-Mao arned revo-
lutionary group centered around Palo Alto and Richmond, Calif.), Pablo "Yoruba" Guzman,
head of the Young Lords Party, Black Panther's Huey Newton, Elaine Brown and Robert Bay,
and "16 American young people led by Mrs. Carmelita Hinton" (of Putney, Vt.). Also Mr.
& Mrs. Max Granich (brother of the late Communist writer Mike Gold), William Epton (ex-
member of Progressive Labor Party), Jack Belden (author of pro-Red China book), Mrs. Susan
Warren (an old CP and PLP functionary), Dick Frank (Mrs. Warren's husband), Mr. & Mrs.
Hoscah Williams (of Southern Christian Leadership Conference), Mr. & Mrs. John S. Service
(ex-State Department employee, recently "rehabilitated" by liberal press in U.S.) Kr.
Mrs. William H. Hinton, Mr. & Mrs. Jack Schulman, Mr. & Mrs. Henry Kilcox, Dr. & Mrs.
Samuel Rosen, Mr. & Mrs. Victor W. Sidel, and Geoffrey Collins.
Among Feking residents present were: Frank and Ruth Coe, Sol and Pat Adler (Frank Coe and
Sol Adler were implicated in Soviet espionage in Washington in the '40s), Erwin Engst,
Joan Hinton (his wife, and a developer of U.S. and probably Red Chinese atomic bombs),
Bertha Sneck (ex-Mrs. Willian Hinton), Eleanor Chaidin, Julian Schuman (once indicted for
treason in Korean War), Norman Schulman, Sidney Shapiro, Ione Kramer, Betty Chang, Alice
E. Cheng, Lucille Stewart, Carmelita Hinton (the younger) and Fred Engst (name order un-
doubtedly is clue to rating).
