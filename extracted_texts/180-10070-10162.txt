AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 16
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 6
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

Dear Mr. Chairman:
20515
I am requesting that you consider authorizing a
retroactive pay adjustment for a former deputy chief counsel
of the Select Committee on Assassinations, Mr. Robert K.
Tanenbaum. Mr. Tanenbaum's employment with the Committee
was erroneously terminated at the close of business July 31--
three days prior to the date he actually left the Committee.
This administrative error was an oversight, which went unno-
ticed until after the August pay period when he notified the
Committee that he had not received a paycheck for August 1
through 3. His annual rate of pay was $36,000%; therefore,
the amount I am requesting he be retroactively paid is $300.
Mr. Tanenbaum was a valuable employee, well thought
of by the Committee. I regret the error and am hopeful that
you will grant this request providing Mr. Tanenbaum the pay
he has earned. If there is anything further I can provide,
please do not hesitate to let me know. Your attention to
this matter is very much appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
NW 88326
