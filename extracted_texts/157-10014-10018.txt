Now, receiving that information, did you

it was, who was describing to you the capacity coming

Let me make a more general point that comes at it from or
another way.
If you have heard testimony that there was pressure to do
something about Cuba, there was.
There was an effort, both from
the President in his style and from the Attorney General in his
style to keep the government active in looking for ways to
7
weaken the Cuban regime.

There was. But if you, as I under-
stand it, and not even those who pressed the matter most closely
as having essentially been inspired by the White House can tell
you that anyone ever said to them, go and kill anyone.
Let me say one other thing about these two men, and that is
that there was something that they really wanted done, they did
not leave people in doubt, so that on the one hand, I would
say about their character, their purposes and their nature and
the way they confronted international affairs that I find it
incredible that they would have ordered or authorized explicitly

contrary to everything that I know about their character, they
had had such a decision and such a purpose, people would not
have been in any doubt about it.
The Chairman. Then have you any way to explain to the
Committee, or any explanation to give to the Committee, as to
why Mr. Helms would testify that he was under, or that he had
no doubts, that the Agency was fully authorized to proceed to
not only develop schemes, but to engage in active attempts to

Mr. Bundy. Well, yes.
There are a great many things that
enter into my judgment about whether the President or the
Attorney General would ever have done that, and I would like
to say, Mr. Chairman, that the most important point I want to
make, just from where I stand personally is that I find the
notion that they separately, privately encouraged, ordered,
arranged efforts at assassination totally inconsistent with

Mr. Bundy. Well, if you had asked me that question a
year ago, Senator, I would have said in my experience with him
he was not such an officer, but I have no way of dealing with
the kind of thing you have just described.
Senator Mondale. It shatters me because I have always
respected him. Because we know that these assassination attempts
occurred. We know that Mr. Helms was a part of it. We have
testimony that Mr. Helms and Mr. Harvey met and agreed not to
tell Mr. McCone what they were doing. And then we have a
.10
document here
well, that was Cubella
and then we have a
11
memo from Helms to Rusk which, in Minnesota
language looks
12

like a lie. Now, I just don't know. Maybe there are other
explanations.

The Chairman.
The memo to Rusk had to do with Cubella

rather than the Mafia.
Senator Mondale. Is that it? It was not the Mafia?
Mr. Schwarz. It was Cubella, except if you just substitute
Cubella for the word Mafia.
The Chairman. What you said otherwise is correct.
20
Senator Mondale.
But he was involved personally with
21
Cubella, wasn't he? And he knew that, and this memo said no.
Is there a plausible explanation?

23
Mr. Madigan.
Helms has one.

Senator Baker.
Helms' position is that he did not lie,
25
that he did not have anything to do with the Cubella incident,

agents are to be interrogated or interviewed by the staff of
this Committee. I would like someone who knows the details and
can be very specific to tell the Committee the exact status of
that situation, how we have been informed and if we can rely on
that information as being authoritative..
Mr. Elliff. Yesterday morning at 9:00 o'clock or shortly
thereafter, I received a phone call from the FBI's liaison with
this Committee with respect to a series of interviews that had
been arranged with the Bureau some relating to the Huston Plan,
some relating to Martin Luther King matters.
1
I was informed that
I had to address this request to the Justice Department in order
to secure approval for these staff interviews.
I then called our liaison in the Justice Department,
Special Counsel William O'Conner, and he told me I might as
well submit these requests in writing, because the Justice
Department would take at least ten days to give us an answer
on these requests and he didn't know what the answer was going
to be.
I then explored with him what some of the reasons might be
for this delay and what the problems seemed to be, and the

explanation that he gave me verbally was that the fact that
'the Committee had notified the Department in its letter of
June 27th that certain cases that we were investigating were
abuse cases meant that any interviews that would be conducted
in connection with those matters would be considered by the
Department to be demand interviews, and therefore this brought
into play the provisions of the Federal Regulations which
require the Attorney General's approval..
Then the question as to whether the Attorney General would

had indicated the likelihood of an abuse in a particular area
that the Department itself would have to consider whether it
should institute a criminal investigation of that matter, and
then, if so, whether our interview would interfere with that
ongoing criminal investigation.
And second, that the Department considered that any inter-
views undertaken by the Committee in such cases might inadver-

generally to some cases and we have attempted to do legal

but they have good lawyers over there and if they want to come
up with a sophisticated argument, we expect that they could be
able to do that.
The Chairman.
Mr. Elliff.
Lawyers can make an argument over anything.
That's so. And so the final conclusion is

oath, via subpoena, is just absolutely essential for an effective

We later received a letter pertaining to an earlier
request for interviews relating to FBI COINTELPRO disruptive
activities where we had asked for certain interviews, and this
letter did not go into specifics, but merely stated that there
were problems that would have to be resolved, that the charac-
terization of an area of the Committee inquiry as abuse might
significantly alter arrangements of access to witnesses who
are present employees of the Department.
The Chairman. In other words, the thrust of all of this
is that the more serious the nature of the inquiry, the more
difficult it will be to obtain the information, that if we are
concerned about a possible illegality or abuse, then the
Department will make it as difficult as possible for us to
secure the information.

The Chairman. I think it is ironic that the resistance we
get from the Justice Department is so much more substantial than
the resistance we have gotten from the CIA.
Senator Baker. That's not necessarily so. I agree with
you the resistance is unfortunate and inappropriate, but I
can think of a request for documentation from the CIA that is
now more than a month old and they haven't had the good grace
to tell us no. They have told us nothing.
The Chairman. But on the whole we've gotten a greater
measure of cooperation from the CIA.

Mr. Epstein. Of course, there is another issue in the
Bureau materials, because we're on the issue of investigative
files, which has never been really litigated, and that
is the propriety of Executive Privilege when it comes to that.
I might add that the importance of the issue of going
to subpoena on these really raises that, because if we go to
subpoena on documents, then that is going to be worthless unless
we know in advance that we are going to win in court in a short
period of time, including whether we have jurisdiction to be
there.
Senator Mondale. In other words, you are saying they are
going to raise the Executive Privilege defense, but that was
the Nixon defense.
Mr. Epstein. I think that they would love for us to be in
the position of having to issue a subpoena for documents,

their inquiry.

Senator Mondale. A few days ago, when the White House
people were here, they showed us a document which we have in
our files which disclosed that President Nixon in 1970 had
ordered the delivery of three machine guns to some people in
Chile and had done so with instructions that that order should
go directly to some subordinate officials in CIA and should be
done without advising the official channels. And it is thought

Mr. Bundy. I would rate it very, very unlikely.
This is a matter I have thought about since you did mention
those dates to me. And I would say that the chance that
within the first four days after being sworn in I would have
been drawn to consider this question is, from my side, as
near zero as I can put it. I had been teaching international
relations over a period of ten years. I was deeply interested
in many of the immediate problems, most notably the problem of
the crisis in Berlin and the concomitant question of relations
with the Soviet Union. And I was preoccupied with all of
the things that happened when you moved to Washington from
helping the Secretary to buy a house, and working out a
staff, and I was under instruction from the President to

Senator Baker. It won't take but a brief moment.
I think I owe the Committee a report on the statement
that I made to the Press a few moments ago. I did not intend
to make a statement, but that it becomes impossible to avoid
when you step outside in these circumstances.
The Chairman.' It is a good thing for you that Senator
Morgan is not present.
Senator Baker. As some of you may know, the news last
night and again this morning carried a story to the effect that
a Colonel, a retired Colonel in the Air Force by the name of
Fletcher Prowdy, has alleged by Alexander Butterfield was an
associate or an employee or a plant of something of the sort of
the CIA when he was at the White House.
I was asked if I had any comment on that. I was asked if
I was surprised by that, and my reply was I had heard that
17 story before. I had never commented on it because I had no

the rumors and I thought that it did warrant further investiga-
tion, that I would recommend that to this Committee at the
appropriate time.

Senator Schweiker. May I make one comment on that, Mr.
Chairman?
I have had vacillating feelings on public hearings, and I

ahead and issue a preliminary report without public hearings.
I think we should put the matter of public hearings in abeyance
until we get into the Chile thing and some of the other areas
of so-called assassinations that may not be Presidential
assassinations per se and leave the Committee option that we
may well want to elect to go into what happened in Chile
publicly and bring up that assassination if that is what we
determined.
I have trouble determining at this point in time whether
we should have public hearings, and I think we ought to keep

that option open as we go along.

As I say, it reconciles with

Senator Hart of Colorado. That was on the basis of the

because of his loyalties to the Agency. The case was not
presented well to him. What I am saying is if we took back his
contact for whom he feels loyalty and the fellow should talk,
I think the feeling of the person who had made the original
contact is that he would talk.

It was not presented to him in the way that the Agency

Well, let us get that additional informa-
Senator Baker. One further point, Mr. Chairman, that might
be of interest if my memory is correct, and I believe it is
correct, is that the major commercial cover for the Agency in
9 Amsterdam was run by the Mullin Company

The Chairman All right.

You understand that the oath still applies to this part
of the testimony?
Mr. Schwarz. will renew the questioning.
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Bundy, I want to call your attention now
to 1963, the Missile Crisis is over. Was there another reassess-
9 ment of Cuban policy in the winter and spring of '63?
Mr. Bundy. Yes, there was.
Mr. Schwarz. Again, did that reassessment of Cuban policy
involve a lot of reassessment of a lot of options?
13
Mr. Bundy.
That is my refreshed recollection.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.
We've shown you a lot of documents, mostly by you in that
period, but some to you as well, and was one of the options the
consideration of the possibility that Mr. Castro might defect
or might be communicated to in a way that would bring him around
more closely to the United States?
20
21
Mr. Bundy. The question of opening communications with
Fidel Castro arises in 1963, I think at more than one time,
:
22
and without having my attention drawn to specific documents, I
23 wouldn't be able to spell that out very much.

Castro died or were killed?
Mr. Bundy. What we did, we certainly posed the question,
the precise form is not clear to me, but what I now know from the
documents you have shown me, is we posed to the Director of the
Office of National Estimates, a Dr. Sherman Kent
Mr. Schwarz. And what did Dr. Sherman Kent say in response
to that inquiry?

Mr. Bundy.
No
now, that I can't tell you out of my

office was organized.
The first things we did, Walt Rostow
and I, was to work out an informal but nevertheless reasonably

clear-cut division of labor.
And the whole business of
12
13
14
15
what I thought of as special group business, namely, matters
that related to covert action, and would, if they came for
division, come through the special group, fell on my side

The Chairman.
Well, isn't it perfectly plausible that

Does it necessarily follow that because the Administration
was making such a plausible inquiry against such a contingency
that might arise at any time that therefore it was within the

I don't see the

the possible death of Castro is one of the items under item
1 and not under item 2.
Mr. Bundy.
That is correct.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, have you had a chance to read them

Mr. Bundy. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. In summary, Mr. Bundy, is it a fair charac-
terization of these papers that you were,iand the Standing
Group was, examining the question of what the situation would
be if Castro were to die?
Mr. Bundy. That is one of the things we were examining,
certainly.
Mr. Schwarz. That was a gamut of matters I tried to:
pose at the beginning of this line of questioning?

Mr. Schwarz. This was a period of time, as the fall of
1961 may also have been, when people asked about or talked
about assassinations as a means of causing Mr. Castro's death.
Mr. Bundy. I am not aware of much conversation on that
subject in the spring of '63, so I would have to take your
21
word on that.
22
Mr. Schwarz. I am asking you, I have no word on that.

Can we further agree that the ultimate conclusion was that
Castro's death would not be desirable for the United States?
Mr. Bundy.
The recommendation, or the assessment, which
comes back from the Office of National Estimates, makes it
clear that the odds would be that, upon Castro's death, his
brother Raul or some other figure in the regime would, with
Soviet backing and help take over control.
Then it goes on to say that there might be divisions and
splits, but that it was unlikely that anti-Communist forces
would be able to take over without extensive U.S. help and
probably U.S. military intervention.
Mr. Schwarz.

You do agree that you were looking at a
situation that would exist as if Castro were killed?
Mr. Bundy. That is one of the things we were looking at.
And in connection with that, was his being
'killed by assassination one of the ways which you understood
he might be killed?
Mr. Bundy.. I don't have any recollection of that point,
of it being on our minds.

Mr.

Then why were you looking at the question of his being
killed? Was there something known?
Mr. Bundy. I really don't have any independent of it.
My sense of events in 1963 is that the internal pressure from
within the Administration to "do something about Cuba" was
7
very much lower.
8

There was, however, external pressure.
There
was political pressure in the United States, critics of the
Administration were making speeches about how not enough was
being done and we must get rid of the Castro regime, and as I
think I may have said earlier', and I would like to say now,

Mr. Schwarz. Now the only remaining question I have on
this group of documents is, how was it that the subject of the
death of Castro do you investigate the possibilities of the
death of foreign leaders as a regular matter?
Mr. Bundy. Well, the question "After: Stalin, What?" was
the staple of discussions in the 1940's, everywhere, academies
and I would assume inside the United States government; the
question after DeGaulle was a question about Western European
14
policy for a great many years. And one could pick
smaller
15
16
figures, more and less controversial, and have the same kind of
question coming up, in a situation in which a particular
17
individual
is as dominant a figure in a set of events which
18
19
20
21
22
23
it had the two, quite contrasting but heavy consequences of the
Bay of Pigs and the Missile Crisis, it doesn't seem to me to
be an irrational question to ask, without any relation as to
whether the United States itself would have any active advisory
role or any role whatever in having that event come to pass.
Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Now at that period of time in the fall of
1963, were you aware that through the offices of Ambassador
Atwood, or Mr. Atwood, as he may have then been called, and
through the offices of a French journalist called Jean Daniel,
another effort was being made to establish contact with Mr.
Castro?
Mr. Bundy. I remember the Atwood effort, as I recollect.
I don't recollect specifically
that he came to see me about it.
Jean Daniel, although it strikes a chord as you mention it.
Mr. Schwarz. What the purpose, very briefly, of Mr.
Atwood's effort?
Mr. Bundy. Well, as I understood it, he had been approached
by someone he knew from Cuba and had been given to understand
that there was interest in, Castro had an interest in, opening
communication, and he was exploring with us whether he could be
encouraged to undertake such an explanation.
20
Mr. Schwarz.
And did you encourage him?
21
22
23
24
25
Mr. Bundy. The exact form of our message to him, or our
if you want to call it, the instruction to him, the President's
decision, I can no longer recollect, but my impression is that
we were interested, and that we did want him to explore it without
engaging the President any more than he could help.

Mr. Bundy. Let me suggest that you focus on Mr. Chase's
memorandum ♬ with respect to my recollection and responsibility,
that is clearly the operative document.
Mr. Kelley. With respect to Mr. Chase's memorandum, in
his summary of the rationale of proposals, he states, as second
"the present importance of Castro as a nationalist symbol makes
him the obvious operational target; assassination is excluded
to avoid Castro's martyrdom."
Do you have any recollection of why he would exclude
assassination? Does that imply to you, or do you recollect,
whether Castro's assassination was being considered and here
is a staff paper excluding it, because someone asked them to
consider it?
Mr. Bundy. No, I think it's a simple statement of what
I would regard as a rationale assessment of the situation by
whoever the original author was, and certainly by the staff
man with respect to a subject that emarges directly from the
notion that he is an operational target, whatever that means
and goes on to say, but we don't mean assassination, because
it would make him a martyr, what other reasons against: that
there may be. It doesn't seem to me that you can read the
statement that assassination is excluded as an inference that
somebody else is including it.

Mr. Schwarz. But was the President in fact informed and
in fact approved the actions taken?
Mr. Bundy. That is my understanding.
Mr. Schwarz.
Is it your understanding or your recollection?
Mr. Bundy. It is my recollection, but it is a recollection
that is refreshed by what I have learned and hearing more about
it in the last few days.
Mr. Schwarz.
Now, were you told, in the fall of 1963,

Mr. Castro?

by the White House to develop an Executive capability, I
have no basis on which to dispute that record.
Then when we asked him, very well, who in the White
House told you, and when were you told, he replied, it
must have been early in 1960, and I don't recall who told me,
but it must have been either Rostow or Bundy.
He then recounts that he had numerous conversations
with both of you during the period, and concludes that the
instruction must have come either from you or from Mr. Rostow.
Now, Mr. Rostow tells us he never gave such an instruc-
tion, and in fact has no memory of every having discussed
12 such an instruction.

since I have taken no documents of that character, no official
documents of that character, from the White House.
And he said

Bundy. I don't recall that I did, but when I came to
look more closely at what I needed to see, as I told you
earlier, it related specifically to the period around August
1962.
Mr. Smothers. Did the White House make the selection of
documents for you?
Mr. Bundy. No. The White House handed me a file of
documents which covered the period.
Mr. Smothers.
They handed you a file of documents covering
roughly the August 1962 period?

Mr. Smothers. To the best of your knowledge or recollection,
did the appointment of this Chief of Staff or Chief of Operations
reflect any lack of confidence in General Taylor on the part of
either the Attorney General or the President?
Mr. Bundy. No, the opposite. General Taylor had heavy
responsibilities in his general responsibility as military
representative of the President. He was made Chairman of the
Committee to keep oversight on this. It was inappropriate
entirely in terms of his rank and his other duties that he
should be the day to day action officer.

it's not much better than that, is that the decision which had
been taken only a week before the new Administration came in,
in the Special Group, was partly reviewed in some fashion, with
the Special Group as reconstituted after the change in
Administration. So I would have to say that I suppose I knew
that weapons were being introduced into the Dominican Republic

would clearly be important to have that kind of understanding,

Nevertheless, we
are faced with a very real dilemma. We know that at the very
time you were being briefed the Agency was not only interested
in developing a capability, but was in fact engaged in a
series of attempts to assassinate Castro, and had been in-
volved in other murder plots and murder attempts against the
leaders of certain foreign governments.
The question we are endeavoring to answer is whether
the Agency had been authorized by the policy makers of the
government to engage in this activity, or whether it was
operating fast and loose on a wild gambit of its own in an
area of extreme sensitivity that could have the most serious
repercussions upon the government of the U.S. and its

to me that the Chairman's question pursues the two alternatives,
either what we now know to have occurred was ordered at the
highest level, or at a very high level, such as the Special
Group Augmented, or they operated on their own, in which case
they were out of control and irresponsible, or there was some
extra communications system that went around the formal struc-
ture that we have been examining, and would account for the sem
of authority that these operators testified to when they

attempts during the period under review.

Yes.
And in that August 10 meeting two or three principals
testified that it did come up. And in fact it is not reflected

Mr. Chairman, any more than I would have pursued any other
shelf capability on which no question was being pushed to me,
either from below or above.
If I may go back and comment on one aspect of your,
I think, important and impressive description of
the difficulty the Committee faces, I am sure that if in the
early months of 1961 I had known what I now know, in part from
18 the newspapers and in part from discussions with your staff,
about what was really in train, I would have had a very

And, Mr. Rusk

The Chairman. You were present at that meeting?
Mr. Bundy. I was present. My memory is entirely
a refreshed memory on this, I had no recollection of the
meeting until recent months. But I have found a scratch
pad that I apparently doodled on on that date, and it
shows who was there, and not much else.
Mr. Schwarz. There were some beautiful drawings.

They were not very beautiful

10
The Special Group Augmented met in August
and this
11
12
13
14
does coincide with my general recollection of the matter
in response to concerns wihch were first, I think, and most
energetically pressed by Mr. McCone with respect to, what the
hell are the Russians doing in Cuba.
And that was the center
15
16
17
of that meeting, and the center of later meetings, and the cen-
ter of a national security action memorandum of considerable
complexity which was put out toward the end of
August, most
18
19
of which dealt with this question, how do we know what they
are going to do, what do we do if they do it, and so forth,
20
with respect to missiles in Cuba.

It was therefore in a
sense much more than an ordinary
i
22
MONGOOSE meeting, let alone a Special Group meeting.
And
28
while I quite agree with the Secretary that that meeting as
1
24
a planning session for anything as horrendous as assassina-

tion is implausible in the extreme.

And when there was a question in such a meeting as to
whether the matter required further judgment, it was the
responsibility of the Chairman of that group to make sure that
that was checked out.
The papers will usually say, higher authority, et cetera,

13

But I never knew of any operation of this kind of any
sort, with one exception, which is quite different, which did

not have that channel. The exception is the Bay of Pigs,

directions, and in which the President himself was involved in

through a quite Presidential process, and everybody involved

until the beginning of this current public discussion, that

Senator Baker. It is a fairly picturesque name as

Mr. Bundy. I have a recollection of what I think of

it in some fashion at the time.

is important for us, Mr. Bundy, to try to establish, as the

himself in is terribly important in that respect.
I believe that you said you had no information or no
recollection of what particular situation, or what other
deals that were made he was interested in.
Mr. Bundy. I will put it more concretely than that.
The President said, can't we do something more about Cuba?
Why don't you get ahold of these people who are dealing with

related to Cuba that came up through the group of ten

"The NSC 54/12 Group

Does this suggest to you that the regular channel was
supposed to operate with respect to MONGOOSE, that is to say,
a central role was to be played by the Special Group in
connection with its activities?

Have you made a similar request to

and that my own recollection was not that we had encouraged
him, but that I had at some stage been informed about it.

why Mr. Bissell would have directed Mr.
Harvey to develop such a capability, and apparently represented
if the documents are to be believed, to Mr. Harvey that he had

Do you think that Mr. Bissell would have undertaken
on his own initiative to develop such a capability and
simply represented to his subordinate that he was doing so on
instructions from the White House?
Mr. Bundy. I think there is a prior question, Mr.
Chairman, which is the credibility of the witness from whom he
is taking this recollection.
The Chairman. That is fair.

Mr

The Chairman. Did Mr. Bissell at any time during the
period under question, or at any later time, ever inform
you of CIA activities or involvement in assassination attempts
against any foreign leader?
Mr. Bundy. No.
The Chairman.
Doesn't it strike you as strange, since
Mr. Bissell was aware of such attempts, that he would not
have told him?
Mr. Bundy. Well, I don't want, for reasons that I t
have already explained, to speculate as to why he did or did
not. I was operating, working on the assumption that I
would know that kind of thing if it existed.

But as I recall, he

was very clear as a matter of independent recollection that

like the Green Berets and organizing to be able to assist
countries threatened by Communist subversion internally.

as it led to Cuba, or as a general capability?

Senator Baker. It may be necessary to ask him to come
back for that purpose.
May I ask a question there?
Mr. Bundy, do you have any recollection of any specific
covert plans that would involve poisons, hypdermic syringes,
12 or other potentially lethal devices in conjunction with acti-
vities against Cuba?
Mr. Bundy. I have no recollection of any specific plan.
I do have a very vague, essentially refreshed recollection
that I heard the word poison at some point in connection with
a possibility of action in Cuba. But that is as far as I
have been able to take it in my own memory.

along to produce a result?
Mr. Bundy. In a general way that is right. But the
form it took in the areas in which I was concerned was in one
sense quite informal. I know of no instance where the Attorney

General tried to replace the normal channel

Africa, for example, was insufficiently sensitive to the aspir-

would come in and say, why can't you people do something about

13
Senator Baker. There is some evidence
we had direct
14 testimony that Mr. Helms, who was DDP at the time in ques-
tion, rather than DCI, clearly thought that the authority of
the Agency was to overthrow the Castro regime by any means, in-

this be in the gingerman concept you are speaking of?

would like to make. But everything I knew about Bobby Kennedy
when he was goading and spurring people on is that he never

think that since the point is impor

Senator Baker. And the time involved and what position

Mr. Bundy, we also have it from Mr. Bissell that at one
time he called in an officer, a subordinate, O'Donnell,
that at one time Mr. Bissell called in a subordinate whose
name was Mr. O'Donnell, and asked Mr. O'Donnell if he would
be willing to undertake the assassination of Mr. Lumumba.

or three times about it?

Could I separate and try and clarify my answer?

Mr. Bundy. I talked to the President, I suppose, many,
many times in the context of the events that led up to and
followed the Bay of Pigs. I talked to him dozens of times,
maybe even hundreds of times, in the context of the events that
led up to and followed the Cuban missile crisis. Those are the
two great moments of Presidential concern over Cuba during the

to stimulate the Agency's activities to produce the overthrow
of the Castro regime, and that he met regularly with Kennedy
in this respect.

Mr. Schwarz. We have indicated to you that we are going
to discuss the countries of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, although not much on Vietnam. And the majority and
minority staff have shown you some documents of that period,
7
some 15 years ago. Before I get to those three countries,
8
I would like to ask you some questions about a subject
9
called Executive Action. Have you ever heard of the
subject
10
called Executive Action?
11
Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have.
12

14
Mr. Schwarz. When did you first hear of it?
Mr. Bundy. Well, as I have told your staff, that is a real
difficulty for me, because I cannot pinpoint the time at
15
which I heard of it.
My impression was that it was some time

in the early months of 1961.
Mr. Schwarz. And do you have a recollection as to the
context in which you heard about it, the person from whom you
20
heard about it, and will you provide to the Committee your
full recollection of the subject of Executive Action in the
21
early 1961?
22
23
Mr. Bundy. Would it help if I try to describe in a
general way what I now understand of this matter, the
24
part which is recollection and the part which is clarified
by discussions with the staff and what I now think about it?

Bundy, based upon your having had an
opportunity prior to the testimony, and now again if you seek
to do so,
to refresh your recollection, will you recount for
the Committee what happened in the summer of 1964 in connect-
ion with this matter?
Mr. Bundy. Well, it is a relatively small matter in the
context of what you are discussing, but what happened in the
8
summer of 1964 was that it came to our attention that there
9
were relations between Cuban refugees in Cuba and people
10
apparently associated with the Mafia.
And this did not seem
11
to be a good idea.
And this was in a period in which
12
13
14
15
16
sentiment had been steadily growing for some time against
activities by Cuban refugees that were wholly outside the
control and not really in the interest of the U.S., and that
they should be associated with a criminal group.
And so when the matter came to the Special Group, the
decision was made to refer it to the Department of Justice
17
as a matter of internal American law enforcement.
That was
18
done.
19
20
And the Department said that it was going after the
matter, which it then did, and reported back.
21
.22
23
24
The reports don't give any conclusive picture of what
really was going on, but they do show that the Bureau went
to a number of people asking around about these matters,
as far as I know, it then faded away.

Anytime you get that kind of problem you have an organization
problem. And the solution of 1961, which took sometime to
work out, as the passage of time suggests, was the creation
of a Special Committee under the Chairmanship of General
Taylor and with General Lansdale as its operating officer.
Now, in the course of the review that did

it another document?

from the National Security

Mr. Schwarz. Now, the contingency to be examined,
therefore, was what would happen would it help the U.S.,
that is the question, if Castro were to disappear?
Mr. Bundy. What would it be like if Castro were to
disappear? The question is open ended.
13
Mr. Schwarz.
What was the conclusion?
14
15
16
Mr. Bundy. I don't remember. My unaided sense of the
matter is that intelligent political analysis would have
suggested in 1961 or at any time later that the removal of a

would have quite unpredictable and not necessarily helpful

Mr. Bundy. I don't have any recollection.
18
Mr. Schwarz. If one were exploring the possibility of
assassination, I take it this kind of analysis is the sort
of analysis one would wish to make if one was not simply
ruling assassination out as a matter of principle in the first
instance.
Mr. Bundy. Let me put it another way. If people were
suggesting this to you, and you were curious about whether
it was worth exploring, one way of getting more light on it
without going any further with that notion itself would be
to ask political people, not intelligence people, what they
thought would happen if Castro were not there any longer.
You will notice that this National Security Action
Memorandum is not addressed to the Central Intelligence

rather to the Secretary of State. And specifically clearly

Mr. Schwarz. But you have no independent recollection
of that or of the fact that Mr. Schultz met with the President?
Mr. Bundy. No. But I will say this
observation
and it is a random
if I were planning an action of great-sensitivity
I wouldn't discuss it with any journalist, I don't think.
Mr. Schwarz. The record from Mr. Schwartz is that the
President said he was opposed to assassination, but that he
brought it up in a conversation with Mr. Schwartz, saying
that he was being encouraged to order assassination.
Now, you have said that you do recall that the subject
was talked about, your words, at some point, and that it
might have been in the fall of 1961.
Mr. Bundy. I wouldn't want to say that it was only in
any given period.
Mr. Schwarz. But that one of the points in which it
might have been discussed was the fall of 1961.

concern we have, General Taylor or I, in the frame of this
language, it was precisely to insulate the President from
any false inference that what he was asking about was
assassination. It is easy to confuse the question.
What
are things going to be like after Castro, with the other
question, and we were trying to focus attention on the
information he obviously wanted, which is, what would happen
if we did do this sort of thing, and not get one into the
frame of mind of thinking that he was considering doing it.
That is the distinction, I think.
Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any further recollection of
discussion of this matter in this fall of 1961? And by this
matter I mean either the broader inquiry into what it would
be like if Castro disappeared, or a scenario arising of the
specific subject of assassination.
Mr. Bundy. No, I don't.

And that is the MONGOOSE programs.
In connection with the MONGOOSE program,
you had some dialogue about the Attorney General which was
quite extensive.
Let me ask you one additional question on
5
that subject.
What was the relationship personally and pro-
6
fessionally between the Attorney General and General Maxwell
7
Taylor?
8
Mr. Bundy. It was very close.
I think that they first
9
met in a hardworking sense when they were
I think they
10
were both members of the committee to look into what happened
11
after the Bay of Pigs, or if the Attorney General was not
12
a member he was certainly closely interested.
13
14
Mr. Schwarz.
He was a member.
Mr.
Bundy.
And I am sure the Attorney General was
15
one of the people strongly favoring the appointment of General
16
Taylor as the President's military advisor.
17
They were both
active and ardent tennis players, they liked each other,
and
(
18
they visited back and forth.
19
One of the Kennedy children
is named for General Taylor, I think.
There was a relation of

real trust and confidence between them.
And the measure of

shart differences over Vietnam.
Now recognizing that, what I am asking for:

standing of that relationship, will you give us your opinion

I would place

was occupied

Mr. Schwarz. So you place it after the 20th of January,

Mr. Bundy. That is right.
Did it come up in a context where you
urged that such a capacity be created?

6
evidence of new block activities in Cuba.
Was that evidence
7

10
connected with the missiles?
Mr. Bundy. Well, there was quite a buildup reported
in the press and in the intelligence initially of Soviet
military personnel, of Soviet surface-to-air missiles.
And
11
the crucial question was, what for and what is coming.
And
12
the Director of Central Intelligence
who was proved in
13
the end to be right
was almost alone in his belief that
14
this was going to lead to a nuclear capability in Cuba that
15
16
could hit the U.S. And he raised these questions in the
month of August in a number of different ways.
And the

reviewed those problems, and as the memorandum itself shows,

the heavy emphasis of the President's concern and of the
Group's concern on the likelihood that developed and what

Mr. Schwarz. The memorandum has quite a range of matters
to be considered. And they range from, if I can use the
characterization, on the soft side, Item 1, which was consider-
ation of the U.S.: pulling its missiles near the Soviet Union out
