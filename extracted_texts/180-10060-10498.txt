RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :
December 8, 1995
Status of Document:
Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 8
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 1
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515
April 18, 1978
The Honorable Frank Thompson, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on House Administration
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have approved a salary increase of $1,980.00 per year
effective April 1, 1978 for Louis Parisi, a staff investigator
for the Select Committee.
As Mr. Parisi's basic salary and benefits are paid by
the New Jersey State Police, his additional salary from the
House is paid in the form of a monthly expense allowance per
prior agreement with your staff and the Clerk of the House.
This was to avoid Mr. Parisi from earning retirement benefits
from both the Federal Government and the State of New Jersey.
Accordingly, Mr. Parisi's monthly expense allowance will
increase from $625.00 to $790.00 effective April 1, 1978.
Sincerely
LS/thw
