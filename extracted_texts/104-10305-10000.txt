Garrison's 'Beseless Fraud'
The former chief investigator in the New Orleans
assassination "plot" testified last week that District
Attorney Jim Garrison's conspiracy theory is a "base"
less fraud."*
William H. Gurvich who worked with Garrison
for seven months in probing the Kennedy assassina-
tion, swore that the entire "plot" was a figment of
the D.A.'s imagination. He testified in an Ohio
extradiction hearing in which Garrison sought the
return for testimony of Gordon Novel, a former New
Orleans resident. Gurvich also said that:
Garrison once predicted the assassination probe
would end with the suicide of his chief defendant,
Clay Shaw, who is charged with conspiracy,
Another defendant, Edgar Eugene Bradley, has
been confused by Garrison with "second" Edgar
Bradley, an anti-Castro pilot. But Gurvich said in
vestigation indicated that neither Bradley played any
part in the assassination,
• Garrison once ordered Gurvich to arrest, hand-
cuff and assault two NBC newsmen, Walter Sheridan
and Richard Townley, who had expressed skepticism
of the Garrison probe.

clippings dating from March
1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with
a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together
with David FERRIE and ARCACHA SNITCH To avoid arrest, NOVEL, left
New Orleans, first going to Mclean, Virginia where he was given a
lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary
on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial
claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's proximity to
McLean, Va.
After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967
a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink
drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy
friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" in CIA and referred
to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVEL claimed
he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the
matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE-CHEK
was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to
the widown of American flyers who participated in the Bay of Pigs.
No connection with NOVEL, could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio
ARCACHA SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario
Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization.
Although ARGACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained
an impression from him that he was employed by CIA,
In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arest by GARRISON
on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to
testify before the East Baton Rouge Farish Grand Jury in their probe
on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisianā.
DETAILS:
The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.
However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisians
and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was
one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with
Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony
before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK
was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that
BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana
sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

Dulles Called in Probe
The district attorney's office today issued a grand jury
subpena for Allen M. Dulles former director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, to appear before the jury March 7
and 8 in connection with the probe of the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.
A new subpena also was issued today for Gordon Novel,
former New Orleans nightclub owner. Previous efforts to
get Novel back to New Orleans to testify have been un-
successful.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY JIM GARRISON said his office
"has succeeded in identifying the assassination of President
Kennedy as an operation conducted by elements of the
CIA," and said both Dulles and Novel were needed to
testify about CIA activities.
•
Both subpenas were issued through. Criminal District
Judge Matthew S. Braniff.
The request for the Dulles subpena alleges that Dulles
was CIA director until Sept. 27, 1961, and as such "would
have pertinent knowledge as to substantial reports that
Lee Harvey Oswald was an agent and-or an employe of
the CIA."
:
THE DOCUMENT SAID POSSIBLE information relative
to CIA knowledge or contact with Oswald (named by the
Warren Commission as the sole slayer of the President) was
suppressed in certain commission documents.
It charges that while Dulles headed the CIA, the organ-
ization negotiated with a New Orleans firm for the purchase
of trucks and vehicles to use in the CIA-sponsored Bay of
Pigs invasion of Cuba and used the name of Lee Harvey
Oswald, who was at that time in Russia.

THE SUBPENA REQUEST QUOTED a copyrighted story
in the States-Item April 25, 1967, as making public Novel's
claim to have been employed by the CIA during Dulles'
(tenure as chief. "Gordon Novel fled the state to avoid
testifying and sought to enlist the aid of the CIA in pre-
venting his return," the document said.
"
The request said "David W. Ferrie, who has been named
in an indictment as a conspirator to the murder of John F.
Kennedy, was an employe of the CIA at a time when Allen
Dulles was the head of the CIA. Among other things, he was
a flying instructor in Guatemala prior to the abortive Bay
of Pigs invasion.”
Dulles was never called be-
fore the Warren Commission,
the document said.
The document said it was is-
sued for the purpose of being
presented to a judge in New
York, "where said Allen W.
Dulles now is, upon proceed-
ings to compel said Allen W.
Dulles to attend and testi-
fy.
"
Both the Dulles and Novel
subpena requests contain pro-
visions granting the men im-
munity from arrest and
process service, while in Lou-
isiana on matters which arose
prior to their entrance into
the state: to answer the sub-
penas..
IN THE PAST, Garrison has
refused to grant Novel such
immunity. Novel has said he
would be willing to return if
it were granted.
The Novel subpena request
says Novel now lives in Co-
lumbus, Ohio.
It alleges that Novel "by
his own admission in public
statements is affiliated with
the CIA."
It further alleges that Novel
"has been established to be
a frequent visitor of and as-
sociate of attorney Dean A:
Andrews who has been con-
victed of perjury in connec-
tion with his testimony rela-.
tive to the conspiracy to mur-
der John F. Kennedy."
ALSO, IT says he was an
associate of Ferrie in connec-
tion with CIA activities.
"Information has been giv-
en to the DA's office which
located Novel at No Name
Key in Florida where a num-
ber of CIA employes were
training for an invasion of
Cuba," the request said.
It also says Novel has been
identified by a witness as a
frequent visitor of Exigar Eu-
gene Bradley in North Holly-
wood, Cafft. Bradley has been
charged in Orleans Parish as
a conspirator in the Kennedy
slaying.
Novel, the request says, has
been identified by various wit-
nesses as having been in vari-
ous places in Dallas in 1963
which are under investigation
by the DA's office.

THE SAME STORY, MINUS THE CIA allegation, was
published in Rome's conservative newspaper: De La Sera,
on March 5.
Incidental to his own story, Novel tells intimates the
CIA may have asked Shaw to observe the traffic of foreign
commerce through New Orleans.
In Ohio, Novel continues to live his free, loquacious life
while waiting for the uncertain extradition machinery to
grind away between governors' offices at Baton Rouge and
Columbus.

He lives in a rent free apartment, drives a used car
with dealer's tags and continues to promise he will send

Novel Not CIA Agent--Weiner
The Columbus, Ohio, attorney for Kennedy death plot
investigation figure Gordon Novel said today that his client
was never an agent for the CIA.
Attorney Jerry Weiner was commenting on a copyright-
ed story in the States Item and the Dayton (Ohio) Daily
News which reported evidence of links between Novel and
the CIA.
"It's utterly ridiculous," he said. "Novel is not now
and never has been a CIA agent.'
::
"
At Dallas, Sergio Arcacha Smith declined comment on
Novel's quoted account of the mysterious munitions in-
cident at Houma in 1961. He told a reporter he would not
have “anything to say about anything."
.
At Washington, meanwhile, the CIA was mum on the
story.

c Novel called the munitions incident

recent news interview. He immediately was
shushed by his Columbus lawyer, Jerry Weiner.
.
Even more recently, Novel restated his charges against
Garrison in a lined story carried by The Dayton Daily
tically, he said, “I think Garrison will expose
operations in Louisiana." He did not elaborate.
His repeated but unpublished account of how the
evalcaves disappeared describes the bunker he says he
helped empty as a CIA staging point for munitions destined
to be used as part of the abortive Bay of Pigs attack on
Castro's Cuba in April, 1961.
PRIOR TO THAT DISASTROUS CIA-staged operation,
Novel says, he was waiting for the intelligence service at.
New Orleans. Part of is job, he contends, was to operate
the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CIA com-
munications.
With funds funneled tim by the CIA, Novel says he
prepared special radio commercials used on 300 stations
in the U.S. and Canada. Their cryptographic messages, he
claims, were talert agents to the invasion date. The com-
mercials advertised aluminum Christmas trees, he says,
and the key alert code names were "Star Christmas Trees"
and "Holiday Trees.". In late 1960, $72,000 worth of radio
time was placed by the agency.

On the day the munitions were picked up, he says, he
was called by his CIA contact and told to join a group which
was ordered to transport munitions from the bunker to New

HE SAYS FIVE OR SIX OF THE BOXES were open.

eventually were taken by boat to Cuba for use in a diver-

NOVEL'S ACCOUNT OF THE explosives caper sharply:
conflicts with Garrison's charges against Arcacha and
Novel. The DA's accusation says the burglary took place
after Aug. 1, 1961-three months after the Cuban disaster.
The DA accuses the two men of conspiring to burglarize
a bunker at an abandoned military base at Houma. Gar-
rison's bill of information says the bunker was leased by.
the Schlumberger Well Services Co. of Houston.
:
Schlumberger officials say they know nothing of any
CIA operations in connection with their magazine, where
oil field service equipment and certain low yield explosivės
are stored.
As to the date the Houma burglary happened, no one
seems to know or will say exactly when it took place.
Schlumberger says it has no records. The Houma police say
their records are missing, and the Terrebonne Parish DA,
Wilmore Broussard, will not reveal the date he charges
Arcacha and Novel burglarized the Houma bunker. He said
it is "material evidence" in his case.

BLOTKIN SAYS HE MADE A TRIP to Houma to get
the date of his client's alleged offense and could not ob-
tain it.
Shaw, a tall white-haired retired New Orleans business-
man, who stoutly denies participating in a plot to kill
Kennedy, was managing director of the International Trade
Mart. He was with the organization for 19 years and in a
favorable position to observe the movements of international
commerce through America's second-ranking seaport.
On March 4, Paese Sera, an afternoon newspaper in
Rome, carried a story which said Shaw is a director of a
firm known as World Trade Center Corp. The newspaper,
which is leftist in its political leanings, claimed the com-
pany was a CIA front operation.

4. NOVEL remains mysterious. Although the press has
devoted much space to him, few facte hayo emerged, He has been
described as a 29 year old former owner of a bar in the French
quarter of New Orleans and as an expert in electronics, (New
Orleans States Item, 25 April 1967.) An FBI report (DDB-79248,
27 April 1967) terms him a former electronics salesman,
5. Nothing has been printed about the source or sources of his
money since he left New Orleans for Columbus, Ohio, in mid-March
1967. It is known, however, that he is at liberty on a $10,000 bond,
The New Orleans States - Item said on 25 April 1967 that NOVEL lives
in a rentefrão a partment in Columbus and drives a used car with
dealer's tage,
The Washington Daily News of 27 March 1967 stated that
during the weekend of 25-26 March NOVEL was in the Washington area
(actually it was McLean, Virginia, a site which might have been chosen
to land an air of plausibility to his claims of working for CIA). There
he was given a polygraph examination by a private detective named
Lloyd FURR, (Comment: As the Office of Security reported on 1 May
1967, the Washington firm REDEX is operated by FURR and Richard L.
BAST, who is described as "'unscrupulous and untrustworthy". BAST

7. On 29 March 1967 the New Orleans FBI office reported

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel.
Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981.
Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls
forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone
number. When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indi-
cated that he was calling the New Orleans office. He was told that Farris
was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to
Houston. Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency
file under the Freedom of Information Act. He was told that he should
address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.
He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent
to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make
sense of it. He did, however, discover that it contained information that
was erroneous and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation
and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter
detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made. He did
not seem interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of
questioning. He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of
the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local represent-
ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the
Director. Novel indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but
was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information
mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified.
representative of the Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding
information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small
sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about that," then hung up.

said he "served as an intermediary between the CIA and
anti-Castro Cubans in New Orleans and Miami before the
April, 1961, Bay of Pigs invasion. Plotkin maintained,
though, that Novel had 'little er nothing to do with the Bay

11. On 7 May 1967 NOVEL again telephoned the FBI's office in
New Orleans He said that in the near future GARRISON would accuse
the FBI of possessing originala of five letters; one from Clay SHAW
to David FERRIE, one from Lee Harvey OSWALD to SHAW, one from
FERRIE to Jack RUBY, one from RUBY to OSWALD, and one from
Senator and former Attorney General Robert Kennedy to FERRIE, He
added that GARRISON hae a typewriter which FERRIE owned in 1963 and
also has two typewriters, personal and business, belonging to SHAW
He said that GARRISON's chief investigator, William GURVICH, has
close relative, living in Russia, who was instrumental in designing
the MIG. He remarked that GARRISON plans to subpoena an attorney.

defense attorneys. "Every lawyer involved in this case, without ex-

The partial sentence reading

reinforce NOVEL's false claim to affiliation with CIA. It will be inter-
esting to note whether he releases this telegram to the press.
Addendum
It has been noted that NOVEL probably served as an FBI informant
for an unknown period before he left New Orleans in mid-March 1967.
FBI report DBB 73269, New Orleans office, 21 February 1967,
ascribed to a "confidential source who in the past furnished insufficient
information to determine reliability, This source describes the group
that carried out the
theft from the Houma bunker as consisting of his
own ex-wife (but not himself), his partner (unidentified), Sergio
ARCACHA Smith, David FERRIE, two ex-marines, and another man
also unidentified. He also said that one of the cars used for the trip to

ARGACHA directly. He was, however, the delegate of the Frente

29 April 1977
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group
FROM
SUBJECT
: Raymond M. Reardon
: Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel
__
1. Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure
who first came to the attention of this Agency during the
~ Garrision Investigation into the assassination of
President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimed to
be a CIA employee or to be acting on behalf of the CIA.
He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no
contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits to
Domestic Collection Division offices. He has been in
several scrapes with the law, most recently in October
1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy to firebomb
several buildings in New Orleans. Mr. Novel has now
filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his
rights and interference with his personal affairs. He
is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard
Osborn as a defendant. Mr. Osborn has been in touch with
the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by
the Justice Department since he feels his being named in
the suit probably resulted from his official duties with
the Agency.

On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the
Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to
inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file
showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named
Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit. Mr. Jameson was
given a rundown on the nature of the information in
Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's
retirement date, 26 February 1974. Mr. Jameson mentioned
that most of the alleged activities complained about by

reportedly was to Hoke MAY, a reporter of that newspaper, that az im
criminating letter which Gordon NOVEL allegedly wrote to a Mr. WEISS,
who was "presumably connected with CIA," was delivered.
rainboard
2. According to the States-Item articles of 26 May 1967, the letter, linoleum
which appeared to be a draft, had been found under a rug in an apartment
occupied by NOVEL prior to his departure from New Orleans in abent
mid-March 1957, and had been turned over to the boyfriend of one of two
girls who found it while cleaning the apartment. The boyfriend had turned
it over to his professor at a New Orleans university who is a friend of
Reporter Hoke MAY, and he delivered it to MAY. (NOVEL's attorney has
stated that NOVEL worked for CIA in New Orleans in 1961).
3. Hoke MAY, without question, is Subject who in April 1958 was
granted a Covert Security Approval for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE.
MAY was not to be directly employed by FJINDULGE bat vas to be used in
connection with his position with a private firm which handled work for the
Project.
4. Investigation of Subject by this Agency in February/March 1958
reflected nothing of a derogatory nature. It fid indicate, however, that he
has in the past had an interest in politics and in 1952 was employed as
political campaign manager in the unsuccessful race of a candidate for Congress
from Georgia. Subject's grandfather was a Governor of Georgia and later a
Senator from that State. Subject has been employed by various newspapers,
including the New York Times (October 1948–March 1949). There is no in-
formation in Subject's file subsequent to his Covert Security Approval dated
April 1958.

"
Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably
be receiving a formal request for pertinent information
as this case develops, but he merely needed a preliminary
reading in order to determine if Mr. Osborn should be
defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.
Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to
Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the
undersigned.

William R. Kotapish
Acting Director of Security
Gordon Novel
Reference is made to your memorandum of transmittal
dated 18 January 1980 which forwarded a Naval Investigative
Service Operations Report dated 9 January 1980. The report
dealt with a contact of your New Orleans Office with one
Gordon Novel. According to the report, during his contact
Mr. Novel indicated that he had a relationship with the
Central Intelligence Agency. This is to advise you that a
check of the appropriate records of the Central Intelligence
Agency has determined that Mr. Novel is not and has never
been an employee of this Agency.

Mr. Novel was in contact with the Domestic Collec-

various proposals. Mr. Novel's proposals were
rejected by DCD, and Mr. Novel was requested to

Mr. Bell is President of Dektor Counter-

Springfield, Virginia, and has appeared widely
in the news media as a "wiretapping expert,
most recently in connection with the Watergate:
hearings. Mr. Bell has never been employed by
the Agency. The Office of Security file on
Mr. Ball was established in 1970 based on a
request from the Technical Security Division,
Directorate of Operations (TSD) for a Contact
Security Approval. Cited approval was granted
in November 1971, although Mr. Bell's file does
not reflect the specific purpose for the request
nor if Mr. Bell was actually contacted. Mr. Bell
was also of interest to DCD in October 1973;
however, the specific purpose of this interest
is not contained within Mr. Bell's file.
3. As indicated, a review of our records failed to disclose
any indication that Mr. Novel, Mr. Rohde, or Mr. Bell have ever
been employed by the Agency in any capacity.

It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request
from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I
would appreciate a written response to those traces by close of business
20 October so that certificates can be prepared.
3. It is possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be
required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that
there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this
is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

Associate General Counsel
Gordon Dwane Novel
1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for prosecution in New Orleans
on 27 October on charges stemming from a conspiracy to firebomb some
buildings on Canal Street. He was mentioned extensively in the James
Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assassination in 1967. Subse-
quently, Novel filed suit against Garrison and later against Playboy
Magazine for an article they published which identified Novel as a CIA
employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted a certificate signed by the then
Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel
had never been employed by the CIA (copy attached). It may be necessary
to submit a new certificate for the upcoming trial in New Orleans. You
are requested to search your files to determine whether there is any
record of employment.
2. There are two additional defense witnesses that we would
appreciate a search as to any employment relationship:

22 December 1967, was interviewed as an applicant for employment
by a member of the Office of Personnel, Central Intelligence Agency.
The search indicates also that, based on the information supplied at
such interview, the interviewer did not recommend employment and
his application for employment was not further processed by the
Central Intelligence Agency. The personnel records of the Central
Intelligence Agency contain ne record of employment of Cordon Dwane
Novel by the Central Intelligence Agency.

for S. Ray
In Channel 6's news broadcast at 6-6:30 PM, Saturday, 25 March 1967
the local newscaster announced that NBC had located Gordon Novel and had
interviewed him in "Washington." The film then switched to a front view
of Novel seated in an armchair and showing him answering questions posed
by someone off camera. (a) The latter asked if Garrison had promised
Novel anything in exchange for his testimony. Novel said that Garrison
had asked him if he needed money and had volunteered to give him whatever
financial assistance he needed. (b) The interviewer asked what was
Garrison's motive in prosecuting the case. Novel eventually said that it
was purely political. But before that, he said that Garrison reminded
win of Hucy Long and of Dr. Goebbels, from what he had read. The inter-
viewer asked this question a second time, couching it in somewhat different
terms what did Garrison hope to accomplish, what was his motive. Novel
said that that was a matter of conjunction (conjecture), that he might
bring in CIA
At the conclusion of the Washington interview, the film returned to
the local newscaster. The latter stated that NBC had informed the NO
station that Novel had submitted to a polygraph test in connection with
the interview and "had passed it."
The attached clippings from the 26 and 27 March issues of the Times-
Picayune do not mention the substance of the NBC interview. These articles
refer to NBC's having contacted Novel in McLean, Virginia, rather than

1. On 31 August 1976, Major Robert Foster, Defense
Intelligence Agency (telephone 11-50418), contacted
Mr. Robert Hopkins, Office of Security Liaison Officer,
seeking information concerning Subject. He explained that
the Subject, while residing in a local motel, hade verheard IN
a telephone conversation a girl. They discussed large
amounts of money with the indication it was illegally obtained.
Also, in this discussion, Subject mentioned that due to this
girl's information, he was arrested by the CIA in February 1976.

2. On 1 September 1976, Major Foster was contacted by
the undersigned and advised that the CIA had knowledge of the
Subject, but that he had never in any way been connected
with the CIA nor had we ever arrested him. Major Foster
was informed that the Subject has a long history of imper-
sonating CIA agents or abusing the CIA's name during his
activities. It was explained that based on our information,
Subject appeared to be somewhat irrational.
3. Major Foster advised that he also felt the Subject
was a "nut" and appreciated the information offered by the CIA.

Domestic Collections Division Memoranda
dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976
1.
According to the referenced Domestic Collections
Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans DCD Office had con-
sidered proposals from Subject in October 1975 and on
9 February 1976 which were rejected. During the last contact,
the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.
2. DCD requested Office of General Counsel (OGC) guidance
if they should be contacted by the press concerning Subject's
arrest for conspiring to detonate incendiary devices in a down-.
town New Orleans building. OGC recommended that they acknowledge
receiving a proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD
was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the
Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made
known to any inquiring reporters or United States Attorney.
DCD stated that they were pleased with this guidance, since
it allowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries
and also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties
in which Subject now finds himself. It appears that the only
action taken in this case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD
and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact
with the New Orleans DCD Office.

Novel claims Defense tie
Businessman Gordon Novel, ac-
cused of plotting to firebomb downtown
buildings during Carnival, claims he is
involved in an enormous project" with
"a gentleman in the Defense
Department."
Asked if the enormous project” was
linked to his arrest, Novel said, "Well,
something is behind this. I think I know
what it is but I would rather not say."
Novel, identified as a financial con-
sultant with the Langford Land Co. here
whose name surfaced nine years ago in
former Dist. Atty. Jim Garrison's
Kennedy assassination probes, made his
comments during a weekend jailhouse
interview.
Novel was arrested Feb. 21 and charged
with possessing a destructive device. He
has been held without bond since then,
pending a hearing Wednesday.
Affidavits filed in federal court allege
that Novel tried to hire an undercover
federal agent to firebomb five buildings
during Mardi Gras, when large crowds
would hamper fremen. Novel called the
charge "insane".
"It's so insane that the government
realizes the only way that it can make a
case is to allege that I'm insane," he
said. Novel said he was willing to take a
lie detector test and to submit to ques-
tioning under truth serum.
He said he has been "deeply involved"
in "counter-intelligence" operations in
the past, but did not elaborate.
“I know enough about the intelligence
community to one day play a major po-
litical role in it," Novel said.
IN 1963, Garrison accused Novel of
conspiring with a Cuban refugee to steal
explosives from an oil company storage
site. Garrison's investigation linked Lee
Harvey Oswald, the President's accused
assassin, with a vaguely defined Cuban
assassin, with a vaguely defined Cuban
liberation movement.
"
i
cent and put on a defense," Garcia said.
"The facts the U.S. Attorney has can be
explained."
Prosecutors allege that Novel tried to.
hire undercover agent W. Lloyd Grafton
to firebomb several downtown buildings
at the height of Tuesday's Mardi Gras
celebration, when fire trucks would be
hampered by crowds.
.
AGENTS REPORTED seizing a can of
alcohol, balloons, gunpowder, fuses and
matches from Novel's office on the 40th
floor of a downtown building, along with
diagrams of the buildings involved.
"That's absolutely untrue," Novel said
in the television interview. "They found
nothing when they searched my office."
Documents filed in federal court indi-
Novel sued Garrison for $50 million,cated Novel, a real estate financial con-
claiming his reputation had been dam-
aged but the suit was later dropped.
Asked if the current charges bore any
relation to the assassination probe,
Novel's lawyer, Servando C. Garcia III,
said: "It's a mistake. It's not related to
anything."
sultant, was "having a few problems"
with some of the downtown property.
which was supposedly the intended tar-
get of the firebombing.
Garcia said he hoped to have his client
released on bond at Wednesday's hear-
ing. He said there was no reason to keep
"We absolutely plan to plead him inno- Novel in jail indefinitely.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Gordon Novel's Arrest on Bomb Conspiracy Charges/Claim of
CIA Association
REF
(a) NO-39-76 dated 20 February 1976, Subject: Gordon Novel
(b) [Houck Watts Telecon of 24 February 1976, Same Subject
3
1. The US Attorney in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called
the New Orleans Resident Office on 24 February 1976 to advise me that
Gordon M. D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Bureau (ATF) for conspiring to detonate incendiary devices
in a downtown New Orleans building on Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976. Novel
had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly
held with an undercover ATF agent.
2. I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a number of contacts.
with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which Novel had offered
for CIA consideration. I told Gallinghouse that the proposal had been re-
jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen Novel on 9 February 1976
to accept additional material in support of his proposal. At that time
I also asked Novel not to contact me again. I assured Callinghouse that
at no time had Novel been an Agency employee, nor had he ever had any
formal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghouse thanked me for ex-
plaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested
that he might recontact me later if necessary for more details.
3. In the referent telecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations,
Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond if Galling-
house sought access to the office file on Novel. Mr. Watts recommended that
I try to avoid giving the US Attorney direct access to the file, but that
if Gallinghouse should ask to review the file, I should refer the request
to Headquarters for resolution.
4. Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my conversation with
Messrs. Callinghouse and Watts. She said that her husband had asked
her to call me to insure that federal authorities were aware that her
husband had been actively discussing a proposal for the Agency with me
Mrs. Novel said that her husband had been denied bond, and that he hoped
his contacts with a DCD officer might somehow convince federal authorities
that he could be safely released on bond after all. Otherwise, she said,
he might be detained through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precaution. She
assured me that Novel had made no effort to persuade the authorities that
he is a CIA officer or employee.

1. Attached are copies of two local news items concerning the
recent arrest of Cordon Novel for the illegal possession of an explo-
sive device and for conspiracy to bomb several buildings in downtown
New Orleans. In the article dated 1 March and in recent television
news coverage of the affair, Novel has been quoted as saying that he
is involved in an important US Government intelligence project and
is in frequent contact with an official of the Defense Department.
As we reported in the referent memo, Novel told the US Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms Durean (ATP) agents who arrested him that he was working
on a CIA project, a claim he said they could verify by calling the
New Orleans Resident Officer..

2. So far, there have been no public statements linking Novel's
recent activities to the Agency. In the referent telecons, however, we
requested guidance in responding to any media inquiries which might
materialize. John Greaney, Office of General Counsel, recommended that
we acknowledge, if asked, that Hovel had offered the Agency a proposal
which had subsequently been rejected. Mr. Greaney also confirmed that
Novel has never been employed by the agency, a fact which we might also
make known to any inquiring reporters or to the US Attorney, if necessary.
We are pleased with this guidance, since it allows us to respond candidly
to any media inquiries, and it also serves to disassociate the Agency
from the difficulties in which Novel now finds himself.
3. We will keep you informed of any further developments in this
matter which relate to the Agency or to our contacts with Novel.

custody Friday on charges of pos-
sessing a destructive device" in
connection with an alleged plot to
firebomb and destroy in succession
"several" buildings in the Central
Business District during the height
of Carnival festivities.
Documents in federal court here
reveal that Novel identified as a
financial consultant with the Lang
ford Land Co. was having "a few
problems with some of the property
located within the (downtown)

Although no formal motive for the al-
leged planned bombings was given,
sources said that Novel was trying to ob-
•tain the properties.
The only building cited by the court
documents as a target for the alleged at-
tacks was the Federation of Churches
Building; located at 330 St. Charles Ave..

Durbin/Noble Telecon, 17 July 1975.
1. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cleveland FBI contacted the
Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The
Bureau had received the letters the same day, and because there were
several references to the Agency, the agent thought that our office
should be informed. Copies of the correspondence are attached for
your information and retention.
2. The FBI agent who discussed this matter with us stated that
he had been told that the author of the four-page letter was a
"professional wiretapper", had previously been convicted to transporting
illegal wiretap equipment across state lines (into Nevada), and was
suspected of illegally obtaining and selling "classified information".
Cleveland FBI plans no action at this time other than further in-
vestigatory work on the individual.
3. The Cleveland RO plans to do absolutely nothing about this
matter other than forwarding the information to Headquarters. The
agent was informed of and agreed to this course of action, he was
thanked for his concern and the matter was dropped.

next Wednesday.
The complaint against Novel claims
that when the defendant was arrested
last week, he was in possession of “an
incendiary device," consisting of a can
of alcohol, balloons, a can of black pow-
der. timed fuses and other equipment.
Also confiscated, according to sources,
were maps and diagrams of the build-
ings to be hit.
Novel was arrested after ATF agents
learned the device was not registered.
The court documents also claim that
although Novel was unaware Grafton
was an undercover federal agent, he
tried to hire Grafton for the plan at
$1,000) and a year's free rent in an apart
ment.
Reportedly, Novel and two other men
were supposed to meet with Gov. Edwin
Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge
to discuss the possibilities of getting a
world's fair for New Orleans.
"I had a luncheon scheduled (last)
Saturday at the mansion with some peo-
ple to talk about the exposition," the
governor said. "But the name Novel
doesn't ring a bell.
"Only one man showed up Saturday.
He said the others couldn't make it and
asked if we could re-schedule the meet-
ing. I didn't even ask why they couldn't
make it.
An aide to the governor said the gover-
nor's office was trying to determine if
one of the three men was Novel.
He said records of the appointment
show only the time and subject matter of
the meeting.
The aide added that Novel may have
been one of the three, but he could not be
certain.
According to the documents, the ATF
Bureau received information "from a
confidential informant" of the alleged
plan.
Grafton, posing as a prospective "hit
man," made arrangements to discuss
the plans with Novel on Feb. 4.
"
The affidavit for a; search warrant
signed by Johannesen said Grafton
was told by Novel that Novel "had
several buildings he wanted destroyed in
the New Orleans, La. area.
The papers also show that on Feb. 6,
Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718
Lakeshore Drive, where Novel allegedly
said "he had made a firebomb for an
individual to burn the first building he
wanted destroyed, but that man failed to
do the job.
The identity of that person was not re-
vealed in the documents.
Novel said he "had a few problems.
with some of the property located within
the (downtown) project area and that
was where Grafton would come
in ...," according to the affidavit.
The documents showed that Grafton
met Novel again at his Plaza Tower of-
fice on Feb. 11 the two "discussed
₫
the firebombin
five buildings within
the downtown area.
At that time, according to the docu-
ments, Novel allegedly showed Grafton
the equipment as well as what Novel
supposedly described as "illegal wire-
tapping equipment.
At that meeting, the papers claim.
Novel allegedly agreed to give Grafton
"the contract" to destroy the five build-
ings.
That same day, the documents indi-
cate, Novel supposedly pointed out the
first building targeted for the alleged at-
tack, and later look Grafton to "the
building located between St. Charles and
Camp Street
According to the papers, Novel al-
legedly explained to Grafton "how
difficult it would be to get inside the
building."
At another meeting Feb. 13 between.
the two in Novel's office, the documents
said, Novel drew a diagram of the first
targeted building which was described
as being "accross the street from One
Shell Square."
Presumably, that building was the
Greater Federation of Churches Build-
ing.
On that same date, the records allege,
Novel fold Grafton "the fire should be on
the second floor in order for the roof and
floor to burn completely.
It was then, according to the affidavit,
that Grafton agreed to the plan for $1,000
and the free apartment.
According to the records, Novel also
presented Grafton a notebook, contain-
ing "a plan project of approximately
three blocks near the One Shell Square)
Building which was also to be part of
the alleged scheme.
After their series of meetings Novel
was arrested by the ATF agents Feb. 20.
Novel was denied bail the next day
and the government - led by Asst. U.S.
Atty. Al Winters - was granted a mo-
tion that Novel be examined by a psy-
chiatrist to determine his competency in
the proceedings.
Defense attorney Servando C.
"Sonny" Garcia III - a law partner of
Municipal Court Judge Eddic Sapir, has
urged that bond he set for his client..
In documents filed with the court Gar-
cia called Novel "a man well respected
in the community" who is "regularly
employed as a financial consultant,"
and a family man.

Dear Mr. Doherty:
Enclosed is a Xerox copy of a letter received by special
messenger on July 7, 1975, from Gordon Novel, making certain demands
on Southwestern Bell, AT&T and companies serving Columbus, Ohio, Reno,
Nevada and Washington, D. C. (See page 4, paragraph 3)
.
Mr. Novel's letter has been reviewed by our company Legal
Department and a decision has been made not to reply in writing.
Mr. Horak, the manager handling Novel's account, is to contact Novel
and advise him verbally that his letter has been referred to higher
management, and that copies of this letter have been forwarded to
the telephone companies serving the cities he mentioned for any
action they deem appropriate. Mr. Novel's propensity for filing
suit was one of the main considerations for choosing this course of
action.
Should any of the recipients of this letter decide to
contact or write Novel I would appreciate being notified prior to
your doing so.
Our Legal Department wants to be kept abreast of any
response made to his demands as it might affect the company's course
of action.
Enclosure

Gentlemen:
Due to the rapidly accelerating national sensitivity
of my historical personal interests, as well as the
magnitude of political, intelligence and financial involve-
ments for which I am legally responsible to my associates,
I deem it wise to contact your office for the following
reasons:
It is imperative that your files be revised in order
to ccase reflecting purposeful disinformation, slanderous
irregularities and obvious inconsistencies about my activities.
This data has been maliciously accumulated by your business
and security offices during the past seven years while
illegally intruding and interfering in highly sensitive
industrial and political counterintelligence research in
which I was involved. To accomplish this, A. T. & T. has
used misrepresentation and a fraudulent legal technicality
covering "anticipated" financial loss to the phone company.
(My phone bills have always been paid promptly.)
-
The police tactics used by your offices--harrassment,
intimidation, threats, extortionary demands have been
verified throughout Texas and in Washington, D. C. However,
the highly sensitive nature of the work in which we are
currently involved could, conceivably, pose a threat to
national security because of this invasion of privacy where
our phone calls are concerned.

Gordon Novel are one and the same person. I am certain
that you have been aware of this for many months. My

the legally incorrect one. Since I have lived 37 years
as Gordon Novel, I do not wish to have it changed in court
to suit some idiosyncrasy of your legal department.

The bills for this number are current and have been
promptly paid, in cash, on time since it was installed last

Upon instructions from my attorneys, I am formally
demanding that your office and A.T.&T. furnish written
assurance, in affidavit form, that neither your Dallas-
office nor its Columbus, Ohio, Reno, Nevada, and Washing-

10) Current interest in the acquisition of a
major D-FW region aerospace and manufacturing concern;
11) The distinct possibility that I will be
selected by the President of the United States as the
next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

The foregoing projects, and our involvement with

! //
Relative to the recent meeting in my private study
at my Dallas residence, July 2, 1975, I have reviewed my
records and do not find a willing nor direct acknowledgment
of the R. B McMasters billing responsibility, alleged by
Mr. Horak in his letter of the same date, written on plain.
watermarked stationery bearing questionable signature.
That purportedly official telephone company document claims
that I owe your company $1,041.42. I deny any responsibility
for the reason that Mr. McMasters personally effected the
installation of the phone at 3055 Leahy (243-6382), in his
name and as an officer of the now-defunct Genesis Corpora-
tion. I have caused approximately $20,000 to be paid to
Mr. McMasters, privately and corporately, for his unsuccess-
ful business ventures and I have no intention of assuming
responsibility for something else I do not owe in Mr.
McMasters behalf. He and the Genesis Corporation were
personally and corporately responsible for the bills for
that phone and I am certain your records will reflect same.
My records reflect that hundreds of vindictive,
disparaging and slanderous long-distance telephone calls
were placed by your company's collection operators alleging
that I did owe the bill. These calls caused me and my
associates severe personal and financial damages. I deirand
that the mistake be corrected in writing. I will furnish
you the list of names and addresses.

"The NBC broadcast of June 19, 1967" put on by Walter Sheridan "will probably stand for
years as a symbol of the lengths to which some powerful outside interests will go in order
to interfere with state government."
Walter Sheridan has recently been hired by the
Democratic National Committed to head their investi-
gation of the Watergate bugging caper. In view of
the importance of this assignment, it would seem
worthwhile to examine Mr. Sheridan's performance in
pact investigations.
"Getting" Hoffa, and False Testimony
Walter Sheridan first came into national promi-
mence in 1961 when he spearheaded Robert Kennedy's
drive against Jimmy Hoffa, during Robert's tenure:
as Attorney General. Sheridan pursued a relentless,
no mercy shown, course of action to "get Hoffa", and
get him he did. In the course of this crusade, some
rather dubious techniques were used; which later
The Watergate Incident
On June 17 at 2:30 a.m., five men were
arrested in the offices of the Democratic
National Committee in the Watergate Hotel,
Washington, D.C. They had broken into the
office, and were found with electronic sur-
veillance devices, cameras for photographing
documents, etc: they were wearing surgical
rubber gloves. They were arrested by police.
These five men were James W. McCord, Jr.,
Bernard L. Barker, Frank Sturgis, Eugenio R.
Martinez, and Virgilio R. Gonzales.
Their connections reach to the Republican
Party, the Committee to Re-Elect the Presi-
dent, Président Richard M. Nixon, the Central
Intelligence Agency, and other persons and
organizations.
Beginning in August 1972, "Computers and
Automation" has been publishing articles on
the Watergate Incident and its ramifications,
because of the threat that this incident rep-
resents to democracy in the United States,
and the importance of seeking the truth about
it and pinning down the responsibility for it.
came back to haunt Mr. Sheridan. The prime example
was the "uncovering" of a key witness against Hoffa,
one Grady Partin of New Orleans and Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. Partin was some years later accused by
✓ a grand jury of giving false testimony against
Hoffa.
"Getting" Garrison
Mr. Sheridan's most notable performance came in
1967 and '68 when he was an executive producer for
_ NBC-TV news. Sheridan produced a one-hour NBC spe-
cial on Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and the trial of Clay
Shaw for conspiracy to murder the President. The
program, broadcast on June 19, 1967, was a highly
biased, provably dishonest, personally vindictive,
attack on Garrison defending Shaw. The Shaw trial
did not take place until February, 1969, a year and
a half later.
Arrest by Garrison and Indictment by Grand Jury
Walter Sheridan was arrested by Garrison on
July 7, 1967, following the NBC Special, and in-
dicted by a grand jury on two counts. The first
was attempted bribery and intimidation of a witness.
Rick Townley of station WDSU, the NBC affiliate in
New Orleans, was arrested and indicted with Sheridan
on the same charges. The federal government, es-
pecially the Justice Department, made sure that Gar-
rison was never able to bring Sheridan and Townley.
to trial. The indictments are still open.
:
If the Sheridan trial ever does take place, the
conviction should not be too difficult. Here are
the facts, as reported by both New Orleans newspa-
pers, the Times Picayune and the States Item, in
1967 and summarized in "The Kennedy Conspiracy" by.
Paris Flammonde. Meredith Press, 1969.
Sheridan and Townley, having been assigned by
ABC to cover the Garrison-Shaw case, became person-
ally and directly involved. The indictments for
bribery, suppressing and altering evidence, and in-
terfering with the trial, did not begin to tell the
.entire story. NBC top management, Frank McGee, the
narrator of the special, and others at NBC, fully

backed up Sheridan, until e of the lies, bribes
and fakes in the program were revealed.
Apology by NBC for Lies Told by Two "Witnesses"
Frank McGee later had to apologize on NBC for
dies told by two of Sheridan's "witnesscs" on the
special. Sheridan and Townley paid them to give
statements against Garrison. The FCC ruled that
NBC had to give Garrison equal time after Garrison
made an appeal, because the special had not been a
news program, but an NBC-Sheridan vendetta against.
Garrison. NBC did give Garrison 30 minutes (the
special was one hour) to respond at a later date in
1967.
To ustrate Sheridan's and NBC's techniques in
the case, at one point the President of NBC helped
in the bribery efforts by calling Mr. Gherlock, head¨
of Equitable Life Insurance Co. in New York. Gher-
łock was asked for assurance that Perry Russo, who
worked for Equitable in Louisiana, would cooperate
with NBC on the Garrison special. Russo was the
key witness in the Shaw trial whom Sheridan and
Townley tried to bribe.
.
To remind the reader about the Shaw trial, Jim
Garrison opened an investigation into the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy in late 1966. Senator
Long of Louisiana had convinced Garrison that a
conspiracy had existed. Lee Harvey Oswald's ac-
@tivities in New Orleans prior to the assassination,
Falong with the strange actions of David Ferrie, on
the day of the assassination, attracted Garrison's
attention. He had not made his investigation public..
but a curious newspaper reporter named Rosemary
James broke the story after a few months of effort.
Clay Shaw's other identity, Clay Bertrand, had al-
ready been uncovered by Garrison, and his involve-
ment in the planning for the assassination had al-
ready been suspected by early 1967.
Party in David Ferrie's Apartment.:
Perry Russo attended a party in David Ferrie's.
apartment where Clay Bertrand, Ferrie, someone re-
sembling Lee Harvey Oswald and others had discussed
the possibility of assassinating President Kennedy.
He became the key witness when Garrison arrested
Shaw on March 1, 1967, and a grand jury indicted
Shaw on March 22 following two hearings on March 14
and March 17 by a three judge panel and a four judge
panel, recommending that Shaw be held for trial.
Effort to Have Russo Change His Testimony
:
Sheridan and Townley both made up their minds.
along with most of the news media and the Justice
Department, that Garrison had to be stopped at all
costs. They decided to really go to work on Perry
Russo, since his testimony was all important.
Townley tried to get Russo to change his testi-
mony at the Shaw trial to make it seem that Garrison
had hypnotized him and had then asked him leading
questions to get Russo to testify against Shaw.
Townley and Sheridan went to Russo's house, his of-
fice, and met him at other places. They badgered
him and attempted to bribe him. They pressured and
threatened him. They used every trick in the book
to try to get him to change his testimony.
They threatened him with being discredited, made
to scem insane, and perhaps fired from his job. They
offered him a chance to work closely, for high re-
wards, with NBC in Sheridan's 'all-out effort to get
Garrison. Sheridan told Russo, "We're going to de-
..
stroy Ca
on and his case along with him." Townley
told Russo: that he could get Shaw's lawyer, Dymond,
to go easy on him at the trial, if he would alter
his testimony. He told Russo that his employer had
promised NBC that no retaliation would be taken
against Russo if he cooperated, with NBC. However
he might be fired if he didn't cooperate.
Sheridan told Russo that NBC could set him up in
California where Russo always wanted to live, if he
helped bust up the Garrison probe. Sheridan said
NBC would pay his expenses to California and to live
there, would protect his job, would get Russo a
lawyer, and would guarantee that Garrison would
never extradite him back to Louisiana.
Gordon Novel, Worker for the CIA
Another important witness in the Shaw trial was
Gordon Novel, a bugging and electronics expert who
worked for the CIA. Garrison tried to subpoena him,
but he left New Orleans and fled to Ohio. Garrison
was never able to extradite Novel from Ohio to Loui-
siana in spite of Novel's public statements that he
knew who had killed David Ferrie. (Ferrie died mys-
teriously shortly after Garrison's probe became pub-
lic knowledge.)
Walter Sheridan told Perry Russo that NBC had :
helped Novel escape Garrison's clutches by flying
him out of Louisiana to McLean, Virginia (home of
the CIA). NBC paid for a lie detector test to be
administered to Novel in McLean. The test was sup-
posed to prove that Novel was telling the truth when
he said he knew nothing about the Kennedy case.
Sheridan told Russo that NBC would do the same thing
for him that they had done for Novel, namely, make
sure that Novel would never be extradited to Louisi-
ana to testify. Since Novel never was extradited
and since Governor Rhodes of Ohio blocked his extra-
dition making Governor McKeithen of Louisiana ex-
tremely angry, it would seem that Sheridan was right
NBC did possess a lot of clout.
Sheridan and Townley also went to work on Gordon
Novel's former wife. Marlene Mancuso. She was
another important Shaw trial witness; because of her
knowledge about Novel's CIA activities and a bur-
glary of a munitions dump in Houma, Louisiana.
Townley called her and tried to convince her to
grant a taped interview for use on the NBC show..
He said Garrison was going to be destroyed and that
she should cooperate with NBC.
The NBC Special on June 19, 1967
The NBC-Walter Sheridan special on June 19,
1967, titled "The JFK Conspiracy - The Case of Jim
Garrison", was packed with Sheridanese. Here are
the principal examples:
1. A lawyer named Dean Andrews in New Orleans had
played a key role in the Shaw trial because Clay
Bertrand had telephoned him in a hospital shortly
after the assassination and asked him to represent
Lee Harvey Oswald. Andrews told so many different.
stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif-
ficult to determine.
.
-
Frank McGee asked Andrews on the program about
Clay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews
said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar
owner in New Orleans. Sheridan's coup quickly blew
up in his face when Davis denied the whole thing.
When the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged
as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as
Clay Bertrand.

--- Image 104-10305-10000_page_70.jpeg ---
13-00000
Bundy Lying
2. Sheridan's second attempt was to attack the credi-
Sbility of Vernon Bundy, a witness for the prosecution
Asko had seen Oswald and Shaw together on the New Or-
leans lakefront (Lake Pontchartrain). Sheridan
cooked up two "witnesses" against Bandy. NBC pre-
sented John "the Baptist" Cancler, a burglar and
Miguel Torres, also a burglar, who had been ac-
quainted with Bundy.
Sheridan paid Cancler and Torres to make state-
ments on the program. Cancler said that Bundy had.
simdicated to him that his story regarding Oswald
and Shaw was not true. Torres asserted that Bundy's
testimony was "an out-front lie". Cancler said he
had been approached by members of Garrison's staff
to "plant" something in Shaw's house. Torres claimed
that he had been asked (by Garrison) to testify that
Shaw had made homosexual advances toward him and
also that Shaw was Bertrand.
Frank McGee reported that NBC had discovered
Bundy was lying during his polygraph test and Gar-
· rison 'knew it but let him testify anyway.
Cancler Sentenced to 18 Years
Following the TV show. Cancler was called before
the Orleans Parish grand jury and asked to repeat
his accusations under oath. Cancler took the fifth
amendment, refusing to reiterate his TV charges. The
jury foreman immediately took Cancler before a judge
and asked him to repeat. Cancler again took the
fifth and was found guilty of contempt of court and
fined $500 or one year. Apparently Sheridan had
paid him a lot more than $500. Two weeks later
Cancler was handed a third convinction and sentenced
to eighteen years as a multiple offender.
Miguel Torres was also brought before a grand
jury and took the fifth when he was asked, "Were
the statements you made on national television on
ABC in June 1967, concerning the district attorney.
true?"
James Alcock, Garrison's assistant district at-
torney who handled the Shaw trial, said to the judge,
"Torres and Cancler just tell the television and
Walter Sheridan about it. When they have an oppor-
tunity to do something they take the fifth amendment.
Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to "Cooperate"
'
3. Sheridan himself appeared on screen to discuss
Perry Russo. He could never get Russo to change.
This mind and cooperate, so Sheridan interpreted for
the audience what Russo had told him. He stated.
that Russo told him that his testimony against Shaw
may be a combination of truth, fantasy and lies.
Andrew Sciambra, Garrison's assistant district
attorney who interviewed Russo, delivered a memo to
Garrison, detailing Walter Sheridan's efforts to
bribe and threaten Russo. The statements made by
Russo to Sciambra were very incriminating about
Sheridan. The net result of all Sheridan's efforts
were that Russo stuck to his story at the trial.
Fred Leemans, "Witness"
4. Sheridan's last "witness" on the show was Fred
Leemans, another bar owner (Sheridan seemed to
specialize in bar owners) and former Turkish bath
operator. Leemans said that his original statements
given to Garrison about Clay Shaw were not true and
that his psyche began to trouble him. The morality

had associated the name Bertrand with Shaw, and that
on occasion he had been accompanied by a young
slightly-bearded man whom he called "Lee". Leemans
said on TV that Garrison had offered him $2500 for
his testimony.
The New York Times telephoned Leemans following
his appearance for an interview. He refused to.
speak about his NBC bit, conceding that he had ar-
ranged to give the Associated Press the exclusive.
story. He said. "After all, I have to get something
out of all of this." On hearing this line, one of
Garrison's staff smiled and said, "Ah, now that's
the Fred Leemans we all recognize."
'
Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses
.
In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe
witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of
Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur-
vich. Garrison found out about the meetings and
did not give Gurvich all of the information he
wanted.
Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC
broadcast, "Aside from the fact that it insulted
the intelligence of every American, it was a very
clear attempt to prejudice in advance possible
jurors in the case. This program will probably
stand for years as a symbol of the lengths to
which some powerful outside interests will go in
order to interfere with state government.
Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical
☐
Computers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-
puters and data processing. believes that the pro-
fession of information engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in a professional and engineering sense, for:
The reliability and social significance
of pertinent input data;
The social value and truth of the
output results.
"
In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.
Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information
related to socially useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
but productive of thought and an improved and
safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.
-
The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war.
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-
sion, and many more.

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March
. 1967 when GARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with
'
a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together
with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left
New Orleans, first going to McLean, Virginia where he was given a
lie detector test by Lloyd B. FURR, a private detective. (See summary
on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial
claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's proximity to
McLean, Va.
After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967
a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink
drainboard by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy
friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in
turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-ITEM, Hoke MAY.

Democratico, an Agency created and supported anti-Castro organization.
Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEL could have gained
an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.
-
In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arest by GARRISON
on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to
testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe
on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.
DETAILS:
The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.
However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana
and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, . Was
one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with
Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony'
before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK
was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that
BURBANK and NOVEL knew each other. BURBANK testified that every Louisiana
sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel
#526113
20 May 1969
1. On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that
he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu, Director of Security,
National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation
by Subject. According to Mr. Bienvenu, an ex-Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent, Mr. Russell 1%. Aufrance, 3256 South Union
Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601, had called Mr. Mathison and
advised that a contact of his had stated that Subject had shown a
CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency.
Mr. Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to
bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials
in Washington and that if anyone wished to contact him they should
call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.
2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr.
Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed
the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and
advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other
occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that
we intended to turn this information over to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such
impersonation cases.
-
3. I later briefed Mr. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who
suggested that I advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to
local FBI agents. In Mr. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance
who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison. He also stated that
Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce
in Columbus, Ohio. She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a

discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of

29. The criminal records of the Chicago Police Department
were checked in the name of Thomas F. HUGHES and there was
no record.
:.
30. A reliable, confidential source, who is personally
acquainted with Thomas F. HUGHES, Jr. furnished the following
observations on HUGHES; That HUGHES was born and reared in
the South Shore area of Chicago; that HUGHES inherited the
family business, Hughes Oil and Coal, and has built it into
a successful business; that HUGHES seems to have an income
sufficient to maintain a 30 foot boat, patronize the smart
and oxpensive restaurants and night clubs, live in an
expensive apartment and dress in a stylish fashion; and
that HUGHES has a reputation for "liking the ladies" and
is a steady patron of the Playboy Club and other night
spots. HUGHES is regarded as a "man about town" who enter
tains frequently around the night club circuit. His tastes
are expensive. The confidential source further related
that HUGHES may have some effeminate mannerisms, but nothing
derogatory was known in that regard. The confidential source
further related that he has always wondered about the source
of HUGHES' money, HUGHES has various business investments,
including somo apartment buildings and an interest in the
Maryland Hotel. The source pointed out that the Maryland
Hotel has always been identified as having ownership in the
Chicago syndicate. The source speculated that HUGHES may be
a front man or have some support from the Syndicate; howeyer
he (confidential source) has never known HUGHES to be involved
in any Syndicate operations or activities.

suspicious that he has turned it over to the FBI. The conversa-
tion was then concluded.
15. Shortly thereafter, according to Mr. HUGHES (also
confirmed by Mr. FAY), a person who identified himself a as
Gordon NEVILLE NEVEL OR NOVEL called the FBI Office and said
ho registered in Room 551 at the Ambassador East and that he
was in Chicago on a matter involving James GARRISON and a
legal action against Playboy Magazine for defamation of character
or some such vague explanation. Agent FAY
Agent FAY was recontacted by
CFO regarding the above telephone call, but he was unable to
add to, or clarify the details of the call. Agent FAY said
he prepared a brief memorandum on the case and closed it.
16. Mr. HUGHES said he has suspected all along that
the telephone calls were either made by, or instigated by
one Gordon NEVIL, NEVILLE or NOVEL (HUGHES professed only
phonetic spelling; however, Headquarters, after an indices
check, later said that it was probably Gordon NOVEL, who
had previously owned a bar in New Orleans and who had
previously claimed an affiliation with the Agency)
17. Mr. HUGHES said that he has a little background on
Gordon NOVEL and it may have a bearing on the recent events
Mr
HUGHES said that about three years ago, he met one Abbey
MULLIGAND a native of Tennessee, who was then working as a
bunny in the Playboy Club in Chicago. Abbey has also worked
at Playboy Clubs in New Orleans, Cincinnati, London and other
places. A few years ago, Abbey married NOVEL, whom she met
in New Orleans. Since that time, Abbey and NOVEL have
made their home in the Columbus, Ohio area. They have had
on
several occasions, Abbey has filed for a divorce. Presently,
Abbey is living in Columbus with her parents, the John
MULLIGANS
a lot of fights and arguments and have been separated
18. Mr. HUGHES further related that NOVEL lives by his
wits and is not to be trusted; that NOVEL engages in "private
eye" work of questionable practices; that he (NOVEL) reportedly
taps telephones, "bugs"
bugs" rooms and takes photographs, all of
which are in connection with questionable activities; and that
NOVEL, in the past, according to Abbey, has claimed working
for the Agency.
19. Mr. HUGHES further related that he has no romantic
interests, such as marriage, with Abbey and looks upon her
as a good friend. Last summer, Mr. HUGHES arranged for
Abbey to spend a few weeks in the Ft. Lauderdale area. Mr
HUGHES was there also. Mr. HUGHES said that he made elaborate
precautions to make sure that Abbey couldn't be traced
directly from Columbus to Florida, lle had Abboy fly to
Chicago and then catch another plane to Florida. Somehow,
Mr, HUGHES further related, NOVEL found out about their trip
to Florida, according to Abbey

SUBJECT: GUGAS, Chris
SECRET
14 August 1968
Subject is identified as a California investigator who administered
polygraph test to Edgar Eugene BRADLEY who has been charged with conspiracy.
by GARRISON.
Ɛubject was born 12 August 1921 at Omaha, Nebraska. He is a former
Agency employee who EOD in October 1949 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer.
Subject resigned his staff status in February 1951 and became a staff
agent with Project/ENDOMORPH) in Turkey from March 1951 until July 1952.
(His wife Anne Claudia GUGAS nee SETARO was granted a covert security clearance
in February 1952 for use in a clerical capacity in the Middle East.)
1
In his assignment with Project (ENDOMORPH in Turkey, Subject was a
source of constant embarrassment in his contacts with Turkish (police] 8
officials. He was boastful, indiscreet, lacking in sound judgment, knew
little or nothing in the fields in which he was self-professedly an expert
and vas guilty of security breaches in failing to maintain his cover.
In one incident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to be
8
made by province governors in Turkey; whereas, in Turkey, the Police
Department is a national organization and not subject to the dictates of
the province governors. This caused much ill will and friction with the
Turkish police.
Subject professed to be an expert in his knowledge of the polygraph
machine and claimed he had two years' experience with the Los Angeles :
Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, it
was developed that instead of this claimed experience, he had actually
spent one or two weeks in a detective school connected with the Los Angeles
Police Department where he received below average grades.
In October 1952 he approached an Agency employes regarding a new
type of
by SunTechnical equipment and this conversation led to the disclosure
that he was employed by the Agency in a covert capacity; that
he was teaching lie detection techniques to foreign police departments
without being authorized or competent to do so. Subject was briefed in
December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his
security responsibilities and exercising utmost precaution in protecting
the covert interests of the Agency.
In spite of the strong warnings given him in this interview, Subject
again became involved in an incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

In March 1953 he misrepresented himself as a polygraph operator with the
"State Department Secret Police". This misrepresentation was made at a
time when the Department of State was not authorized to have a polygraph
machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regarding
such authorization. As a result of this misrepresentation, Subject was
afforded another security interview in March 1953. He explained that
his cover company sold equipment to foreign countries through the Mutual
Aid Program and supplied consultant services to the State Department but
Subject denied that he ever represented himself as a State Department
polygraph operator. After the security interview Subject was also assessed
by an Agency psychologist (March 1953) and was found to be egotistical,
emotionally unstable, possessed of a need to build himself up in the
eyes of others and gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous
information as to his past positions. His intelligence quotient was found
to be comparatively low in relation to those of other Agency employees.
In April 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.
Subject resigned 29 April 1953 "to accept a position in California.
Washington climate is not agreeable to his family."
In April 1964 Mr. J. Kirk BAREFOOT, Director of Becurity, McKesson
and Robbins, Skokie, Illinois, informed the Agency he had been a witnesa
to unauthorized disclosures of classified information made by a group in
a cocktail lounge in Omaha, Nebraska. The individual making the disclosures
/ about ENDOMORPH) activities abroad under Agency sponsorship was identified
as Leonard HARRELSON. Subject, who was then Director of Public Safety
for the City of Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the group and it was believed
that he was responsible for supplying the classified information to HARRELSON
about [ENDOMORPH activities.
Leonard HARRELSON is a private investigator specializing in hypnotism __
and the use of the polygraph machine. In 1964 he was employed by the Keeler
Polygraph Company in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954 HARRELSON was in partnership
with Lloyd B. FURR in a private detective agency known as the American
Bureau of Investigation, Tower Building, Washington, D. C. Lloyd B. FURR
is the polygraph operator who gave a lie detector test to Gordon NOVEL,
hostile witness subpoenaed by GARRISON. The test received newspaper publicity.
as being given at "McLean, Va." in March 1967. (Summary on FURR attached).
HARRELSON is believed to be a person of poor morals. He was given
a medical discharge from the Army as a psychoneurotic in 1949 and had been
court-martialed twice for impersonating non-commissioned officers of a
rank higher than he possessed. In his business partnership with FURK,
HARRELSON would misrepresent himself as being with the FBI by covering the
word "American" when presenting his credentials and just showing "Bureau
of Investigation"
Incidentally, the informant, J. Kirk BAREFOOT mentioned above, was
disapproved for Agency employment in 1951 because of falsification of his PHS
and questionable maturity, judgment, discretion and honesty.
