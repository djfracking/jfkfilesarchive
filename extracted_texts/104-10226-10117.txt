Subject: Apparent RIS Interest in Manfred R. Schroeder,
Bell Telephone Labs
10. After Schroeder visits the USSR on his current trip, he
plans to fly to Sofia to spend approximately a week with his wife's
family there. Schroeder had not mentioned the Bulgarian visit in
outlining his original itinerary to Bob Martin of this office, there-
fore, it was not mentioned in Schroeder's Coordination Outline.
In-
11. All of the above would seem to indicate quite strongly that
Schroeder, as we originally surmised, has been targeted by R.I.S.
briefing Schroeder, we ran through some of the typical entrapment
situations fabricated by the opposition, e.g., women, homosexuals,
purchase of drugs for Sov citizens, black market activity, acceptance
of letters to mail outside the USSR, commitments to disaffected Sovs,
etc. In addition, we stringently admonished Schroeder against any
notetaking or photography which could in any way be construed as com-
promising. We also alerted Schroeder to the fact that some attempt
might be made to use his Wife's family as leverage in a recruitment
attempt. In this connection, we pointed out to Schroeder that there
was a strong likelihood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian service would
make an approach to him during his forthcoming visit to Sofia. An
approach in Bulgaria would give the Sovs an opportunity for disavowal
and also would provide the proper setting for maximum utilization of
relatives. When Schroeder mentioned that his sister-in-law, FNU
Monschik, had indicated several times in the past that she would like
to leave Bulgaria, we strongly admonished him against making any com-
mitments to her, pointing out that she may possibly be co-opted by
the opposition. We told Schroeder that any representations to gain
an exit visa for his sister-in-law should be channeled through the
US Legation in Sofia. Schroeder was told that, if any pressure were
applied concerning his wife's family, his best reaction would probably
be a noncommittal, "I'll think it over when I get home:" All in all,
ve alerted Schroeder as best we could to the opposition M.O. and pre-
pared him on how best to avoid some of the not so obvious pitfalls
which might be in store for him.
12. Prior to our briefing of Schroeder, Bob Martin alerted Bell
management to all of the ramifications of Schroeder's travel behind
the Curtain. The management was informed by Martin that we felt it
our obligation to point out to them the strong possibility that Schroeder
had been targeted in order that they would have all of the facts avail-
able before signing off on his trip.

Subject: Apparent RIS Interest in Manfred R. Schroeder,
Bell Telephone Labs
13. Assessment of Schroeder: Subject, a very accomplished
scientist, heads up all acoustics research at Bell. He reads
Russian and is fluent in German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,
and English. He impresses us as being a rather savvy, discreet,
cooperative, mature, stable, well motivated individual. We attri-
bute Schroeder's apparent lack of discretion in his dealings with
the Sovs more to the subtlety of the Sov approach than to his own
naivete. It has been our experience that most US businessmen and
scientists are very susceptible and vulnerable to the opposition
approach mainly due to somewhat of a lack of realistic public
education concerning contacts with Bovbloc nationals. We feel
that Schroeder's degree of cooperativeness with US services has
been enhanced considerably by his feeling that he has really been
taken for a ride by the opposition.
Incidentally, when we asked subject for permission to release this
information with source disclosure to the FBI, he was at first some-
what apprehensive and expressed the desire to talk it over with one
of his Bell superiors before he made any commitments. He finally
agreed, however, when we convinced him that it would certainly be in
his best interest to get on record with the FBI as soon as possible.
Most of his apprehension about the FBI seemed to be attributable to
the fact that he has just been granted US citizenship and, in addition,
is now somewhat concerned that his activities with the Sova in some
way my effect his security status which in turn could be very detri-
mental to his career.
Based on our limited contact with Schroeder, we have every reason to
believe that he would be suitable for operational use, should the
Bureau choose to pursue such a course.
14. We would strongly recommend that all of the above be passed
to the Bureau ASAP in order that that organization may effect contact
with Schroeder and provide him with proper guidance concerning any
further approaches by Sov or Bloc nationals in this country.

During routine debriefing of Donald E. Thomas of Bell Labora-
tories in connection with his recent USSR visit to attend the Poyov
Society Meeting, 5-14 May, Moscow (see NYOR 8878 for Coordination Out-
line) subject mentioned having had recent contact with a Soviet Govern-
ment representative in this country. The Soviet in question identified
Chimself to Thomas as Gleb Aleks? Pavlov and gave his address as 1216
First Avenue, Manhattan.
2. According to Thomas, his initial contact with Pavlov took
place in late March following the International Convention and Show
of the I.B.E.E., 25-29 March, New York City (see Case 39843). At the
convention Thomas became friendly with two Soviet counterparts in
attendance, A. V. Tiel and Anatole Trutka, both of whom Thomas invited
to his home for a social visit during their US stay. When the Sovs
departed for home following the convention, Thomas saw them off at New
York International Airport. It was at the airport that he first met
Pavlov, who apparently was seeing off all of the Sov I.E.E.E. delegates.
After the Sov delegation had departed, Thomas and Pavlov returned to
Manhattan together and, on parting, exchanged addresses.
3. A couple of weeks after their initial meeting, Pavlov tele-
phoned Thomas at his home and told him that Tiel and Trutka had asked
him to send their warmest regards to Thomas and thank him for the
hompitality which he showed them during their trip to this country.
During the conversation, Pavlov expressed an interest in renewing his
acquaintance with Thomas, and suggested that he would enjoy visiting
him at his home in Madison, New Jersey. Thomas said that he would
enjoy seeing Pavlov, but that he was currently preparing to leave on
a trip to the USSR and Europe and was not scheduled to return to the
UB until late May. Thomas suggested that, in view of this, perhaps
early June would be a good time for them to plan on getting together.
Pavlov replied that he, himself would be in the USSR then, but would
contact Thomas when he returned in early July. Incidentally, Pavlov's
copy attached

phone call to Thomas was made on a pay phone. In fact, when the opera-
tor cut in for overtime, Thomas called Pavlov back at the pay phone.
Thomas mentioned that he possibly might have the phone number written
down somewhere.
4. Boon after the phone call from Pavlov, Thomas called John
McVicker of the State Department and inquired if any clearance of
Pavlov's proposed trip to his home in Madison would be necessary.
McVicker told Thomas that any such clearances were Pavlov's worry
and that he need not be concerned about. same.
5. During his recent trip to the USSR, it would appear that
Thomas was exposed to two incidents which possibly could have been
of opposition fabrication. One involved an approach by a Soviet
interpreter by the name of FNU Petrov, who took Thomas aside and
asked him if he could do him a personal favor by getting him a sub-
scription to National Geographic Magazine for which he, Petrov, would
reimburse Thomas in rubles. Thomas politely refused.

•Rent CIUSSA
6. The other incident involved Thomas being photographed with
Lan attractive young female Interpreter, Ludmilla Oshkina. According
to Thomas, when one of the Soviets in their party was about to take
a picture of him standing next to Ludmilla, another individual stand-
ing nearby was pushed out of the way apparently so that he would not
be included in the photograph. In addition, Ludmilla attempted to
strike an affectionate pose with Thomas for the photograph by slipping
her arm through his. Thomas claims to have pushed her arm away just
as the photo was being snapped.
7. Assessment of Thomas: Subject strikes us as being extremely
naive and unrealistic. He appears to be more apprehensive about his
dealings with CIA than his dealings with Soviets. In fact, when Thomas
was asked if he would mind if a tape recorder were used for debriefing,
he became very nervous and expressed a fear that, if such a tape were
made, perhaps the Soviets might gain access to it and use it against
him in some way at a future date.
Thomas had an outline in his own handwriting of the sessions of the
Popov Society Meeting. When we asked for a photostat of same, he
again expressed misgivings and indicated that he would prefer to have
a typewritten copy prepared for us instead of a copy in his own hand-
writing because he was fearful that it might fall into Soviet hands.

We inquired of Thomas why he had not mentioned Pavlov to us during our
defensive briefing of him before his trip. He replied rather nebulously
that it was his understanding that it was company policy that our only
function in seeing him before his trip was to give him a defensive brief-
ing, and that, since no debriefing was involved at the time, he felt no
obligation to volunteer the information concerning Pavlov.
It is our opinion that Thomas's obvious naivite, apparent lack of sophisti-
cation, and extreme apprehension concerning dealings with our Agency would
make him most unsuitable from the standpoint of operational utilization
by the Bureau.
8. We would strongly recommend that all of the above be passed to
the Bureau ASAP in order that that organization may effect contact with
Thomas in time to provide him with proper guidance concerning any further
approaches by Pavlov or other Sov legals in US.

1. We thought the attached reports would be of interest to Lincoln
Staff from a Soviet realities standpoint. We also felt that they should
be brought to the attention of Division management because the M.O. out-
lined therein is becoming a major factor in dealing with sources who have
contact with Sovbloc nationals. It has been our experience that the type
of activity outlined has been on a marked increase, particularly since
the establishment of the KGB 10th Directorate. Although such activity
by Bov legals is taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly
its greatest impact is being felt in the New York and Washington, D.C.
“areas because of the large Soviet Government establishments in both of
these cities. For this reason it would seem imperative that both WAFO
and NYFO be extremely vigilant for such activity in companies and insti-
tutions with which they are dealing in order that it may be recognized
in its earliest stages and appropriate CI/CE countermeasures instituted.
In order to assist other offices in this respect, we plan to write in the
near future an article for the Division Newsletter, outlining some of our
experiences along these lines.
2. We were somewhat disappointed in CI Staff's reaction to our
recent request for assistance in defensive briefing of the subject of
one of the attached reports. It seems to be quite clear now that our
original assumption concerning his being R.I.S. targeted was quite correct
and that there is a strong likelihood that his current trip behind the
Curtain will be utilized by the opposition for provocation and/or an
actual recruitment attempt. We wonder in future cases of this nature
exactly what support we may expect from Angleton's shop. Although we
feel that we have a fair capability for handling such matters here in
New York, we do admit that, at least on this one, we would have felt
slightly more comfortable had a CI specialist been along, if for no other
reason than to preclude any possible Monday morning quarterbacking by the
"old pros."

While at this Congress I met a Soviet female scientist, L. Chistovich,
who is connected with the Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Leningrad.
One day during the Congress I took a walk in the Black Forest with
L Caistovich and another Soviet scientist. After a short time, the
other Boviet scientist excused himself saying that he had to rejoin
his colleagues.
In June 1963 Manfred Schroeder, an acoustician with Bell Telephone
Laboratories, was in the USSR. On his return to the US he told me that
he had heard while in the USSH that L Chistovich, on her return from
the 1959 Stuttgart Congress, had been placed under house arrest. He
also said that he had seen L Chistovich while he was in the USSR, and
he had asked her whether it was true that she had been placed uner
house arrest on returning from the Stuttgart ngress. He mid
Chistovich's only reply was to blush,

Subject: Attempted R.I.S. Penetration of Bell Telephone Labs
3. Judging by the attached material, it would appear that, despite
established Bell policy (see our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the
opposition has seen fit to deflower at least two of Bell's scientific
virgins. We seriously wonder at this point just how many other Bell
people might be in the same boat. Perhaps, as a result of all this,
some representation by Bell management to the KGB will be forthcoming,
spelling out to that organization, as was spelled out to our own, estab-
lished company policy pertaining to such matters. In any event, it would
appear that at least one or two Bell scientists, and there are probably
more, have been giving the R.I.8. more cooperation and reporting than the
Agency. Let's hope that in the near future Bell management takes some
effective steps to rectify this rather ludicrous, and patently dangerous,
situation.

11 0930-1230 hours 14 June, Manfred R. Schroeder of Bell Labs
received a strong defensive briefing in connection with his June-
July trip to the USSK and Bulguria (see our 7 Day Coordination Out-
line for subject)* During Schroeder's briefing, Nagle elicited
from him that prior to a trip to the USSR in 1959 he had been con-
tacted by an individual who represented himself us u West German
Intelligence Officer. More important, we also learned that, at
about the same time, RIS cultivation of Schroeder apparently began.
2. Concerning the West German approach, Schroeder indicated
that his mother, who resides in Hamburg, was velophoned in 1959 by
an individual who claimed to be an old sequintance of her son's
and who was interested in contacting him concerning employment in
the US. The caller left a phone number and said that he would ap-
preciate it if Schroeder could call him neze time he was in Hamburg.
Schroeder's mother relayed the message to her con, and, as requested,
he telephoned the caller just prior to his 1959 USSR junket. The
individual he called identified himself as a West German intelligence
Officer and said that he would like to meat Shroyer as coon as
possible. Schroeder agreed. When they met, the individual in question
(Schroeder does not recall his name) presented suitable credentials
and expressed interest in Senroeder's trip to the USSR. According to
Schroeder's account, the West German Intelligence Officer gave him the
old "keep your eyes and ears open" pitch, and sold him that he would
contact him in the first West German city in which he touched down
after his USSR trip. Schroeder was convicted in Stuttgart promptly
after returning to Germany from the USit on his way buck to the US.
Because of his US employment and the fact that Bell paid for his trip,
Schroeder became very apprehensive about any further contact with the
West German service and at the time of the call indicated that he had
nothing to say and wanted no further contact. Other than the cursory
examination of credentials (us reported above), Schroeder made no
attempt to establish the bona fides of the German who made the approach.
We pointed out to Schroeder the unlikely possibility that the approach
might not have been one fide and might, in fact, have been a provo-
cation.

the information or whether he turned it over to trim on his own initiative.
At one point during their relationship, Volgin anked Schroeder to watte
an article on US acoustics work for publication in a Soviet chica
Journal. Schroeder declined.
8. In retrospect Schroeder admitted that he had been quite unive
about his relationship with Volgin and expressed some concern that sel
security hadn't been more active in mlmonishing him against devel p-
ment of relationships with Dov Goverment representatives. His view
of his experiences now completely coincides with ours as a result of

immigrated to the US in April 16 and lived with Schroeder and his
wife until November 1962 when she returned to Siria, apparently because
she was homesick and couldn't mijunt to the new language and life in
the US. Schroeder aaid that his mother-in-law's original exit visu
request was rejected in 1958 by the Bulgarian Government, but after he
and his wife wrote several letters to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry
she was finally granted permission to leave in 1×60.
