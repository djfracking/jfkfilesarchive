1. John Purfey passed the attached to me on Saturday, 9 May.
FYI I would like to comment as follows.
2.
(Item 1) It was Herbert White, not Beske, who re
reported
on the new radical group at Pitzer; source Linda Knolles. We doubt
that we can obtain much more in response to CI/SO questions. We
will try, but with caution, since we are dealing with a young, obvious
liberal female. As for Tom Clark, we think he is back at Cornell.
Our report to you covered all we know to date.
3. (Item 2) R. D. Beske will try and determine what he can
about Dr. and Mrs. Leo Exper at UCLA. If everything appears favorable
and we can clear we may contact. However, they are unknown to us.
Aak CI/90 what they can tell us about them. It will help.

Where did Purfey get

5.
These people unknown to us. who are
their names? What does he know about
to do about them?
(Item 7) As I have reported, I will not personally contact
John Cole. The FBI regards him as unsuitable to help them and,
based upon their assessment, I will not serve any requirements on
him. (Sorry my memo on this had an incomplete sentence.)
6. (Item 8) Anmser is "no".
7.
(Item 9) I have contacted Reid and reported.
8. (Item 10) Joseph Charles' PHS sent in 14 May.
9. (Item 11) I have told Purfey that Hugh McDonald is an
opinionated, egotistical ass who refuses to provide any data to support
his statements, thereby making it impossible to assess the information
he supplies.
10. (Item 12) Beake says the chance of Baum providing anything
is questionable.

11. (Item 13; I have finally figured out Purfey's West Pointer.
During one of our initial conversations I facetiously remarked, in
response to types he was looking for, that what he wanted was a red,
white and blue Negro, a graduate of East Point, who is now in the
export-import business dealing with Africa.
12. (Item 14) I told Purfey on Saturday that the local os
people are and have been in contact with the LAPD and the Sheriff's
Office on militant matters; that the OS people are known as Agency;
that 00 is reporting whatever they learn and for us to involve our-
selves would be confusing and duplicative. If Purfey wants to know
what OS is getting, tell him to contact Ralph True in Headquarters/OS.
Purfey might want to consider having his requirements levied on OS.
13. (Item 15) Beske reports nothing new, and not likely to be
anything soon on the Connover-Clarke affair. Connover has changed
jobs and is too busy to do much.
14. (Item 16)
Beske reports Gonzales may have something on V.B.
but he doubts it. He will check.
15. (Item 17) I told Furfey that I do not want to get in-
volved in any activity that would put us in the position of being
accused of investigating militants. We are on thin ice as it is.
Therefore, Devanon will not be asked to follow up on "Compton"
contacts and we will depend on OS polica contacts.

Cover Potential of
World Associates, Inc.
10 September 1969
DCS Case 53199
1. On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAPO, met with Hugh C. McDonald,' President
of World Associates Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives,
Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation
among law enforcement agencies. He has cooperated with the Agency fully in
the past. He is a cleared source of LAPO/DCS.
2. Since his retirement McDonald has started World Associates Inc., a
company with two divisions, the Security Division and the Aircraft Division.
3. The Security Division provides, as its primary service, a bank
security system, designed to provide banking institutions with a means to
control and curtail losses from fraud and robbery.
4. The Aircraft Division was set up because of the exclusive contract
World Associates has with the Hughes Tool Company (Hughes Aircraft) for the
sale of helicopters to law enforcement agencies, to operate a helicopter pilot
training school for municipal and other law enforcement agencies and to handle
the installation of helicopter patrol systems. This contract applies to all
countries except the US. McDonald said he expects to sell the Hughes Model
300 helicopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been
sold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines. He will have to open up
offices in order to demonstrate, sell and arrange for servicing of the
helicopters. A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative would
be needed at a beginning cost of about $18,000 per year. McDonald said he
would have a good, plausible reason for setting up such an office in Hong Kong,
not only to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but also
to use as a base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expects to
57
start exploring the foreign police potential for helicopters in the near
future, beginning with a trip to South America.
5. The possibility of using foreign offices to promote the activities of
the Security Division of the company also exists.
6. Currently, McDonald is in Hawaii and is exploring the possibility of
setting up a police intelligence school in Hawaii to train police officers
from Asian countries.
7. Attached are copies of data pertaining to prospectus, products,
services, etc.
8. In the event Cover Division has any interest in this matter, Chief,
LAFO, will be glad to discuss it further at Headquarters during week of
5-11 October 1969.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
AL6.88
SUBJECT: Meeting with Mr. Hugh C. McDonald, President of
World Associates Inc.
A/S
A149859
1. In response to a request from Air. Killgore, on the staff of
Senator Barry Goldwater (K., Ariz.). I met with Mr. Hugh C. McDonald
at the Madison Hotel this afternoon, McDonald explained that he is in
the banking and security business, having previously worked in the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. He also said he had a contractual
relationship with the Agency some years ago and served as chief of
security for Senator Goldwater during his campaign for the presidency
in 1963.
;
1
2. Mr. McDonald talked this morning with Senator Coldwater
about his interest in meeting with someone from the Agency to discuss.
a report which he has prepared on the subject of highly sensitive Soviet
bacteriological warfare activities on the island of Vozrozhdeniya in the
Aral Sea. McDonald said he originally became aware of the existence
of the secret Soviet activity in this locality while in Europe on a business
trip. He decided to follow it up and was referred from one contact to
another until he was virtually at the Russian border and decided he had
investigated the matter as far as he felt he could without the possibility
of personal risk. McDonald pointed out that the information in his report
was obtained from sources who spoke freely to him without any remunera -
tion whatsoever. He added that he understood from some of his sources
that they had been in touch with the Agency or with U.S. intelligence
reprosentatives and had become reluctant to deal further with these
representatives because they were not treated properly by them and
the sources feared the Agency had been penetrated by Soviet agents.

7. The report has been forwarded to Dr. Karl Weber, of OSI,
for review. A check with the Domestic Contact Service Asclosed that
McDonald had been a contact of the California Field Office and, although
considored by DCS to be somewhat of a phony and a nuisance, his
clearances were verified by them. McDonald does not appear to me
to be a crackpot although I have not read his report. He gave no indication
at this meeting of making a "pitch." He appeared concerned about the
Information he has uncovered and seems to want to do what is right under
the circumstances. Mr. Killgore, in Senator Goldwater's office, has
asked that we give him a followup report on our contact with McDonald.

3. The reasons for McDonald's contact with us are threefold,
3. After preparing the 65-page report (a copy of which
he gave me) he became concerned that publication of this
document might not be in the national interest. He is anxious
for our advice on this.
b. He is interested in knowing whether the information
is reasonably accurate. He quite naturally does not want to
publish a story that contains errors.
c. He is interested in knowing whether the Agency wants
to delve further into this matter.
4. With regard to the possible publication of the report, McDonald
said he planned to talk in very general terms this afternoon with repre-
sentatives of Time/Life. He will make no commitments to them and
will treat his meeting as strictly exploratory. It is McDonald's opinion
that the story would appeal to publishers and would bring approximately
$200,000 to $300,000.
5. Mr. McDonald claims he has no real interest in pursuing this
subject further unless the Agency feels there is real merit in it. He
caid his cources are "wide open" and he is confident that further informa-
tion could be developed although he has no direct contact with them as
Individuals and would probably have to go through the same laborious
process of contacting one person through another as he did before.
6. McDonald plane to leave Washington tomorrow, but said he
could stay in town through Friday if this was necessary. He said he
came here for the express purpose of discussing this report with us.
He said he did not consider Senator Goldwater a personal friend, but
indicated he had traveled thousands of miles with the Senator during
Mis presidential campaign and although he argued with him on many
subjects had a very high regard for him. It was agreed that I would
get the report in the hands of the appropriate Agency people as soon as
possible and attempt to give him a preliminary reaction some time
tomorrow.

Subject: World Associates, Inc. (Hugh McDonald)
1. McDonald asked me to meet with him on 24 Mar 70. I did. He
started the conversation by stating, "We are getting bigger all the
time and are on the way of becoming the largest, private intelligence
organization in the world. And we are picking up intelligence that
I want to pass to someone, anyone in government. I feel you should
get it."
2. At this point I commented that I appreciated his feeling but
wondered if he could provide some basis for information passed to us
that would permit some evaluation, such as type of person who provided
him the information, when, where and his evaluation of his source.
McDonald "blew his cool". He said if he did so, we would figure out
who his source was and contact the source directly and push the source
around to get what we wanted. I told McDonald we did not push people
around; that I had personally heard the Director comment years ago
that he would not permit any pressure on anyone, anytime, anywhere.
McDonald replied, "Then he has changed. I know that people have been
pushed around by CIA". I asked who, when and where, He replied it
happened after WWII in "1947, 48 or 50 in connection with the Katya
Massacre investigation". I told him that to the best of my knowledge
ve had nothing to do with the Katya inquiries; that it was a Congressional
Commission that looked into the matter..
3. I asked McDonald if he felt he could not trust us then why
bother to pass along information to us. He said that he wants the
government to have the information that he feels is important; that
he trusts me to pass it along; that he keeps a record of what he passes
us in the event it is ever said he had information and failed to
pass it along.
to
4. McDonald then proceeded to tell me that "new, short, fat missiles"
have been shipped into Cuba; that they are so-called defensive missiles.
but are a type that can take a "multi-head offensive warhead". The
shipment to Cuba from the USSR took place three-four months ago. These
new type missiles can reach targets in the US.
5. Next, McDonald said that there are two sets of people involved
in the current bombings of banks, offices, etc. One is a racial group
made up of black militants and the other a group of white US and Canadian
trained "sappers" who aim at disrupting everything. He stated that he

1. Hugh C. McDonald, World Associates, Inc., Santa Monica, a former
Deputy Sheriff of Los Angeles County and now in a private detective-
security business, telephoned me on 17 March 1970. He said he has learned
from "an impeccable source" that, "by August 1970 the USSR will hit China."
Also, that the Soviets have solved the problems they have been having with
their MIRY system.
2. McDonald refused to provide any information concerning the
qualifications of his source to provide reliable data. In fact, he became
a bit vexed when the matter was brought up.

3. I regard McDonald as a prima donna, an opportunist and one
inclined to exaggerate. However, I pass the above along for the record.

has a list of large companies to be targeted in this area (probably
the All Points Bulletin I received 10 days ago which listed four
companies).
6. Again, McDonald said he would not reveal his sources or any-
thing about them that would enable us to identify them.
7. McDonald went on to say, "We are spending a lot of money on
lot of campuses to obtain intelligence." When asked for some details
he backed off and said they were just starting and had to be careful.

8. A little later on he spoke of talking to a 20 year old senior
who had been in his office and the attitude expressed by this student.
about young people and the establishment (this could be one of his
impeccable sources of information).
9.
McDonald then said his organization had gathered together some
very interesting statistics on student protests." He said there are
25 million college students; one-quarter of these are freshmen who de
not involve themselves; one-half of the 25 million are sophomores
and juniors. These are the real source of trouble. The seniors are
concerned about graduation and a job and inclined to forget protests
and lean towards the establishment as of now. However, as time passes.
and students are promoted by the time they will become students they
will remember being part of a protest, their pictures being on file
and will feel they will never get a job and will, therefore, become
part of the permanent anti-establishment group. (These "statistics"
were not supported by any written reports or other data.)
10. During the conversation McDonald said that, "Mixon personally
sent 20 Washington people out to me to consult with us on a program."
Further remarks revealed that the Washington, DC police department was
contacted by one of McDonald's people in an attempt to sell a helicopter-
police patrol training program.
11. Obviously, MaDonald is overly impressed with himself; is prona
to a high degree of exaggeration and truth-stretching; is not inclined
to cooperate fully and one should be careful not to be taken in by him.

DCS Case 53199
1. On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAFO, met with Hugh C. McDonald, President
of World Associates Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives,
Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation
among law enforcement agencies. He has cooperated with the Agency fully in
the past. He is a cleared source of LAFO/DCS.
2. Since his retirement McDonald has started World Associates Inc., a
company with two divisions, the Security Division and the Aircraft Division.
3. The Security Division provides, as its primary service, a bank
security systes, designed to provide banking institutions with a means to
control and curtail losses from fraud and robbery.
4. The Aircraft Division was set up because of the exclusive contract
World Associates has with the Hughes Tool Company (Hughes Aircraft) for the
sale of helicopters to law enforcement agencies, to operate a helicopter pilot
training school for municipal and other law enforcement agencies and to handle
the installation of helicopter patrol systems. This contract applica to all
countries except the US. McDonald said he expects to sell the Hughes Model
300 helicopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been
cold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines. No will have to open up
offices in order to demonstrate, call and arrange for servicing of the
helicopters. A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative: would ·
be needed at a beginning cost of about $19,000 per year. McDonald said he
would have a good, plausible reason for setting up such an office in Hong Kong,
not only to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but also
to use as a base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expects to
start exploring the foreign police potential for holicopters in the near
future, beginning with a trip to South America.
5. The possibility of using foreign offices to promote the activities of
the Security Division of the company also exists.
6. Currently, McDonald is in Havali and is exploring the possibility of
setting up a police intelligence school in Hawaii to train police officers
from Asian countries.
7. Attached are copies of data pertaining to prospectus, products,
services, etc.
8. In the event Cover Division has any interest in this matter, Chief,
LAFO, will be glad to discuss it further at Headquarters during week of
5-11.October 1969.

30 April 1969
DCS Case 52872
Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hugh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source,
informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with
his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington
himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose
of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has
not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not
plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting
bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries.
He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries.
Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries.
His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign
police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security
system to banking institutions.
2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are
firmed up.
3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9
May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident
System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some
specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise
it would be a waste of time.
It was
4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69.
decided that since ORD (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald
previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice
Ident System directly with McDonald.
5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick: TEREN
that DCS/LAFO Would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.
