Answer item 27 only if the deceased died before this year.
27. Did you or any child for whom you are filing earn more than $1,200 last year? .
Yes
No
If "Yes," give the name of each such person, show his total earnings, and list the months of last year in which the person
did not earn $100 a month in employment and did not render substantial services in self-employment. If any such person
was self-employed, show the number of hours he devoted to self-employment opposite each month listed-if none, show
"None." (Do not list any month before the month the deceased died.)

MONTHS
An annual report of earnings must be filed with the Social Security Administration within 3 months and 15 days after
the end of any year in which you, while under age 72 at least one full month of that year, or any child for whom you are
filing, earned more than $1,200. Also, your benefit is not payable for any month you do not have in your care a child of
the deceased entitled to a child's benefit unless you are receiving benefits because you are a widow age 62 or over.
FAILURE TO REPORT THESE EVENTS MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ADDITIONAL
MONTHLY BENEFITS.
28. Do you agree to file the annual report of earnings when required?.
29. Do you agree to notify the Social Security Administration promptly if you do not have an en-
titled bad of the deceased in your care?

A widow's entitlement to benefits ends with the month before the month in which: (a) she remarries, with certain excep-
tions (however, all marriages must be reported); or (b) she is under age 62 and no child of the deceased is entitled to
child's insurance benefits.
A child's entitlement to benefits ends with the month before the month in which the child: (a) attains age 18 (unless the
child has a physical or mental impairment which began before age 18, is expected to be long-lasting, and prevents any sub-
stantial gainful activity); (b) dies; (c) marries, with certain exceptions where the child is disabled (however, all marriages
must be reported); or (d) is legally adopted (unless the adoption is by the child's stepparent, grandparent, aunt, or uncle
after the death of the parent on whose record the child's claim is based).
If the child is age 18 or over and is receiving benefits as a disabled child, his entitlement to benefits also ends with the
second month after the month in which his disability ceases.
30. Do you agree to notify the Social Security Administration promptly if any of these events occur
and to return promptly any check for benefits received by you if you or any of the children are
not entitled to it?

We have withheld only the records of wage and self-employment income
maintained under the direction of 42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2). This record is
created on the basis of tax return information received from the Internal
Revenue Service. Under 26 U.S.C. 6103, this information is given to the
Social Security Administration for the administration of the Social
Security Act and redisclosure is prohibited. You may request this
information directly from the Internal Revenue Service.
I understand that the Dallas Region has already sent you the local
folder on Lee Harvey Oswald. We are also checking with the National
Archives to determine if it may have further social security records
on Lee Harvey Oswald or Marina Oswald. To date, we have found no
records under the aliases you provided. We will contact you if further
documents are located.

Our newspaper has reported the re-marriage of the wage earner's
widow. Since the language barrier is still a problem with her
it is possible she will overlook making a proper report.
Reportedly the marriage took place on Tuesday June 1, 1965.

FOURTH ENDORSEMENT on Pfc OSWALD's ltr of 17 Aug 1959
From:
To:
Subj:
Senior Member, 3d Marine Aircraft Wing Hardship or
Dependency Discharge Board
Commanding General, 3d marine Aircraft Wing
Discharge by reason of dependency; request for case of
Private First Class Lee H. OSWALD 1653230/6741 USMC
1. Guided by the provisions of reference (a) and in compli-
ance with Third Endorsement hereto, the Hardship or Dependency
Discharge Board met at 1530, 27 August 1959 to consider the
case of Private First Class Lee H. OSWALD 1653230/6741 US.C.
The Marine had submitted an official request for a dependency
discharge in accordance with reference (a). The following
members were present:
Lieutenant Colonel Bolish J. KOZAK 07108 USMC (MWHG-3)
Major George E. MC CLANE 016430/7335 USMC (MAG-36)
ajor Eugene T. CARD 035129/7304 USMC (WHG-3)
2. Upon examination of the basic request, supporting encl-
osures and Service record, Private First Class Lee H. OSWALD
was interviewed by the Board. The following facts were
then considered:
a. Private First Class Lee H. OSWALD, not married, on
his initial three (3) year enlistment in the Marine Corps
is obligated to serve on active duty until 7 December 1959.
b. The Marine submitted his request for a dependency
discharge in order that he may provide physical and
financial assistance to his invalid mother residing in
Fort Worth, Texas.
C. The home situation of Private First Class OSWALD nas
been aggravated subsequent to his enlistment date through
incapacitation of his mother as a result of an industrial
accident. The mother is no longer gainfully employed due
to her physical condition and has no source of income. The
presence of her son, Private First Class OSWALD, is required
for physical and financial assistance.
d.
One son, married and residing in Fort Worth is
unable to provide either financial or physical assistance
to the Marines mother due to his marital responsibilities
and the inability of the two families to maintain a common
Horse
Another son, married, with the U. S. Air Force on
active duty in Japan, cannot furnish financial support.
