ALSO SAID THAT IF BKHERALD IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING POSADA'S SERVICE
CONTACT SHOULD BE INITIATED THROUGH HIM (DIEGUEZ) AND NOT DIRECTLY TO
POSADA FOR SECURITY REASONS''. HOWEVER, IF NECESSARY POSADA CAN
TRAVEL TO THE US.
5. DIEGUEZ WAS TOLD THAT HIS REQUEST IN BEHALF OF POSADA WOULD
BE FORWARDED THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS AND THAT WE COULD NOT

WIFE HAVE ENTERED THE U.S. WITHIN THE PERIOD WHEN THEIR ALIEN
RE-ENTRY PERMITS WERE VALID, AND IF THEY DESIRE TO RETAIN THEIR STATUS
AS PERMANENT-RESIDENT ALIENS (PRA), THEY MUST MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR
RETURNING RESIDENT VISAS WITH THE CARACAS CONSULATE. THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT THE VISAS WILL BE ISSUED, SINCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO
QUOTA NUMBER INVOLVED, THE PROCESSING IS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER
IMMIGRANT VISA, WITH THE CONSULAR OFFICER HAVING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO
MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY APPLY SOLELY FOR A
TOURIST VISA IN THEIR VENEZUELAN PASSPORT, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR PRA
STATUS, SINCE APPLYING FOR A TOURIST VISA IS PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE
OF 8888 BORE ABANDONMENT OF PRA STATUS. IF THEY OBTAIN RETURNING

EVALUATION
7. WKSCARLET-3 -- WKSCARLET-3 is being met on a weekly basis
in a safehouse. While his access remains unchanged, his reporting
has dropped off during this reporting period due mostly to the
fact that his energies are being directed against guerrillas and
since the capture of Gabriel Puertas and Carlos Betancourt, the
WKSCARLETs have had little success in this field. WKSCARLET-3's
division is currently working against Gordo Mansania, Solo Suarez,
Tito Herrera, and Elias Eljury. During the period he produced no
disseminations, however, information reported by him was used for
one field comment.

3. From a negative point of view, WKNUGGET coverage of the
home phone of WKSCARLET-3 was useful in that it did not reveal
any indications that he was involved in narcotics trafficking.
Since he also successfully passed his SGSWIRL, and satisfied
the Station in a debriefing that he was not trafficking in
narcotics, the WKNUGGET coverage of WKSCARLET-3 was discontinued.

time, Subject stated that a friend, IDEN J. asked him if he wished
to participate in the smuggling of cocaine out of Peru. Subject
☐ advised that he declined the offer. As previously noted. SGSHIRL
results supported Subject's contentions that his involvement with

IRD# 72501
BACKGROUND:
Subject of this report is a KMSTONE born citizen of IDEN B who
has permanent resident alien status in WODUAL. Subject was granted
a renewed OA on 17 July 1972 and he was last SGSWIRLed on 3 November
1971 with favorable results. Subject estimated that he has been
SGSWIRLed approximately ten times by BKHERALD and two or three additional
times by the MODUAL Army.
PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE:
On 8 May 1973, in IDEN C, Subject was again SGSWIRLed at the
request of his Case Officer, Gabriel J. LABRENZ. The session was
conducted in order to determine if Subject has ever been involved in
the illegal drug traffic as alleged by a LNAGON source and also
whether Subject knows anyone involved in the illegal drug business.
Subject has a good command of the English language and the entire
session was conducted in English. All of the test questions were
coordinated with LABRENZ in advance and he remained in an adjoining
room within hearing range. This examiner was introduced to Subject
as Bill JOHNSON from WODUAL.
RESULTS:
No indications of deception.
SGSWIRL results supported Subject in his contentions as follows:
1. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has not
used drugs for non-medicinal reasons.
2. that, excluding IDEN D, he is not acquainted with anyone who
he knows is involved in the illegal drug traffic.
DETAILS for those he "suspects.")

14. As Headquarters is already aware, WKSCARLET-3 passed
his SGSWIRL with flying colors on 8 May. Based on the SGSWIRL
and his earlier debriefing concerning his alleged involvement
in narcotics, it seems that WKSCARLET-3 was only guilty of
having the wrong kind of friends. LRAGON Caracas was advised
on 15 May regarding our conclusions based upon the debriefing
and SESWIRL of WKSCARLET-3. LNAGON Caracas agreed with our
conclusions and now regards the case as being closed. WKSCARLET-3
agreed, and we so advised LNAGON, that WKSCARLET-3 would help
out with narcotics leads he might come across. We told LNASON
that such assistance would only be on an ad hoc basis subject
to our other priorities as well as WKSCARLET-3's security.

3. that, excluding what he told us (See DETAILS), he has never
received money or been involved in the sale, purchase, or
smuggling of drugs.
4. that, excluding what he told us (See CETAILS), he has never
been asked to participate in the illegal drug traffic.
DETAILS:
During the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that he personally
has sшked marijuana on three or four occasions and he has sniffed
cocaine on approximately five occasions in the past ten years. Sub-
ject asserted that on each occasion, he was attending social gatherings
with KYSTONE friends and he felt socially compelled to indulge in
order to please the other participants. He estimated that he knows
approximately thirty-five people who use cocaine or marijuana. Subject
asserted that his last use of cocaine was last month when he visited
WODUAL. SGSWIRL supported Subject's claim that his personal use of
drugs has not been more extensive.
During the pre-test discussion, Subject asserted that he was not
acquainted with anyone who he knew for certain was involved in drug
trafficking. Subject did list the following IDEYS when asked if he
knew anyone who he "suspected" was involved in trafficking drugs:
IDENS D, E, F, G, H and I. Subject asserted that his suspicions
were based on rumor and these people have never talked to him about
illegal drugs. After recording reactions to the test question, "Are
you concealing the identity of anyone who you know is involved in the
sale or smuggling of drugs?" (Ans. No), Subject acknowledged that his
concern for the question was due to the fact that he more than merely
"suspected" IDEN D was involved and he was "90% certain."
During the pre-test discussion, Subject stated that in 1954 or
1955, while in KMSTONE, he and a friend sold a non-dangerous drug to
a buyer who believed it to be cocaine. Subject asserted that he made
$25.00 from this transaction. Also, while in KYSTONE at the same

MOST MILITARY OFFICERS DO NOT DOUBT THAT BRIBES WERE INVOLVED, AND
POSSIBLY TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN AS YET ANNOUNCED, FEW THINK
THAT THE GOVERNING SOCIAL CHRISTIAN (COPEI) PARTY IS IMPLICATED
BECAUSE IT OPPOSED THE PURCHASE OF THE MACHINES. THERE IS
EXTENSIVE MILITARY COMPLAINING ABOUT AND DISCUSSION OF THE
SCANDAL BUT THIS IS CONFINED TO CONVERSATIONS WITH FELLOW
OFFICERS, FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES.
IN GENERAL, THE MILITARY
BELIEVES THE VOTING MACHINE CONTROVERSY IS OUTSIDE ITS PROVINCE
AND CONCERN, AND THERE IS NO INCLINATION TOWARD MILITARY
INTERFERENCE, (FIELD COMMENT: CARACAS EMBASSY TELEGRAM 3155
OF. 12 APRIL GIVES FULL BACKGROUND ON THE VOTING
MACHINE CONTROVERSY. INDEPENDENT SOURCES OF UNDETERMINED RELIABILITY
HAVE REPORTED THAT 60TH COPEI AND THE MAJOR OPPOSITION

HISTORY OF VUTING MACHINE ISSUE RECOUNT ICO
Carsons Radio Continente Network in Spanish 0300 GMT 11 Apr 73 P
[Text] The president of the Supreme Electoral Council, Luis A. Pietri, has denied the
charges made regarding the collection of nommissions on the sale of voting machines.
Just as this station has reported, Piotri has ordered a thorough investigation in order
to establish responsibilities. The announgement was made by Pletri during a press non-
ference held tonight at the headquarters of the Supreme Council. Speaking for himself.
Plotri #aid that he would have filed suit against those implicated in the commissions
deal. He said that he would have started the suit if he had known which persons were
involved in the affair.
The statement made by Antonio Espinoza Prieto regarding a supposed reduction in the
contract for the purchase of the voting machines is completely false, said the comptroller
goneral, Manuel Vicente Ledesma. "The report was published in local newspapers." Accord-
ing to the papers Antonio Espinoza Prieto said that Mr Dixon, former president of the
Automatic Voting Machines (AVN) Compary, had come to Venezuela to negotiate a reduction.
in the price of the contract. [Words indistinct) Prieto said that the reduction was in
the nature of $3,050,000, but the comptroller general of the republic denied the infor-
mation because his office never had any knowledge of Pristo's assertion.
The
The affairs of the collection of commissions on the purchase of voting machines has
turned into a real scandal. It will be recalled that the proposal to purchase the
voting machines in the first place was a sensation. On that occasion the representatives
of the various parties represented in the Supreme Bloctoral Council were divided.
opposition insisted that machines had to be used in the next elections because the
laws specified this. The Social Christian Party [COPKI), the Democratic National
Front (PKD) and an independent party ware opposed to the purchase because it meant
disbursement of millions of bolivares. Subsequently the matter was submitted to a
vote and the opposition parties won.
The oppo-
Contacts were begem with the machine supplier and more disagreements arose.
sition wanted to purchase the machines from AVM, while COPEI and PND wanted to purchase
them from another company. The opposition won again because it was in the majority
and it was decided that AVM would supply the maolines. The U.3. roprosentatives arrived:
the owners, the salesman, and the commission agents of the company. The contract was
drafted and it specified that Venerala hould not pay more than 1 peruent of the total
transaction in commissions. The transaction was for 180 million bolivaros.
At this stage a ghost appeared to pursue the AVM in the United States in the form of
the Election Systoms Company, which sued the AVM, alleging that the AVM negotiated
directly in Venezuela without going through the Elections Systems Company. The latter
demnaunted its commission and last week won the suit. This is how the scandal broke:
The AVM said that it could not pay commissions to the Election Systems Company besause
these commissions had been paid directly to Venezuelan politicians. The AVM defended
itself and its representatives said at the trial what they had to say, which is precise-
ly what Pedro Segnini La Cruz told the papers today. The People's Electoral Movement
[MPB) was accused of having received $40 por machine which, multiplied by 10,000, amounts
to $400,000, or 1.8 million bolivares.

MILITARY COURT QUESTIONS BLANCO PARTY LEADER
Paris AFP in Spanish 1453 OMT 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
[Excerpts) Montevideo, 11 Apr--Reliable sources today reported that the military court
has asked Blance Party national leader Omar Murdoch for information about a declaration
issued 2 weeks ago in which the Blanco Party strongly criticized President Bordaberry
and the military authorities.
The military court is trying to establish whether the Blanco Party leader committee a
violation of military regulations. It also asked Murdoch whether he concurred with the
terms of the Blanco Party declaration.
It was reported that the alleged violation concerned the military regulation which
prevents retired officers from participating in or formulating political declarations
during the 4 years following their retirement.
According to reliable sources, Murdoch--a retired navy captain--will be brought before
the military tribunal if the violation is confirmed.
The military court's action agitated the political atmosphere and the Blanco Party
leaders will meet this evening to discuss the situation. A Blanco Party member expressed
the opinion that instead of looking into the political attitudes of retired officers, the
military court should try those military men on active duty who have in effect formed a
political party.
It was revealed in parliamentary circles that opposition legislators will demand in
parliament that the defense minister explain the true motives which led to the
proceedings initiated by the military court.
ARGENTINE AUTHOR RELEASED PROM URUGUAYAN PRISON
Paris APP in Spanish 1445 GMT 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
[Text] Montevideo, 11 Apr--Argentine writer and journalist Eduardo Galeano was released
yesterday by a military court after a 1-week detention. Galeano himself confirmed his
release today and said that he was in perfect health and that he had been well-treated
during his detention.
He was arrested at Carrasco Airport on his return from a visit to several Latin American
countries. Galeano, who has been living in Uruguay for a long time, is a journalist
of the leftist weekly MARCHA and was recently appointed director of the Argentine
review CRISIS.
The reason for his arrest is unknown.
Several circles not only in Uruguay and Argentina
but also in several Latin American countries protested the arrest of the author of the
ook "The Opened Veins of Latin America.

In addition, the representative of the MSP, Antonio Espinoza Picto, receive1-450,000
bolivares. The same arrangement was made for the Democratic Republican Union [URD]
and Omar Rambos, another one of the representatives of the opposition on the Supreme
Electoral Council. Rambes and his party received similar amourts to those received by
the MFS and Espinoza Priete. Democratic Action [AD], which was also accused, was sup-
posed to reveive more than the others, that is, 2,115,000 bolivares. The distribution
also included several lawyers, one : (Hans), and others rama Eduardo Blanco and Leoni.
According to the same document released by Segnini La Crus today, the AVM representative
said that he unknowingly signed a ecemission invoice for $305 per mahine. This means
there is a $2 commission per mashine, the recipient of which the AVM representative
said he did not know. As spokesmen for public opinion, we are obliged to inform the
Venezuelan people about the content of Segnini La Crug' document. In the meantime, it
is up to those involved to explain the scandal of the collection of commissions for
the purchase of the voting machines.
L
The comptroller's office has never had any information to the effect that the formar
president of the AVM came to Venezuela to negotiate a reduction in price. Manuel
Vicente Ledesma made the explanation in connection with a report published in the local
newspapers and attributed to Antonio Espinoza Prieto. Prieto said that Mr. Dixon had
come to Venezuela to reduce the selling price of the voting mashines by $3,050,000.
Prox another quarter, Ledesma said that the tools and supplies which will be used to
manufacture the machines will remain in Venezuela. In addition, the country will take
possession of the voting machines in a domestic port and not abroad.

GUERRILLA LEADER CABANAS CLAINS KIDNAPING ROLE
Paris AFP in Spanish 0443 of 11 Apr 73 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
LI
[Text] Acapulco, 10 Apr--Lucio Cabanas, top guerrilla leader of the country, appears
as signatory of a press communique in which he claims responsibility for kidnaping
a rich cattle breeder, Franciso Sanchez Lopez, on 7 March in Texpan, Guerrero State.
The document was published today, Tuesday, by the newspapers LA VERDAD and EL GRAFICO
issued in Acapulco with a picture of five masked men in uniforms and with Mexican
Army guns surrounding someone who seems to be Sanchez Lopez.
Lucio Cabanas added to his alleged signature the title of head of the executing
peasant brigade of the Poor People's Party. in the name of which he accused
Mexican society of being capitalist and of exploiting the people and said, that
for this reason, this society must be eliminated.
He added that the kidnaped cattle breeder, of whom nobody has heard since his
disappearance, is a bourgois who exploits the people whose land he has seized by
means of usury and unlawful maneuvers.
He called the government a bloody murderer of peasants and stated that, for this reason,
the executing brigade applies the law of retaliation in kind and justly retaliates
by means of executions and kidnapings as well as bank and company holdups. After
urging peasants and students to join the movement, Lucio Cabanas said, in conclusion:
Our basic method is that of arms.

SUBJECT
MICROFILM
PLMIABYSS/Forwarding of BNDD Document's Regarding Luis POSADA
ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES
Reference: CARACAS-21539
1.
Forwarded herewith are two BNDD ROIS and one telegram
regarding Luis POSADA. The first ROI prepared by S/A Jose Marin
and dated 6 February 1973 is based on a debriefing of a BNDD
source who identifies POSADA aka "Bambi" as being a source of
supply for narcotics in Venezuela. The C also claims that
POSADA, along with Jose Gomez and Humberto TRUEVA, have been
involved in other illegal activity such as dealing in stolen mer-
chandise, counterfeit money, and contraband.
2. The other ROI, prepared by S/A Charles R. Schaming and
dated 13 March 1973, concerns a debriefing of a source who does
not believe that POSADA is involved in narcotics.
3. The third document is BNDD Headquarters telegram 1846
of 23 March 1973 (repeated from Miami BNDD) concerning the
debriefing of Jose GOMEZ, the BNDD CI who went sour. GOMEZ'
debriefing adds little and in the opinion of the Station and BNDD
Caracas, GOMEZ is either. lying and/or not telling the whole truth.
GOMEZ lists a number of names of persons he claims to have met
while in Caracas which we do not consider worth a follow up
except that of Colonel Freddie BALBOA. BALBOA may possibly be
the unidentified police/security official so frequently seen with
GOMEZ et al.

DIRECTOR 583069
1. Based on a reconciliation of WKSCARLET/3's 1971, 1972, 1973
and 1974 Federal income tax returns, it has been determined that he
has an excessive tolerance (underpayment of tax) in the mount of
$512.00 for 1971, $549.00 for 1972, $769.00 for 1973 and $425.00 for
1974. Attached, under separate cover, is a sealed envelope containing
copies of each reconciliation which have not been classified so that
they may be handcarried to him for review. If security permits, this
unvelopa should be opened only by HKSCARLET/3. The Station is requested
to treat these documents so classified and they should be destroyed or
retained in a sealed envelope by the Station.
WKSCARLET-BL
2. The $1,860.47 due WKSCARLET/3 par Paragraph 2 of Reference C
should have been reduced by $349.25 (per Paragraph 1 of Fafaronce A)
representing underpayment of 1969 and 1970 taxes. Attached is Headquarters
T/A / CC-0140 in the amount of $1,511.22, representing the 1971 tax due
of $512.00, 1972 tax due of $549.00 mul a portion of the 1973 tax dua
of $450.22. The collection of these taxes will liquidate the final
payment due WKSCARLET/3. The balance of tax due must be paid by WKSCARLET/3,
3. Please adviso WKSCARLET/3 to mail his personal check in the amount
of $743.78 to the accommodation address forwarded by Reference D. This
amount represents the remaining portion of the 1973 taxes due of $318.78
that were not liquidated by his final payment and the 1974 taxes due of
$425.00. The check should be made payable to himself without endorsement
on the reverse. Also, please advise WKSCARLET/3 that the cashier's check
for $147.00 and his original 1971 through 1974 tax returns were mailed to
the IRS Philadelphia Office on 30 June 1975.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Alien Affairs Officer,
SUBJECT
OPS/LSN
: Luis Clemente POSADA Carriles
30 January 1975
1. On 30 June 1974 Luis Clemente POSADA's employment
with the Agency was terminated by mutual consent. At that
time he was establishing a private investigative agency from
which he expected to earn his livelihood. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service file on POSADA, therefore, may
now be decontrolled. As of 27 January 1975, POSADA is still
located in Caracas, Venezuela.
2. On 12 June 1974 Caracas Station advised that POSADA
had been informed of and fully understands the effect that
termination of his Agency employment will have upon his
resident alien status and eligibility for U.S. citizenship.
We have not yet received termination records on POSADA,
probably because the Station is still meeting with him
regarding settlement of his outstanding U.S. tax liabilities.

ALSO SAID THAT IF BKHERALD IS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING POSADA'S SERVICES
CONTACT SHOULD BE INITIATED THROUGH HIM (DIEGUEZ) AND NOT DIRECTLY TO
POSADA FOR **SECURITY REASONS''. HOWEVER, IF NECESSARY POSADA CAN
TRAVEL TO THE US.
5. DIEGUEZ WAS TOLD THAT HIS REQUEST IN BEHALF OF POSADA WOULD
BE FORWARDED THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS AND THAT WE COULD NOT

Semi Annual Operations Report
(4) WKSCARLET-3.
SOURCE INFORMATION
EVALUATION
WKSCARLET-3 was granted a POA effective
17 January 1972 and an OA effective 17 July 1972. He was first
brought to the attention of the Station by WH/Miami. It is difficult
to tell from our files exactly when contact was initiated, but as
early as 1965, Subject was being used by EKHERALD. WKSCARLET-3 is
- currently in the process of establishing a private investigative
company in Caracas. From January through March 1974, when the new
government took over and EKSCARLET-3 was asked to leave his job,
he was the Chief of Ou of SECURITY of WKSCARLET, and reported on all
aspects, operations, etc. of that unit. He is now in the process
of being terminated, effective 30 June 1974, by his case officer,
BACHHUBER, due to his lack of access and high profile. WKSCARLET-3
currently receives compensation in the amount of Bs2,000 per month.
Subject was last successfully given an SGSWIRL on 8 May 1973. Since
March 1974, his profile has been relatively high. There have been
two articles in the local press naming him as a BKHERALD agent.
Since those two articles, none have appeared; however, he has several
high powered personal enemies in the current government and could
come under political attack at any time. The Station does not feel
that WKSCARLET-3 presents or will present a security threat. lle
has been well treated during his long relationship with BKHERALD
which he realizes and is thankful for. Meetings to carry out the
termination are being conducted with strict regard for security.
A safehouse used for part of the period (S/H 45) and costing about
$950, was terminated in March 1974. The only special commitment
with WKSCARLET-3 is a termination payment of Bs6,000.
