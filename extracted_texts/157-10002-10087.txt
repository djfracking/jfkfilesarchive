The Chairman. I would like to take this and several
other questions up with the committee, one of which deals
with the question of the August recess And I want to
confer with you on that, too.
How many more questions do you have?
Mr. Schwarz. Instead of asking the other questions I will
ask whether he knows anything about them, and we could bring
him back later if he does.
Do you know anything about the film made in ord

The Chairman. Can we get that done now?

Mr. Schwarz. Such a film was made

Mr. Halpern. I don't know where it was made, sir,
but I know it was made.

Mr. Schwarz. It was made in the U.S.?

Mr. Halpern. As far as I know it was.

a model who looked like Mr. Sukarno purporting to have

my
sexual activity with some female, and that then the film
would be released in Indonesia, and it would be attributed to
the Russians in some fashion?
â€“
Mr. Halpern. No, sir, that was not the plan at all.
Mr. Schwarz.
Mr. Halpern.
What was the plan?
The plan was to have such a film from
which we could make film which we could use in the propaganda
activity against Sukarno in terms of him being close to the
10 Russians, because the woman was supposed to be the Russian
blonde woman that was assigned to Mr. Sukarno as escort
officer when he visited the Soviet Union, and then went back
and stayed with him for some time in Indonesia.

Mr. Schwarz.
In short, it was a fake movie which was

Senator Mondale. How was that film supposed to get to

Mr. Halpern. It wasn't a film. The original plan was
to use clips from it in propaganda leaflets, and pamphlets,
and things like that, just pictures from the film.

Mr. Schwarz. Who authorized that?

Senator Schweiker. I just want to say, Mr.Chairman, that
I would like to compliment the witness for some very clear and
impartial answers, instead of the partial amnesia that we have
run into lately.
And I think your kind of candor is very helpful to us
in this committee to do the job. And I think it was very
refreshing to hear some clear-cut specific recommendations of
what did or did not happen. I just want to thank you.

did that meeting take place?
Mr. Halpern. About the middle of October 1961.
Mr. Schwarz. What instructions were you given by Mr.
Bissell at tht meeting?
Mr. Halpern. Mr. Bissell said he had recently and
he didn't specificy the date or the time he had recently
been chewed out in the Cabinet Room of the White House by
borh the President and the Attorney General for, as he put
it, sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting
rid of Castro and the Castro regime. His orders to both
(Mr. Zogbey and to me were to plan for an operation to
accomplish that end.
Mr. Schwarz. Was any content put into the term
"get rid of", or was that the term that was used, and only
that term?
Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, that was
it. There was no limitation of any kind. Nothing was for-
bidden, and nothing was withheld. And the objective was to

I would like to ask Mr. Schwarz if he would give us a
1
brief synopsis of what we intend to question our witness
about this morning.
Mr. Schwarz. The witness this morning will only be a
single witness. He is Mr. Samuel Halpern.
He was in the
Far East, and I have now found out he was involved in the
Sukarno moving and some alleged killing of an agent in
Tailand, which are collateral matters that we may want to
take up with him at the end.
But he came back here in the fall of 1961 and was in-
structed as assistant to get into the Cuban matter. And
he will testify that he was told that they would proceed
to overthrow the Castro government, and that there were

He will then describe the way in whch they worked

Assistant to Harvey. And Harvey, you will remember, was the
man that was actually in charge of the Cuban position.
The Chairman. When are we going to get Harvey?
Mr. Schwarz.

He is coming next Wednesday morning.
We are going to get some of this same conflict between

remove Castro and his regime.
Mr. Schwarz.
And did you talk about tactics at all
in that meeting, or was it just a general discussion about
getting organized.
Mr. Halpern. Just a general discussion as to what we would
do, how we would proceed, and what we would need. And at
that point I had no idea how many people were left on the staff
in the branch only having been on the job a day or a day and
a half.
Mr. Schwarz. Shorly after that time did you get put in
contact with a general?
Mr. Halpern. Yes, sir. General Lansdale.
Mr. Schwarz. And what was his function when you were
introduced to him?
Mr. Halpern. Both Mr. Zogbey and I were introduced
to him as the new chief of Operations for a government-wide
17
effort to accomplish the removal of Castro and the Castro
18
regime. This effort was to include not only CIA but the

General Lansdale was to be the Chief of Operations for that

he brief you about the operation, or what was the nature of that?
Mr. Halpern. No, we briefed him first in the old
Situation Room, what used to called the Ibell Building, which

the words were, his man on Cuba. This was something

The Chairman. May I ask you to repeat that?
I am sorry, I just didn't catch it.
Mr. Halpern. At a meeting sometime in December 1961,
which was the morning staff meeting that the Director held, and
Mr. Zogbey was present
Mr. Schwarz. But you were not?

for the Deputy Director of Plans, and Mr. Bissell was in the
room as the DDP.
Mr. Helms had no inkling of this before the meeting,
and so stated to Mr. Zogbey, and even asked Mr. Zogby if he had
had any inkling before the meeting.
MrZogbey told me that he had none whatsoever.
Mr. Schwarz. Did Mr. Helms then come and visit your
new organization and tell you to make some changes?
Mr. Halpern. Yes. He came to
Zogbey's office and looked
at the list of officers, male and female, who were still
working in the branch. Most of them were the remnants of the
people from the old Bay of Pigs operation who had not yet been
reassigned.

Mr. Halpern. It wasn't a matter of General Lansdale's
being in charge, or the Attorney General being in charge,
nobody objected to General Lansdale reporting to the Attorney
General.
I
It was a matter of whether this would be done through
the normal chain of command, or whether we would actually be
under the General's direct command.
Mr. Schwarz. But it still is a chracterization, you
were dealing with organization and bureaucracy?
Mr. Halpern. That is right. And drafting papers.
Mr. Schwarz. Drafting papers to do what?
Mr. Halpern. To try to get organized in terms of how
we would accomplish the objective.
Mr. Schwarz.Did any of those papers that you drafted
in those early stages include any reference to assassination
as a device to accomplish the objective?
Mr. Halpern. No, sir.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, did Mr. Helms enter the picture in
the latter part of December 1961?

Mr. Schwarz. There was no such previous evidence.

still do, in our branches. And there were some in the Cuban

cers whose objective would be to plan for the overthrow of

Mr. Smothers. Was it your understanding that these
plans were to extend to assassination?
Mr. Halpern.
That word was not used, sir. But no
holds were barred, and we had no limitation.
Mr. Smothers. Let me ask you it another way. What was
your understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do
by the President and the Attorney General?
Mr. Halpern. To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime
on the Island of Cuba.
Mr. Smothers. Did Mr. Bissell convey to you the idea
that that included killing Castro?
Mr. Halpern. The subject never came up per se.

to come up with a plan of some kind designed to overthrow,
