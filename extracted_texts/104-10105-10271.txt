exposed. His assignment in Paris under student cover is
similarly classified. The description of this activity just
a couple of pages before the author gratuitously mentions the
lack of an agreement between the Agency and the French barring
unilateral operations in France] (Item 4 below) is potentially
an additionally damaging blow to liaison relationships.

1. Attached is an ad- ..
vanced informal copy of our
proposed security deletions
and revisions of the Hunt
galley proof. Please note
that this list has not yet
been reviewed by Mr. Blee
and is, therefore, still
subject to change.
2. The DDO panel that
reviewed the Hunt manuscript
has designated items, numbered
12, 14, 19, 21, 24 and 25, as
"hard core," by which we mean
that the Agency should insist
on their deletion or revision
and be prepared to obtain an
injunction and engage in
litigation should Hunt refuse
to cooperate.

3. Page 63, line 21; the name "Frank Holcomb'
Mr. Holcomb retired under cover and his past relationship
with the CIA should not be exposed. It is additionally
recommended that the entire paragraph wherein Mr. Holcomb's
name appears (lines 21-24) should be deleted because it ac-
knowledges CIA operations in support of anti-communist political
operations in Italy. (page 105, lines 18-21.)

(page 106, lines 4-7.)
5. Page 66 beginning with "Finis" on line 24 and ending
with "world" on line 27. This passage describes a specific CIA

an animated cartoon based on George Orwell's Animal Farm.
(Page 111, lines 6-9.)
6. Page 68, the pseudonym "John F. Rittenhouse" on line 34.
The author's original CIA pseudonym was classified, and even
though compromised, never appeared in the press and still exists
on various currently classified documents. (page 114, line 23.)
7. Page 71, beginning with "Spanish" on line 28 and ending
with "America" on line 20, page 72, and including the footnotes

tributing) "El Campesino's" book, Life and Death in the USSR.

8. Page 72 beginning with "Eudocia" on line 21 and ending

it describes the Agency's role in the translation, publishing
and distribution of Eudocio Ravines' book, The Yenan Way. It
also describes William Buckley's role in that operation as a
CIA officer. (Page 121, lines 17-23 and page 122, lines 1-6.)
9. Page 73 beginning with "Mexican" on line 5 through
"Rivera" on line 8. This should be deleted because it not only
describes sources and methods but also identifies a specific
CIA operation. (Page 122, lines 19-21 and page 123, line 1.)

32. Page 220, lines 5 through 10. This passage concern-
ing the use of CIA alias documentation by Hunt and others in-
cludes loose language which implies that still another set of
documents was prepared by the CIA for Hunt's use
- i.e., a
set of documents which was not mentioned during the recent
Congressional "Watergate hearings". As such this is misleading
and could serve to create additional difficulties for the Agency.
It is recommended that the OGC make an effort to have the author
rewrite this paragraph in order that this potentially damaging
language be removed from his manuscript. (Page 387, lines 4-9.)

damage potential to liaison relationships with the Uruguayan

is now employed by the State Department. (Page 225, lines 10-11.)
It would appear

that this description of the author's contact with Dr. Barney
Malloy of CIA is very unfair to the latter. It implies that
Hunt had a special relationship with Dr. Malloy and an effort
ought to be made by OGC to have the author rewrite this version
in order to reflect Dr. Malloy's true role in this affair.
