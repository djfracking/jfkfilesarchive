Status of Document: Postponed in Part
Number of releases of previously postponed information: 9
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.
Number of Postponements: 5
Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.
Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

Honorable Louis Stokes
Chairman
House Selectcommittee
on Assinations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.
The Plaza Apt.
18th & Parkway
Phila., Pa. 19103
May 25, 1977
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am writing in order to clarify the present
situation regarding the receipt of back pay, which in my case
had accrued from January 1, 1977 until April 11, 1977.
On that date in April, I visited your office
to inform you that my husband had received the Republican
Party endorsement in Philadelphia's race for District Attorney,
and that I would be returning to Philadelphia to join him in
his effort to win that election. However, during that same
conversation, I expressed concerns of the timing of my depart-
ure, for fear that if I left my position as Staff Counsel prior
to the Committee receiving its funding, I might not receive
my back pay.
In response to my concerns, you offered me
your personal "moral commitment" that I could leave and your
full assurance that the 35% which had been deducted from my
salary for more than three months, would definitely be forward-
ed to me upon the Committee receiving its funding from the
house.
It has now come to my attention through
Bob Lehner and Tom Howarth that I will not be receiving more
than $800.00 of those monies owed me.
While I would never consider asking for any-
thing to which I am not entitled, I respectfully submit that
I do deserve to receive that for which I worked during that
3-1/2 month period.
I remain confident that this matter will be
reconciled in accordance with our previous conversation. If
there are any problems in this regard, please do not hesitate
to notify me.
I extend my best wishes and hope that all is
going well with the Committee.

Mrs. Terry W. Lazin
The Plaza Apartments
18th and Parkway
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103
Dear Mrs. Lazin:
I am sorry that there is a misunderstanding relative
to my position on your back salary. I have consistently held that
any employee would receive back salary if such could be worked
out before the employee terminated services with the Committee.
You were paid the maximum salary possible for the eleven days
you worked in April. Unfortunately, your termination date of
April 11th precluded you from receiving the full amount you
would have been entitled to if you had stayed with the Committee
longer.
The Rules of the House prohibit paying salary to anyone not
actually employed by the House. Furthermore, keeping you on the
payroll after your termination while you were actively working in
your husband's political campaign could prove very embarrassing
to the Committee.
You did fine staff work with the Committee and if you
decide to return at some future date we shall be happy to give
you every consideration.
