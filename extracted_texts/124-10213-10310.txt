"DOMEC" is possibly identical with ROBERTO DOMEQ RODRIGUEZ

located at 3491 S. W. 11th Street, Apartment 1. ($) (u)
FERRER stated he observed ATON, DOMEQ and RODDA on
the night the last three bombs were planted. On the following
day, these three were in almost constant contact by phone and
took unusual precautions to prevent their phone conversations
from being overheard. ATON has reportedly told the Miami
Police Department and other law enforcement agencies he has
a cache of explosives, but that it is dynamite. FERRER
believes from what ATON has told him, the cache is actually
C-4 plastic explosive. (5)(u)
FERRER also stated C-4 is for sale in the Miami area
by certain individuals not named in the Second National Front
of the Escambray and others, unnamed, who can get it from
New York and' "Mafia" contacts, at $1.50 per pound, sold only
in 100 pound lots. FERRER also advised a large quantity of
acid-type time pencils from the same sources are available in

RE:
SERGIO FREIJO, aka.
Sergio Freijo y Dedia, Carlos
Salgado-Suarez, DOB 7/21/24, Havana, Cuba,
Social Security #457-70-8161
The following investigation was conducted by
SA JAMES D. HAYES:
On January 25, 1968, MM 724-S, an individual
acquainted with certain phases of both pro and anti-CASTRO
activities in Cuba and the United States, advised SERGIO
FREIJO was in the Miami area while released on bond in
connection with the hijacking of the freighter transport.
He stated FREIJO is an explosives expert and was well known
in Cuba for his terrorist activities. He also advised
FREIJO had been in contact with members of the Cuban Youth of
Ft. Jackson, an anti-CASTRO organization.
(x)(u)
MM 724-S recalled that the Cuban Youth of Fort
Jackson group had seriously considered dividing into small
cellular units in order to undertake positive action
purportedly against communism and FIDEL CASTRO. In this
connection, they planned to use codes, which included the
names of individuals who were actually in Cuba as pseudonyms,
for either an operation or members of a cell. The organization
planned to organize in a secretive active group within the
organization with not more than 4 or 5 men to a cell in this
inter-group.
In order to maintain their anonymity, one cell
would undertake a certain project for a short period of time
and then cell number two would follow for another brief
period of time and thereafter cell number three and number
four, etc. Each time the cell which just completed the
activity would move to the bottom of the list and become
completely inactive in every respect. This is being done.
for a two-fold purpose: (1) to continue secrecy regarding
the objectives, including secrecy among its own members and
even between cells and (2) to prevent the local and/or
Federal authorities from discovering their purpose and
identity.

ERNESTO DE LA FE, described as coordinator of
"Los Accionistas de Cuba" (Actionists of Cuba) reportedly
sent a communication to SERGIO FREIJO, giving FREIJO the
signal to start activity against communism and CASTRO. No
further details were mentioned in this connection. MM 724-S
said ERNESTO DE LA FE is the brother of ROMERO DE LA FE, who
is currently in the Miami area, released on bond from his
arrest in connection with the hijacking of the "freighter
transport." ERNESTO was the Minister of Press and Propaganda
in the BATISTA Government and General Secretary of an anti-
communist organization. He is currently serving a 30 year
sentence in prison in Cuba.
(X (u)
MM 724-S believed SERGIO FREIJO has recently been
in contact with Cuban news reporter BENJAMIN DE LA VEGA, who
may be aware of the reported communication received by
FREIJO from ERNESTO DE LA FE.
(X(21)
The following information was obtained from PCI
JESUS DIEGUEZ on February 23 and 27, 1968, by SA JAMES J.
O'CONNOR:
PCI related that SERGIO FREIJO "is the type to
work with Poder Cubano". About a month ago FREIJO, who is
employed at Aerodex, called PCI and inquired if the latter
knew of a place in which a person could be hidden out. A
few months previously FREIJO inquired if PCI could obtain
explosives. PCI stated he replied in the negative to
inquiries by FREIJO and that he did not ask FREIJO what was
going on.
PCI advised that FREIJO has known him since Cuba.
During the revolutionary activity against President BATISTA,
FREIJO was involved in a plot to kill a communist organizer
named FABIO GRAUBART, and, at that time
at that time, FREIJO was hidden
by a group which included the PCI.
PCI had lived in Chicago prior to the hijacking
of the freighter "Freight Forwarder" at Miami about
September, 1967 by a group of Cubans headed by RAMIRO DE
LA FE.

RE: RAMIRO DE LA FE
aka Captain Anton
The following information was developed on February 8,
1968, by SA WILLIAM P. KELLY from PCI JOHN ALEXANDER O'CONNELL:
On February 8, 1968, PCI had a conversation with
Haitian Consul at Miami, EUGENE MAXIMILIEN.
EUGENE MAXIMILIEN. MAXIMILIEN
claimed that "Captain ANTON, a white male Cuban, 34-36 years,
about 6'1", or somewhat less, heavy build, dark hair, was
recently convicted in Federal Court, Miami, in connection with
the hijacking of a U. S. ship off Miami Beach.
1. S. ship off Miami Beach. MAXIMILIEN stated
"Captain ANTON" was the leader of the hijackers. (This may be
referring to RAMIRO DE LA FE, one of the subjects in Miami
file 45-1127.)
Regarding "Captain ANTON," MAXIMILIEN stated that
this individual is currently locally engaged in "shaking
down' (extorting) money from unidentified Latin American Consuls
in Miami. MAXIMILIEN further stated that he believes "Captain
ANTON" to be the person responsible for recent bombings in the
Miami area, including the bombing of the Mexican Consul's home.
According to MAXIMILIEN, "Captain ANTON" drives a
1961 or 1962 Chevrolet, bearing Florida license 18W2221.
On January 29, 1968, MM [1109-s\furnished the following

report to SA ROBERT G. STRONG :
There have been several exchanges of impressions and
discussions among RAUL GRAMATGES, PEDRO FERREIRO and MARTINIANO
ORTA, motivated by recent events in Cuba and here in Miami.
Because of comments and opinions expressed in anti-CASTRO
revolutionary groups in Miami, it is supposed that the recent
dynamiting attacks are the work of one of these groups:

VIRGILIO (LNU) also informed MM 492-S one night
he received an anonymous call trying to scare him into not
sending packages to Cuba. When he asked the anonymous
caller why he should not send and indicating that he would
continue to do so until he is forced to stop, the caller
hung up. VIRGILIO believed highly significant and possibly
more than mere coincidence the following morning ROLANDO
MERULO and another member of the staff of the newspaper
"El Nacionalista" appeared at the store attempting to sell
an ad for the "El Nacionalista" news paper.
VIRGILIO stated
they took an ad in the paper at that time. He also advised
MIGUEL SAN PEDRO, active leader of the CNM, is a customer
at the Warfield Drugstore. VIRGILIO described the anonymous
caller as a Cuban male who spoke perfect Spanish with Cuban
inflection. He did not know the name of the individual but
indicated the voice seemed very familiar to him and he would
remain alert should he hear this voice again.
(X\u)
On February 5, 1968, MM 492-S furnished SA JAMES D.
HAYES the following report on Cuban Power and bombings in the
Miami area,
along with informant's comments and conclusions:
The newspaper "PATRIA," which is directed by
ARMANDO GARCIA SIFREDO, has always been opposed to
terrorism, possibly because SIFREDO was one of the first
victims of gunmen and terrorism in Miami. First, there was
a bomb which exploded in front of his house some time ago.
Then, he was playing dominoes on the porch of the home of
his friend, VIVANCOS, S. W. 8th Avenue between 3rd and 4th
Streets, and several shots were aimed at him from an auto.
Later, another bomb exploded under his car. On another
occasion, an unknown person hit him with his fists as he
was leaving a restaurant and for a long time he received
telephone calls from anonymous persons who threatened to
kill him because of the partiality shown in his newspaper
"PATRIA" which sometimes defended General BATISTA and his
friends, at other times opposed the Fidelistas, possible
infiltrees, the people who keep coming in, etc.

stated 29 individuals attended this meeting, including owners,
managers or their representatives of various pharmacies in the
Miami area. There was a great difference of opinion among
these individuals concerning the sending of parcels to Cuba;
because of this controversy a committee was formed consisting
of the representatives of the organization of Cuban Pharmacists
in Exile, including ANDRES RODRIGUEZ, owner of Andres Pharmacy,
9th Avenue and West Flagler; CARLOS ACOSTA, Highland Park
Pharmacy, 9th Street and NW 7th Avenue; Santa Clara Pharmacy,
8th Street and S. W. 23rd Avenue; "ANTORITO, representative
of the Hialeah Pharmacy. This committee was instructed to
prepare a manifesto for the press in the next day or so
concerning a policy to be practiced by all members of this
organization of Cuban Exile Pharmacists concerning the sending
of parcels to Cuba.

MM 492-S believed the manifesto will state the
pharmacists will continue to send parcels to Cuba, however,
they will be limited exclusively to sending medicine and
small socks for small children. The socks, which are not
available in Cuba, can help to clothe youngsters but also help
in the packing of the medicines. Further, MM 492-S believes
they will strictly oppose the sending of any radio,
electrical or automotive parts to Cuba . Further, news has
been received from Cuba that FIDEL CASTRO's communist govern-
ment of Cuba has reportedly not permitted any packages to be
delivered to the recipients in Cuba since the bombing of the
Havana Post Office, January 8, 1968. Therefore, it is
believed no parcels will actually be sent to Cuba by the
pharmacists until they have been assured by relatives in Cuba
that packages are being received by these relatives in Cuba
On February 1, 1968, (FNU) CEPERO, co-owner of

By memorandum dated February 13, 1968, CIA,
Miami, furnished the following additional information
regarding JORGE GONZALEZ : (50/4)
>
On February 9 1968 a contact of CIA advised
that he had, a conversation on the evening of February 7,
1968, with JORGE GONZALEZ, military chief of the
Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria
(MIRR). GONZALEZ stated that the activities of the Cuban
Power roup would continue. He said they intended to
"frighten" some members of the news media, such as NORMAN
DIAZ ARTILES and JUAN AMADOR RODRIGUEZ of Radio Station
WMIE, and SERGIO VIDAL CAYRO of Radio Station WFAB ($7.4)
(5)
GONZALEZ stated that they knew they were under
investigation by the FBI. He said the only evidence
against ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA during his trial for extortion
was that the threatening notes had been typed on a type-
writer to which BOSCH had access. For this reason when
Cuban Power had something to write, they rented a type-
writer at the cost of $30.00 for the purpose. GONZALEZ
said that different persons rented typewriters from
different places in order to elude the investigative
efforts of the FBI. (*) (1)
GONZALEZ said that Cuban Power was preparing news
releases which would be sent to the local news media that
night (February 7). According to GONZALEZ, the MIRR and
ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA were preparing "an important work
about Cuba" which would reaffirm the position of the MIRR
so that there would be no connection between the MIRR and
Cuban Power. GONZALEZ said this action would allay the
suspicions of the FBI since it would appear that the MIRR
was
inactive. (*) (u)

bombings which had occurred in Miami. FELIPE RIVERO,
of the CNM, commented regarding the recent bombings in Miami
that the only thing a bombing such as occurred recently in
Miami does is to take the medicine from the elderly and the
children. RIVERO further stated that when he does something
he signs his name to it. JORGE MASCANOSA, representative of

On January 26, 29 and 30, 1968, MM 1264-C was
contacted regarding Cuban Power and the recent bombings in
the Miami area
Informant advised that he heard that a young group
of Cubans in the age category of 18 to 20 years of age have
been actually or personally involved in the local bombings' in
the Miami area. He felt that Cuban Power was using these
young individuals in that they have no fear and they crave
excitement. He further said that he heard that ORLANDO
BOSCH is the leader of the Cuban Power group. He further
stated that he believes it is this same group that is
responsible for the bombing of B25 cargo aircraft at Miami
International Airport on January 20, 1968.
Informant continued by saying that a source for
the Cubans obtaining powder for any homemade bombs could be
through Maule Industries, Miami, which handles explosive
powder and this company hires many Cuban employees.
