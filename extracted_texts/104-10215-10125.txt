"Robert COHEN was sending reports of the group's travels to NBC;
O'Connell said that he planned to write NBC a letter telling them what a poor
choice they had made. O'Connell described Cohen as intelligent but over-
bearing, and probably the most unpopular member of the group. He admitted
that he had been a pimp in San Francisco, and was rather proud of the fact
that in 1939 at the age of 9 he had been stoned while marching in a May
Day parade. Steve Tyler told O'Connell that Cohen had been residing in Paris
and that he known there as a "violent left-winger". O'Connell could not under-
stand the fact that Cohen at some previous time had been in the Army in
security work for the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth." (Foreign Service

2. The Peking CHINA YOUTH NEWS carried in its 5 October 1957,
issue an article by Joanne Grant, giving her impression of her visit to
China. She had the following to say in her article:
"You can see the future through the Chinese people. You can ob-
tain a firm conviction that China will continuously advance forward. As a
western visitor, nothing impressed me more than the great power of this
country. Every person in New China is very modest but has great pride;
they are united, have self-respect, and respect each other. No one can
overlook China's advance; it is to be regretted that many people do not
have the opportunity to observe it personally. I like Shanghai very much,
because from the way Shanghai has changed I can really understand New
China. In the old Shanghai, except for the Chinese, everyone had special
privileges. However, everything has changed greatly. I am of the opinion
that from this, one can see the miracles which have begun in this great
country."

by a doctor that he was paranoic. Once in a meeting of the American group

against the wall. On a second such occasion, he threw a glass cup at
Jake ROSEN, which caused Rosen to have three stitches in his chin and five
in his biceps.. This second incident was hushed up only with difficulty because
the Chinese authorities learned of it when a doctor was called."

Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group. He

i
"Larry MOYER, age 32, was reporting on the trip for United Press.
O'Connell was Moyer's roommate in Moscow, and had learned of many of
Moyer's past experiences before O'Connell had indicated where he stood
politically. Moyer had been a pimp in Hawaii in 1941, working through the
photograph shops where a serviceman could get his picture taken with a hula
girl. He had also been afriend of Ada B. Jackson, whom O'Connell described
as "a well-known pink in New York"; Moyer had known her through American
Labor Party meetings there. O'Connell said that Moyer was crude, but by
no means stupid." (Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong, number 289,

spent the last year or so in London. He has a socialist viewpoint, but is
neither a clear not a fast thinker. O'Connell commented that he sometimes
had too much to drink and may have said some things he otherwise might not
have." (Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong, number 289, 14 October 1957.)

O'Connell said he saw Father Wagner in prison in Shanghai; he did not pro-
vide the Consulate General with more information about Father Wagner than
appeared in the press. He was quite cooperative with the Consulate General
(he turned over his passport) and was most anti-Communist in public and
private statements. He described the greater part of the American group
which attended the October 1 celebrations in Peiping as being politically and
morally corrupt, and stated that only three members of the group, including
himself, made any effort to defend the U.S. against Chinese Communist
critics. The shortness of O'Connell's stay in Hong Kong prevented spending
much time with him, but he stated that he would be happy to answer further
questions after he returns to Chicago. (Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong,

Embassy De-briefing of Shelby Tuckor, American Student Who
Visited Communist China
Mr. Shelby Tucker, an Amorican student at Oxford University,
visited Communist China in company with several other students
at the conclusion of the Hoscow Youth Festival. After his arrival
in Poking he was requested by the Chinoso Communist authorities to
surronder his passport. Mr. Tucker refused to do this and as a
result was deported from China into the Soviet Union. He returned
to London on September 12 and during his discussions with the
Embassy voluntoored to prepare a statement of his impressions of
Communist China based on his notos. This statement is transmitted
as onclosure one.
Shortly after Mr. Tucker arrived in London ho was approached
by Life magazine for his story, which it is understood he sold to
the editors for a sum of $500.00. A copy of this story, which
was written by a Life staff writer based on Mr. Tucker's ronarks
is transmitted as enclosure two. The Embassy understands that
Life magazine is not now plaiming to publish this story.
There is transmitted as enclosure three a copy of Mr. Tucker's
affidavit regarding the use of his passport in Communist China.
This affidavit has already boon transmitted to the Department under
separate cover in connection with Mr. Tucker's passport difficulties
but is included here for the Department's convenience.
It was the impression of the de-briefing officers that Mr.
Tucker was sincere in his desire to furnish information which
might be of use to the United States Government. Unfortunately,
however, Hr. Tucker seems to have vory little background in
Chinese affairs and his observations, both written and oral, appear
to contain little significant political or economic information.

2. Daniel M. O'Connell, a member of the American youth group which

Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group.
He had the following to say about the Tylers:
"Steve and Patty TYLER (ref. Consulate General telegram to Department
560, repeated Moscow 8, Prague 1, of September 27, 1957) have been travel-
ing in Europe for about a year and a half. Steve is 23. Neither are college
graduates. O'Connell felt that Patty was the smarter of the two, but that
both were quite sound in their thinking, and he was convinced of their anti-
Communist sentiments. O'Connell said that both of Steve's parents had
been in some sort of trouble for leftist or Communist activity in the U.S.,
and that Steve feared that this would unwarrantably be held against him in
spite of his violent reaction against his upbringing. O'Connell said that
he had never known a case where the views of father and son were father
apart." (Foreign Service Dispatch Hong Kong, number 289, 14 October 1957.)
