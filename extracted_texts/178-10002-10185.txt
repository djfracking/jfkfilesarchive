after Mr. Martinez' departure from Havana.
6. Mr. Martinez defected in early December 1960. I saw him once
in early 1961 in Miami, Florida where he had taken up residence. I do
not know if any other Station officers were knowledgeable of this incident
although it is probable that Mr. Arthur Avignon, DCOS (now retired and
living in the Washington area) may have read the pertinent cables.

1. In 1960 the writer developed and recruited Jose Raul Martinez
Nunez (201-281382), a Cuban national and a ranking Cubana Airline pilot.
2. Mr. Martinez requested an emergerey meeting on 18 July 1960 to
advise that he was the likely choice to pilot a chartered Cubana Airline
flight from Havana, Cuba to Pragie to pick up Raul Castro Puz and his
official party. On 20 July Mr. Martinez reported that the flight to Prague
was scheduled for 21 July and that he would definitely pilot the aircraft.
Headquarters and appropriate field stations along the flight route were
advised of the flight schedule; requirements were requested.
3. On the morning of 21 July Headquarters sent a TOP SECRET RYBAT
OPERATIONAL IMEDIATE cable (DIRECTOR 40923 OUT 98941, 21 July 1960) to
the Havana Station advising that "possible removal of top three leaders
is receiving serious consideration at Headquarters" and requested the
Station at its option to contact Mr. Martinez and determine his willingness
to cooperate in arranging an accident during the return trip from Prague.
The cable said that Headquarters would be willing to offer a payment after
successful completion of $10,000.00 or a reasonable amount in excess of that.
4. Mr. James Noel, CCS Havana, instructed the writer to meet with Mr.
Martinez and make known our interests. The writer contacted Mr. Martinez
and arranged an emergency meeting which took place in Mr. Martinez' personal
vehicle while driving to the airport. Mr. Martinez aid he would take a
calculated risk but limited the possibilities which could pass as an accident.
At one point Mr. Martinez asked for assurance that in event of his death
the U.S. Government would see that his two sons were given a College education.
This assurance was given orally. On returning to the Station the writer
was advised that an OPI cable (DI ECTOR 40965 OUT 99096, 21 July 1960) had
been received at the Station directing the Station to disregard the earlier
instructions.
5. Mr. MÃ¤rtinez was debriefed by the writer efter his return from
Prague. He reported that he had no opportunity to arrange an accident such
as we had discussed prior to his departure. I do not recall telling Mr.
Martinez that the original instructions, had been changed and I am inclined
to believe I made no reference to the new instructions which had been received
after
