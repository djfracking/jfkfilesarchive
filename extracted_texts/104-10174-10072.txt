13. In August 1975, informei 1DEN A that control of his
operation was being transferred to the Miami regional office, and that
his financial relationship with INCOLLAR would be terminated and then
re-established locally following 1 September 1975. •On 9 September 1975,
a state-federal task force arrested 39 persons in Key West. IDEN A know
nothing about the arrests in advanca. He called IDEN G to find out what
was happening, and IDEN C said he also was unaware of them. He asked
IDEN A to continua reporting on these developments. The next day IDEN A
met with a source who told him someone had blown IDEN A's LNCOLLAR
affiliation to the drug ring. He described the leak as coming from an
ex-BKHERALD officer who hated IDEN A. IDEN A's source, who was in touch
with drug ring members, toid IDEN A the codename of his INCOLLAR operation
(IDEN S), and IDEN A. learned IDEN F had spread this word all over town.
IDEN A subsequently received telephone death threats (one of the ring
member's girl friend called to tell him a white LNCOLLAR informant (IDEN A)
would not get out of town alive). There had been eight informant deaths
in Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, all unsolved murders.
There was
every reason; then, to take the threats seriously. IDEN A informed
LNCOLLAR about the threats. LNCOLLAR replied that IDEN A was pushing the
panic button, and asked for more information. IDEN A requested that the
emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but LNCOLLAR refused. Finally,
INCOLLAR said "We don't know what you expect us to do since you've been
terminated". IDEN A, who had been terminated by LNCOLLAR/Washington,
had not been picked up subsequently by the Miami Regional Office.
14.
IDEN A, desiring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many
of his agents in Key West, but the fow he did reach were expecting a
portion of the reward money since the ring that was rolled up was one the
agents had reported on for many months. IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR
on this, and was informed his net's information was not used as the basis
for the arrests. IDEN A learned that IDEN F had passed the word around "
Key West that IDEN A was not an LNCOLLAR staff employee, which made IDEN A
· fair game for removal. He also learned plans had been made locally for
his murder. At that point, IDEN A then made his escape with his wife.
In Miami, he met with IDEN M. IDEN M claimed IDEN E had not caused any
of the problems IDEN A had experienced. Concerning money ascurances,
IDEN M first denied any promises had been made. Later he said any that
had been made (by IDKN G) were unauthorized. He reiterated IDEN A's
reporting, although accurate, was not used in the arrests. LNCOLLAR
agreed to provide IDEN A with US$1800 for all his problems, and raised
the sum later to US$3 thousand. IDEN A accepted the money, but did not
indicate he was satisfied with this summ.
15. IDEA snuck back into Key West and packed his household goods
in one evening. his boat was given to a fish supply house to sell. Sinca
he owed the company money for supplies he had purchased, the rish house

sold the boat for a sum equal to his debts. IDEN A's wife quit her job
without notice, and he estimates his actual financial losses are
US$25 thousand. LNCOLLAR has indicated the US$3 thousand payment is
"all IDEN A will get", and he is determined to get more.
16. IDEN A believes many of his agants think he did receive a payoff
from LNCOLLAR following the arrests, and that he took all the money and
ran, leaving them axposal in Key West. The cars of two of his agents
were burned, and IDEN D. IDEN P. and others in the Miami area quit working
for LNCOLLAR when they learned of the treatment, he had received and/or
received death threats themselves. IDEN T. As a result, IDEN A cannot
return to Key Wast, and his lobster business no longer exists.
17. The purpose of IDEN A's contacting the AKHERALD is first to
let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets.
IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the false prouises that were used
to lure some BKHERALD employees to work at LNCOLLAR. As documentation,
he provided IDEN l'a grievance letter to LNCOLLAR which is attached* and
for retention. IDEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence
Division of INCOLLAR and placed in enforcement work in Miami. IDEN I
is currently seeking to return to BKHERALD amployment, and IDEN A says
IDEN I will verify his statements on the treatment of BKHERALD personnal
who transferred to LNCOLLAR. (IDEN I's home phone in Miami is IDEN I.)
He and the other ex-BKHERALD employees working at a lower level are fed
up with LNCOLLAR, and are convinced they will never receive fair treatment
in that organization. Since IDEN A believes the recruitment of BKHERALD
officers to switch to LNCOLLAR will be a continuing thing, he feels we
should know the realities of life in LNCOLLAR.
*[Forwarded Separatelyl
18. In addition, he notes LNCOLLAR is using many retiral BKHERALD
people and former BKHERALD assets in its activities. IDEN A believes
these persons, in many instances, are being both used and abused. Any
flap which occurs as a result of LNCOLLAR mismanagement will bounce
back on BERALD, since it appears BKHERALD is involved in the LICOLLAR
operation. Indeed, IDEN G has given the impression his activities have
been cleared with and approved by BKHERALD. Those assets who are being
turned off by LNCOLLAR mismanagement are going to be lost to BKHERALD as
well as to LNCOLLAR. Some of these persons could be significant assets
in years to come.
19. A flap may not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, who is
writing a book about the role of the Cubans IDEN V and IDEN W in the
IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that IDEN G'a
wife and IDEN Y's business manager made a trip to Florida recently.
Also IDEN U said he has learned that a former BKMERALD man who is a

LNCOLLAR agent is a honosaxual, and that US$15 thousand in LNCOLLAR
funda were given to someone in Miami to bail out a Puerto Rican drug
dealer. The investigation of DEN by LNCOLLAR internal affairs did
reveal, according to IDEN A, that US$15 thousand could not be accounted
for by IDEN E, whose career appears to have bean unaffected by the
investigation. IDEN U, who obviously has a source within LNCOLLAR, also
told IDEN A about many of the individuals (by name) in LNCOLLAR who are
formarly BKHERALD employees.
-
20. IDEN U's information appears to be accurate, according to IDEN A,
who recalls receiving a telephone call from IDEN G in July 1975. IDEN G
was agitated, and asked IDEN A to handle a matter for him quickly and
quietly. He said his wife, children, and the business agent of IDEN Y
were in Key West, and were supposed to stay in the apartment of a retired'
"BKHERALD employed named LDEN Z (formerly with IDEN AA). IDEN 2, a friend
of IDEN F, had left the area and gave his apartment key to IDEN F. When
IDEN C'a wife and the others arrived in Key West, theyccould not locate
IDEN F to get the key IDEN C asked DOEN A to find out what they were
doing, "and just how far my neck is stuck out". IDEN A learned they had
checked into a local motel. He called IDEN G and passed on this information.
IDEN G was relieved, but asked IDEN to keep an eye on them and report
their movements to him. Subsequently, while on a trip to Miami, IDEN A
was approached by an LNCOLLAR officer in Internal Affairs. This individual
said the episode was under active investigation, and asked IDEN A what
• he know about it.
i
21. Finally, IDEN A 1s giving EXHERALD an opportunity to provide
whatever advica, guidance, and assistance it vishes to furnish before
he takes further action to obtain just compensation from LNCOLLAR. lla
is thinking in terms of possible BXNERALD intervention on his behalf
with LNCOLLAR. He recognizes REMERALD may wish to let him fend for
himself. In that event, ha plans to approach IDEN BB in Tampa to reveal
the above story, and seak IDEN 85's assistance in patitioning LNCOLLAR
fof financial relief. He will not take any action with IDEN BB until
he has heard from BEKHERALD. Since he is anxious to get started on
this matter, a speedy reply to his request for assistance will be
appreciated.
22. IDEN A, incidentally, has decided to remain in Tampa, and has
obtained a job as chief investigator for a local private security
service. We indicated a reply would be forthcoming either through us
or directly to IDEN A. His phone number is IDEN A. He resides at IDEN A.

SUBJECT:
IDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee
NFL-002-76
DATE: 14 January 1976
1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7
January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the
meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for
several hours about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is
a long summation of his comments, and at the mero's conclusion his reasons
for bringing this situation to our attention. [Forwarded_under Separate
Cover].
2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Pigs activities, and
who was associated with JMWAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained
many contacts within the Cuban community in Florida. LNCOLLAR, which
was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the
drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key West,
Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
respected member of the community.
3. In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had
been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN. A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate
IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired
and could not help. A few months later, IDEN D (AMTABY-27), another
former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed
him LNCOLLAR had sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified
his LNCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff
employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being
staffed with BKHERAID employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BKHERALD staffer.
4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BKHERALD retiree, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was LNCOLLAR-involved.
Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

US$100/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a
seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings
will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of
dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with his agents. IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year. IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster
boat available.

that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami
who would come to his aid instantly. IDEN A was given emergency telephone
numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his
airlift out (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR
affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided

assistance was not specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months

reimbursement for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD
official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what

the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug
activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much
additional data.
IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began sending
back reports. IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with
IDEN G. Often, these meetings were a waste of time, and on occasion IDEN G

would not even show up. At one point IDEN J asked IDEN A to write, a
paper on the capability of ex-BKHERALD assets who were drug traffickers,
and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration, to penetrate
WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs. IDEN A showed how the assets could
circumvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic.
The paper
"scared LNCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN A. At the end of June 1974,
IDEN J asked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR
officials on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with
IDEN G and his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G.
indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access
in Key West.
8. Later, IDEN A told IDEN G he had sent lots of reports, but there
had been no arrests, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said he would no
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to
make IDEN A a LNCOLLAR consultant to protect his retired status. He also
promised IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in
LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs. IDEN G also spoke of using IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities
in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
request) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's name,
and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.
9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.
In June he made similar comments while at another social gathering. IDEN A
made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
IDEN F said he knew IDEN A was working with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974,
IDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer. IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cumbersome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,
IDEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which İDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly
cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the violators by LNCOLLAR officer IDEN E, who
had come to Key West unbeknownst to IDEN A. Through friends in Miami,
IDEN A found out IDEN E was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West,
had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible for the breakup of IDEN E's first marriage), had big
real estate deals going in Miami, had a Swiss bank account, and was still
using SKHERALD cover in Miami.
11.
IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E's LNCOLLAR connection, and two
other LNCOLLAR assets in the Miami area, had agreed to assist LNCOLLAR
only if LNCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
their relationship or see any of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged
for this through IDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in
IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinely saw
all of IDEN P's reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding
paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about
IDEN E, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had assured
him he would be brought to Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing
ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR on the orders
of INCOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no clearance or
background check would be undertaken on him.
12. IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN F to learn more about
IDEN E: During a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed
the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who would go to
LNCOLLAR. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E for a long period of time, and
had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN E by LNCOLLAR
since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed.
At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been
learned. including IDEN F's admission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A
was an LNCOLLAR asset. IDEN G denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would
check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with IDEN Ġ the next day in Miami to fill
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meantime,
IDEN F told IDEN E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E
wrote a memorandum saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over-
stepped the bounds of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR
asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and IDEN A were running an investigation

inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in
discussing an LNCOLLAR employee with an asset. The Internal Affairs
section of LNCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E probe and concluded by May 1975
that the charges against IDEN E were accurate. In the meantime, IDEN I
was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN A.

Publication of Items Relating to Cuban Operations
13 January 1976
1944947
1. We met with Grayston Lynch, a retired Agency staff employes,
on 7 January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. Lynch had requested
the meeting through contact with OGC. One item of interest to Lynch
concerns a book he wishes to write on Cuban operations during the
period 1961-67. Lynch currently is in the process of preparing one
book (on the Bay of Pigs) for publication. Recently, however, ha
spoke with George Crile, who is writing a book on Watergate burglars
Bugenio Martines and Bernard Barker. Crile indicated he and co-author
Taylor Branch plan to follow that book with one on the Agency'a Cuban
operations, and focus on Lynch and William Robertson, two major figures
in the Bay of Piga invasion. Since Martines was deeply involved with
Lynch as a ship captain during the Bay of Pigs and in subsequent
operations against Cuba, he will be the primary source for the book.
2. Lynch believes the story Martinez will provide will be somewhat
inaccurate because he only saw developments from the vantage point of
a ship captain. Lynch (whose cohort Robertson is deceased) believes
only he can provide an accurate recounting. The Martinez book is
scheduled for printing in the summer of 1976. Lynch would like to
beat Crila and Branch to the punch. Indeed, he believes they will not
publish their book if they know he is going to publish one on the same
subject. What Lynch wishes is an indication of general Agency reaction
to any samuiuscript he might write on the period.
3. Lynch wishes to write about the operations of the AMLILAC
group (Commandos Mombisei) during the period 1961-67, when Lynch
conducted about 100 infiltration and exfiltration operations in Cuba.
Any manuscript he drafts will, of course, be submitted to the Agency
for review, Ha does not wish to get into the writing job, however,
if there is a blanket prohibition on describing Agency operations
which occurred in that period and place. He notes that Martinez, not
fettered by Agency restrictions, will provide Crile and Branch with
his recollections. Lynch believes he can cover the material in a way
which will not hurt anyone or expose anything. He had no intentions
of getting into the commando raid recounting business until he heard
from Crile recently.

.4. Since time is important on this matter, Lynch shall appreciata
a fairly quick response on this question. He recognizes no final
decision on his manuscript can be made until Agency officials reviews
it. At the same time, however, it may not be too difficult to ascertain
the presence or absence of a blanket restriction on writing about this
ere.

1. John Greeney, OGC, called this date to advise that ex-CIA
employce (now retired) Grayston Lynch told John over the telephone
that he wants to consult with a CIA officer on some undefined problems
concerning other ex-CIA employees. It seems that Lynch, who was
involved in the Bay of Pigs operation and is an open protagonist of
CIA, is writing a book. He is in contact with Greaney with respect
to OGC's need to review the boek before it is published.
2. Greaney, who believes that Lynch may be connected with.
Dave Philips Ex-CIA Employees Association, asked if we could have
a DCD officer from the Miami Field Office visit Lynch in Tampa.
where he is now living, and listen to his story. Greaney attached
some importance and urgency to his request and indicated that it
would be advantageous for the Agency to remain on good terms with Lynch.
3. I told him I would pass his request on to higher DCD
authority and let him know what is decided. Lynch's address is:
8709 Bay Point Drive, Tampa, Florida, telephone: 813-884-8610.

OPERATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT
This report is believed to contain information of operational interest and may not be disclosed to personnel outside
the Directorate of Operations without the prior permission of the Domestic Collection Division.
US citizen, individual with longtime relationship with Bulugio
Cantillo. Source is a retired Agency staff employee.
1. Eulogio Cantillo, a Cuban national who resides at 6701 S.W. 2nd
Street, Miami, Florida, is a former Cuban general. In 1956, when
he was the Chief of the Cuban Air Force under Cuban dictator Batista,
Cantillo's uncle came to him with an ore sample the uncle had
uncovered in an abandoned former Spanish mine în Cuba. The uncle
suspected the ore was uranina. Cantillo brought the specimen to
the US, where it was assayed by an unnamed US survey company as
being the richest uranium sample the firm had ever tested. Cantillo
and the mcle, who were the only Individuals aware of the location
of the mine, recognized archaic Cupen laws did not protect their
find, so the general attempted to get Batista to change the mining
statutes. Batista suspected the general had come across something
significent, andhhe sent a tean of men to the Pinar del Rio area
for six months on a search. The team uncovered nothing. Batista
also tried to work out a deal where he would be a partner in the
Benture as a pre-condition to changing the mining laws.
unsuccessful in convincing Cantillo to permit him to become a
partner. At that time, the revolution reached full intensity, and
Batista left the country.
2. Cantillo's uncle is still in Cuba. Despite Cantillo's imprisonment
by the Fidel Castro regime for nine years, he has never told anyone.
about his uncle's find. Approximately one year ago, Cantillo
approached a retired Agency staff employee and informed him of the
uncle's find. He did so after all these years because of the
developing relations between the US and Cuba. Cantillo feels the
US may be able to make use of information that Castro does not
possess about the riches that exist in his own nation, and that
Castro and the USSR would capitalize on the find if they were to
become aware of it. In his view, the US should know of this
potential before it conducts negotiations with Castro. The general
is willing to provide the name of the assay company, so that
documentation can be obtained on the purity of the uranium.
!
The general's US contact notes Cantillo is not the sort of man who
speaks inaccurately about things such as this. He described Cantillo
as a "solid guy", and says the information Cantillo has provided
probably is reliable.

dealing with Justin McCarthy and a Robert M. Moore. It is
uncertain whether or not these individuals are the ones of

least 15 other individuals named Robert Moore; without
considerable additional information, we cannot make any
positive identification). I am forwarding, on loan, our

.2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the Bay of Pigs activities, and
who was associated with JMHAVE during the period 1961-68, has maintained
many contacts within the Cuban commmity in Florida. LNCOLLAR, which
was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the
drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantime, had moved to Key West,
Florids, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
respected member of the community.
3. In late 1973, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had
been terminated in 1963; IDEN C, came to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
running between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate
IDÈN C's willingness to be of assistance.

IDEN A replied he was retired

former asset, flew to Key West from Miami.

He met IDEN A and informed
his LNCOLLAR contact as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff
employee, moved to Key West and informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being
staffed with BIGGERALD employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BKHERALD staffer.
4. A few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BFHERALD retires, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was INCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two SKIDRALD people in Hond wanted to meet with IDEN A. IDEN A agreed
to a meeting, and IDEN F introduced IDEN I and IDEN EIDEN-A know-
IDEN I, "but was aware of IDEN-E only-by reputation, which was unsavory.
IDEN E claimed to be a BKHERALD employee, as did IDEN I. IDEN A, of
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a
call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami. lie was an ex-EKHERALD officer,
and he said IDEN C wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent
basis.
5. IDEN G told IDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for LNCOLLAR:
to establish intelligence networks in the Cuban community in Key West. He
said no one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start
US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said
this money would not be reportable as income. When IDEN A asked about
the effect of his own ex-BKHERALD status, IDEN G replied BKHERALD does
not want or need to know of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that
US$100/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a
seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings
will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of
dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with his agents. IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster
1. boat available.
6. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature
of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important consideration,
and IDEN G said, "I don't want to go to any more funerals". They added
that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami
who would come to his aid instantly. IDEN A was given emergency telephone
numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his
airlift out (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR
affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided
up to US$40 thousand, as well as relocation assistance. The relocation
assistance was not specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months
living expenses and assistance in job search activities, as well as
reimbursement for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD
official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what
he knew about drug traffickers in the Key West area. Two weeks later,
the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug
activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much
additional data.
7.
IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began serding
back reports.
IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with

would not even show up. At one point IDEN J asked IDEA to write a
paper on-the capability of ex-BKHERALD assets who were drug traffickers,
- and who had been trained in infiltration and exfiltration, to penetrate
WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs. IDEN A-showed how the assets could
circumvent any government effort to stop the drug traffic.
The paper
"scared LNCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN A. At the end of June 1974,
IDEN J asked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR
officiala on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with
IDEN G and his deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDEN G
indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access
in Key West,

had been no arrests, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said he would no
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to
maka “IDEN A a LNCOLLAR consultant to protect his retired status.
lle also
promised IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in
LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs. IDEN C also spoke of using. IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities
in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
request) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's name,
and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are IDEN O, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.

9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.
In June he made similar comments while at another social gathering. IDEN A
made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
DDEN F said he knew IDEN A was working with INCOLLAR. In July 1974,
IDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer. IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cumbersome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,
IDEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which IUEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly
cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

from a direct approach to the violators by LNCOLLAR officer IDES F. who
had come to Kay West unbeknownst to DEN A. Through friends in Miami
MEN A found out IJEN E was in charge of IDEN A's operation in Key West,
had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible for the breakup of LDEN E's first mirriage). had big
real estate deals going in Miami, had a Swiss bank account, and was still
using BKHERALD cover in Miami.
11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN B's INCOLLAR connection, and two
other INCOLLAR assets in the Miami area. had agreed to assist LNCULIAR
only if LNCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
their relationship or see any of their informant reports.
for this through IDEN G, and the three agents' files were placed in
IDEN I arranged
IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinaly say
all of IDAN P's reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding
paragraph were known, IDEN I told DDEN A there were many allegations about
IDEN E, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had assured
him he would be brought to Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing
ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR on the orders
of LNCOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no clearance or
background check would be undertaken on him.
12.
IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approach IDEN P to learn more about
IDEN E. During a one hour discussion, IDDEN F said he had been appointed
the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who would go to
LNCOLLAR. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E for a long period of time, and
had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN E by LNCOLLAR
since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN E revealed.
At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been
learned, including IDEN F's admission that IDEN B had told him IDEN A
was an INCOLLAR asset. IDEN G. denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would
check on IDEN E. IDEN A met with IDEN G the next day in Miami to fill
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. In the meşutine,
IDEN F told IEI E of his meeting with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E
wrote a memorandum saying a fellow INCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) had over
stepped the bounds of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR
asset (IDEN A), and that IDEN I and ID: A were ruaning an investigation
on IDEN E. IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable".

section of INCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E probe and concluded by May 1975

was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN A.
