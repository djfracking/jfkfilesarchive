Nagell was believed to have hed-
a physical defect which was cor-s

Nagell does not wear glasses or a

shaven.
Sometime in 1968, while Source was on duty as a Desk Clerk at the
Strand Hotel from 1600 to 2400 hours, SUBJECT came to the hotel desk and rea
quested that Source allow HIM to sleep at the hotel that night since SUBJECT
was from out of town and did not have any money to rent a room.

Source of-
Since then, Source and SUBJECT have been close friends, and Source shared his
room with SUBJECT until approximately three weeks ago when SUBJECT left the
hotel with some friends, and Source had not seen HIM since.
SUBJECT told Source that HE was originally from Pittsburg, Pennsyl-
vania, where HE lived with HIS mother, Mrs. Trinkala, prior to coming to
New York City. Source had never met Mrs, Trinkala, however
talked with her telephonically on several occasions.

further details unknown. SUBJECT has several other brothers and sisters,
names unknown. During July or August 1969, SUBJECT was inducted into the
United States Army and was assigned to Fort Gordon, Ceorgia, for basic mili
tary training. SUBJECT always discussed with Source the fact that HE was a
very religious individual and HE considered HIMSELF a Conscientious Objector.
During one of Source's telephone conversations with SUBJECT'S mother, Mrs.
Trinkala told Source that she was making the necessary arrangements with her
Senator in Pittsburg, name unknown, to get SUBJECT out of military service.
At this time, Source told SUBJECT's mother that he felt it would be difficult
to get SUBJECT out of military service; however, Source felt that he could
help her and SUBJECT in obtaining SUBJECT'S transfer to the United States
Army Chaplain School, (USACS), Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, New York. In December
1969, a couple of days after Source's conversation with SUBJECT'S mother,
Source met Nagell at the Strand Hotel. Since Source knew Negell to be
former United States Army Captain, Source told, Nagel1 about SUBJECT and re-
quested advice from Nagell as to what could be done to have SUBJECT.

however, since HE is a Conscientious Objector, SUBJECT would hesitate to kill
anyone other than in self-defense.
Harfez Muneer recommended that Victor L. TRINKALA be favorably
considered for assignment to a position of trust and responsibility with the
United States Army.
AGENT'S NOTES: During the course of this interview, it was noted
by the undersigned that Source appeared to be genuinely interested in the
well being of SUBJECT and on several occasions Source made it clear that he
wanted to help HIM, Source appeared to be truthful and always answered the
questions asked in a straightforward manner and without hesitation. It was
also noted that the hotel room occupied by Source at the Woodstock Hotel
contained only one bed, which gave reason to believe that SUBJECT and Source
were sleeping in one bed while sharing the room at the hotel. When Source
was queried concerning SUBJECT, Source presented for inspection a copy of
SUBJECT'S Sworn Statement completed by HIM on 19 February 1970 and signed by
HIM on 20 February 1970.

transferred to USACS At this time, SUBJECT was at Oakland Army Terminal
with PCS orders for Vietnam, Negell immediately sent a telegram addressed
to the Commanding Ceneral, Sixth United States Army, requesting SUBJECT'S
transfer to USACS since SUBJECT was a Conscientious Objector. Nagell had
never met SUBJECT personally; however, the same night that Nagell sent the
telegram to Sixth Army in regard to SUBJECT, Source talked to SUBJECT by
telephone and at that time Nagell was introduced to SUBJECT telephonically.
Source believed that neither Nagell nor Source was instrumental in getting
SUBJECT separated from the service, since it is a fact that SUBJECT'S mother
mentioned to Source that she was making the necessary arrangements through
her Senator in Pittsburg to get SUBJECT separated from the military service.
It'is Source's opinion, that either Mrs. Trinkala or her Senator was in-
strumental in getting SUBJECT out of the military. Source knew of no other
efforts or attempts made by either Source or Nagell to get SUBJECT separated
from the military service. Source could not offer any further information
concerning Nagell and had not seen him since that night that Nagell wrote
the telegram in behalf of SUBJECT.
In December 1969, SUBJECT was discharged from the United States
Army, reason unknown to Source. SUBJECT returned to New York City and
continued to share Source's apartment at the Woodstock Hotel. At that
time, Source recalled that he was illegally convicted and confined to the
FP for the use, possession and selling of narcotics. Since SUBJECT is a
young man and there is & narcotics problem in the New York City area, Source
started counselling SUBJECT against the use of narcotics or drugs. Source
secured a job for SUBJECT at the Clinton Hotel, 19 West 31st Street, New
York, New York, where SUBJECT started working during the day shift. Since
SUBJECT was working during the day, Source suggested to SUBJECT that HE
register at the evening classes offered at the YMCA so that HE could finish
HIS high school education. To Source's knowledge, SUBJECT never completed
high school and Source was unable to state whether or not SUBJECT ever
registered in the evening classes offered at the YMCA. Approximately three
weeks ago, SUBJECT was at Source's room at the Woodstock Hotel with some
friends, not further identified. SUBJECT left the Woodstock Hotel with HIS
friends and Source had not seen HIM since then. To Source's knowledge,.
SUBJECT had never been approached or been in contact with anyone representing
policies inimical to the best interests of the United States and it is Source's
opinion that SUBJECT would report to the proper United States authorities if
HE were ever approached by such a person. SUBJECT was considered to be loyal
to the United States and to favor and support the Constitution of this
country. SUBJECT is willing to defend the United States against all enemies;
