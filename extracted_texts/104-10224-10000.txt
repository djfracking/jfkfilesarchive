Section C, attach a separate weet of peper. During the period under review, Sobject has
continued to produce at his previous high level and he has planned and
executed three intelligence collection operations against a denied area
with the two teams under his supervision and direction. His leadership
qualities have, to a large degree, enabled him to maintain his commando
group morale at a high level under the difficult circumstances of en-
forced inactivity. Subject's indigenous agents respect him and are
willing to follow his instructions to the letter. Subject's seemingly
limitloss resourcefulness, drive and initiative coupled with his
demonstrated proficiency for this type of work mark him as one of the
fow persons known to the Rater who is ideally suited to this particular
type of agent handling on a day-to-day, face-to-face basis.
During the reporting period Subject has committed his four infil-
tration boat teams on a total of seven operations and excellent results
have been realized. He has conducted extensive testing of equipment
and tochniques in support of Station requirements and Headquarters
requests. His reporting after these field tests has shown that his
reporting ability has improved to such a degree to warrant a rating of
strong in this duty.
He is cost and security conscious and has demonstrated his effective-
noss in the use of personnel, equipment and operational funds. Subject
has not had the benefit of formal language training and does not have a
definitive language capability. In view of his long tenure of field assign-
ments during his career with WOFACT, it is recommended he be wiyen.

LANGUAGE TRAINING, AIM AND EVALUATION CRITERIA
The aim of this course of study was to provide the student with the foreign language competence desired by the
sponsoring office. Except as noted below, the instruction emphasized speaking, aural comprehension and reading, as
required.
This student's evaluation is based on (1) Instructor and Department Chief observations; and (2) regularly samin
istered achievement tests. Fluency and accuracy, as appropriate to each skill, were given due consideration in eval
uating the student. The achievement rating and performinge evaluation below reflect performance and achievement in
this course only and are conditioned by the student's motivation and aptitude for language learning. This ration
should not be confused with the Proficiency Rating (Form 1223) *Certification of Language proficiency which is s
mitted separately. The degree of progress achieved by the student while in language training is shown in the box
in the upper right corner of this report.

FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE TESTING RESULTS
DATE

DeJuono
Iking
Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of
training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be
some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test
scores, just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than
expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, FRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE,
and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language train-
ing and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of
Languages previously studied or learned and the amount of academic and non-
academic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but
are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether
such experience was in the same language as the one to be studied or in a
different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

14 DEC 1370
1
It was determined that no action would be taken on
this case until after the first of the year (1971) at
which time. Mr. Lynch will be advised by C/SOD/Personnel
that he will be made available for a suitable operational
assignment, most likely overseas, unless he opts to apply
for disability retirement.
If Mr. Lynch opts to apply for disability retirement
he will be continued in his present assignment pending
approval of his retirement.
If Mr. Lynch, chooses to be shopped for a field assign-
ment, SOD will initiate action to locate such a position.
When found, Mr. Lynch will be processed for the assignment.
Should he fail to be medically approved, action will be
taken to obtain his retirement for medical reasons. Should
an assignment not be forthcoming by April 1971, a medical
disposition for overseas planning purposes (General) will
be requested.
The purpose of the above scheduled action is to either
find a suitable assignment for Mr. Lynch or to effect his
disability retirement on either a voluntary or involuntary
basis.

form of records activity. It reviews the records mission of the CS and examines
the logic and structure of the system itself. The responsibilities of CS personnel
to the system, and the services provided by the different elements of the system,
provide the central theme of the course. Students are familiarized with methods
of input, maintenance and retrieval of information, and in disposition, disposal
and destruction of the records themselves. The course includes an introduction
to the various machine programs associated with the records system, and outlines
the management cycle by which the system is controlled and modified.

The course aims to provide a description of counterintelligence in the
covert and clandestine warfare of today in both friendly and enemy areas.
To do so, a brief description of the intent, purpose, and dynamics of .
espionage, subversion and counterintelligence as practiced by the major
enemy forces is provided and this is contrasted to the spectrum of counter-
intelligence activities of the United States of America and of allied countries.
To support counterintelligence missions levied upon the Agency, a review
of the cooperation and coordination and exchange of information and services
between cooperating services is provided. Counterintelligence is then
related to all other Clandestine Service operations and its place as a part
thereof is demonstrated. To provide the student with a framework within
which to work, the organization of the Agency for counterintelligence is
also provided.
ACHIEVEMENT RECORD
This is a certificate of attendance. Since this course is a survey
course, it does not attempt to qualify the student as a counterintelligence
operations officer and no evaluation is made of individual performance.

This is the third Fitness Report prepared on Subject
since his assignment to this Station. The comments set forth
on the two previous Fitness Reports by the Reviewing Officer
and the Chief of Station are in the main still applicable. The
Reviewing Officer has been most favorably impressed with Subject's
performance in his present position. Subject has continued to
perform his job in his usual competent, dependable and professional
manner. The Reviewing Officer shares the Rating Officer's high
opinion of Subject's performance and there is no doubt that
Subject has contributed significantly to the Station's activities.
Subject's over-all performance continues to warrant an evaluation

1.
Chief, Special Operations Division
: Maritine Branch Nomince for the Special
Operations Division's Historical Program
: Chief, Special Operations Division Nemo-
randum dated 24 December 1969. Subject:
Historical Program
Considering the current manpower shortages and
relative inexperience in the Maritime Eranch, I recommend
that only one quarter man year be devoted to the Historical
Program in calendar years 1970-71. If and when officers
report on board who have the unique or special knowledge
required to write histories, then these personnel will bo
assigned this task and a subsequent increase in man years
available will be made.
2. I nominate Mr. Grayston L. Lynch to write his-
torics in CY 1970-71. This officer combines the unique
knowledge of first hand operational experience with the
qualities of a good narrative writer.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in cement position keeping in proper perspective, their relationship to
overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment
on foreign language competence, if required for current position, Amolify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best
basis for determining-future personnel action. Manger of perfomance of managerial or supervisory duties and cest consciousness
in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If exuin space is needed to complete
Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper, During most of the period reported on, Subject
was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phaso-
out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject
continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned
him, worked up and implemented realistic training prograss, and con-
tioued to devolop excollont targets studies against the possibility of
a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally
by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees vas of great interest
to other agencies offices in the area. Subject was the only Station
source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's

Subject has shown a decided proficiency in the supervision of
the type of unit for which he has responsibility. His men respect
him and follow his orders readily. He is resourceful, acts with
initiative, and delegates responsibility. In his field he thinks
clearly and is decisive and versatile in his actions. He is capable
of handling larger units of personnel and assuming greater responsi-
bility in the PM field. If he were required to accept duties of a
broader nature in the intelligence field involving less supervision
of his own activities, he would need to improve in the areas of
.
written and oral expression and in his understanding of KUBARK
requirements and responsibilities. In this regard he would need
additional training and exposure to more extensive KUBARK fields
as he has not had the opportunity for participating in such KUBARK
activities. Subject does not have the proficiency of the language

SPECIAL NOTE
Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic' statement of specific duties may be reported in Section 8. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo-
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardise security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section 8 indicating the level of responsibility.

overall performance. Stute, suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment

Section C, attach a separate sheet of popet. During the period under review, Subject had
continued to produce at his previous high level and he has planned and
executed three intelligence collection operations against a denied area
with the two teams under his supervision and direction. His leadership
qualities have, to a large degree, enabled him to maintain his commando
group morale at a high level under the difficult circumstances of ea-
forced inactivity. Subject's indigenous agents respect him and are
willing to follow his instructions to the letter. Subject's seemingly
limitless resourcefulness, drive and initiative coupled with his
demonstrated proficiency for this type of work mark him as one of the
few persons known to the Rater who is ideally suited to this particular
type of agent handling on a day-to-day, face-to-face basis.
During the reporting period Subject has committed his four infil-
tration boat teams on a total of seven operations and excellent results
have been realized. He has conducted extensive testing of equipment
and techniques in support of Station requirements and Headquarters
requests. His reporting after these field tests has shown that his
reporting ability has improved to such a degree to warrant a rating of
strong in this duty.
He is cost and security conscious and has demonstrated his effective
ness in the use of personnel, equipment and operational funds. Subject
has not had the benefit of formal language training and does not have a
definitive language capability. In view of his long tenure of field assiga-
ments during his career with WOFACT, it is recommended he be given

sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these casos, general statements of

Subject has been under my supervision for approximately 6 months.
During this period he has shown an outstanding proficiency in the
supervision of his Commando Group. He is responsible for the
logistical support, maintenance, planning and operations of the
group and must also maintain their motivation and moral. As a result
of the stand-down in PM activities at this Station, one of his major
duties has been keeping his group motivated and happy. Subject has
performed these tasks in a very professional manner; he has shown
strong leadership qualities and a definite ability to adapt to
difficult and frustrating changes in the operational climate.
Subject has had the additional duty of handling an FI Agent for
the Station. He has spent long hours on this activity and has shown
that he is fully capable of broadening his scope of activities to
other fields besides the supervision of a commando group. He. is
cost and security conscious and has shown that he is effective in
the use of personnel, space, equipment and operational funds.

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE
---
--
Štravs strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions main to employee for improvement of his
work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater
sponsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and he provide the best basis for determining
future personnel actions,
As a former military officer, Subject is hard working and abundantly
sincere in his efforts to fight Communism. His performance since Aug 1961
has not been at the top level of his capabilities for several reasons,
not all of which are within his ability to overcere. Subject has had
little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to compre-
hend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and cancel operations.
A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for discipline
for his men. Still another reason is the directive for only limited
action with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say
that in a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to
be held in limbo, he has not been at his best.
Subject's dealings with his agents have in turn been affected by his
own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted
in obtuse explanations to them which have made them harder to handle.
His reluctance to put things on paper has detracted from his performance
and denied him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His
security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations.
Subject is in need of training in tradecraft and PM operations. His
basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that he can, with
training, do a much better job. This combined with a program of concen-
trated action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should
be of real value to the Agency.

amount of $165.54. He stated that this was not correct as the verbal instruc-
tions given him b. Mr. Robert Bladergroen of OGC were followed by him when
☐ he filed his 1962 covert return. According to DEVUONO, Bladergroen discussed
tax matters with him during a visit to JMWAVE sometime in April 1963.
:
2. As I was not previously acquainted with the facts in DEVUONO's case,
I did not attempt to judge it nor to promise him that it could be resolved to
his satisfaction. I did, however, inform him we would investigate the matter
and would officially advise the Station of the decision. Therefore, please
initiate appropriate action with the covert tax people and the Office of General
Counsol (Mr. Bladergroen) to set this matter at rest. Informally, Bladergroen
informs me that he recalls his conversations with DEVUONO and that DEVUONO
either did not understand his instructions or chose to disregard them. I believe.

1. The Office of Security has been advised that you
will be a recipient of an honor award in the Headquarters
Building in the near future. This memorandum is designed
to alert you to the security implications of receiving this
award. As must be obvious to you, your role with the organ-
ization has been one involving very sensitive operations and
projects calling for extraordinary security precautions. You
will be expected to continue this kind of exacting security
orientation in all dealings you may have with the outside world
regarding this award.
2. First, the organization's security policies require
that the number of persons on the outside learning of an award
be limited. In your case, such persons should be limited to
those in your immediate family.
3. Secondly, you are asked to scrupulously avoid re-
leasing or cooperating in the release of any publicity re-
garding the award to public information media such as radio,
television or the newspapers. This award should never be
mentioned in the presence of any reporter or representative
of any public information media.
4. After receiving your award you will be asked to
return it together with any accompanying papers to the Secretary,
Honor and Merit Awards Board, for safekeeping. When the
cover and security factors requiring secrecy about your con-
nection with CIA are no longer operative these award materials
will be returned to you.

SUBJECT
:
Tax Problem of Irving G. DEVUONO
While on TDY at Headquarters, the writer conferred.
with the Head of the Covert Tax Unit on the subject problem.
The writer was informed that the Covert Tax Unit is not able
to accept and forward a Covert return for the year 1962 for
the subject individual since a Form 1099 had been issued.
It was further stated that the Internal Revenue Service, while
performing a service last year (tax year 1961) of this nature,
would not under any circumstances permit a person and/or
persons receiving a Form 1099 or W-2 to file a Covert Return
for such reported income. Therefore, it appears all avenues
of escape for Irving. G. DEVUONO have been closed and he should
file an amended return for Tax Year 1962 to include the KUBARK
income reported on Form 1099.

The mission is to adapt current assets into a force
which can enter the target area by sea or air to conduct recon-
naissance, caching, sabotage, raids and/or guerrilla warfare
support operations.
3. The organizational concept to be followed is that of
small teams which can function independently or in combination
and entirely under indigenous leadership. All personnel should
be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should be
physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short
notice. Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities
necessary for training become available.

4. The standards for members of the group should be con-
stantly upgraded by culling of members who become marginal or who
do not develop as expected. Recruitment of promising new members
will be dependent on the needs of the station based on policy
directives. Priority should be given to sabotage training to
permit the mounting of a sabotage, program at the earliest possible
moment. Coincidentally, planning and thought should be given to
the topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of
those facilities necessary for a rapid expansion of the group if
a full scale operational program should be developed.

Also, the

should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual
proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness
for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams parti-
cipating simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justifica-
tion for operations.

Subject: 1962 Income Tax for Irving C. DEVUONO
1. The subject person has submitted the attached memorandum which
outlines his objection to paying the self-employment social security
tax under the proviso of being self employed. Unfortunately the
subject's contract contains the following proviso:
Paragraph 8(d): From the salary pald pursuant to this
contract these shall be deducted the appropriate rate
percentage (presently 61%) for deposit and eventual
crediting to the Civil Service Retirement Fund. When
circumstances of your cover warrant or require contri-
butions to social security such contributions will be
at your expense and you will not be reimbursed therefor
by the Government.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Transfer of Irving C. DEVUONO to the AMLILAC Group
1. On 15 March 1963 a meeting was held at Ace Cartography
in order to advise both Irving G. CADICK and Irving C. DEVUONO
as to the latters transfer from the AMTABBY group to the AMLILAC
group.
In attendance at this meeting were Stanley R. ZAMKA,
CADICK, DEVUONO and the writer.
2.
ZAMKA initiated the discussion by stating that the 15th
would be DEVUONO's last day with CUSOG and that he should take
care of any accounts outstanding and complete processing out of
CUSOG. DE VUONO was advised he would be contacted by WALTUCK later
in the day in reference to his next assignment.
3.
CADICK was then advised he should plan a caching opera-
tion during the month of April. The exact location, woight and
contents of the cache would be passed to him the afternoon of
the 15th. CADICK requested that a boat, the Squall King, with
which a great deal of training had been accomplished be permitted
to go on this caching operation. ZAMKA agreed that security wise
the use of an organic AMTABBY boat might be worthwhile. CADICK
will include the use of the Squall King in the operational plan
which he will submit this coming week.

This meeting broke up at 1130 hours, 15 March 1963.

FROM
SUBJECT: INCOME TAX
I was sent to this Station in Aug. 61 and was given a cover breifing at
Headquarters before I left in which I was told that since I was paying into a retirement
fund of this organization that they would no longer withold Social Security from my pay.
In late 61 I was notified that they wre refunding to me all money withheld for incme tax
up to that time and that I would have to file on the inside and to start withholding my
own taxes. This was done and I was told by this station to file the covert return with them
and to file an overt return on my Army retirement pay. This I did for the year 1961. I
was also told by BOB the tax man to file this years return the same way. I made my own tax
withholding during 1962 and have the money to cover the taxes, but now I am told that because
someone made a mistake and mailed both me and the IRS a form 1099 on my 1962 pay that now
I must file an overt return. This now will cause me to pay $225.00 selfemployment tax
will make me liable to a 6% penalty for not filing an estimated return quarterly. Since
I would not have had to pay these extra taxes if the mistake in mailing the form 1099 had
not been made and since I did everything in this matter that the station wanted me to do
I do not feel that this extra cost should be for by me. I feel this is penalizing me for
request
and
someone elses mistake. I mak that this matter be reconsidered and that I be informed as
to how I should file my 1962 tax return and that I also be told how this years withholding
is to be done,

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and suppor
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section 8 indicating me level of responsibility.

fully mastered the tools of his trade. Subject applies all of
his para-military knowledge in the performance of his current
duties as the senior outside case officer for a thirty-man commando
group, which is capable of carrying out a variety of different
missions. These missions include caching operations, sabotage
raids, tactical intelligence reconnaissance activities and
contingency missions related to war plans. Subject is at his best
in dealing with mon and military equipment. Subject's major weak-
mas is in records management and reports writing. Despite this
minor weakness, Subject's over-all performance warrants an evalua-
timn of Proficient.
Subject has the potential to train and operationally exploit
para-military forces in units which have a T/O strength of not
more than 60 men. Subject could command a conventional military
formation at the battalion level. Subject is capable of mounting
counter-insurgency operations with the use of forces up to battal-
ion strength.
Subject's work comes to the attention of the Reviewing Officer
on a bi-weekly basis.

fisld. If Subject is to remain in operations in Latin America, he
aust be given an opportunity to study Spanish on a formal basis.

1. The writers' contract, as Career Agent, states in Para 4:
"Allowance: You will be entitled to: (a) living
(a) living quarters allow-
ance in conformance with applicable government regulations. You
may be provided quarters by your cover facility or the government
and, in such event, you will not be entitled to the living quarters
allowance herein indicated.
(b) Cost of living allowance in conformance with applic-
able government regulations including, but not limited to, a post
allowance or an equalization allowanco in llou thereof, a supple-
mentary post allowance, a transfer allowance, a basic service
transfer allowance, an education allowance, and a separation
allowance."
.
2. It appears clear to the writer that any housing allowance
which applies to staffers also applies to the writer. This would
then necessarily have to commence at the same time for both types
in order to be equal.
3. It is requested the writers' housing allowance be timed
to commence on the same date as the Staffers in order to comply
with the intent of the contract.

ABSTRACT

ACCOM
1.
Headquarters officers in charge of arranging
the award ceremony are reluctant to initiate any arrangements
without more information regarding the urgency indicated in
Reference. The fact that we reminded them that it had been a
year since the award was authorized had little effect.
2.
Are there any plans in the future to send Irving C.
DEVUONO to Hoadquarters? If so, then with several days advance
notice of such a trip arrangements for the ceremony could be
initiated.
3. It also would be helpful to indicate whether DEVUONO
will bring his family and anticipate a largo ceremony or whether
he would prefer a smaller, more intimate group gathered in the
Director's Office.

SUBJECT:
Fitness Report, Devuono
#14 February 1963
Cadict
i
1. The subject report being due, the writer is the
only person observing DEVUONO's work and has statements
and commendations which should be reflected in his fitness
report. The contents of this memorandum will be established
in DEVUONO's file in other form at later date by the writer.
2. DEVUONO has completed one year with CUSOG. In this
period he has shown a complete and practical knowledge of
paramilitary techniques and tactics. This knowledge is born
of experience and application. His application of this
knowledge for KUBARK has resulted in visible progress in the
technical abilities of CUSOG personnel.
3. He has shared CUSOG responsibilities of organization,
administration and operational preparation in a manner to
follow out KUBARK practices to its credit.
4. He carries out clear instructions to the letter,
reflecting a military background.
5. Contrary to observances noted in a previous fitness
report DEVUONO has been found to be anything but naive in
his dealings with PBRUMENS during the period observed.
6. His administrative and accounting procedures within
CUSOG are in order.
7. Hesitating to call them weaknesses, the writer must
state that DEVUONO's entire experience with KUBARK has been
field experience, usually far out on a long string of contacts
into a KUBARK installation, a fact which has prevented a look
at any of the administrative side of paramilitary as conducted
by KUBARK.

8. This man has good potential for helping KUBARK's
paramilitary effort, which potential will be more effective
when he has been schooled in the terminologies and peculari-
ties of paramilitary KUBARK-style. It is recommended a tour
by DEVUONO where such schooling can be conducted as on-the-
job training would most bring out this potential.

As a former military officer, Bubject is hard working and abundantly
sincoro in his efforts to fight Communism. His performanco sinco Aug. 1961
has not been at the top level of his capabilities for several roasong
not all of which are within his ability to overcome. Bubject has had
littlo clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to compro-
hend the intangible factors which provent, dolay and cancel operations.
A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for disciplino
for his men. Still another reason is the directive for only limited
action with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say
that in a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to
be held in limbo, he has not been at his bust.
Subject's dealings with his agents have in turn been affected by his
own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted
in obtuse explanations to them which have made thom harder to handle.
His reluctance to put things on paper has detracted from his porformanco

and denied him the clarifying process which reporting provides.
security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations.
Subject is in need of training in tradecraft and PM operations. His
basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that ho can, with
training, do a much better job. This combined with a program of concen-
tratod action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should
be of real value to the Agency.

1.' In the reference DEVUONO is recommended for an honor or merit
award. It is noted the reference states he is currently in the field.
2. If the award is granted, the following security measures are re-
commended:
a. The award should be retained within Headquarters until such
time as DEVONO returns to Headquarters on a permanent change
of station and security/cover considerations permit the release
of the award to him. There would, of course, be no objections
to informing him of the granting of the award by me of Agency
secure channels.
b.
i
Prior to. DETUONO's receiving physical possession of the
award he should be instructed there are no objections to his show-
ing the award to his immediate family and his associates in the
Agency but that he should not release or cooperate in releasing
any publicity regarding the granting of the award.

3. Also, since CA/PG had limite responsibility for these
ZRJEWEL personnel after their operational uniflower to WH Division
has ended, it would be very helpful to us in planning the future
conduct of the ZRJANEL program if occasionally we could hav. a report
directly from each of these men personally, giving us their own
appraisal of their current utilization. In this regard ve vould
appreciate your view as to whether this would be fungible, within the
bounds of operational security, and whether it could bust be
accomplished by requesting written reports, or by oral de-briefinge
when these as are in the Washington area.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT:
Policy Concerning Guests at Award Ceremonies
!
1.
The Office of the Director has determined that when inviting
guests to award ceremonies, the Agency will be as liberal as possible
within the bounds of available space and security considerations since
one of the purposes of an award ceremony is to let the family, friends,
and associates of the recipient know that he has been honored.
2. In implementing this policy the points listed below will be
guiding criteria:
a. Any Agency employee who is a friend of a recipient
may come to ceremony, up to the limit of space available,
if the recipiem asks that he be present.
b. Any Government employee (who is not employed by the
Agency but who is witting of the recipient's employment) can
come so long as there are no operational security reasons that
would make his presence inappropriate.
B
c. Any friend who is not employed by the Government may
be invited only it is obviously desirable (Example-- A very
close old friend who stood in the relationship of "family" to the
recipient when subject had no immediate family). Friends who
are not employed by the Government normally would be
discouraged.

Chief, Western Hemisph Division
Recommuiation for Averis, Coss of Mr. Willion Robertson
and str. Grayson lynch
:
1. The purpose of this record is to rock cash words far
subject exployvos.
2. In recent paramilitary operations equinst Cuba, Mr. Lynch and
Mr. Robertson norved as operations officers of the Central Intelligence
Agency vessels and BARA 3 respectively. Both of these employsse,
in the course of extremely hazardous operations, repeatedly exposel
themselves to fire by opposing land, sou and air forces. Their fearless
and skilled leadership embled indigmous forms to conduct an exhibi
landing under the most difficult conditions, and their courageous determine
tion to loop their vessals in position to support the operations, althau
under heavy air attack, was in keeping with the best traditions of the
Asrican people at war. Furthermore, their repeated landings, in person,
on a hostile shore for the purpose of rescuing Cube curvivors of tho
inmoion force, was a demonstration of extraordinary valer. Their
ezesgylary conduct throughout the craft action was above and boyrad the
call of duty.
3. Military personnel perfonding in excibat in such a mammer would
be eligible for the highest decortlow for heroicc.
4. In view of the extraordinary heroion displayed by Mr. Robertson
and Mr. Lynch, I strongly recommend that they be awarded en appropriate
commntion, and, in addition, a cash banje umre of five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) arch.

sponsibility for these employees including compensation, operational

vision for operational duties. For administrative purposes, it is sug-
gested that WH Division assume these responsibilities for both Robertsva
and Lynch as of 1 June 1961.
8. Uns of the major considerations in the contract employment
of these two officers has been that their lack of association with the
Agency, thus far, permits their operational utilisation in circamstances

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Contract Negotiations with Mr. Grayston L. Lynch
1. After discussing the proposed contract for Mr. Lynch
with Messrs. Earman, Collins, Barnes, King, Esterline, and others
and obtaining their agreement that the proposed contract was a fair
one, I met with Mr. Lynch on the morning of 24 May 1961. I outlined,
in detail, to him at that time the many advantages accruing to him
through the new contract over the previous contract. Mr. Lynch stated
that he had not been fully aware of these benefits, that he was afraid he
had given the wrong impressions to us with regard to his salary demands,
and that he would be glad to sign the contract as offered.
2.
Mr. Lynch signed the contract later in the morning.
3, I also had advised Mr. Lynch that Colonel King and Mr.
Esterline had been requested to look into the possibility and desirability
of obtaining for him a bonus award because of his services on the Pro-
ject. I told him that they had agreed to look into this, that no promises
could be made, and that any such award was a matter entirely outside
the scope of his contractual arrangements and employment by this Staff.
Mr.
4. I then called Mr. Earmar and advised him of the above.
Earman indicated that he was sure the Director would be very pleased
to hear that a suitable agreement had been reached, but that the Director
also would undcubtedly raise the question of the bonus award at some
future date. I, therefore, undertook on behalf of Mr. Earman to re-raise
the question of the award with Mr. Esterline early in the week of May 29,
1961.

COMMENT
1. During our first discussions with IYNCH 10 May 1961, on the
question of salary, he stated that he would not accept a new contract
at the rite of pay ($9,500) of his present contract, because the
Director had promised that he would receive more; however, he would
not give us a figure that he would accept. Before the new contract
was written he was told that it would be for $11,000, and he voiced
no objection. After the contract was written and presented to him
for signature, he stated that he wanted $12,500, plus "hazardous
auty puy", and that he wanted to take the contract to the Director
for review.
b. At the time of his retirement, LYNCH was an Army Captain with
20 years service, and I understand that he was in jump status.
Remuneration for this service was about $9,425 per annum, including
all allowances. His present retirement pay is $291 per month, or
$3,372 per year, and I understand that he would be authorized to
retain this in addition to all pay and allowances received from an
Agency contract.

NOTE:
Since his precipitate meeting with the Director about 1730 hours
on 16 May 1961, Lynch has not been heard from. Presumably he returned'
to his home in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
On 18 May 1961, CA/PD had calls from the office of both WH/4
and C/WH asking if we knew of Lynch's whereabout, and whether we
had a record of his Fayetteville address. The answer to both
questions was negative. Eubsequently his address was located in
files and WH was informed.

23 May 1961
:
;
1. Lynch called today at 1200 noon. He said that he wanted to
let me know that he was back, and to find out what had been done about
his contract..
2. I told him that I had heard nothing since he had left. I said
that before he left we had rather leaned over backwards to write a
contract for him which he had not accepted; that instead he had taken
the matter to the Director, and that I had then been requested to deliver
a copy of the contract to the Director's office which I had done. I
said that I had then acted as a messenger boy only, and had not discussed
the matter at the Director's office, nor heard anything about it since.
3. Lynch said that he could fill me in from there. He said that
at the Director's office the contract had been turned over to the Director's
Executive Officer who was to review it and recommend a salary figure.
Lynch said that he had agreed to accept whatever figure the Executive
Officer recommended, and was told to call CA/C/PMG/Mr. Cox on his return.
4. I asked Lynch where he could now be reached, and he said that
he was at Bob Moore's office on X-8912.

follow up on his application dated January 1960 when he was interviewed

Lynch - provision of cover, Cinancial briefing, Rosesment and
evaluation, language aptitude test and possible language training, and
all basic Clandestine Operations training.
% Project ZRJSWELL further provides that administrative re-
sponsibility for these employees including compensation, operational
security etc. will be transferred to the Operating Division for such
periods of time as the employees are under the furisdiction of the Di-
vision for operational duties. For administrative purposes, it is sug-
gested that Wil Division assume these responsibilities for both Robertson
and lynch as of 1 June 1961.
8. On of the major considerations in the contract employment
of these two officers has been that their lack of association with the
Agency, thus far, permits their operational utilization in circumstances
where staff employees cannot participate, and their long range con-
tinued employment is, to a certain extent, dependent on their being
abot to maintain this posture. It is requested, therefore, that you
take every reasonable precaution to maintain their "deniable" status.
9. Since the CA Staff will once again become responsible for
these officers whenever such time may come that you no longer have
a reqiore,emt fpr tje,. ot wpi;d be veru,ic) altrecoated of tjos

vided tutorial or group training, according to their individual needs,

Rig, strong, outdoor type,. Has a long term interest in staff employment but will
accept contract. Though he prefers to take his family with him he will serve two
years overseas without them if necessary.
His first area of interest is Europe/Germany but he would serve where ever
assigned.
Looks like a good PM prospect for a training officer down below. Jungle warfare,
escape and evasion are his specialities.
Will contact us when he returns from special six month assignment in Laos.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
: CARDS Retirement of Mr. Grayston i.. Lynch,
05-14, 80D, on the Busts of malifying Domestic Service
1. This memorandum submka a recommendation for your approval in
paragraph 4.
2. After more than twenty years of active milkary service, Mr. Lynch
joined CIA in February 1961 to asetat in operations against the Cuban target.
He was awarded the Imoiligence bar for his participation in the day of Pigu
and related actlykties is the spring of 1961 Because of the sensitivity of his
duries in behalf of CIA, bis periods of foreign service were not recorded in
the usual rudanør, Prom August 1961 until june 1968 he was intensively involved
is the recruitment, training, administration and operational direction of a
large number of agents as well as the planning and direction of operations into
Cabe.
3. After reviewing his application for admission to CIARDS and corrob-
orating statements from Clandestine Service officers acquainted with his work,
the Clandesting Service Career Service Board concluded that Mr. Lynch's case
merits a recommendation for approval. It is our view that the demanda placed
sippa hiin were at least on a par with these horne by operations officers assigned
ØverbGSH.
6. It is, therefore, recommented that Mr. Lyach ise designated a
part in the CLA Retirement and Disability Systers on the basis of qualifying
Somestic service. If he is eccepted for CARDS, Mr. Lynch will apply for
by retirement.

3. In summary, Mr. Lynch's tasks were professionally
and personally more demanding than those of many of our
Operations Officers abroad. He had to apply clandestine techniques
and concepts in a highly volatile and difficult operational climate.
To admit him to the CIA Retirement System seems justified.

Grayston L. Lynch
Mr. Lynch's memorandum to
Director of Personnel, dated
22 June 1971.
I
i.
On the basis of what I can recall from the time I was
connected with the Bay of Pigs activity and my years with WH
Division thereafter, Mr. Lynch has stated his tasks correctly.
2.
Since the issue is whether Mr. Lynch's service in Miami.
could be considered equivalent to that of an Operations Officer over-
seas, the following might be considered:
Mr. Lynch had to operate clandestinely.
He used pseudonyms, safesites for meetings, non-
official cover.
He handled, trained and dispatched agents. He
debriefed them. He worked with them side by side.
He worked long, irregular hours (days and nights)
under unusual pressures and at personally inconvenient
and unappealing sites.
Mr. Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at
least, in real personal danger. (Our case officers abroad
do not often face such situations nor do they have to display
such courage.)

2. Mr. Lynch's memorandum dated 22 June 1971 requesting
that service at JMWAVE be considered as qualifying service
under CIARDS has been reviewed by individuals familiar with
his activities during the period noted. They state that his
memorandum is factual and accurately represents the situation
as it existed at JMWAVE.
2. The service described is considered comparable to
that performed overseas. WH Division concurs in favorable
action on his request should that be the recommendation of
the Board.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
: Recommendation for Approval of
Mr. Grayston L. Lynch as a Participant
in the CIA Retiremem and Disability System
: HR 20-50
:
1. It is strongly recommended that Mr. Grayston L. Lynch
be approved as a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability
System,
2. It is the opinion of the Special Operations Division that
the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the time he entered on duty
in February 1961 until early 1968 meet the spirit and intent of the
criteria for "qualifying service" as defined HR 20-50b. The lone
exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"
during the time involved except on a sporadic basis. This exception,
however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area
of operations. This location made it uniquely propitious to have
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base. There is
no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service was in the conduct
and support of covert operations which required continuing practice
of security and tradecraft procedures and which included, from
time to time, hazards to his life and health. It is also believed
that Mr. Lynch would be at a disadvantage in obtaining other employ-
ment because of the sensitivity of his past service as well as the
dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and
knowledge.
3. On the basis of the above and Mr. Lynch's unique per-

Mr. Grayston L. Lynch is a Career Agent who entered on duty
into the Agency in February 1961 and served in New Orleans, Louisiana
And Key West, Florida preparing WH Agent assets for operational
assignments. In March 1961 he left Key West, Florida aboard a covert Agency
vessel for Nicaragua where he assisted in the preparation of Agency vessels
and assets scheduled for operations into Cuba. in April 1961, he left
Nicaragua on a Agency vessel to participate in the landing operations in
the Bay of Pigs, Cuba. He was involved in armed action both at sea
and at shore during the four days of the invasion attempt and, from direct
Instructions from the DCI engaged in series of covert landings and opera-
tions into Cuba for several days following the invasion Landing. For this
action Mr. Lynch received the Intelligence Star.
an
Mr. Lynch
"apbsequently served as a paramilitary operations officer at Miami, Florida
until approximately June 1968. During this period he participated in
mumerous clandestine activities including agent training, parachute training,
weapons training, planned and directed 115 actual operations into Cuba,
HE ALSO
In the course of these earlier operational assignments, Mr. Lynch.
developed a psychosis which will not permit him to travel by air at
all nor by overland means for any lengthy period of time.
.
This has resulted in a medical hold being placed on Mr. Lynch
for any overseas assignment PCS or TDY. Since he is uniquely a field
special operations officer there are literally no departmental duties to which
he can be assigned. Since there is no suitable assignment available for
Mr. Lynch it is necessary to terminate Mr. Lynch's contract as a Career
Agent. Since he is eligible for Involuntary Retirement under CIARDS, Mr.
Lynch has made application for retirement effective 10 September 1971.
In view of Mr. Lynch's age, specialized skills, bong service in a uniquely
sensitive area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is
believed that a termination bonus at the time of his retirement is fully
warranted.
Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of a GS-14, step 5 with an
anmal salary of $23; 591. The proposed $10,000 termination bonus represents,
therefore, less than 42% of his annual salary or approximately 5 months
pay.
In connection with this, it should be noted that if he were being termina-
ted rather than retiring, he would be entitled by virtue of the provisions of
his contract to 90 days notice which would equal approximately $6,000 at
his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additional fringe benefits would
increase this figure.

.
Assuming no interruptions or changes of assign-
ment or status in the interim Mr. Lynch will complete
his currently scheduled Spanish language training in
mid-April 1971, Between now and then it is understood
that he will--on his own initiative and with whatever
assistance and encouragement we can properly provide--
make an effort to overcome his phobia of flying and
thereby, in due course, qualify medically for TDY or PCS
overseas field duty.
2.
carry
In view of Mr. Lynch's past history, however,
we cannot assume that he will be successful or will even
actively press to overcome his problem. In spite of his
career agent status and his operational performance
(Intelligence Star), we cannot,
we cannot, in all conscience,
him on SOD contract rolls indefinitely in an unproductive
capacity. He has completed all of the advanced and re-
fresher operations training necessary to qualify for
assignment now. He has not adapted well nor has he been
receptive to the kinds of headquarters duty assignments
open to him. He is a field paramilitary officer,
3. It is prudent, therefore, to begin contin-
gency planning now for his appropriate retirement and
outplacement into a job which will offer him both security
and personal satisfaction. His Spanish language training
should enlarge his horizons and opportunities,
We can
predict he will not, at least at first, take at all kindly
to the idea of retirement and relinquishing his Agency
association. He is emotionally involved, and identifies
himself as an Agency career field operations officer.
4. Please acquaint C/CSPS and DDP/JO with the back-
ground of this case, and together with them begin now to
plan for this contingency.

1. Mr. Lynch reported to C/SOD/Pers for interview on
5 December 1968. JMWAVE officials had notified him of the
medical decision and the purpose of this visit to arrange .
for a six month interim assignment period while he under-
Kocs appropriate treatment in Miami. We discussed' the
terms of the agreement which was made part of memorandum
of agreement and was signed by Mr. Lynch and C/SD/Pers.
-(attack)
2. Mr. Lynch visited WII Division for discussions re-
garding the interim assignment with Dave Philipe, Cuba Desk.
According to Lynch there was some difference of opinion
about the job at this point as to whether he'd be working
for JMCOBRA or for Cuba Dosk. He discussed this again with
WH officials who he says agreed that he would work on a
project for Mr. Philips unless Mr. Esterling had something
specific he needed him to do. A message was to be sent out
to this effect by WH Division.
3. Mr. Redmond of Agent Panel and Mr. Pollock SAS/OP
were advised of status of this case but did not need to see
Mr. Lynch unless he wished an interview. Pete Gaughan and
Dr. Robinson of OMS were contacted and Dr. Robinson pro-
vided the names of three cleared consultants in Miami area
for Mr. Lynch's referral. Mr. Lynch had a briof interview
with Mr. Holcomb to let him know that arrangements for the
six month interim assignment had gone well, he understood
the terms of the agreement, and hoped to return in six months
qualified for full duty including overseas and flying. He
then took care of his accountings in SOD/E&F and departed for
the drive back to Florida.
A.
Mr. Lynch appeared to be in good spirits on this
visit. He seemed to understand fully the terms of the six
month agreement and expressed appreciation for being given
this period of time to prove himself qualified for continued
employment. However, he was left with no doubt of our inten-
tions to terminate his contract at the end of the six month

Section C. attach a separate sheet of paper. During most of the period reported on, Subject
was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-
out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject
continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned
him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and con-
tinued to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of
a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally
by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees was of great interest
Subject was the only Station
to other agencies offices in the area. Suoject was
source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's
ability to maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period
because of the cutback in infiltration operations.
.
:
It could also be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this
Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly
professional intelligence officer and is, in many ways, an outstanding
one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though
his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as
well.
Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport
with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations,
is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his
assignments. He is a definite asset to WOFIRM.

SUBJECT
: CIARDS Retirement of Mr. Grayston L.. Lynch,
CS-14, SOD, on the insis of Qualifying Domestic Service
1. This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval in
paragraph 4.
2. After more than twenty years of active military service, Mr. Lynch
formed CIA in February 1961 to assist in operations against the Cuban target.
He was awarded the intelligence Star for his participation in the Bay of Piga
and related activities in the spring of 1961. Because of the sensitivity of bis
duties in behalf of CIA, his perkals of foreign service were not recorded in
the usual manner. From August 1961 until June 1963 he was intensively involved
in the recruitment, training, administration and operational direction of a
large mumber of agents as well as the planning and direction of operations imo
Cuba.
3. After reviewing his application for admission to CIARL3 and corrob
orating statements from Clandestine Service officers acquainted with his work,
the Clanlestine Service Career Service Board concluded that Mr. ! yach's case
merits a recommendation for approval. It is our view that the demands places
upon him were at least on a par with those borne by operations officers assigned
Overseas.
:
4. It is, therefore, recommended that Mr. Lynch be designateri a
participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System on the basis of qualifying
domestic service. If he is accepted for CIARDS, Mr. Lynch will apply for
Jisability retirement.

The lone
criteria for "qualifying service" as defined in i 20-50b.
exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"
during the time involved except on a sporadie basia. This exception,
however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area
of operations. This location made it uniquely propitious to have
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base.
no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service was in the conduct
and support of covert operations which required continuing practice
of security and tradecraft procedures and which included, from.
time to time, hasarus to his life and health. It is also believed
that Mr. Lyach would be at a disadvantage in obtaining other employ-
mont because of the sensitivity of his past service. as well as the
dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and
knowledge.
3. On the basis of the above and Mr. Lynch's uniquo per-

period is certainly equivalent to if not in excess of the requirements
for "creditable service abroad" and that if it had not been for a
geographical accident, this service would have been performed as
