the installation is that he is working on the house at the
request of the leasor, Washington real estate agent, Mr
request order supposedly maintains
TERE
Mr.Fu ES
the house for a New York lawyer in order to billet the latter's
transient clients. Case Officer MATT has engaged a maid to
clean up the house Mondays and Thursdays; however, she can be
told to stay away if Agent SSEER needs to do work there on
those days. It was also discreetly requested by the undersigned

recorders on a timely basis.
