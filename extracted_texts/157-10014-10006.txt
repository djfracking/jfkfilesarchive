Mr. Miler. There were very few of them, with the chiefs.
There may have been some.
Mr. Johnson. In those cases where there were such
operations, were they cleared with the DDO?.
Mr. Miler. Every single one of them was cleared with the
DDO and/or the Director and/or the Deputy Director.
Mr. Johnson. On important counterespionage operations,
could you tell us in more detail what the approval and clearance
process is?

Mr. Miler: Well, Mr. Angleton might want to qualify my
response, because obviously he was involved more in this
than I was, but there would be the two primary considerations.
One was a strictly CIA, counterintelligence or counterespionage

Mr. Johnson. But how do you respond to the criticism that
during your tenure and Mr. Angleton's tenure, too tight a
rein was kept on counterintelligence information, and individuals
in the field at the station level failed to get the information|
they needed to conduct their counterintelligence operation?
Mr. Miler. I would have to respond to that, Mr. Johnson,
and I could only respond to it in the context of specifics.
To my knowledge, and as practiced from my position as Chief of
Operations, whenever there was information which was judged
to be of significance, importance to a field station, that
field station was advised, unless there was some overriding
security source protection or other considerations, and the
decision then not to advise them was made at the Deputy
Director for Operations, as it is now called, or the Director
level.
There was, certainly, a very tight security, a very
tight compartmentation of counterintelligence information and
activities, which in my view was essential, and still is
essential, and will be even more essential in the future if

Council directives 53, 55 and so forth. The authority rested
in there. The approval would go to the then DDP, now Deputy
Director for Operations, the Deputy Director and/or the
Director.
The authorities, if it were
if it were a significant counterintelligence
or counterespionage case, the authorities, as I understood it
then, might require the Director to go outside the Agency to
the White House or the Attorney General and so forth.
Alternatively, we in the CI Staff might be directed to
coordinate this with the FBI. We would go to the FBI, explain
the case and so forth. The FBI would then go to the Attorney
the Department of Justice and get authorities, whatever
authorities they would require in order to pursue the investi-
gations, conduct the case, and do it according to whatever
stipulations that the Department of Justice would put on it
in order to either neutralize the suspected spy or agent, and/or
conclude the case by prosecution.
And I am talking now of primarily in terms of a serious
counterespionage case involving an American citizen.
Mr. Johnson. Mr. Angleton, do you know of any instances
where the CI Staff or higher authority within the CIA went
outside the Agency for approval for important counterespionage
operations?
Mr. Angleton. I know of cases, yes.

Mr. Johnson. And what would the approval system be?

the opposition a long time, but he had access to codes, and alsd
a great deal of deciphered material. So it was kicked back

take it over, the staff would take it over in its entirety.
And therefore, it meant that I called in Scotty and we
pulled together our team, we sent them abroad. We handled the
man in the field for a long time, and then eventually brought

In a case of that sort, the instruction was agreed upon

components.
Mr. Angleton.
With the added fact that we did not disclose

all of the facts, nor identity.
NOW,
this is important, because the individual was of
such prominence that the country concerned would be placed in
8 jeopardy diplomatically, the place where he was residing on
tour. There would be intensive investigations by his head-
quarters, and therefore we had to have covers. And so we
laid on in such a fashion that another service received infor-
mation regarding the target country that would induce them to
take certain observable actions, and then to spread the word
that the fellow had actually defected to another country, so
that their entire investigative thrust would be directed toward
that country.
Senator Hart of Colorado. So far we've talked about
process, and I think we'll keep going on it, and return to
it, but I would like to quantify some of this if I can.
First of all, by terms of definition, is the phrase or
the term "counterintelligence" interchangeable with counter-
espionage?
Mr. Angleton. It can be. I think technically counter-
intelligence is regarded to be all forms of investigative
activity, travel control, your data files, your dossiers, all

Out of that emerges a product, and one of the products is

of the FBI and a Director of CIA who are independent of one
another. You have to have some higher authority to whom you

The French original reaction to President Kennedy's letter
it was Soviet provocation, because this was at the stage
when France was making certain very sensitive agreements in the
atomic field and otherwise with the United States, and therefore
these allegations of penetration had a very direct bearing on
those negotiations. And so the General who came over was
totally prepared to believe this was provocation, but after
three days with the defector, in a meeting with Helms and
myself, he stated without any question that this man was 100
percent bona fide, because he could ask him those questions
right on the nerve of their secrets, and he got the responses.
Now, this defector also gave considerable data on the
status of penetration in the U.S. Government, documents which

that the defector in question was probably a provoca-

I would say they have not had any contact with him since 1965.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Why did Hoover make that
decision?
Mr.
Angleton. Well, among other things, this defector
wanted to have access to ongoing and to past cases with the
view that he had a tremendous amount of data that he could not
on,
relate to anything, but if he could see things that were going
then it would be meaningful to him in terms of what he had
to contribute. And I can take the example that, with another
allied service; immediately we brought them into it and he had
seen certain naval documents that dealt with infrastructure and
budget. This happened to be British.
In time they found the documents, and when they presented
them to him, he could identify those he had seen and those he

stated that he is bona fide, that they have never been able to
disprove a statement of fact that he has given as a statement of
fact, although they do not necessarily agree with his hypotheses.
That is the official statement.
Mr. Miler. May I just add two things on this?
First, Mr. Johnson, it goes back to the business of
compartmentation and not advising stations.
In the case Mr.
Angleton cited, the Paris station of the CIA was not told
anything about the information, and I think this is a very good
example of why you would not.
14
15
16
The second point I would like to follow up on is with
respect to this defector's information, there were five leads
which were passed to the FBI about penetration which involved
17
18
the CIA, for action. And one case was solved, but it was
solved only after the FBI officially sent us a letter saying
19
that they concluded that there was no substance to this
20
information.
21
They had to reopen the investigation
22
Mr. Angleton. And they also said: send it to the Army.
23
Mr. Miler. Yes, send it to the Army.
24
Now, they had to reopen the investigation when their

it was subsequently proved that he was a Soviet spy.
Mr. Angleton. Now, that individual had performed four
separate missions for Soviet intelligence since about 1938 or
'39.
One, he had been dropped in by the Soviets into Germany
on a mission with the WT set, to be captured in order to be

Second, he had moved from that into the penetration of

the Vassilov movement, which were the captured Russians in the

Third, he had penetrated the anti-Soviet forces in Germany
and then he was taken on by us in 1948 or '51 is when they
sent to renew his inks.
So he was with us from '51 to around '60.
13
14
Well, when the defection occurred, it was '62.
Mr. Johnson.
15
And Mr. Angleton, you used a term that is
unfamiliar to us:

Secret inks. In other words, the Germans
18
had captured a Soviet agent who had the same kind of
19
inks, and so therefore the inks were compromised, so they laid

on a large operation in Berlin and trained him in highly
sophisticated inks. And he is now residing not too far
distant from us.
But I might add that it is very important to note that while
we maintained that he is a Soviet agent, and the Bureau disagreed

in the Soviet intelligence, five people, Philby being one.
But from the time he knew about it, in actual fact it
was a ring that went into the twenties, because the purpose
of the penetration is simply not to be a passive figure; it is
to be an aggressive figure who creates situations for recruit-
ment. And that case has never been prosecuted. The man has
never confessed. He's never been broken. And yet it was in

Senator Hart of Colorado. Just so we can have an idea
of the magnitude of volume.

Mr. Miler. Well, for example, one, program that we had
going was an attempt to record penetration recruitment attempts

And over

so a year, just in that one small area of counterintelligence

The number of cases that we had would vary, but I would
say that from defectors in the last ten year, from Soviet
and Soviet Bloc defectors, we averaged around 150 cases a

Mr. Miller. What kind of volume did you put together in
your years in this activity? If this is the product of one
interrogation, what kind of volume did you put together to
make a workable capability?
Mr. Angleton.
Well, the first thing was to computerize
everything, and the second was to break it out case by case,

British cases, Australian cases, New Zealand cases, Dutch
cases, Finnish cases, French cases, Italian cases, all the

it should be kept within the Bureau. It should, be greatly

Mr. Lombard. All right.
Now, let me ask you this. In your experience were there
problems where the law enforcement impded the running of
counterintelligence or counterespionage operations domestically?
In other words, were there times when you would have liked to
have run an agent domestically for a longer period of time
in order to get the rest of the guys, but they said no, we've

And there is one added proviso, then, that

you can only run a first rate double agent if you have a

source superior to him that he is unaware of. In the war,

danger signals, questions of alerting him that he was under
control and so on was taken care of because of communications
intelligence.
When you don't have communications intelligence, then
the only other source that is superior is penetration, that is,
somebody who can read back from their headquarters how they are
in fact, absorbing the thrust of that double agent. And those
conditions do not exist for the Bureau or for ourselves.
Mr. Miler. Or for the military services, to run a lot
of double agents.
Mr. Angleton.
I mean, they do not have the superior
source of control over double agents.

Now, I have never seen the post mortem of the whole project
on the estimation, but I would assume that any estimator who
received information by letter or memorandum, hand-carried,
quoting Gromyko, would tend to discount the fact that the Arabs
were about to attack Israel where they would have to depend on
Soviet arms, and therefore the question of the Yom Kippur war
would be out of the question. In other words, that one report,
I give it as an example.
Now, independently a study group of the Joint Chiefs came
up with the whole question of Soviet disinformation, strategic
disinformation to put us off balance on our estimating process.
Now, in our own Agency we were heavily frowned upon for
raising these questions, that there was a strong element of
Soviet deception and disinformation that had been injected into.

is that that source who provided the Bureau with that infor-

to promote the best kind of a national program.
Senator Hart of Colorado.
Assume something about,
Mr.
Angleton mentioned earlier, about the tendency to sweep
penetrations under the rug in this country.
Has there been a pattern in the past that still prevails
of reluctance on the part of professional intelligence
officials as well as administration officials to admit that
we are susceptible to that?
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think there is no question that
there has been a tremendous dishonesty in facing up to hard
facts an intelligence.
10
11
12
I'll take the Yom Kippur war as an example.
As you know,
13
it was a complete failure in terms of prediction.
As I main-

in a primitive area, then God help you when you come into the
Bloc area, and I still hold by that conviction.

But in that case, a few days
a few days prior to the Yom Kippur war,
the FBI disseminated a report to the President, the Secretary
of State, Defense and the Director of CIA which purported to
and a very senior source
be a discussion between Gromyko

23
to the effect that they had given up on the Arabs, that they
would no longer support the Arays, they would no longer give

fact they had the draft notes ready for the recognition of

Israel.

it to have taken place, et cetera, et cetera.

Well, they were a hardworking group. We
There were many things we could have
taken on and I'll give you one example because it is still
pending, and it gets down to the question of penetration.
But when Philby was stationed in Washington, he was
given communications intelligence clearance so if NSA broke
6

into the Bulgarian traffic, he could go to his Soviet control

and tell them that we were reading Bulgarian traffic. A secret

traffic as a deception channel the moment they know you are
reading it. That becomes a powerful instrument in their
hands to deceive.
Now my point is this: No one has made an analysis from
the day that he was briefed on that particular traffic of why
the traffic continued for two more years and then gradual.
petered out of what was put into that traffic which, if you
took that and identified an item of deception that came from
the opposition, you then look at your own agent reports and
find what agents at the same time were fortifying that lie
or that piece of deception. And it would point a finger on
21 | agents who, in fact, were under control.
22
23
24
25
Now this is just one small exercise. HSA has preserved
every single piece of paper. In other words, there's literally
hundreds of thousands of pages of available material for such
an analysis, and I worked very closely with Lou Tordella.

Mr. Angleton.
I don't think anyone regards the lie
detector to be anything more than just another investigative
instrument. It does help in the sense that there are certain
people susceptible. They will in turn reveal something of their
past which they should have revealed, which, if you had
discovered independently, would have given you grounds to believe
they were penetration, but once the machine begins to find that

Mr. diGenova. Mr. Angleton, the point you made of the
lack of study of traffic which followed the deception in the
cable traffic, as I understand it, you're saying that there's
been no analysis that you're aware of since that time done of
of everything since then.
Mr. Angleton.
There's never been any analysis ever.
Mr. diGenova. Is the current research set-up which CI
staff now has which is oriented toward instant studies, quote

with wanting to achieve that sort of goal, like analyzing that

We trained teachers who went out, who in turn trained
other people. That was a three months course, if I recall.

We rean a seminar using the highest talent that we had and

for the most part it has been reasonably good, it has been

They

have not cooperated to the extent that the military commanders

Some of this has to do with priorities that are imposed
on the CIA representatives from Washington. Some of it has
to do with lack of manpower. Some of it has to do with the
fact that in the opinion of many of the CIA operatives, the
Army in particular, to a lesser extent the other services,

have not undertaken counter-intelligence activities which are
of a high enough level to justify the time and attention,
particularly of senior CIA representatives abroad.
It is, I think, also a bit of a problem because the
priorities of military counter-intelligence in many instances
do not parallel or support CIA's priorities. They have the
responsibility for the protection of their installations and
there have also been imposed on the military the requirement
to build assets, what we term double agents which the military
term controlled foreign assets, as a contingency for possible
deception use.
Traditionally, also, the CIA, and in recent years this
has been quite true, the CIA field operatives have wanted to
exploit military counter-intelligence assets for what is
termod aggressive positive intelligence or recruitment attempts
of the enemy agent or officer who was controlling the double
agent of the controlled foreign asset.
There has been traditionally a problem of coordination
between the military services, the CIA, and the FBI on double
agent operations.
I think overall this has worked reasonably well, given
the fact that in particular, for example, the system of
chain of command in the Army is a very confused one and is not
easy to put your finger on. There are various echelons and
reporting procedures and so forth.

Mr. Johnson.
Does the CIA have veto powers over military
proposed double-agents?
Mr. Miler. No, not the veto power.
Mr. Angleton. Well, it never really comes up to a veto.
But if we took a stand against it and supplied reasoning that
made sense, they would go along the way that we wanted. We've
never had a head-on collision.
Mr. Miler. There would oftentimes be differences in the
field, that would be presented through the proper channels,

From the counter-intelligence staff standpoint, in
particular what I was concerned with was an attempt to make
sure that there was a full integration.
You see, under the
operating procedures and the responsibilities, the military
services are required to advise the CIA of its activities,
counter-intelligence and so forth abroad. In turn, they
advise the FBI of their counter-intelligence activities and
so forth here in the United States.
So you have, when an activity here in the United States,

coordination and vice versa.
Mr. Angleton. I'd like to inject this. There is
concurrent jurisdiction since the double is usually an American
citizen. So regardless of where he is, we would always persuade
the Army or whoever it is, to notify the Bureau through their
17
own channel because you're dealing with Americans, so
18
geography is not really the important element..

From a counter-intelligence standpoint,

Mr. diGenova. I'd like to change the subject matter just
briefly.
Part of the responsibility of the CI research personnel
is to produce reports on various subjects which include current
analyses on proprietary companies used by foreign intelligence
services.
I would like to know whether or not either of you could
shed any light on the question of whether or not we have any
evidence that foreign intelligence services have established
and used proprietary companies in the United States?
Mr. Angleton. Well, there's one case that comes to mind.
I can't remember the details but I think that as a result of
it, one of our deputy directors had a big project with this
company and they dropped it because the Foreign Intelligence

intelligence function of any responsibility or significance
in Vietnam. That was a tragic failure on the part of CIA
and it goes back to the basic problem of the present management,
to answer your earlier question, the present management because
the present management of the CIA was involved in the decisions
which prohibited a good counter-intelligence effort in Vietnam.
Mr. Shea. In that paper that is before Dr. Kissinger,
are there any proposed control mechanisms that would act as
a filter so that the misinformation in a sense could not flow
back into the policy circles within the United States?

Mr. Angleton. Well, there wouldn't be. The kind of

on in counter-intelligence?
19
Mr. Angleton. We are not dealing in overt.
There may
20
be some overt things put out that support a document that was
21
given to a double who would pass it to KGB.
But if the man
22
22
24
25
is regarded to be an agent of the KGB, the KGB is not going to
publicize that document without having blown the alleged agent.
Mr. Shea. But they could work on it in their process
of disinformation to come back, and you would be caught.

Service had quite a penetration into it.
Mr. diGenova. Would that be the only instance of which
you are familiar that there was in fact knowledge of an operating
proprietary company run by a foreign intelligence service
within the continental United States?
Mr. Angleton. Offhand I can't say because the Office of
Security would be working with the Bureau, usually. I mean to

say that S&T are the most likely people to have contracts with
a number of contractors and companies. It would be Office
of Security's job.

12 just thought that maybe in the course of your counter-intelligence
13 function you may have discovered by whatever means that there
14
was in fact such a company operating in the United States
15 which was being used, not to contract with the Agency but to
contract or just do anything, whether it was a bookkeeping
firm or a law firm or anything, and was in fact engaged in
espionage.
Mr. Miler. Well, we've had a number in the past. We've
had a number of leads which were to the effect that Soviet

Mr. diGenova. Well, the staff has been given information

proprietary companies of foreign intelligence services, and
either that information is wrong or we just do not understand

one I mentioned, was the one where in this case it was French,

contracting with our STT people and therefore, our question
was rather a project for large sums of money of using this
company would proceed, and the decision based on our counter-
intelligence analyses was to drop the project.
Mr. diGenova. I'd like to ask the question.
We've been told that one of the benefits which occurs
to U.S. counter-intelligence when it focuses on bloc
countries
is the fact that these totalitarian regimes have a habit of
acquiring great amounts of information about their citizenry
and storing it, and that this is, on occasion, accessible to s

and makes them somewhat vulnerable as a result of that.
Turning the coin around a little bit and looking at our-

country which put in a central location large amounts of
'
information about individual citizens and large groups of
citizens, making us vulnerable to penetration in terms of
information, more vulnerable in terms of penetration by
foreign counter-intelligence services?
Mr. Angleton. Vulnerable in what sense?
Mr. diGenova. Getting information about us, period,
which I understand is one of the key goals of counter-intelligence,
finding out what the other side is doing.
Mr. Angleton. You mean surreptitiously getting it from
us or officially getting it from us?
12
13
14
15
Mr. diGenova. Both. The fact of the matter is the
16
information exists and it's vulnerable for them to have it,
:
17
is it vulnerable for us to have it?
18
19
Mr. Angleton. Well, I wouldn't put it down as vulnerable
because when anyone makes a request on you for information,
1
20
21
the first question is why. So the burden is on them to justify
that they have a counter-espionage reason for asking for that
22
information.
And in the bulk of the cases you'll find that the

25
are doing your work for you.

so we start an investigation as to Bulgarian antecedents or
anything dealing with Bulgaria, et cetera. And if it's
justified, we give them the information.
Mr. diGenova. Well, I don't think, Mr. Angleton, that's
not what I'm getting at.
We as a country are amassing properly, quote, unquote,
11 large amounts of information about ourselves through the use
of computer systems.

That's right.
The CIA tells us that that is one of the
things they like so much about foreign countries, because the
totalitarian regimes have the tendency to amass large amounts
of information about their citizenry and when we penetrate
and get that information, that helps us.
My question is when we do that, when we centralize the
information by using our own computer systems, no matter where
it is, do we help them?
And in this regard I would note that in 1970 the Inspector
23 General's report on the question of cover noted that the fact
that credit bureaus in this country were amassing so much
information about people, including CIA personnel, that it

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think, no question, it's the
Soviet bloc services that represent the major threat because
they are really a small, they are directly subordinated to the
central committee and to the basic objectives, as I've seen them
all my life to the change and balance of military power.
Further, that practically all intelligence operations more
and more have political objectives, and I think it is the fact
that since '59 they have elevated the Cuban intelligence and
9 all of the other bloc services to a very high degree of
efficiency, that they are coordinated and they work as equals.
And I think that is the major threat, that is the
inability of the FBI by lack of personnel and manpower to be
able to cover these people. There isn't the minimal coverage.
The people they cover are people who have been "identified,"
and I defy anyone to have a list of identified agents in this

Now that is the legal side of it. Now the larger part
of it is the illegal, where there's been little or no success.

The only one that has really come out is the Abel case, which
Hayhanon
we handled through Hahánnan. And then there was one or two
minor ones.
But that is a whole program of bloc activity, and
according to one of the best sources we had, his view was that
the illegals would be placed primarily in airports, docks,
factories, and they give a whole listing. And these are the

the major foreign covert action program directed against this
country in your lifetime and experience in the Agency?

there are not successes, It's just happenstance.
Mr. Epstein. It's disruption of our defense effort?
Is that what you're speaking of now? Their goal being
disruption of this country's defense effort?
G-4p
Mr. Angleton. Well, they have many assignments. But
the point is they have also the sabotage-assassination part,
which is totally apart from the body politic of the KGB, and
it raises questions in everybody's mind when there is sabotage
and all other kinds of activities and you cannot find the
culprits.
One defector stated that he believed that the computer
fire they had in the Pentagon several years ago was KGB. lie
was KGD. But he stated in effect that he thought that was
one of their operations.
Scotty?
Mr. Miler. The major threat to the U.S., I think, is
based on the fact, as we referred to earlier, as this should
affect counter-intelligence, the national counter-intelligence
effort, is to have your national counter-intelligence focuse

electronic experts who had made a very sensitive, Top Secret

years behind us.

For example, one of the most famous of the disinformation

Mr. Epstein. How about campaign financing?
Mr. Angleton. I don't think it figures unless it would
be the CP.
But just to add one last point to this question of the
threat, it is my view, seeing Angola and seeing the unwilling-
ness of this country to resist or to define its purpose, or
to deal fairly with its allies, that within a period of four
years there will be a form of confrontation on an unpopular
issue between the Soviet bloc and the United States in which
we will back down. We will then go into our supreme isolation,
because in December of '61, when this Soviet defected and he
had read the political action programs, he spelled out in
detail that one of the primary purposes of the reorientations
was that all intelligence operations or political objectives,
and the main political objective was to reaffirm the United
States as the main enemy, to achieve its isolation and to achieve

Mr. Miler. I think one important point here that I

would like to make is that what has happened, in my opinion

what has happened in counter-intelligence in the Agency and
I
6
the so-called aggressive operations, the increase in double

agent operations and so forth and the dispersal of the centralized
counter-intelligence is not going to produce a counter-
intelligence program within the CIA
which is going to focus
on attempting to provide the government, policy-makers and
so forth, with the kind of information and analytical product
that is necessary if we're going to have a successful counter-
intelligence.
Mr. Johnson. I would like to thank the witnesses, and
unless Senator Schweiker has any questions, we will adjourn
for five minutes.
Is that acceptable?
Thank you very much.
Sonator Schweiker. Thank you very much.

Mr. Johnson. So both of you left the CIA in December, 1974.
Since that time we understand there have been some changes
in how counterintelligence is conducted at the CIA.
Could you give us some understanding of those changes?
Mr. Angleton. I would like to defer to Mr. Miler on this,
if I may?
Mr. Miler. Yes.
My understanding is there have been some rather fundamenta
9 and substantive changes which are a continuation, actually,
of changes that were made first in 1973, in July of 1973
when many of the centralized counterintelligence functions were
decentralized and reallocated to different components of the

collection and covert action operations; the oversight on
intelligence operations, and oversight on counterintelligence
operations in the field were decentralized. Research and

the application of historical cases,
Could you be more specific on these changes,
for example, in research?
Mr. Miler. In research, the research is now, as I under-
stand it, pretty much on a case by case basis, not in an
overall perception of worldwide or national counterintelligence

There
is little application of analytical and assessment work to the
overall role of foreign intelligence and security services in
political action.
There have been some fundamental changes in operational
philosophies stemming from an application of what is termed
management by objectives as it is being applied in the CIA to
operations, and there is a has been a distinct change in
some of the attention which has been previously placed on the
problem of penetration from foreign and particularly hostile
intelligence services into the American community.
And there has been a very, very substantive change in
the perception and the conduct of counterintelligence in that
there has been what is in my view a very serious erosion
20
21
of security and compartmentation of operations, and leakage
of information which has not been to the best interests of

a national counterintelligence effort.
Mr. Johnson. So, from going from a rather centralized
apparatus to a decentralized situation, the dangers of penetration
have increased.
