DATE: 21 February 1957
1. With regard to the contents of reference dispatch, which were
communicated to the Subject, VAIVADA has no objections and is agreeable
to conversion to the career agent category as described therein.
2. VAIVADA requests, however, that the plans already proposed for
acquisition of U.S. citizenship by his wife be carried through. He, and
the Station, believe that this step will provide him with greater security
in non-official cover assignments. In addition, such action will minimize
the red tape he must cut each time he has to obtain new visas for himself
and family.
3. The Station will submit a new request for VAIVADA's training
several months prior to the desired new training dates.
