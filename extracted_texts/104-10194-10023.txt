PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE
The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding
employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate
data on all personnel. The new systern will aid in implementing Agency
policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel
with desired education and experience for vacancies which may occur. It
is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics
for planning and management purposes.
2.
The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those
factors in which the Agency is interested. Although the information is, in
a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitted by you, it
is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize
those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves
to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.
3. Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as
thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative
Officer within the time allotted.

MEMORANDUM FOR: E. Howard Hunt, DDP/BUR/CA
SUBJECT
Service Computation Date
"
In your memo of 24 February 1969 to the Director of Personnel
you requested a classification of your Service Computation Date,
since various records had indicated three different dates.
date should be 7 September 1944.
The
This date reflects the following service:
Economic Cooperation Administration-
13-
17 May 1948
Foreign Service-
-
08 June 1948 22 days
08 mo., 11 days
09 June 1948 - 19 February 1949
U.S. Naval Reserve-
->>>
19 August 1940 13 October 1942 02 yr., 1 mo., 25 days
U.S. Amy-
06 October 1943 - 08 January 1946
Agency (Staff and Contract)-
08 November 1949 to Present
02 yr., 3 mo., 3 days
Total non-Agency time amounts to 5 years, 2 months and 1 day.
When this time is subtracted from your Agency EOD date the result
is 7 September 1944.
The confusion has resulted from conflicting dates arrived at
in previous attempts at classification.

SEGRET
This office is charged with arriving at SCD's for leave
purposes. Prior to your retirement the Retirement Operations
Branch will obtain records from the Civil Bervice Commission ·
verifying that service which is creditable for retirement purposes.
In this regard let me point out that the date which we have….
just verified contains a period of service that is potentially
creditable for retirement. Your military records show an en-
listment in the Army as 6 October 1943. However the form later
states active duty from 22 November 1943 to 8 January 1946. Ir
you have any questions regarding the computation please call me
on X7165. Questions regarding creditable service for retirement
purposes can be referred to Murray Benthall on X3257.

Howard E. Hunt, GS-15, Employee
Number 013842, DOB: October 1918;
EUR/CA; Career; Service Designa-
tion: D.

OVER-ALL RATING
:
Strong
1.
Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA In
July 1968. His performance in this position has been con-
sistently Strong.
2. From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's.
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the past two years of many long established
projects. He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of
European realities and evolutions. While concerned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the
recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific
action in the field. In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
and persistance and vigor in helping get action underway.
3. There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business. The
first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, an excellent awareness of realities in the field and of
the practical limits imposed by the field priorities, manpower,
and the requirements of security.

4. Secondly, Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS
a continuing participation in the work of that staff in its
two aspects: the countering of Soviet political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party
operations. He has contributed to the definition of these
interests and worked closely with the Branches in identi-
fying opportunities. Neither of these areas are of a nature
that has made for prompt common understanding between Head-
quarters and the field. Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of
major assistance in furthering this understanding.
5. Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,
studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra-
tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
and studies which have derived from that participation.
.
6. In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has
reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination. He has had
to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take
with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch
people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting
business done at Headquarters.
7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA
officer's duties within the Division.

You have every reason to feel great pride

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:
Although I would not differ from the evaluative
comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his
over-all pérformance as highly PROFICIENT rather than
Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade. This
officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems,
beyond his control, which have tended to dull his cutting
edge just enough to be noticeable.

Subject has performed in a manner quite consistent with his long and broad ex-
perience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence. His senior grade, his special
expertise in the field of propaganda and publication and his very high intellect
have contributed to the division's operations in the public media field a sharp
focus, an economical concentration of money and effort and a consequently
heightened impact. In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in
a moribund clandestine asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under
his personal direction, that it is one of the most effective activities of its kind.
Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from
visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer-agent rapport. Subject's
personal handling of this operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project
prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically
welcomes.
Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one
to two professional staffers under official cover and three professional career
employees under unofficial cover. The fairness and precision of his management
has patently won their respect and inspired their performance.

Mr. Hunt continued to direct the propaganda activities of the DOI Division
in a superior professional manner until 12 October 1964, when he was incapacitated
by illness. On his return from sick leave on 7 December, he was detailed to the
Office of the DD/P and officially transferred to that office on 28 February 1965. DO
Division can only view this transfer with considerable regret.
Mr. Hunt, by virtue of his personal background, has a unique flair and com-
petence in the propaganda field. Over and above, but complementary to these special
skills, his extensive experience in the CS, his sound judgment, high and creative
intellect and other commendable personal qualities contributed significantly to the
successful prosecution of DO's efforts in the media field. These same attributes,
attest, in my judgment, to his suitability for employment as a Station Chief or in any
other position requiring broad knowledge of and skill in the CS business. He is very
cost conscious and an effective supervisor. He enjoys the respect of all personnel
under his supervision, official and non-official, as well as that of all his co-workers
in the Division and Station.

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:
SEGRET
Although I would not differ from the evaluative
comment on this officer, I would be inclined to rate his
over-all performance as highly PROFICIENT rather than
Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade. This
officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems,
beyond his control, which have tended to dull his cutting
edge just enough to be noticeable.

Strong
Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in
July 1968. His performance in this position has been con-
sistently Strong.
1.
2.
From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the past two years of many long established
projects. He has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of
European realities and evolutions. While concerned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the
recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific
action in the field. In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
and persistance and vigor in helping get action underway.
3.
There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business. The
first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on-going CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, an excellent awareness of realities in the field and of
the practical limits imposed by the field priorities, manpower,
and the requirements of security.

4. Secondly, Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS
a continuing participation in the work of that staff in its
two aspects: the countering of Soviet political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party.
operations. He has contributed to the definition of these
interests and worked closely with the Branches in identi-
fying opportunities. Neither of these areas are of a nature
that has made for prompt common understanding between Head-
quarters and the field. Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of
major assistance in furthering this understanding.
5. Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,
studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra-
tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
and studies which have derived from that participation.
6.
3
In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has
reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination. He has had,
to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take
with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch
people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting
business done at Headquarters.
7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA
officer's duties within the Division.

If there are any areas of weakness in his performance it is only because
his potential is so considerable. For example, it is possible that the staff and
planning aspects of his job could receive more attention although, admittedly.
there is a large grey area between the responsibilities of the CA Staff and the

Dear Howard:
I have taken so long in answering your letter
5th because of the careful consideration given to your request
by all concerned, particularly as we have not had the problem
before.
I am sorry to tell you that our answer is in the negative
although we have taken every approken we can think of to comply
with your wishes. Very simply, the problem is as follows:
The statute States--
At the time of redeem, any marbled
participant may elect to receive a reduced
annuity and to provide 10s an annuity payable
loe
to his wife or her husband, commencing on
the date following such participant's death..
(emphasis added).
Our regulation on the subject repeats the
language of the statute above and in addition
states--
A participant may not change his election
under this provision.

HOWARD HUNT

Potomac, Maryland 20854.,
May 12, 1971.
The Honorable
Lawrence R Houston,
General Counsel,
The Central Intelligence Agency,
Washington, D. C. 20505.
Dear Larry:
I thoroughly appreciate the thought
and study you gave my problem, and while your find-
ings are disappointing to mc, I must regard chem as
definitive.
:
Reflecting on the statute, however, I
find myself wondering whether such irrevocable limi-
tation on personal choice is, first, in the public
interest, and second in the interest of annuitants
whose personal circumstances and civil status are
subject to unanticipated change. This could be the
subject of an interesting class action challenge in
which, I imagine, more than a few annuitants would
be eager to join.
All that aside, I'm most grateful for
your efforts to help me once again.
Cordially,
Harvind

We considered the possibility of a waiver of the reg
tion but ran into another probleme The act specifically
provides that the Director mby prescribe rules and equilib
but continues with the language males and regulations
are to become efferve after approval by the chalerman and
ranking minority members of the Armed Services Committees
of the House and Senate." The regulations as presently entered
were specifically beviewed by those Committees and approved
in their present form.
Looking back into the legislative history of the net, we
believe it is clear that the Committees desired out-
form as closely as possible to Civil Service retirement, which
definitely would not permit a change of election after retiremen
porn
There does not appear to have been any administrative error or
misunderstanding at the time you retired and made your election,
therefore, we have been unable to find any basis for making the
change you request.
I think you know me well though to agree that I like to
stay as flexible in the law as I possibly can, but this seems t
be one case where we are bound by specific provisions with no
leeway to meet the requests of individual employees.
Sincerely,
Laviny

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Mr. E. Howard Hunt
t
15
1. On 21-June 1972 Mr. Robert Tegethoff, INR, Department of
State, informed Mr. James Franklin, Chief, CCS/OCB, that the
Department of State had received press inquiries in regard to Mr.
E. Howard Hurt's service with the Department of State. INR had
arranged for withholding any Department of State replies until CIA
had been consulted. Mr. Hunt's cover record showed that he was In
Integrated Department of State status in Mexico from 1950 until 1953
and in Montevideo from 1957 until 1960. He also had nominal domestic
Department of State cover from 1966 until he retired in 1970. Upon
retirement, Mr. Hunt was opened up "as a CIA employee back to
EOD in November 1949.
2. In the absence of both Messrs. Osborn, Director of Security,
and Geiss, Deputy Director, I discussed the State Department request
with Mr. Leo Dunn, Acting Deputy Director of Security for Personnel
Security. He concluded that everything considered, the Department
should say that Mr. Hunt was assigned to the Department while in
integrated status but, when pressed, not deny his basic CIA status.
While trying to clear this line with the ADDP, Mr. Geiss called and
at the end of our discussion, cautioned that any guidance to the
Department of State in regard to Mr. Hunt should be cleared with the
DCI
3. I then talked to Mr. Sam Halpern, EA/DDP, to determine
the whereabouts of Mr. Meyer. He recommended that I talk to both
Messrs. Meyer and Colby who were in the OPPB think tank.

4. As I was leaving my office, Mr. Tegethoff called Mr.
Franklin a second time to say that in the evening of 20 June 1972,
Mr. John King, Department of State's Press Office, and Mr. John
Unumb of CLA had discussed press inquiries in regard to Mr. Hunt
which were made to the Department of State in the afternoon of
20 Jane 1972. These inquiries had particular reference to Mr. Hunt's
blography In WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA showing him as Department of
Stare employee since 1968 and listing his office at the Department of
State. Messrs. Unumb and King agreed the press should be laformed
that he was not on the State Department's payroll during the period.
Mr. Unumb confirmed this arrangement when I called him and said
that he had added that Mr. Hart retired in good standing from CIA
in April 1970. I also cleared the proposed guidance with Mr. Ted
Shackley, Chief, WH Division.
5. I then saw Messrs. Colby and Meyer, outlined the Department
of State's request and our proposed reply that Mr. Hunt, during his
Integrated service in Mexico and Montevideo, was assigned to the
Department of State. This information would not be volunteered by the
Department of State, and Mr. Hunt's basic status as a CIA employee
would not be denied if raised by members of the press. Messrs. Colby
and Meyer agreed that this was the only feasible line to take. I then
asked Mr. Colby whether additional clearance from the DCI was required.
He replied that it was not, and that he would brief the DCÍ.
6. I informned Mr. Geiss of Messrs. Colby's and Meyer's decision
and then called Mr. Tegerboff and provided him the agreed guidance.

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 - 31 March 64
Section C (Continued)
Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in
carrying out his responsibilities. These were best demonstrated when
he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast-
ing project, to establish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,
immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles
precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.
Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to
FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA
activities, a practice consistent with his habit of seeking maximum benefit
for every dollar spent in time, effort or cash.

ECONOMIC COOPERATION ADMINISTRATION
SPECIAL MISSION TÓ AUSTRIA
November 19, 1948
Mr. Averell Harriman,
U. S. Special Representative,
Economic Cooperation Administration,
Hotel Talleyrand,
Paris, France.
Dear Averolls
On the point of departure from Vienna, I want to record.
with you my appreciation of the services rendered me in this
Mission over the last few weeks by Mr. Howard Hunt, Information
Officer, temporarily assigned here from your staff.
Hunt has not only carried the duties and responsibilities
of Information Officer, pending appointment of Mr. Wilson to
that post, but he has, additionally, carried a large load for me
in connection with the Ross murder incident. He has acted as a
personal aide, to all intents and purposes, at a time when,
understaffed as this Mission is, we were faced with a concentra-
tion of vitally important work in connection with our normal
Mission operations.
I think Huat has shown a broad-gauged grasp of what ERP is,
what ECA is, and what Information work in behalf of both should
bo. Besides this, he is the right kind of person to have in this
great ECA undertaking. I hope you will be able to keep him and to
give him opportunities to express his abilities fully.
Sincerely,
Westacore Will
Westmore Willcox
Chief of Special Mission

23. C At the request of the Allied High Commissioner for Austria,
Lt. Gen. Geoffrey Heyes, I was placed on assignment in
Vienna to the ECA Special Mission for the purpose of writing
and producing an official U.S. documentary film directod at
the Anti-communist elements of Austria, and specifically
toward Austrian labor groups. The film has received wide
distribution in all Allied zones except the Russian Zone,
and its showing at the Vienna Fair, I have been informed,
was the subject of an official Russian protest.
