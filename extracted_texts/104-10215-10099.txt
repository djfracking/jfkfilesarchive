CP-A-155 Part II
13. Subject cannot be expected to devote any major portion of his time to
our work until he has built up his cover and is oriented in his new
surroundings. Although fluent in the lanuage, he will probably en-
counter a good deal of new terminology.
14. Subject has entered into a tentative oral contract to perform services
for us for a salary of $50.00 per month. This can be made into a written
contract at any time.
15. Subject's tentative continuing project is outlined in paragraph 2 above.
16. Subject should be capable of initiating his om projects.
PAYMENT
17. Starting in February 1940, it will be necessary to pay subject $50.00 11.s.
dollars per month as indicated in paragraph 14 above.
18. Subject has been told that if his services prove satisfactory, he can ex-
pect an increase in salary. No specific amount was discussed.
19. It is contemplated that this station may be required to my certain travel
expenses for Subject. If done, this will be charged against Project
Development.
20. No cost of purchase of information is involved at this time.
21. Subject's superiors regard this man as highly dependable. He has had con-
siderable experience in writing reports and has remarked that his two
principal criticisms of intelligence reporting as he has observed it in
this area is that the reporting is inclined to be sensational rather than
factual and that most people have nothing to report other than that which
the opposition is willing that they receive. He should have a fair con-.
cept of security. However, Jeneral security in this area is very lax and
he may have subconscious bad habits.
22. In view of his background, Subject should only be good in semi-covert work.
23. If this man is kept under cover he might eventually effect a penetration of
scholastic or parlor-pink circles. It is presumed that this would be on
a low level.
24. This individual could easily be recruited for a full-time job with our organi-
zation. However, it is believed that more is to be gained by starting him
off in this manner, perhaps giving hin periodic schooling and gradually in-
creasing his activities and responsibilities.

1. Mr. Ross L. Crozier, a Career Agent assigned to
Special Affairs Staff, has tendered his resignation from
the Agency. In accordance with the terms of his contract,
he gave 90 days notice making his termination effective
close of business 28 November 1963.
2. Subject's employment history was established by
Mr. Biladeau of the Central Cover Staff in conjunction with
the Outplacement Branch of the Personnel Operations Division.
Mr. Crozier was advised that he should indicate employment
by CIA from his EOD date (1 June 1949) through the above

ment to the Outplacement Branch of the Personnel Operations

TERMINATION SECRECY OATH
I,
Ross L. Crozier
am about to terminate by
association with the Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with
the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which
concerns the present and future security of our country.
unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws
I am aware that the
of our government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence
sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR,
WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS,
AS FOLLOWS:
1. I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or other-
wise, any information relating to the national defense and security and partic-
ularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods,
personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, including, but not limited
to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government
employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the
Organization or his authorized representative.
2. I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims I may have
against the Organization or our government which may in any way necessitate the
disclosure of information described herein. I have been advised that any such
claims will receive full legal consideration. In the event, however, that I am
not satisfied with the decisions of the Organization concerning any present or
future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satisfac-
tion without prior written notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance
with such legal and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.
3. I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified or un-
classified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility of the
Organization, having come into my possession as a result of my duties with the
Organization or otherwise.
4. During my exit processing and during my period of employment with the Organ-
ization I have been given an opportunity to report all information about the
Organization, its personnel, and its operations which I consider should receive
official cognizance. Hence, I am not aware of any information which it is my
duty, in the national interest, to disclose to the Organization, nor am I aware
of any violations or breaches of security which I have not officially reported,
except as set forth on the reverse side of this sheet or on other attachments.

12 July 1963
On qualifications there just aren't any in the
civilian or industrial category The university work in
Economic Sciences was real, not cover, but interrupted_before
I got the degree (5 years). However, I specialized in Economic
Theory, which when considered that I studied in three Latin
American Universities (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cuba) does
give me some qualification as a "Latin American Consultant".
The classification as "Research Analyst" is cover except
for that part of which the "Latin American" background could
be utilized.
Although I have had no business experience in an administrative
or executive capacity, I am sure that I could qualify in that
work, especially if it were in connection with Latin America or
utilizing my Spanish language ability.
As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no
comercial "counterpart" for the type of work I have been doing
for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the
"local outplacement" man first, on the possibility that there is
a local opportunity, but the opportunities in the Latin American
field whill be greater.
(In addition to the above, I might add that I have performed
best in "operations" work"- which involves planning, direction and
coordination.)

1. The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can
provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an
ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement. NOEMAYR's tentative ETD of 1 January
1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in
addition to other departure preparations.
2. NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary
correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities
for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of
PBFRIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the
necessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the
Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been
received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian
clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers
to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for
the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant
Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four
months of the date issued.
3. An early reply to this dispatch would be appreciated.

1. Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA's early TDY to Headquarters.
were held between the agent, the field case officer, and the Chief of Station on
13 and 14 January, as a result of which it became clear that, unless Headquarters
has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be advisable that the conten-
plated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's current contract year,
i.e., the period of July-August 1957.
2. A number of important personal problems dispose VIAVADA to accept the
delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue from such a postponement. His
wife is sufficiently ill at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recom-
mend that she not travel now. His children would have to lose a semester of
their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he
and family have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would
have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed winter clothing
for himself and his family which does not seem justified for a period as short
as two months. Owing to several routine but time-consuming inquiries being made
by the local ODACID in connection with his wife's visa application, there is no
guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957.
3. On the operational side, in spite of the original Station request that
VAIVADA's travel be expedited, advantages now of delaying his TDY outweigh the
disadvantages, from the Station's point of view. Most important of these is that
two promising sources currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCH-
6 and AMPHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been
the person working most closely with them. To substitute him with a relatively
untrained cut-out at this point in their development is not desirable. On the
basis of the original proposed timing of his trip the Station has however proceeded.
with firm plans to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODARCH-1 and AMBI-
VALENT-5, to a reliable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether
VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-
level sources off VAIVADA's hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new

development of specific student Communist and Youth targets the Station has
already lined up. Both these sources have passed through an initial period of
training and have fully demonstrated their reliability and ability to continue
to perform effectively via a cut-out. In handling a half-dozen sources; as
VAIVADA has been doing, he reached the limits of reasonable span of control and
has not had the time to give to such new developmental work which is his forte
and upon which it would be most desirable to have him concentrate rather than
upon the mere routine handling of relatively tested sources.
In
4. Delaying VAIVADA's TDY as proposed herein would place VAIVADA at
Headquarters at or about the end of his current contract year, where he would be
immediately available for personal consultation regarding his future assignment
whether or not it is decided that he return to Habana or sent to a new post.
this connection the Station wishes parenthetically to point out its definite
interest in having VAIVADA reassigned to Habana for at least one additional year
if possible, and to note that VAIVADA has expressed a personal desire to that
effect.
5. Regardless of the decision as to timing of his travel, VAIVADA is
proceeding to change his residence. He will try to obtain a suitable house
possessing a telephone, something he has lacked heretofore, thereby carrying
through plans previously reported to Headquarters in paragraph 6 of HKH-A-3144.
6. Therefore, unless there exist truly urgent reasons for VAIV: DA's
travel to Headquarters prior to about July 1957, it is recommended that his
trip be postponed until that time.

SPECIAL NÓTE
Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of odministrative and support
personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected
that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section 8. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

(1) Subject will commence by serving as cutout for
Hugger, who has always held out great promise but
never been properly developed or directed.
(2) In the labor field, the principal and only target
at the moment is the only labor federation, the
Rerum Rovarum.
fat
(3) Subject will represent our only contact among the
student groups and certain allied "intellectual"
societies. Any activity in this category showing
promise may subsequently become an assigned target.
C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel
The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to
subject individual, is hereby discarded. He will
hereafter be designated by San Jose Station Symbol
No. 26. For essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365,
Part I and II.
D. Control and Contact
Judging by Subject's background data and his already
demonstrated cooperative attitude, we do not feel that
control and direction of his activities will be any
problem. Contact, owing to the nature of this project,
will be frequent and carried out in any convenient
manner, generally in one or the other of our respective
homes.
E. Cover
Subject had planned to and has established himself in
Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any
contact with this office. He has a Costa Rican wife,
attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal
life which any assignments from us will not disrupt.
Our only anticipated problem is that of moutine contacts
between Subject and the Chief of Station. That matter
will be handled with care and discretion.

DATE:
21 December 1948
1. The proposal that the Panama Station activate an agent project
in conjunction with San Jose has been studied by this headquarters and
elicits the following comment. It is felt that nothing can be gained
from a cumbersone joint operation of this project that cannot be obtained
from a simple agent project controlled exclusively by the San Jose Station.
If San Jose wishes to amil itself of these top man as an independent
project, that station is authorised to proceed with its preliminary
-planning for submission to this headquarters for final approval.
2. In the event San Yoop decides to use Hydropathic, that station
is directed to become more familiar with his capabilities before entering
into a formal acrescent re tasks and salary. His practical experience
and educational background are not outstanding and the mere fact that
he has had duty with the J. S. ray in an intelligence capacity in no
sense automatically qualifies him for our work. It is suggested that
the San Jose Station initiate its relations with Hydropathic by using
him as a cutout in\an endeavor to test his abilities. If his value is
proved and his Costa i can associations appear to be in a position to
give him high-level intelligence information, then come to a formal agree-
ment with regard to his future work in an intelligence gathering capacity.
The San Jose Station is directed to give him no encouragement at this tis
with respect to a later full-time position with this organisation.
AB X-

3. In summary Hydrocyst is to sever his formal connection Ed th
Hydrocyst I and is to have no knowled;e of Hydropathic with regard to
the latter's work for Hareer. [etails on the procedure to be followed
in Hydropathic's relation with Hydrocyst I are the responsibility of the
San Jose Station and are to be submitted to this beadquarters for final
approval before any formal commitments are made. The Panama Station is Destina
directed to forward to San Jose all the documents in its files that are
considered pertinent to the development of this project.

Reference: HillL-A-2577 201-32773
Action Required: Pouch Views on Proposal Contained herein
1. Handquarters looks favorably upon references proposal to grant staff status
to Arter 0. VAIVADA. It has been deteralged horever that such status is
virtually out of the question for subjent so long as his wife remains an
alian. It has been further determined that the wife can acquire U.S. citi-
sinship within a span of 15 days in the so desires and is willing to come
to the U.S. for that parion of time, most of which would have to be spent
in the acquarters brea. There are certain other basic requirements such
as a fair knowledge of English and an ability to pass routine citizenship
8X8A9. Kone is felieved to one en problem in tids case however.
fogo
2. Headquarters recognises that the proposed travel and related expenses might
work certain hardships on VATTAA and his fem ly. In order to partially
offset these, or to bring VAIVADA to Headquarters for TDY-
training to coincide with his wife's stay in the U.3.
A
If the foregoing proposal meets with the approval of the Station, VAIVADA,
and the latter's wife, Headquarters should be advised as to preferable
dates for implementation of same. We would also like to have recommendations
res further training of VAIVARA at Peadquarters. Any objections to the
plan, as outlined above, should-liksuise be communicated to Headquarters at
Nan early date.

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
1
1. JMWAVE has reviewed the status of contract personnel
assigned to this station and has related the circumstances of
their assignment to that of staff agents with respect to the
application of the station housing allowance. Certain of these
contract personnel are not indigenous to this area, have been
transferred or assigned to JMWAVE from other areas on the same
indefinite basis as staff agents, and suffer the same inconveninces
and uncertainties as staff agents which were recognized in the
Headquarters approved housing policy. The rationale for granting
some degree of financial relief under these circumstances, in
the form of a housing allowance, is considered equally applicable
to these individuals. Based on JMWAVE initial survey of the
status of contract personnel the station requests that Headquarters
approve extension of the housing allowance to the following
individuals:
HAROLD R. HOEMAYER
PETER J. DIGERVENO
HENRY J. SLOMAN
IRVING G. CADICK
PHILIP D. GLAVASCO
IRVING C. DEVUONO
ALICE P. JENRETTE
2. Upon approval JMWAVE will forward to Headquarters copies
of the proposed amended contracts and will pay and administer the
allowance in the same manner as is now applicable to staff agents.

and his transfer has been cleared with Mr. Armstrong of the Agent Service
Panel.
4. This Project was merely a support mechanism for NORMAYR and did
not provide positiva or CE information. NODAY has performed valuable
services for KUBARE with WH Division since 1948.
5. There are no cover or security problems involved in this project
termination action since this is only an administrative measure transfer-
ring HORMAYR from Project LIEDGE to WH/4. The Office of Security and CCG

Our preliminary interviews with Subject lead us to
believe that he will be the interested and reliable
American cut out for which this station has long felt
a need. His greatest virtue in this respect appears
to be an understanding of operational methods and an
appreciation of relative values with respect to infor-
mation. It is hoped to make this a permanent project,
but our plans and our arrangements with Subject are
considered to be probationery, dependent entirely
upon his development and future usefulness.

Transportation and Temporary Storage of HHB (Domestic PCS Move)
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
3
Ref: UPOT 910, dated 28 October 1961
1. Reimbursement for the temporary storage of effects applicable
domestic PCS movement is authorized from the date of the employee's
departure. The marirm storage period is sixty (60) days. Harold R.
BOEMATR and William D. WENKEAD were assigned PCS to JMHAVE on 20 August
1961. Therefore, the initial reimbursement date for storage of effects is
20 August 1961. Unfortunately charges prior to 20 August will have to be
borne by the individuals since regulations do not permit storage of
affects during periods when an employee is absent from his domestic post
of assignment.
2. Paragraph two (2) of the reference requested advice regarding
reimbursement for shipment of effects between domestic PCS points using the
following instruments:
8. POA
-
Upon evidence of a proper weight certificate,
reimbursement for the transportation of 543 pounds from Washington
to Miami (1104 miles) is the product of the applicable commuted rate,
1.0., $19.40 (999 pounds or less) multiplied by the net hundred
weight transported which is 5.43, giving a total of $105.33.
b. Rental of Trailer
-
If a proper weight certificate was not
obtained at the time the effects were hauled between domestic PCS
points, three (3) estimates must be obtained as to the weight of the
effects. Reimbursement will be at the commuted rate and this includes
the trailer rent (receipt is submitted).
c. Employee Rents and Drives a Truck - The same formula as
given in the rental of a trailer is applicable. A weight certificate
(or three estimates) along with the rental receipt must be submitted.
Reimbursement is at the commited rate.

3. A question has been raised on how to interpret the rate tables in
attachment 2 to HR 22-11. For example, the mileage from Washington, D. C. to Miami,
Florida is 1,111 milea. In shipping 4,000 pounds of effects between these points
is the employce entitled to reimbursement at the rate of $11.70 or $12.00 per hundred
weight? In addition, reimbursements where minimum weight allowances occur are not.
olear. We assume that in the case where 350 pounds is billed as 500 the employee is
entitled to payment for 50 hundredweight at the applicable rate. However, in the case
of a shipment from Rookville, Maryland to lami where 850 pounds shipped is billed as
1,000 pounds what reimbursement is in order? HR 22-11, attachment 2, mentions a
1,000 pound minimum only in regard to Fishers Island, New York.
4. Your early reply will be appreciated.

3. Interpretation of the "Commuted Rate Table" citing examples was
requested in paragraph three of the references
-
8. Shipment of 4,000 lbs. of HHE from Washington, D. C. to
Miami (1,111 miles) $12.00 rate is used. In this instance the
mileage is more than 1100 miles (Column "A" of Table No. 3);
therefore, any mileage in excess of 1100 miles up to and including
1150 miles, the rate in Column B ($12.00) is used for shipment of
4,000 15s. and up.
b. Minimum rates-(1) Thres hundred fifty pounds billed at
500 pounds: reimbursement at the applicable rate for shipment of
500 pounds is authorized. If billing is less than for 500 pounds,
reimbursement is applicable thereto.
-
(2) Shipment of 850 pounds HHE from Rockville, Maryland,
to Miami and billed for 1,000 pounds: reimbursement since the not
weight (850 lbs.) exceeds the number of pounds shown in Column B
(774 lbs. breakpoint in lbs. for 1150 miles), the applicable
rate is that shown in Column D ($15.00 for 1150 miles), and the
applicable rate is the minimum hundredweight of that Column (D),
instead of the actual weight (850 lbs.) of the HE transported.
-
(3) The 1,000 pound minimum weight allowance for shipment
to or from Fishers Island, New York is for additional allowance only
and does not apply to shipment of effects from Rockville, Maryland
to Miami.
4. We hope that the above has helped to clarify the transportation
and storage of HHB in connection with a domestic PCS movement.

--365 Part II
e. Subversive potential and leading subversive personali
ties of most Latin American countries.
f. Subject is trained in the use of Nreams, jungle war-
fare, and has studied and worked with maps and charts,
and is acquainted with surveillance and evasion pro-
cedures.
g. His primary activity after his arrival in the new area
may of itself be useful. However, it is doubtful if
this man will be able to devote any large portion of
his time to our work until such time as he is thoroughly
oriented.
4. Subject is best qualified to procure information in Latin American coun-
tries, particularly Panama and Costa Rica.
HAMBER OF OPERATION
5. After he has established himself, Subject is interested in traveling in
Argentina, Chile and brazil.
6. He is willing to travel for us and subject to Home Office approval, it is
planned to introduce HYDROPATHIC to HYDROCYST who will, in turn, introduce
HYDROPATHIC to HYDROCYST I and, if approved, to HYDROCYST II. For the sake
of cover, this is to be done on the basis that HYDROCYST and HYCHOPATHIC are
lodge brothers. HYDROPATHIC will join that organization in order to build
up the cover. (Paragraph 8, TZF-2-365 Part I).
7. The number of people that will work for Subject is undetermined. Tenta-
tively me have in mind hYLROCYST I and HYLKCCYST II and, if he recruits
then, the subjects underlined in red in Paragraph 16 of TZP-A-385 Fart I.
It might be well to start collecting biographic data on the latter three
individuals at this time.
8. Subject is employed by another agency, but that employment will be terminated
in the near future.
9. Subject has been recruited on an Embassy Intelligence Officer basis. It is
possible that he knows the ultimate destination of any information he may
submit.
10. As presently planned, HYDROCYST and HYDROPATHIC will be acquainted with each
other. The turnover could be effected without these agents meeting, but
then it would be more difficult to build up the lodge cover story. It would
even be possible for HYDROPATHIC to communicate with HY ECCYS? since both
have a knowledge of Horse Code. However, it is believed that future infor-
cation from HYLACCYST I will not have its primary value in this area.
11. Subject will be briefed to corrunicate by letter-drop. Here again, a lodge
connection night be used as this is the present system which HYLFOCYST I
employs in forwarding communications to HYLEOCYST.
12. Subject will be briefed to report in writing and to require his sub-agents
to do so wherever possible.

1. The centruct of lese Crester with casadments bes been reviewed.
It is noted that the terms set forth a rate of 63-12 ka fall compensation
and as provision is indiented permitting additional pay. Overtine deca
not apply above 08-10 and premium pay has not to date been applied to
ccatrach types.
·
2. The approval of presim pay is based em CBC Regulations,
25.261 which permite such pay to full-time employees subjected to substantial a
Bootloos
enots of irregular, unscheduled overtim, night and holiday duty. Com-
sequently sertifications were received from supervisors at Headquarters
attesting to those eligible and in the field all staffers were processed
for this in 03-11 and above (not to proved the top of a GS-15) on the
knowledge of the various assignments subjecting our employees to these
qualified conditions.
3. Since processing is in edministrative exercise of effecting a
paracanal action to add to his salary and thereafter assure that he is
taken off this entitlement as soon as he is no longer entitled to 16, it
is not intended to do this for short periods. Except in the initial onSES
effective 1 February 1961, this pay becomes effective the beginning of the
Siret pay period after he enters this type duty and is takes off the end
of the pay period when he is no longer subjected to much duty. On contract
types, it is sulgosted, therefore, that overall aspects be considered much
