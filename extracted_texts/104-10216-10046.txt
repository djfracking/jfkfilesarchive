ACTION REQUIRED: FII
REFERENCE
: DBA-12821 (25 June 62)
1. OKENVY reports that they were advised by Identity Å that
his associate, Identity B would be visiting Djakarta in mid-July
and that probably he (Identity A) would be summoned by General Jani
in the near future to assist in procurement activities for the military.
2. Identity A expressed himself as being willing at the same
time to serve ODYOKE without renumeration, on a confidential basis or
otherwise, if his services can be of assistance.
3. Identity & has done some dickering with the local attache
regarding aeronautical spare parts for which export permits have been
difficult to obtain, claiming that he would have no difficulty in
obtaining permits if the parts were purchased through his organisation.
4. Identity & has also been in contest with another ODYOKE
component since January 62 and therefore cannot be approached by
KUBARK
