coup was launched. DON confirmed he had talked with the Ambassador who had vouched
for CONVEIN. DON stated that he was leaving on 29 October to coordinate final
plans. DON requested CONEIN to remain at home until 30 October until further
notice. DON repeated that the Ambassador would have the plans before the coup
Vegan,, but when pressed on his previous commitment to make them available, 48 hours
in advance, DON said that possiblythe hours would only be made available 4 hours in
advance. DON said that nothing would be happening within the next 48 hours and that,
if there was a good reason for the ambassador to change his planned 31 October departure,
the Ambassador would be informed in time to make his own decision.

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following description of the events of August 25,
1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek
tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evening of August 24,
1963, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties on
summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.
"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON.
It was drawn up at a meeting called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER
HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task
force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECTOR
JOHN MCCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

the cable proved historic. For the first time it gave the signal to
'unleash' the Vietnamese military, flashed a green light for the coup against DIEM of which
the generals had been talking for so many years.
the cable of August 24 was a radical revision of the previous philosophy
of one war at a time. It envisaged the generals' making war on their own government, and
with the implicit blessing of the United States.
"The substance of the cable was that the U.S. EMBASSY was to make an effort (con't.)

COLBY states that "When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINH,
that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had committed suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible
on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics and CONEIN doubted
that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance
to look at the bodies but turned it down. In trying to reconstruct the period of the assass-
ination on November 1, COLBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between Presi-
dent DIEM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was very
strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early
stages. At a later stage, in the early morning of November 1, he called and indicated that
he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent somebody down to
receive that surrender and found that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten
out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city.

At 0256 hours, following receipt of the sixth non-CRITIC cable, headquarters instructed the
STATION to put the coup reporting on the CRITIC network at the STATION. Sometime during the
day of 1 November (the confirmation copy of the cable lacks a date/time stamp) headquarters
cabled a warning to the STATION against including the names of CIA personnel in its CRITIC
cables. CONEIN is identified by and as being at JGS headquarters in eleven CRITIC messages,
seven of which were put into the CRITIC channel, without the name being deleted, here at

Colby stated that although he did not have the copy there was a telegram
which recounts a call made from Diem to Lodge on the afternoon of the coup.
Diem said that he was having trouble. ... an effort was being made against
him by his Generals, and that he believed it essential to put this down.
He urged that the U. S. consult General Lansdale and me (Colby) by name
because we understood something about this situation. This was in the
afternoon of the coup. The response, I believe, Ambassador Lodge did
mention something about assistance in leaving the country.

same date by CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 2063): ........do not think we have the
power to delay or discourage a coup. DON has made it clear many times that this is
a Vietnamese affair......I believe we should continue our present position of keeping
hands off but continue to monitor and press for more detailed information. CAS has
been anaylzing forces for some time and it is their estimate that the generals have
probably figured their chances pretty closely.......It does not seem sensible to have
the military in charge of matter which is so profoundly political as a change of govern-
ment....As to requests from the generals, they may well have need of funds at the last
moment with which to buy off potential opposition. To the extent that these funds can be
passed discreetly, I believe we should furnish them....If we were convinced that the coup
was going to fail, we would of course do everything we could to stop it. HARKINS has read

OCCURRENCE: On October 30, 1963, in a CIA cable to Saigon (DIR 79407) the following
quotation appeared: "....We do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power
to delay or discourage coup....We cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your
message that only conviction of certain failure justifies intervention....U.S. authorities
will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side.... ( the IG Report here
states without further showing the author of the above message that "the White House re-
peats its instructions on command of the country team after LODGE leaves." The inference
can probably be drawn that the message although looked upon as a CIA cable to Saigon,
was undoubtedly emanating from the White House.)

Conein explained that although it was baffling as
ing as to why Dien left the palace
to go to the church in Cholon, and although he did not know exactly how they
got out the general assumption was that there were secret tunnels in the palace
which was the former Governor General's Palace called Gailong Palace. The
tunnel took them under and through the palace and the half block to City Hall.

Higgins states that the Xa Loi pagoda, based on her own experiences, was more a political
command post than a holy place. It was the headquarters from which the militant
Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime.
According to Higgins, Thich Tri Quang told an Austrian journalist by the name of
Denis Warner early in August that he hoped in the process "they would kill one or two
of us."
Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen
pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists.

At the trial of Dang Sy by the Khanh regime that succeeded that of the
coup leaders temporary or provisional government, Khanh's prosecutor insisted that the
deaths had been caused by American-supplied grenades of the type known as MKIII whose
use had been ordered by Dang Sy, and the conviction by the military court was that the 8
deaths were caused by these concussion grenades. Higgins argues in her book that this
conviction is contrary to the Pentagon's assessment of the MKIII grenade which found that
at worst the effects of such a grenade are non-fatal. Nor does such a grenade have suffi-
cient force to decapitate or mutilate persons, let alone bring down the ceilings, doors,
and windows that were adjacent to the veranda of the radio station. (95-96) Higgins also
states that: "The conviction of Major Dang Sy certainly throws no light on the matter
one way or another. The trial was clearly rigged from the start." (96-97)

Higgins claims that "...the raids by the Vietnamese Army and the pagodas took place
five days after the departure of Ambassador Milting from Saigon, and a week before Henry
Cabot Lodge was expected to arrive on his first tour of duty in Viet Nam." Higgins goes
on to explain that Diem claimed that the reason that the raids were performed at this
time was because: "It had become clear that Thich Tri Quang of Buddhist was that no
intention of coming to any agreement with the government, irrespective of how many
consessions were made. Since the raids would create an anti-Diem propaganda explosion,
it would be less embarrassing to the United States if they took place when the new
Ambassador was President of Vietnam. For the same reason, great care was taken not
to inform the United States of the pagoda plans. The reasoning was that Washington
could
be blamed for something about which it knew no
nothing. (page 183)

OCCURRENCE: Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any
religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National
Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the
Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made
possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-
Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the
excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the National Vietnamese flag
on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number. (91).

OCCURRENCE: Mecklin stated that the American position following the incident at Hue
was to "urge Diem to repair all Buddhist grievances forthwith, to accept responsibility
for the May 8 killings, and to indemnify the victims and apologize, perhaps by visiting
Hue himself to do so." (Ambassador Nolting was on a Meditterranean vaction at the time.)
"According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from
Washington, 'direct, relentless, tablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States
had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government...' In despair Trueheart
in June resorted to a formal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures
(police effort to prevent and disperse illegal demonstrations), the United States would
be forced to disassociate itself publicly from such actions, as indeed we did two months
later. The warning was a momentous step. It amounted to a direct official command from

that it had become obvious to people in the State Department, USAID and JUSPAU, as well

ment at that time was not DIEM but rather NHU and CAN, as well as MADAME NHU, the chief of

OCCURRENCE: According to Higgins on May 8, 1963 on the Buddhist birthday Thich Tri
Quang, in the middle of a religious ceremony, began to give a vitriolic anti-government
speech on the subject of the non-existent ban on Buddhist flags. About 8 pm Thich Tri
Quang arrived at the radio station carrying in his hands a tape recording which he then
made the demand upon the director of the station to play. He was refused. Thich Tri
Quang proceeded to encourage an already active angry crowd which in the middle of this
oration began to shout and press forward. The director of the station called up Nguyen
Van Bang who soon arrived and attempted to appease Thich Tri Quang, but the latter would
not listen. Nguyen Van Bang then asked for armored cars in hopes that this would
fighten the crowd and prevent any violence to the radio station. Major Dang Sy
then arrived with some armored cars and got some general orders to disperse the crowd.
Police arrived and attempted to turn fire hoses on the crowd. (93-94)

"Immediately after May 8, President Diem ordered a formal investigation

Major General Tran Van Don, the acting head of the army (General Don was considered a
man of integrity by the Americans.)" The commission also included the Surgeon General
of the Vietnamese Army and its Chief of Ordinance. After extensive interrogation of

May 8.
"At the time, nonetheless, Diem's regime claimed that plastic bombs caused the deaths was

Nguyen Van Bang later at the trial of Major Dang Sy said that "While we
were inside, two loud explosions suddenly reverberated on the veranda. Then came the
sounds of broken glass, gunshots, and exploding hand grenades." In the confusion Major
Dang Sy heard the explosions also and in attempting to signal what he feared may be a
Viet Cong attack fired three shots in the air. Unfortunately this was the prearranged
signal authorizing his troops to use grenades to disperse the crowds. At least 15 of
these grenades were throw and the explosions caused at least 8 dead at the radio station.
(95) This statement though, appears to be in conflict with later medical evidence coming
from the Interior Minister which found that none of the bodies of the dead had metal
splinters in their organs, but rather the weapons expert said that the bombs were probably
made of plastic and that "plastic is the arm of the Viet Cong guerilla." (95-96)

Diem during his first few years in office and also the inexperience of Free Viet Nam's

the country to determine the effect of the Buddhist crisis on the war against the Viet
Cong. Returning to Washington, Krulik and Mendenhall each gave a different report on the
effect. Higgins notes that Kennedy asked wryly, "Have you two fellows been in the same
country?" Higgins goes on to note that this was indeed indicative of the American reac-
tion to Vietnam generally. Krulik, Higgins points out, visited the theatre of war by go-
ing to all core areas as well as six divisional and some twenty-five regimental and bat-
talion headquarters. But Mendenhall saw the theatre of the political intrigue, i.e.,
Hue in Saigon. These latter two areas was the only Viet Nam that Americans knew during
that time, and it was the slightly Effett, volital society which was the haven of Viet
Nam's chronically critical and bickering intellectuals. ages 104-105)

On or about October 5, 1963 when the telegram of October 5 and 6 were sent
to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT
KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA
should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE
"felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reser-
vations concerning DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we
could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My pre-
cise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I
was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a
good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we would have not one
coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might
last several years as indeed it did. So it was for that reason that I felt there would be

annually, and of payment of $250,000 on 3 September. The story was datelined in
Washington and in Manila. David Bell warned in a television interview that the
U.S. Congress might cut pack aid to Vietnam unless the Diam government changed

In a CIA cable from Saigon (SAIG 0523),/the I.G. REPORT provides the following summary:
"RICHARDSON cabled a damage assessment. He concluded that DIEM and the NHU's are fully aware
that the USG encouraged the GENERALS to attempt a coup and that CIA was the instrumentality of
this encouragement. He judged there was an even possibility that all major programs could
go forward as in the past. He listed as a major dilemma the Stations future relationships with
COL. TUNG. He noted his dissatisfaction with TUNG as a GVN liaison vehicle through which to
conduct PM programs, but noted that the GVN had offered no alternative. Unless we were willing
to discontinue our NVN, Laos border, and cross-border programs, we must continue to work with
IUNG. 【NOTE: PM programs paramilitary programs]
"The Times of Vietnam published charges that the CIA was plotting and financing a coup
and was giving asylum to the chief anti-DIEM Buddhist leader. The story was picked up and widely
played by the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, and other prominent

OCCURRENCE: DINH's desire to become a Minister was greater than his allegiance to President
DIEM. He became the actual key to the success of the coup. His facile, and at times
brilliant mind, was used to the general's advantage in that GENERAL DINH convinced President
DIEM that he, General DINH, along with COLONEL TUNG, should be given blanket orders to be
a counter-coup force. "DINH also convinced TUNG to move four of his principal airborne com-
panies on a bootless operation outside of Saigon on 29 and 30 October, so that these troops
would not be present on 1 November. DINH is the Minister of Security in the provisional

When the ministerial post for DINH did not materialize by early October, the

evident from statements during the series of meetings with GENERAL DON and GENERAL MINH dur-

him sufficiently with his troops, and, if necessary to eliminate DINH if he showed any sign
of compromising the generals. DINH was surrounded by officers who surveilled him 24 hours a

On August 29, 1963, the following report was listed within the Saigon Station's chronology
of August 1963 coup activities as follows:
"At 0745 hours, RICHARDSON, SPERA and CONEIN, latter two of whom were scheduled to contact
GENERALS MINH and KHIEM at 0815 same morning, were shown a message from GENERAL TAYLOR to
GENERAL HARKINS stating aspects of Vietnam situation being reviewed at WHITE HOUSE and com-
menting that second thoughts were beginning in Washington. Faced with this information and
given strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting with GENERALS MINH
and KHIEM should not be postponed but that contacting officers would make this meeting a
fact-finding mission without encouraging or discouraging GENERAL MINH.

at the position you took. And I said, well, you didn't disagree with it..."(T) This dis-
cussion had nothing to do with assassinations. This was whether we should let the coup go
or use our influences not to. Then interestingly enough, the President sent a series of mes-
Sages to CABOT LODGE urging that he'd do all that he could to get DIEM to change his ways.
CABOT LODGE's first attempt failed and then he was called -- CABOT LODGE was called by DIEM's
Office and DIEM said, you tell the President to tell me what he wants me to do and I'll do
it. Unfortunately, the forces were surrounding the palace at that very moment and the coup
was on. It was a kind of a dramatic little part of the history of that tragedy."

opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, Chief Fareast Division, that fiddling with
the commodity import program as a political lever would be much more likely to create
an economic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu into a more
cooperative attitude, because it would seriously affect the confidence and planning
of the Vietnamese business community and quickly engender inflationary measures at
large of a more serious nature. It was the concensus of the meeting that some meaningful
political movements had to be made but exactly what they should be was not determined.

On 8 September 1963, the CIA IG report reflects in a comment that the U.S.
government publicly confirmed on Oct. 8, 1963 that aid had alraady been cut
quitely and over a period of some months. Bill Colby, Jock Anderson and Dave Smith
told us that the public announcement of the aid reduction was a signal to the
general and that the reduction was planned with that in mind. It may be that
the cut in aid was deliberately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that
intention did not find its way into the record. The nearest thing to it is in the
record of a presidential meeting of 10 September 1963. The President asked
Rufus Phillips of AID what specific actions Phillips recommended and he suggested
"cutting aid to Colonel Tung which would be viewed by the generals with much
enthusiasm as an indication of virgouous of American position. " "In general,
ald cuts were discussed in terms of bring pressure on Diem to make needed changes in

However planned, or however looked upon by the US administration, it is
clear that the Vietnamese considered the official confirmation of aid F. Jan, it is
token of their support of coup planning.
