ORGANIZATION OF THE FILES
OF THE COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
->
:
The files have been left in the same basic organization
as they were maintained by the lawyers during the
investigation.
The most helpful information in finding
specific documents in the files is, therefore, an understanding
of what areas were investigated by each team of lawyers.
Belin-Gray-Greene Files (B-G-G). The files of
the executive director and his two special assistants are
of a general nature, focusing on no particular portion
of the investigation.
Schwarzer-Manfredi Files (S-M). This team was
responsible for Chapters 14, 15 and 18 of the
Report, on Watergate, domestic activities of the
Directorate of Operations and CIA file systems.
Baker-Weidner Files. This team was responsible for
Chapters 9, 10 and 11 and the federal portion of 17 of the
Report, on mail intercepts, inter-agency domestic intelli-
gence evaluation, CHAOS and CIA aid to other federal
agencies.
Olsen Roethe Files. (O-R). This team was responsible
for Chapters 12, 13, 16 and 19 and the state and local portion
of 17, on the Office of Security, the Directorate of Science
and Technology, the Kennedy assassination and CIA assistance
to state and local agencies.
Gellhorn-Cargill-Hardy Files (G-C-H). This team was
responsible for Parts II and III of the Report, on the
legal authority for the CIA and its internal and external
controls.
