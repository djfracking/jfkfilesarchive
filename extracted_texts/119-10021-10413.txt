Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this ship under
surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown, British Guiana.

At the repeated urging of the CIA Station in Lima
the Peruvian Government lab in August published a new anti-
terrorists law providing a penalty of no less than five years
imprisonment for persons who particiate in guerrilla activities
or in the illegal manufacture of weapons or explosives.
The Peruvian National Intelligence Service is working
on a lead furnished by the CIA Station in Lima concerning a
200 ton vessel reportedly involved in armis traffic..

urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to Cuban delegatos
to a preparatory meeting planning for the II Latin American

5.
Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean visas for this
i
meeting is one of the contributing factors to the Cuban sponsors
announcing during August that the meeting had been postponed.
k. Sent general instructions to our missions in countries

e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA
station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the

led to postponement of the Congress.
