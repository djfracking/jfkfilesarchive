Well, I suppose you had some conversations
with Dulles and with Bissell and some of
these people about it.
LANSDALE: Yes.

LANSDALE: Well, Bissell definitely felt the same wayo
¨ O'BRIEN:
Bissell was a very hard-working, intense person,
an
almost high-strung type of individual. He
became rather impatient with my questioning
of the changed concept when it took place. I thought
that

and they had a correct reading of dissent
inside of Cuba, that was a fair chance to do
something. My only concern at the time was?:

of any, but I was assured that there were such

Americans but I'm not certain that there were.

Did you question the kind of intelligence that
was coming out about Cuba and the expected
reaction of Cubans to an invasion, and the

Don't do it. So I'm sure there are

a judgement of an individual on that thing.
It's not a policy type of a thing from the

LANSDALE: I didn't notice that. It might have existed,
and I wouldn't have even known that.
O'BRIEN: Well, there's some feeling among people
during

as I understand it, that somehow there's an
involvement on the part of the South Vietnamese

Oh, yeah. Both the South Vietnamese and the

or with exile groups that wanted
to go back in Cambodia, and so on, and I'm
not certain that the Americans from either
Thailand or South Vietnam were fully aware
of what all was going on. And I'm not
certain that the Americans or the Cambodian
government people inside Cambodia knew what
was going on, and were tending to exaggerate
some of this. Things get blown up out of all
proportion in this. But just the fact that
there was antipathy and it would take this

going on.

Well, do you find again, in passing on to

the task force--and the formation of that.

the Kennedy administration--do you find the a

political appointees, to what's going on
in South Vietnam? Are you able to explain
what you're telling me right now about
South Vietnam to these people?
LANSDALE: Un,

the mechanics of getting decisions in Washing-

were with the problem that they were
employing the mechanics to solve. It was all

among his comrades just, "This stupid jerk,"

we would get a political section that would
work out better relations with the Vietnamese

confrontations with the Vietnamese government

the opposition considered in the governing

body. Another thing was on the police, of
getting police training done so that they
could cope with meeting enemy units, rather
than doing urban police work. In this, I
was begging them to at least get to a state
level
constabulary as far as American advisors were
concerned, and I wasn't certain that the U.S.
Army's military police could cope with it, but
maybe they could get a team of them in and
then I was pointing out that there were
constabulary officers and officers from other
countries, including South America and the
old Philippine constabulary, who knew the
law-and-order conditions--quite similar to
Vietnam--and bring them in if they wanted to
go international. I was trying to get them

there. They then proceeded to rewrite our

what the trouble was. And he said, "You and

I was seeing Gilpatric everyday and working

July 11, 1970
Alexandria, Virginia
By Dennis J. O'Brien
For the John F. Kennedy Library
O'BRIEN: I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just simply with the question;
'
when did you first meet President Kennedy,
or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before
he was President?
LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was
I believes
9
President. The first meeting was I believe,
the first Saturday following the inauguration,
○ whatever date that was. I was called into a
meeting in the White House by (Robert S.)
McNamara. It was a meeting, on, actually, on
n
a report that I had written for (Dwight D.]
Eisenhower. It was sort of a I'm not sure

in
the influence in the Agency in decisions?

LANSDALE: Yes, I think so. I'm not certain that it was

It might have been the

th
__s encouragement of some of the military who
were somewhat interested but wouldn't really
have expressed the interest unless they were
directly asked, and there always had been some
feeling of unease, I think would be the best
T-amon
word to describe it --among the military about
type of n
any clandestine operations. They felt that
:
once it got over into guerrilla type of operations
or anything that would involve a military subject,
2
that it would be far better to let the military
establishment of the U.S. handle it.
99
But that
would be sort of a dinner-coctail party type of
a gambit on their part, rather than sitting and
n
planning and so on of "We must grab some of
that'
this," Even though among themselves they talked
that way.
They didn't express it in terms of
their attendence at policy councils or even in

talks with people like the Secretary of Defense
or the civilian, executive side of Defense.

this, I think that McNamara himself probably
well,
started thinking initially that this was a
military operation and just to be more efficient
and effective, the military should take over
such things.

I imagine that he talked that way

him from the JCS, and the Chiefs, and from the
intelligence community, the military intelligence
community. I know that DIA [Defense Intelligence

I felt that more could be done with the
armed forces of Laos themselves in making
them more able to stand up for themselves
and defend their country. But if it couldn't,
I couldn't see an intervention of any sort
in there. Morally, we'd have been on a moral
ground then to turn around and start using
some international moral pressure, through the

in bringing things down was
one of the key
things on this. But again, there was even
talk at the time of taking Vietnamese troops
in there, and secretly, and using them up
