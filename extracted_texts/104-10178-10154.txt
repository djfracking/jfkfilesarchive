:
Have you ever been in Communist China? Answer: No.
Have you ever worked for the intelligence service of any country
besides IDEŃ J and LNHARP? Answer: No.
Have you ever received intelligence training in PBRÙMEN?
Answer: No.
Have you ever been a member of any Communist guerrilla group?
Answer: No. Later explained sensitivity to the question as
emanating from current work with two former Communist
guerrillas named IDEN K and IDEN L both of whom are now
with IDEN B.
Have you told-anyone in PBRUMEN that you are working with
WOFIRM? Answer: No. This question led to a discussion
of broadcasts from PBRUMEN which identified Subject as a
member of WOFIRM. These broadcasts occurred in October
· 1967 according to Subject and the man fingering him was
IDEN M. • The latter was not officially in Subject's WOFIRM
group before his capture in PBRUMEN dence Subject does not
know why it was that he was specifically samad. When it was
later suggested that this announcement would probably have
●cme affect on his family, Subject said he just didn't know
what effect it would have and has heard of nons. He agreed
that it was quite ironic that one side of the family was working
with an intelligence service which was diametrically opposed
to the side to which another member of the same family was
affiliated and in fact because of his present IDEN B employment
he was actually in the business of hunting them down. Subject
agreed that it was indeed ironic but felt his convictions differed
from his brothers' and that was that.
•
Have you told anyone in IDEN N that you are working for WOFIRM?
Noted that some knew of his past affiliation hence the question
was qualified to mean his present affiliation. Later after
reactions were recorded, Subject noted that his wife is fully
witting of his WOFIRM employment as is IDEN O. He also
mentioned that a PBRUMEN type. IDEN P, whom ne knows
from childhood has been kidding him constantly in Caracas

11. The first mention of Subject's brother Roberto in
the 201 is JMWAVE internal memo WCI-1501, dated 21 September 1966.
In this memo Subject described his telephone call from his
family in Cuba. Subject stated that his mother told him that
his brother Roberto was in England on a purchasing mission for
the GOC and that some time soon his brother Roberto would travel.
to Spain. Subject's mother expected Roberto to be out of Cuba
for two months. He stated that he last knew his brother to be
employed for the Cuban Telephone Company in Havana and in
Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province. He said that he last saw his
brother Roberto in April 1961. This is at variance with info
in the 1961 Questionnaire which stated he came to the U.S. as
a political exile 28 February 1961.
12. A. JMWAVE 3182 (IN 01749). 23 September 1966, stated
that Madrid-8990 (IN 85265) reported that Roberto arrived in
Madrid from Havana 26 August 1966.
B. Only other station traces on Roberto are in
UFGA-20828 (transmittal of Luis POSADA PRQ Part. 1) which passed
information provided by Subject.
C. AMOT files show Roberto in charge of telephone
center at Buenavista, Marianao, according to a telephone .company
bulletin of June 1964.
D.
AMOT-214 in October 1964 reported Roberto had been
an employee for the Telephone Company.

NOTES
:
1. In a Spanish questionnaire of Personal Information made
out in 1961, Subject listed his brother Raul POSADA-Carriles as
an administrator of the Narianao Electric Company as a relative
in some government service. He did not list his brother Roberto
in this section, although he did list Roberto in Para 16,
Subject:
Brothers and sisters.
1
2. In another signed but undated Spanish Personnel
Information form of apparently 1965, he again listed both his
brothers in Section N. Subject: Brothers and Sisters, and in
Section N he again listed his brother Raul, who he stated he
believed to be working for the Cuban government as an engineer.
He again failed to list his brother Roberto.
3.
Concerning his PRQ Part I filled out in March 1965, again
no mention of his brother Roberto appears in Section XIV, Subject:
Relatives, Acquaintances and Contacts. in any Government Service.
4. According to POSADA's own admission in an LC Flutter
of 14 April 1965, he had been involved in planning for a
Guatemalan coup headed by Roberto ALEJOS-Arzu.
This matter later
came to the attention of the FBI. There is an FBI report dated
17 May 1965 in the 201.
AMCLEVE-15 also furnished information
on this Guatemalan coup for JMWAVE, who disseminated this
information in July 1965.
5.
AMCLEVE-15 informed JMWAVE concerning other independent
exile operations into Cuba in July of 1965.
;
:
His PRQ Part II. Section XI, dated September 1965, says
that "Subject is of good character, very relaible and security

Subject demonstrated good security techniques while
reporting on the activities" of Roberto ALEJOS concerning the
attempted coup against Guatemala.
7. An FBI report of 30 September 1965 outlines the contacts
that had been made by some Americans seeking to purchase pistols,
blasting caps, hand gernades and silencers. This is the first
indication in the 201 that Subject was involved with Frank
Lang "Lefty" Rosenthal, Miami, who had the reputation of gambler
and hoodlum associated with other hoodlums and jewel thieves in
the Miami area.
8. In a report filled out by Subject on 21 April 1966
to update his employee file, Subject again reported his brother
Raul POSADA in government service but failed again to report
brother Roberto POSADA.
9. A JMWAVE memo WTR-1299, 21 July 1966, explains a request
from AMCLEVE-15 to resign from his job as an instructor in the
maritime training section to accept a job or the Junta being
set up at that time to govern the activities of RECE, COMMANDOS L,
30 NOVEMBER MOVEMENT and the 2506 BRIGADE. An FBI report of
29 July 1966 and another for 1 August 1966 both commented that
Subject had been approved by the exile groups to accept the
position of military leader of the newly formed alliance.
10. On 1 August 1966 AMCLEVE-15 was transferred from the
wals to

18. Cable DIRECTOR-15805, 29 June 1967, requested replies
to series of questions concerning AMCLEVE-15's activity with
ROSENTHAL and FBI. JMWAVE replied in JMWAVE-7953 (IN 02284),
30 June 1967. JMWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15 had failed to report
the October 1966 transactions with Rosenthal until 9 June 1967,
and therefore the Miami FBI was not notified until 15 June 1967.
JMWAVE stated that AMCLEVE-15's explanation for not reporting
the October 1966 transaction was that he "just forgot."

that he is still with WOFIRM until Subject finally told him in
an offhand way, "Sure I'm with WOFIRM," but he does not
know what effect this had on IDEN P or whether he has told
anyone of his suspicions of Subject's WOFIRM involvement.
He specifically denied that anyone other than these thres
persons were knowledgeable.
Does anyone in IDEN B know you have this meeting with us today?
Answer: No.
Have you ever been asked to perform any task or mission against
the LNHARP? Answer: No.
Have you ever performed any task or mission on behalf of IDEN G?
Answer: No.
Has anyone told or instructed you on what to report to us? Answer;
No.
Have
you had contact with IDEN C since 1967? Answer: No. Con-
tinued reactions to this question which necessitated a break-
down test to isolate the reason for his sensitivity to the topic.
He repeatedly denied that he had had any contact with IDEN C
since the IDEN Q told him not to but acknowledged a physical
revulsion to the mention of the man's naine, and a long dis-
cussion ensued regarding the extent of Subject's involvement
with ¡the man. Subject contended that the contact began quite
innocently in 1965 and was what Subject initially thought was a
deliberate provocation to see what Subject's reaction would be.
Subject immediately reported the contact to JMWAVE handiers
who guided him through continued contacts and instructions from
IDEN Q. Subject was instructed to sell IDEN C "silencers" (guns
with silencers attached--about six or seven to the best of his
recollection) in order to find out his true identity. Subject fur-
nished physical descriptions and license numbers to JMWAVE
and continued to report on contact with IDEN C. He offered
Subject $500 US which JMWAVE told Subject to keep since it was
merely a bonus given him for his work as an intermediary.
IDEN C continued to force contact with Subject and once came
to his home in shorts and made veiled threats which were
answered with counter threats of violence from Subject, and an
outright threat that Subject would kill IDEN C if he threatened

him again. In 1967 while with the IDEN R, Subject gavo
IDEN C_some "pencils' to keep him away which Subject did
not then report to WOFIRM but later did. He gave him about
129 altogether. Subject had promised IDEN C some 500 pounds
of C/4 explosives, M-2's, sub-machine guns, etc. but all waa
intended to balt IDEN C for arrest and none was ever supplied
to him. Later Subject noted äfter reacting to a break-down
question that he had supplied him with pencils, silencers, and
also some grenades and pentolite. But these he claims should
be a matter of record with JMWAVE. The grenades were
typical military type and numbered about 24 to 48 altogether.
Again, however, Subject noted that he acted only as intermediary
between IDEN C and another individual who is now deceased in
PBRUMEN and did not physically handle any munitions shipments.
As noted above, continued sensitivity to the question of the amounts
or types of equipment furnished IDEN C is believed attributable
to uncertainty of Subject's part as to exactly what he did arrange
for shipment to IDEN C. As to the basic question about contact
with him since 1967 (or when he was told by IDEN Q to no longer
have contact with IDEN C). Subject insisted that he never re-
established contact of any kind but always checks at IDEN 8 to
determine if IDEN C is around.
Do you now have in your possession any arms, munitions or articles
of demolition which was once the property of the LNHARP? Only
those items which were discussed during a pre-test debriefing,
via., items brought to Caracas by him in a suitcase and consist-
ing of the following: 3 or 4 smoke grenades; 6 or 7 booby traps
(army type); 1 piece of delay fuse about 100 feet long; ore primer
cord about 100 feet; 2 or 3 MK2 grenades; about 10 pencils (some
regular open market supply items and some of the "company"
variety); demolition pliers; knife; compass; metascope (infra-
viewer worth about $50 used). These items he said were taken
while with the IDEN R and with the knowledge of IDEN T although
IDEN T did not know exactly what he had taken. Subject was using
these items frequently in training courses and they were not to
the best of Subject's knowledge the property of LNHARP at that
time although it is possible that some of these items were at one
time LNHARP and possibly WOFIRM items. But he explained
further that these items are plentiful in the Miami area and can

1. The Station desires to explain its viewpoint on AMCLEVE-15
clearly because of what could conceivably be construed to be a tone
of impatience in the first line of Reference A. First of all, why do
we want to hire AMGLEVE-15? Our objective is to use him as a unilateral
penetration of CIRASH and CIVISTA, which controls that organization.
Specifically, we would like to penetrate the inner circle surrounding
IDENTITY and CIRASH-4. The recent provocation (reported in reference C)
which we believe was run by IDENTITY is a clear indication of the need
for this type of penetration over and above the normal need for
penetration of security services.
+
2. What we are not trying to do is to make a CIGOAL-1 or
ANOT-260 out of ANCLEVE-TS: that is, put him on the payroll as an
advisor to CIRASH-4. We want to be very clear on this point, since
this may be the cause of Headquarters' concern. His role will not be
advisory. AMCLEVF-15 is to be used to obtain counterintelligence
information to protect the Station and its operations and to get for
us that portion of the intelligence available in CIRASH which is not
made available to the Station via the liaison channel.
3. From the information available to us, AMCLEVE-15 seems to
present an almost golden opportunity to Caracas Station: i.e., a cleared
KOFIRM agent (who although terminated still reports to WOFIRM when in
the JWAVE area), who is a well-placed "hombre de confianza" of the
chief of CIRASH and the chief of the special investigative unit within
CIVISTA which may have penitoring of EOFIRM activities as one of its
objectives. We say "seems to present" because, although we have
confirmation from CIRASH-15 that AMCLEVE-15 does in fact hold the
position described above, we are of an open mind regarding the
practicability of his use and we are completely willing to accept any
infermation that would zilitate against his secure and fruitful employment.

concerning the organisation of Identity of Reference A's office.
23 November 1967 a meeting was held in Identity of Reference A's office with
members of the PTJ who were to work for Identity of Reference A in the special
investigative unit he is establishing. Identity of Reference A announced
that the director of the PTJ had refused to let his men work in Identity of
Reference A's organisation, although the request for their services had come
from CIGIEO-1. The men vare given until the end of November to decide whether
or not they would quit the PTJ to begin work for Identity of Reference A.

wile Dr.Gustavo CRTIE and "Vósforo" played a protection role for
Eduardo with automatic pistols ready in their trouser belts.Eduardo
is now in Miami, and will be back at the and of this weck with his
Amily.In a very confidential way, he's been asked to bring back
bullets cal. .32 (Dr.Vacátegui gave him $100.00 for a silencer cal.

Miami.He will also try to get in touch with links (Cuban and C.I.A.)
to get as much stuff as possible, to be used probably here.Dr.Uzcá-
tegui, beside asking Eduardo to buy bullets and a silencer cal.22
for himself, also asked Eduardo, on his way back to Caracas, to stop
in Puerto Rico a couple of days for something he had to do there.
De.Uzcátegui has asked me what I think about Eduardo's capabilities
As a member of the office in the field of sabotage, etc., explosives,
stall told Dr.Uzcátegui it was good to have people with some background
in the mentioned field.On the other hand, Eduardo and Dr.ORTIZ want
He to help them with instruccion on the same technical field, but do
not want either Dr, Uzoátegui or Erasto Fernandez to know about it:
Dr.Uzoátegui has asked me to find people for the office.He needs, for

sources cheaper than LNHARP. Also Subject noted that the
few.guns (small calibre snub nose weapons) which he has
brought to Caracas with him from Miami are merely for the
personal use of some of his fellow employees in IDEN B, and
´he breaks no laws in bringing them with him on the few trips
he has made between 1967 and the present. He feels ho has
perhaps brought a total of 6 such small sidearms to Caracas
and also one sport rifle (AR-15) which he was asked to bring
back by IDEN U. The rifle was a gift to IDEN U. The weapon
as not automatic per Subject.
7
The only other items which Subject could think of which could
lisk WOFIRM with his organization are the silencers which he
reported on in Miami some months back which his organization
took from captured guerrillas and which were probably issued
to a group which went to PBRUMEN and were lost. Subject is
positive they were WOFIRM issue but purportedly the serial
numbers which he submitted cculd not be checked.
One additional item which was cleared up dealt with the pentolite
which had been reported seen in Caracas. Subject voluntarily
mentioned that he had seen such a supply under the bed cí a friend.
The supply was attached to magnets which were to be used to
attach the charge to the underside of a ship in Caribbean waters
of IDEN V or IDEN W nationality. The charge was to discourage
further shipments between these latter IDENs and PBRUMEN.
Subject said he detached the magnets from the pentolite and
intended using it in training classes for students with his present
employer. The person who brought it to Caracas was IDEN X.
Subject does not know how he got it here, but knows that his
employer could facilitate such deliveries.

IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR STATION TO WORK WITH FERNANDEZ IF HE
APPOINTED CHIEF, DIGEPOL BUT FEEL THAT SENSITIVE OPS SHOULD CONTINUE BE
HANDLED WITH CIWOODS OR UNILATERALLY. IT IS TRUE THAT FERNANDEZ COOPERATED
WITH STATION DURING HIS PREVIOUS TOUR AND APPEARED NOT BE ANTI-WOFACT BUT
HIS GENERAL GREEDINESS AND LACK OF SCRUPLES MAKE HIM AN UNSAVORY PARTNER
TO DEAL WITH AT THAT LEVEL.

WH COMMENT: *COS, Minit and Erasto Fernandez Betancourt, for DC/Digepol met
to discuss colaboration between Station and Digepol. Not
clear if Fernandez to be new Chief. While F has bad rep not
clear why. Fernandez was cooperative with Station previous
time no clear indications he enriched himself by accepting
bribes from left. Station would work slowly until full
assessment acquired. Asked WAVE to work closely with
AMCLEVE-15 during Fernendez stay in Miami to collect info on
latter.

mother in Cuba, in which she gave him news of Raul and POSADA CARRILES
Roberto POSADA Carrilės.
2. Raul spends most of his time in Cienfuegos because
he is directing the installation of a thermoelectric plant
in the area. A snapshot of Raul was enclosed, and we are
enclosing a blow-up of Raul for your information.
3. Roberto is apparently in Havana (at least not in
Cienfuegos), and the only comment about him was that he
is suffering from back trouble.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
MEMORANDUM FOR AMCLEVE/15's File
14 August 1967
SUBJECT:
Salary Misunderstanding
ORIGINATOR:
Gary L. FLUSTIKOFF
1.
ANCLEVE/15 submitted the attached note, written
by him, to the writer. In the note ANCLEVE/15 says
.
"
"he is not asking for anything but wants the records checked
regarding his past salary of $325.00 per month." AMCLEVE/15
claimed "Chip" (Grover T. LYTHCOTT, his former CO) told
him that effective Octobor 1966 he would be paid $100.00
per month by WOFACT, while the balance would be placed in a bank for him.
2. For the record AMCLEVE/15 was told by the writer
and not Chip that effective August 1966 (not October)
he would be cut back in his salary, to approximately
$100.00 por month. He was cut back from $350.00, not
$325.00, for reasons of economy and cover and he was
agrecable to the cutback. The writer did not tell him
that the balance of approximately $212.00 was being
saved for him; only that his gross salary would be
raised to $350.00 in the event RECK ever stopped paying
him his salary. (It was assumed that his RECE employment
might be short-lived). For administrative reasons the
salary cutback was not offective until September 1966 and
from latter date until December 1966 he was paid $111.13,
From January 1967 until June 1967 he was paid $110.90
due to a FICA change. During the entire period, September
1966 tọ June 1967, AMCLEVE/15 was budgeted by JMWAVE in
the amount of $350.00 gross with the notation of his
voucher of "possibility of paying balance later". Then.
in June 1967 ANCIEVE/15's salary was increased to $350.00
gross, as so promised, because he was unemployed during
most of June.
3. The writer explained the above to ANCLEVE/15
and he seemed satisfied. He told the writer that he had
to borrow some money to cover expenses in connection
with his trip to Venezuela.

Question: What kind of weapons id you bring for assassinations?
orica: We brought two Doretta pistols with silencers, a .22-cal. pistol with
a silencer, and an M-3 with a silencer.
Question: What kind of ammunition did you bring for the .22-cal. pistol with silencer?
Lurcerica: Part of the ammunition was conventional bullets and part of it was
cyanide-tipped bullets.
Question: Who prepared the bullets with oyanidet
Laucerioa: I prepared them.
Question: What were those bullets prepared fort
Lascerica: Those bullets were prepared over there in Miami,
(Polo--phonetic)
randa, member of an organization called (†El Rece) asked me to prepare them, in
spite of the fact that I know nothing about chemistry, for attempts on lives, to
paige fäure of the death of the individuals against whose lives attempts were to be
made, but they were for specific attempts.
Question: What plans were made in the United States or among the counterrevolutionary
eireles, what is the main objective sought?
Lucerica: Well, the physical elimination of the leader of the Cuban revolution
Fidel Castro.
Question: The physical elimination of Kaj. Pidel Castrof
Loucerica. Yes, sir.

Question: Those counterrevolutionary groups which operate from Florida, frem Miama,
de they have the approval of the North American Government for their actions?
Mucerica; Almost entirely. For example the most opportunist elements over there
crcite small groups to obtain dollars from the US Government for their subsistencé,
but there are close links among all the organizations in exile with the Central
Intelligence Agency. We have, for example, the case of (1El Rece) which--through
Inie Poanda, who is known by all as a CIA agent--belongs, that is all its activities
of ing on Cuban coasts, actions against merchant ships and so forth, are linked
to the CEN.
Question:¨ You say that you had a .22-cal." pistol with poisoned bullets for specific.
attempts on lives?
Lucerica:
Yes, sir.
Question: I would like you to clarify something more. What specific attacks,
against which figures, were those attempts to be made with that type of weapon?
"Atcerica: Well, against the most prominent figures of the revolution according to
existing circumstances and according to the individuals who were going to execute
then. Specifically, it is to be supposed that if the idea of counterrevolution were
to take root in Havana, well then the effort to kill the leader of the revolution
would be intensified.

Dear friend Palo,
This is the third letter that I am sending you.
sending this letter by messenger, I can explain more.
Since I an
The Government here assisted a group of Cubans called the
Brigade. The Department of Defense (Army) provided this assistance
without consulting the Ministry of the Interior. When the Minister of
the Interior found out, he demanded an explanation from the military
men and they stopped the assistance.
There are strong possibilities that a plan will be developed for
Cuba, which will involve the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of
the Interior and which will be assigned to a group of serious persons.
I believe it is highly important that I go to Miami urgently or that
some of you come here. This is urgent.
33
If you want me to go, send my fare to this address:
San Juan Bosco Avenue
Mayflower Bldg. Apt 24
Altamira, Caracas Venezuela
On the other hand, ERASTO FERNANDEZ is being summoned by Congress.
He is accused of being too severe with the Communists. Send a telegram
as soon as possible, expressing solidarity with his attitude, in the
name of the Cubans in EECE. If possible, mention me in the telegram.
The address is:

1.
AMCLEVE/15 informed the writer on 9 August 1967 that
he plans to fly to Caracas, Venezuela from Miami on 12 August
1967 accompanied by Aldo HERNANDEZ, a friend who is employed
as a salesman in Caracas. In Caracas AMCLEVE/15 will seek
employment through or with an old friend, Ricardo VENTURINE ·
aka Jose VENTURINE, connected in some way with the TV industry
in Caracas. HERNANDEZ is also a friend of VENTURINE.
2. If AMCLEVE/15 finds employment in Caracas, he does
not intend to return to Miami and his wife and son will then
join him in Caracas.
3.
If AMCLEVE/15 does not find employment in Caracas,
he intends to go to Puerto Rico from Caracas to lock for
employment through some of his friends living in Puerto Rico.
4. AMCLEVE/15 was given a recognition signal for estab-
lishing bona fides in the event that NOFACT should want to
contact him in Caracas or elsewhere. AMCLEVE/15 was instructed
that the person would establish bona fides by saying, "I'm a
friend of Lawrence". He was also given JMWAVE address
Mr. Lawrence R. DEROME, PO Box 390, Main Post Office, Miami,
Florida,
5.
JMWAVE has no identifiable traces on VENTURINE and
HERNANDEZ.
6. AMCLEVE/15 reported that his name was mentioned on
the GOC radio on 6 August 1967 in connection with the alleged
captured WOFACT agents. He was described by Alberto LAUCIRICA
Diaz as the liaison between WOFACT and RECE.

ABSTRACT.
MED
MICH
AUG 7 1967
DOC. MICRO. SER.
H
1. As reported in reference, AMCLEVE/15 was terminated
effective 11 July 1967. AMCLEVE/15 was terminated because he
resigned from his position as a military coordinator/member of
RECE (Cuban Representation in Exile), a Miami based Cuban exile
organization, in early June 1967 and he thus lost access to his
target, as AMCLEVE/15 had been reporting on the activities of
RECE since 1 August 1966. In addition, JMWAVE does not have a
current need or any operational interest in RECE, and the AMOT
organization has the capability to penetrate and report on RECE
if and when the need should arise. After AMCLEVE/15 resigned
from RECE, he was a candidate for employment in the AMOT organ-
ization; however, because of his involvement with Frank "Lefty"
ROSENTHAL and for other security reasons it was decided that
the AMOT organization should not hire him.
2. AMCLEVE/15 began his employment with WOFACT in April
1965 and initially served as an instructor in the Maritime
Training Branch of JMWAVE. He was also active in reporting on
exile activities. On 1 August 1966, AMCLEVE/15 was transferred
to the CI Branch where he was used to report on the activities
of RECE until his resignation in early June 1967.
3. Since AMCLEVE/15 was amicably terminated, JMWAVE does
not envision any problems at this time. AMCLEVE/15 plans to
seek employment in Caracas, Venezuela, through an old friend
who resides there.
4. On 21 July 1967 AMCLEVE/15 was given a termination
bonus of $650.00, which is equivalent. to two months salary, minus
FICA and federal income tax. He was paid $549.60 net.

to discuss future action AMCLEVE/15 case. JMWAVE position was to agree have
AMCLEVE/15 aid in case as much as possible without exposing AMCLEVE/15 or his
WOFACT employment.
The following proposals
Justice Dept. attorney requested AMCLEVE/15 recontact Rosenthal and the meet would
be covered by FBI. AMCLEVE/15 would ask Rosenthal for money for down payment on
material (c-4 explosives) but nothing would nothing would be furnished at that
time. Later AMCLEVE/15 would furnish Rosenthal sufficient amount of explosives
to constitute violation, when AMCLEVE/15 and Rosenthal separated, Rosenthal
would be arrested.
ANCLEVE/15 was to contact Alberto Larrain-Maestre and exhibit requested silencer
which would not be furnished. This contact would also be covered by FRI, but
action wuld be taken by local authorities to avoid possible disclosure as to
involvement of AMCLEVE/15 in the matter.
JMWAVE was in process of terminating AMCLEVE/15, but in view of FRI need, he would
be retained on payroll until 30 Sept.

the information from Jorge MAS Cancea, who got it from Johnny No201
Alvart, who recently arrived in Miami from Cuba.

2. The report names'Jorge Morate as a Cuban lieutenant-
who studied rocketry in the USSR for three years. It states
thất Nōrate is disaffected with the Castro regime and sells
things on the black market that the Russians bring into Cuba.
The report also mentions that "XI Gallego" Fernandez; chief
of a squadron of MIG's at the Olguin Air Base, is also
disaffected with the Castro government and used to give
Alvart information about the base. Fernandez told him that
in April 1968 there were severe fuel restrictions on the
air base which limited the MIG Tlights.

JMWAVE may wish to contact Alvart if it has not
already done so.

VALUABLE SOURCE SINCE PICKED UP BY CARACAS STATION FEBRUARY

1965. WE BELIEVE HE COLLABORATING FULLY WITH WOFIRM AND WOULD
NOT EXPOSE, INFORM ON OR WORK AGAINST WOFIRM. THIS DOES NOT
MEAN HE MIGHT NOT ENGAGE IN SIDE ACTIVITIES OF HIS OWN UNRELATED
TO WOFIRM ACTIVITIES WITHOUT INFORMING WOFIRM.
2. BELIEVE GOOD TRADECRAFT REQUIRES HE UNDERGO SGSWIRL
AT THIS TIME. ALSO WE WOULD LIKE REGULARIZE HIS STATUS, REIN-
STATE HIS CLEARANCE AND REMOVE HIM FROM "HOSTILE" LIST SO WE
CAN WORK WITH HIM MORE CLOSELY, LEVY REQUIREMENTS, AND THEREBY
REAP FULL BENEFIT HIS POTENTIAL,
3. WE WOULD PROPOSE LIMIT EXAMINATION TO POINTS DESIGNED
DETERMINE THAT HE HAS NOT, IS NOT, AND DOES NOT PLAN ENGAGE IN
ACTIVITIES HOSTILE TO WOFIRM.
OUR ONLY REAL CONCERN IS TO BE
ASSURED HE NOT WORKING AGAINST US.
CE

SUMMARY: AN INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION BY THE
DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF POLICE (DIGE PCL) ON CUBAN EXILE
PLANS TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK ON CUSA HAS REVEALED THAT
MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY, WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE MINISTER OF DEFENSE, ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED. THE
VENEZUELANS HAVE PROCURED ARMS FOR THE PLOTTERS AND HAVE
HELPED THEM BRING IN ARMS BY BOAT. THE PLANNED ATTACK HAS
SEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE DIGEPOL'S INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED
REVE
DETAILS OF THE OPERATION. HOWEVER, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE
INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO INTEREST 'ITSELF IN A IDING CUBAN
EXILE PLANS. END SUMMARY.
1. IN FEBRUARY 1955, THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF POLICE
(DIGEPCL) BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS THAT VENEZUELANS
WERE PROCURING ARMS FOR A CUBAN EXILE GROUP IN VENEZUEL A
WHICH PLANNED TO ATTACK CUBA. INITIAL REPORTS IDENTIFIED
TWO CUBANS INVOLVED IN THE CASE:
ARRIVED IN VENEZUELA AS AN EXILE FROM CUBA IN 1959, AND
REINALDO BONIFACIO GONZALEZ-LEON GARCIA, WHO IS A CLOSE
FRIEND OF ROLANDO MASFERRER AND WHO TOOK PART IN THE BAY

OF PIGS INVASION ATTEMPT.
(FIELD COMMENT : AN INDEPENDENT
AND UNTESTED SOURCE REPORTED IN NOVEMBER 1967 THAT GONZALEZ -
LEON WAS THEN APPROACHING THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY WITH
REQUESTS FOR ARMS AND BOATS TO BE USED IN AN ATTEMPT AGAINST
CUBA.)
2. BY APRIL 1968 DIGEPOL'S INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION
HAD IDENTIFIED NINE MORE CUBAN PARTICIPANTS AND HAD REVEALED
THAT TWO UNIDENTIFIED MEMBERS OF THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY,
AN ARMY COLONEL AND A MAJOR, WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE
PLAN. THE TWO VENEZUELANS HAD PROCURED ARMS FOR THE GROUP
AND HAD ALSO HELPED TO ARRANGE THE ARRIVAL IN VENEZUELA IN
EARLY 1968 OF TWO BOATS CARRYING ARMS. THE BOATS
WERE DOCKED AT CLUB PUERTO AZUL AND AT PUERTO CABELLO.
3. UPON LEARNING THAT THE VENEZUELAN MILITARY WAS
ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE PLAN AND THAT THE MINISTER OF
DEFENSE RAMON FLORENCIO GOMEZ KNEW THAT VENEZUELAN
MILITARY AID WAS BEING GIVEN TO THE CUBAN PLOTTERS, THE
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR CONFRONTED THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE
ON 23 APRIL WITH THE ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE COLLECTED ON
1
THE CASE. THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ADMITTED ITS INVOLVEMENT.

2. The course was particularly heavy on explos i van with
the first three volumes being devoted to it exclusivaly.
Volumes 4 and 6 are also mostly an explosives, with the first
part of each being on photography and Marxism, respectively;
Volumes 5 and 7 deal with much subjects as tradsaraft,
tration-axfiltration operations, security, safehouses, re-
cruitments, sabotage operations, etc.
3. No copies of the attactments are being sent to

BACKGROUND:
Subject is a 40-year-old PBRUMEN male who has been of continuing
WOFIRM interest since initial contact with JMWAVE and more recently
with the Caracas Station as a penetration of the IDEN B organization.
PURPOSE/PROCEDURE:
Subject was SGSWIR Led at the request of the Caracas Station because
of several issues which tended to question Subject's bona fides, possible
affiliation with PBRUMEN intelligence through relatives, unreported associ-
ation with gangster elements, thefts from WOFIRM, plus other items specified
in questions listed below. The interview was conducted in the home of
“Oscar C. KALBING in both English and Spanish. (Subject's English is quite
good, however, during actual testing Spanish was used to avoid ambiguity or
misunderstanding of the question content.) KALBING did the translating.
RESULTS:
Subject remains sensitive to one question which is related to his past
dealings with IDEN C but in fairness to Subject this sensitivity is believed
generated by genuine uncertainity over the amount of items which he had
been instrumental in getting for IDEN C. Sensitivity initially recorded in
other aross was resolved through post-test discussion and responses to all
other questions are regarded as substantially truthful. Subject was most
cooperative and candid throughout the entire interview.
DETAILS:
Because of the numerous issues which were believed in need of clarifi-
cation, a three phase test was structured prior to the interview and rehearsed
with Subject completely before any testing took place. Discussions, as noted,
wero in both English and Spanish. Specific questions asked of Subject and
answers given by him are as follows:

REFERENCE, HVCS-2610
AMCLEVE-15
1. Hoadquarters' request to review the contents of the attachment to
Reference was received at a time when the Stattes was unable to produce current
data to make a moaningful contribution to updating subject matter. Since receipt
of Reference, the Station has unilaterally recruited a telephone technician who
la knowledgeable of SIFA telephone tape. This subject has not been used as yot,
per ha he received his first months salary and RXOVER is not yet prepared to
probe Subject on SIFA tape. With regard to DIGEPUL technical operations, the
Station hea only recently been able to obtain unilateral type information through
ANCLEVE-15 who is only now getting to know the man in obarge of the DIGIPOL
talephone operation.
2. Within the next two months the Station should be in a position to
provide a more detailed and specific report on GOY technical operations.
3. The following is all the information currently available to the Station
on SIFA/DIGEPOL technical operations.
8.
SIFA telephone tape are monitored in the building bousing the
Ministry of Communications, which is located alongside SIFA headquarters.
According to the telephone technician, they have a ompability to inter-
cept 50 lines, but only a dosen are in operation at any given time. The
monitoring section consists of 2-) persans. Because of this personnel
shortage many tapes are not replayed and oven loss are transcribed. SIFA
offices in the interior have been reduced and it is doubtful that a
telephone program is in operation.
b. The DIGEFL talephone intercepts are now directly under command
of the Minister of Interior and all intercept requests must have his
approval. According to CIGIRO-1 in conversations with the COS, the
formar olains a talsphone capability of 50 lines, not including 3-4 lines
be has running directly into his office. (Plans call for completion of
an additional 100 lines by the end of February 1968.) These are monitored
in the building of Ministry of interior. The staffing pattern, production
and utilisation of the take is unknown to the Station. 3ince a capability
of this extent involves running a pahle to the monitoring post, it is
most probable that the actual taps are on the frams at the main telephoma
axchange in Carsons.

1. CIRAGH-15 reported that MNCLEVE-15, shortly after the latter's
return from Kimi on 30 January 1968, asked 8-15 if he esald obtain
curare poison for "approximately forty hypodaruša needles,' DICLEVE 15
said that the request had been made by Bustavo CELL Paes, who was still
in Stani at that time. CATII returned to Carecas during the second un
of February, and on 15 February he personally contacted CIRASH-15 and
ruiterstal the request. CIRISH-15 has so far been unable to determine für
what purpose CTIẻ vents the curare.
2. We have not board anything about this from INCLEVE-15 and will
not ask him in order not to expose CRASH-15. This is possibly another
one of the goon squad activities tentatively planned for Carenas mentioned
in Reference A, but mare likely it has to do ad to some wild Cuban axila
scheme in Miami, sime CLEVE-15 told CIRATE-15 whan ORTIZ was still in.
Nimmi that ORTIZ wanted the surare shipped to his there via a Viasa pilot.
3. As was stated in Reference B, we do not approve of these
activities and would like to discuse them wi ACHIEVE-15, pointing out
that they could jeopardise his employment hare with Clhash-4; but our
present relationship with ANCLEVE-15 prooludas son disoussions. Neamville,
the case officer will wear his special armored shirt to all meetings with
ANCLAVE-15.

Have you used any name besides IDEN A? Answer: No, except
for nicknames and aliases used with WOFIRM.
5.6
Have you ever travelled to Washington, D. C. Answer: Yes.
Once several years ago.
Have you ever been to the Soviet Union? Answer: No.
Are any of your relatives members of the Communist Party?
After some discussion Subject felt it probable that they were.
Those specifically mentioned were his two brothers IDEN D
and IDEN E and also possibly a sister named IDEN F who is
also in PERUMEN and married to a Captain in the Militia.
When the question was prefaced with the words: "Is it your
belief that any of your relatives are members," Subject's
answer was always yes. He based this belief on the fact that
both brothers hold highly responsible positions in key industries
In PBRUMEN and hence must be members. He also noted that
prior to his leaving PBRUMEN, he (Subject) and his two brothers
had many discussions about politics and their views differed
from Subject's. As for his brother IDEN E, Subject regarded
him as the "brain" in the family and originally a very religious
person who attended Catholic services daily. He later evinced
distrust for the clergy in PBRUMEN and blamed them for the
downfall of the church. When Castro made his move, IDEN E
was in complete sympathy with him and remained with him
despite his apparent conversion to Communism, although
IDEN E never acknowledged that he had been a Communist and
would usually retort with a comment that he (IDEN E) was a
"humanist. "
Are any of your relatives working for PBRUMEN Intelligence?
His answer was that he felt that at least one of them was accord-
ing to what KALBING inferred during his discussion with Súbject
the day before the SGSWIRL test. This was his brother IDEN D,
but he also wondered about his brother IDEN E who might also be
with PBRUMEN intelligence because according to what his mother
mentioned in a letter some time ago, IDEN E had been in the
USSR receiving training of some sort. This training lasted for
a full year and occurred in 1962 to the best of Subject's memory,
Subject was reasonably sure of this date because of the "Missile
crisis" and President Kennedy's death which occurred later.

AMCLEVE-15 was contacted by Oscar C. KALBING again on 2 February
1968. AMCLEVE-15 is willing to provide the Station with any information
that comes his way in CIRASH, and the Station has agreed to pay him' 1000
per month for such information.
2. We will, of course, handle ANCLEVE-15 as a "hostile", as requested
in Reference A, although we do not share Headquarters' alarm concerning
ARCLEVE–15's possible engagement in härassment of communists. This is not
the type of activity that we would choose for ANCLEVE-15, of course; and,
as stated in Heference C, we had intended to advise him to stay clear of
it in order not to jeopardise his position with CIRASH-4. We will not
discuss this with him now, however, and risk exposing the source, CIRASH-15,
to a "hostile". While we would hope, if we did talk to AMCLEVE-15 about
these activities and asked his to desist, that he would comply, we would
not be overly surprised if he did not. We are only fooling ourselves if
we think that agents, whom we like to consider we "control", are telling
us everything they do.
3. At the risk of belaboring the point, it is precisely because he is
the kind of person that he is that AMCLEVE-15 is able to become the trusted
confidant of people like CIRASH-4, CIRASH-6, Remberto UZCATEGUI and Gustávo
ORTIZ, all of whom may be considered somewhat unsavory characters but who,
whether or not we like it, run an important part of the security system in
Venezuela. And it is precisely because of ANCLEVE-151s position as such
trusted confidant that we are interested in him.
4. He will attempt to ascertain ANCLEVE-15's motives, as requested in
Reference A, but this task will be considerably hampered by our need to
1 handle him as a "hostile", which will preclude the use of some of the basic
tools of investigation, such as the SGSWIRL and the levying of requirements.

After this discussion the question read: "Is it probably that
your relatives (brothers) are working for PBRUMEN Intelli-
gence? Answer: Yes. "
Did you know your brother (IDEN D) was working with IDEN G
before we told you? Answer: No. But again had some
suspicions.
Besides the letters we asked you to send to your brothers have
you communicated with anyone in PBRUMEN? Answer: Yes.
His mother about two or three times a year and with an aunt
named IDEN H which was the person to whom he actually
addressed the letter to his brother which WOFIRM asked him
to write. This letter incidentally was posted in 1967 (a fow
months before coming to Caracas) and not 1966 as noted in
Station files. Since arrival in Caracas, Subject has written
his mother only once and had the letter posted from Miami to
prevent anyone knowing his exact whereabouts. (In addition
to these contacts, Subject has sent one telegram to his mother
soon after the IDEN I just to let her know he was alright.) It'
was abɩut this time that IDEN E wrote to him and criticized
his participation in IDEN I.
no.
Have you seen either of your brothers since 19617 Subject answered
Last saw IDEN E at the airport in the distance but there
were employees from IDEN E's place of employment present
and IDEN E was apparently reluctant to go near the plane. Since
1961 Subject has not seen any member of his family and as time
goes on dues not miss them as much. The persons he claims to
have been closest to were his aunt and grandmother and addresses
comments to them personally when he does write to his mother.
When further discussing his brothers on this question, Subject
was somewhat complimentary despite their differing political
views and generally considered them as hard-working energetic
types with good school records.
Do you have a secret means of contacting anyone in PBRUMEN?
Claims he knows of friends who have used telegrams to transmit
coded messages but he has never engaged in such activity. These
messages were directed against the PBRUMEN,

5. No are attaching copies of some of the reports that ANCLEVE-15
passed at his first moeting with a Station case officer on 22 January 1968.
At the second moeting he said he would try to obtain for us copies of the
interrogation of Antonio ROMERO Colis, of CICLOSE face, and the report from
the CIVISTA agent who recently returned from Cuba (800 MADRID-3121 and
CARACAS-8318). ANCLEVE-15 is only now really getting deeply into his work
with CIRASH, having just settled his family into an apartment on 1 February
1968, and he expects to be able to furnish a great deal more in the near
future. In spite of the problems inherent in some of MCLEVE-15's friend-
ships and peripheral activities, we are hopeful that this is going to be a
productive and valuable operation for the Caracas Station.
