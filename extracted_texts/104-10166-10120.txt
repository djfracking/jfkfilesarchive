MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG
SUBJECT:
James C. Wray
OGC 68-0374
5 March 1968
1. I called Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason
for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA
Del Valle's patent application. At that time Wray had stated that as a
patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application
pending on which some $140 in fees was due.
2. Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several
years ago to file an application concerned with a high speed boat on
which a patent was ready to issue upon payment of $140 in filing fees.
He stated further that as a consequence of CUESTA's subsequent capture
he had been unable to communicate with him and that he had failed in his
efforts to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility for the
fees. Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had no
responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called us merely
as a matter of last resort.
3. I found Wray's description of the boat's configuration and
attributes to be interesting. While emphasizing that we had no re-
sponsibility for his client's present situation or for his fees, I suggested
that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications. Wray
accepted this suggestion. My thought here was that an item of this nature
might be of interest to SOD/Maritime Branch.

[This report was developed by an Air Force AFXIN representative assigned
to the office of preparation.).

1. My secretary recently returned from a 17-day visit to Havana, Cuba.
Through conversation, with her, I learned of her visit and permission
visit her husband, Antonio Cuesta Valle, a political prisoner of the
Cuban government.
2. Cuesta, who was active in an anti-GOC movement, was taken prisoner on
29 May 66 in company of four other men, while on an infiltration vission.
While trying to escape he supposedly blew up his boat and as a result of
the explosion he lost his left hand at the wrist. He was captured along
with Eugenio Saldivar Cadena, and both are presently hold prisoners at
the Military Hospital in Marianao, Havana.
While in Havana she was permitted, on a daily basis, to visit with her
husband in his hospital cell. She was permitted to visit alone with him
on one occasion in a room that had several mirrors and for a period of
approximately 15 minutes. The remainder of her visits were in the
presence of her assigned escort or the guard assigned to her husband's
ward. She knew her escort as "Infante," and he was always dressed in
civilian clothes. He was most polite and courteous at all times. She
was told what hours she could visit her husband by phone each specific
day, and her escort would pick her up and take her to the hospital.
I was told that her husband has been given the best treatment available
and that he had no complaints in that respect. He is suffering from
advanced active cataracts and is almost blind. He has been treated by
two Soviet doctors, but due to the language barrier proper treatment was
not administered and the Soviets became very angry at the nurses at the
hospital. Considering his background he is being treated like a VIP.
He was told that a Cuban specialist is going to take his case in the near
future. Ho said that his food is very good and generous servings are the
order of the day. By direct order of Fidel he is furnished a box of the
best oigars, and they are replenished each time the box becomes empty.
During a Sunday afternoon he and his wife were taken to the beach,
complete with a picnic lunch, in company of four guards that kept a
distance of about 100 foxi,

Honorable J. Waker Yeagley
Assistant Attorney General
Department of Justice
Washington 25. D. C.
Dear Mr. Yeagley:
By letter of 5 January 1966, you advised that the Department is
contemplating prosecutive action against certain individuels involved in
the hit-and-run raid conducted in the Havana Harbor area in November
1965. In this connection, you requested our comments relative to any
past or current interest this Agency might have had or has in Antonio
CUESTA Del Valle and whether disclosure of that interest in the event
of prosecution would be detrimental to its operations. In addition, you
also requested to be advised whether this Agency has or ever had an
operational interest in Jorge MAS Canosa or his anti-Castro organi-
sation, the Cuban Representation In Exile (RECE).
This Agency has no present operational interest in CUESTA or
MAS, although it did have in times past. We do not believe that disclo-
sure of these past interests would have any serious consequences for
the Agency.
For your information, with 303 Committee approval, this Agency-
does have a relationship with the RECE pursuant to which limited financial
support is provided for the maintenance of its Miami office. While MAS
should not be knowledgeable of this fact, any statements he might munke
should not affect our relationship with that organisztion.
Sincerely,
SIGNED

Justice interest. He said that Justice was now waiting for an

1. According to Luis Diaz, a member of Comandos t, a militant Cuban
exile organization, Antonio Cuesta del Valle has been in Puerto
Rico for several months attempting to set up a camp there for
training Cuban exiles. He has also been attempting to obtain
permission from the Dominican Republic to use the Dominican
camp which was used by Eloy Gutierrez Menɔyo, a military leader
of the Segundo Frente Nacional del Escambray (SFNE, Second
National Front of the Bacambray), and has been making regular:
tripe to the Dominican Republic from Puerto Rico for that purpose.
On 3 February 1965, Ramon Font Saumell, second in command of
Comandos L, told Diaz that the recent accusations made against
the top Dominican military personnel by Gutierrez after his
capture in Cuba in January had jeopardized his organization's
good relations with the Dominican Government.
