Dear Mr. Richmond,
At the direction of the Deputy Director for Plans
you served from 6 November to 17 November 1972 as a
member of the Clandestine Service Nonofficial Cover Board
Sub-Panel convened for the purpose of evaluating-GS-12
Staff and Career Agent personnel under nonofficial cover.
I know that this work was particularly demanding. Your full-
time participation and the diligent application of your
professional experience were decisive factors in the successful
accomplishment of this aspect of the Nonofficial Cover Board's
missions.
I wish to commend you personally for your contribution
to our evaluation procedures each phase of which helps to
strengthen the Clandestine Service Career Service.
A copy of this letter will be included in your official
personnel file.
Robert P. We

Dear Pete.
I want to thank you personally for your fine work as a
member of the GS-15 Evaluation Board which convened from 15 May
to 16 June 1972. I know that this work has been particularly
demanding. Your full-time participation and diligent application
of your professional experience have been decisive factors in
the successful accomplishment of the Board's missions. I know
that your recommendations will provide a reliable base for the
Clandestine Service Career Service Board and myself in arriving
at a final promotion list.
Your wise and energetic participation in the evaluation
process has helped to strengthen the Clandestine Service by
objectively identifying those officers whose performance,
qualifications and potential mark them as especially-fitted
for senior positions of leadership...

During the past reporting period Mr. Wheeler has
served his first full year as Chief of the newly-created
Nonofficial Cover Affairs Division. He has worked hard
and long to improve and simplify the procedures through
which we recruit, train, and deploy our nonofficial cover
personnel. He has identified accurately the bureaucratic.
roadblocks that stand in the way of our efficient use of
nonofficial cover and if he has not succeeded in removing.
these barriers he has made some progress. His enthusiasin
for the job and his belief that it can be done have been
invaluable during a formative period, and his performance:
on the whole has been a strong one.

:
During the first part of the reporting period, Mr. Wheeler
served as Chief, Missions and Programs Staff, and on 17 January
1972 he assumed his new duties as Chief, Non-Official Cover Affairs
Division. As Chief, MPS, Mr. Wheeler effectively supervised the
important planning and budgetary functions of that office and under
his leadership the Clandestine Service has considerably improved
its programming presentations to the 7th floor and, due to the
effective staff work and Mr. Wheeler's guidance, the area divisions
have been largely relieved of the many questionnaires and inter-
ventions with which they were once plagued.
:
Mr. Wheeler took over his new duties as Chief, NOCAD
with enthusiasm and his wide field experience, and good relation-
ahips with the area divisions should in the future bring about-a
much more secure and imaginative employment of our non-official

Unfortunately a heart attack during the past
year slowed Mr. Wheeler down for a while but he has made a
good recovery and his performance on the whole has been very
strong.

5. Mr. Wheeler also has the gift of being able to absorb rapidly
and commit to paper accurately and quickly, a characteristic and asset
of his which has much to commend it,
6. He has been a superb deputy, acting in this capacity in my
absence. He has excellent recall, is a gifted administrator, and has
introduced a number of procedural changes that have increased MP8
effectiveness. He has been effective in dealing with OPPB and in par-
ticipation in the briefings of Office of Manageinent and Budget (OMB)
personnel. He is very cost conscious and has made several suggestions
resulting in the saving of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Wheeler
has always enthusiastically accepted assignments to panels designed to
upgrade the quality of various trouble areas, the latest being the search-
ing look into the nonofficial cover situation within the CS.
7. Mr. Wheeler is a searching individual who is totally com-
mitted to the Plans Directorate and has the high regard of most of the
elements comprising the Clandestine Services,
8. As I have previously recommended, I believe Mr. Wheeler
would make an outstanding Chief of the Missions and Programs Staff.

has never passed up an opportunity informally to discuss
PPBS, to lecture at formal courses and to assist the DDP/
TRO in his exhortations for management training. He has
been a strong leader as Chairman of the Program Review
Panel and supervisor of his subordinates. He has been
outstanding in his ability rapidly to gather facts and
produce a document in response to program and management
queries levied on MPS. His wide CS experience, affability,
sincerity, intelligence and dedication to the missions of
the Agency, all of which have continued to be in evidence
during the reporting period, make Mr. Wheeler, in the
opinion of the Rating Officer, one of the CS' most valuable
officers.

Fitness Report (Annual)
Robert P. Wheeler
7 APR 1969.
1. In compliance with HR 20-20, this memorandum is
submitted in lieu of Fitness Report Form 45 covering the
performance of Mr. Wheeler from January 1968 to 31 March
1969.
2. In late 1967 it was determined that Mr. Wheeler
would be reassigned in June 1968 from the Office of
Planning, Programming and Budgeting (OPPB) to the Missions
and Programs Staff (MPS). Under an arrangement with the
Director of PPB, Mr. Wheeler was lent to MPS on 1 January
1968 for the purpose of preparing himself to assume the
functions of Chief of the Programs Group (PRG) in MPS.
Accordingly, what follows covers the period of the loan,
from 1. January to 11 June 1968, and the period as Chief,
PRG, from 12 June 1968 to 31 March 1969.
3. From 1 January to 11 June 1968. During the
period of loan to HPS, Mr. Wheeler understudied the then
Chief of PRG, acquainted himself with all Group files
and responsibilities, attended the Advanced Management
(Planning) Seminar and performed numerous ad hoc tasks
assigned him by C/MPS. He prepared himself for the new..
assignment and performed the ad hoc tasks assigned with
such dispatch, enthusiasm and intelligence as to augur
well for the future. No minor task was too menial; every
major task was readily accepted as a challenge. In short,
his preparation for the new position soon to be assumed
left little to be desired on the part of the Rating Officer.
4. From 12 June 1968 to 31 March 1969. As Chief of
PRG, Mr. Wheeler is responsible for, inter alia, liaison.
on non-budgetary matters between the CS and OPPB; in-
stalling the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System
(PPBS) within the CS: advising and assisting CS components
in the preparation of Operating Directives and the program

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT:
Mr. Robert P. Wheeler, GS-16, O/PPB,
Employee Serial No. 060947, D Career Service
REFERENCE: HR 20-20c(2)
1. In accordance with reference, this memorandum is submitted
in lieu of a Fitness Report (Form 45). This is an annual report but in
view of Mr. Wheeler's transfer to the Missions and Programs Staff,
DD/P, in January 1968, it covers only the period April 1967 through.
December 1967.
2. Mr. Wheeler's assignment as Program Analyst involved:
(a) reviewing and evaluating Agency activities, principally covert action.
programs; (b) participating in special in-depth studies of selected Agency.
activities; (c) preparing the Covert Action Program Memorandum for

ing the Program Review Panel; preparing and/or coordinating
special studies and surveys on operational programs; and,
as required, advising CS components on the requirements of
PPBS that need to be addressed in CS documents requiring
DCI or Executive Director-Comptroller action.
:
5. In carrying out the functions enumerated in para-
graph 4, above, Mr. Wheeler has displayed drive, initiative,
enthusiasm and understanding. He has pushed within the CS
on those concepts of PPBS that are considered applicable
to an intelligence organization and has argued with OPPB
against forcing the CS to apply those concepts which are
not considered to be applicable. He has worked diligently,
alone and with the assistance of the DDP/TRO, to spread
throughout the CS an understanding of the why and how of
PPBS. He has prepared himself well for and has exercised
sound judgment and tact in the handling of the chairman-
ship of the Program Review Panel, on the actions of which
he has brought to bear his experiences in OPPB. He has
given unstintingly of his time to lecturing at Agency.
management courses when requested. Although he understands
the need for flexibility in the CS, he has to be slowed
down at times so anxious is he to make the CS the best
managed directorate in the Agency. His sincere interest
in good management has made him and the two senior officers.
he supervises cost conscious. This affable, conscientious,
dedicated, highly experienced, intelligent employee, who
already has given evidence of a strong performance, is a
pleasure to collaborate with and a valuable asset to MPS
and the CS.

Employee Serial No. 060947, D Career Service
REFERENCE: HR 20-20c(2)
1.
In accordance with reference, this memorandum is submitted
in lieu of a Fitness Report (Form 45). This is an annual report and covers
the period 1 August 1966 through 31 March 1967.
2. Mr. Wheeler's assignment as Program Analyst involves:
(a) reviewing and evaluating Agency activities or programs, principally
in the areas of clandestine collection and covert action; (b) participating.
in special in-depth studies of selected Agency activities; (c) preparing
Program Memoranda for the Director's approval and submission to the
Bureau of the Budget; (d) keeping abreast of Agency plans, programs;
and progress toward defined objectives; (c) providing general staff assist-
ance to the Director/PPB in implementing the Agency PPB system; and
(f) preparing special presentations and correspondence for the Office of
the Director.
3. Mr. Wheeler has many years of experience in clandestine
operations and administration, both at Headquarters and in the field. This
experience has proven to be of great value to this Office in assessing Agency
activities. Mr. Wheeler has been quick to see the usefulness of the new
planning, programming, and budgeting concept as a tool for assisting man-
agement at all levels in the Agency. He has enthusiastically supported the
development of a system adapted to Agency needs and has made significant
contributions toward this end.
4. Currently, Mr. Wheeler is participating in three studies of
Ageney activities: an Inspector General survey of Agency proprietary
organizations and two studies which were requested by the Bureau of the
Budget--Agency use of communications media for political-psychological
programs and Agency air capabilities at two selected facilities. In addi-
tion, Mr. Wheeler is in the process of preparing a Program Memorandum
for the Director's approval which presents Agency Covert Action plans and
programs for the next five years.

·
I thought that from abroad, general standpoint the orientation was worthwhile.
but that far more BOB participation would have enhanced the program greatly.
There was too much of "we think this is what BOB means" and too little of
BOB saying "this is what we mean". I found the movie presentation of Dr. E.
S. Quade's speech terrible because of inept projection, faulty audio equipment,
☐☐ and out-of-place music. Dr. Quade had a message and fortunately the CSC
planners must have known their film was inadequate, for we were provided
with the written text. Outstanding possibly because he stood out so far in
comparison to the others was Mr. Peter Szanton from BOB. Dr. Adams from
the University of Maryland was quite good and Mr. Greenhouse of VA was one
of the few others who really seemed to know what he was talking about beyond
Immediate low to medium level parochial application.

establishment of liaisons, and the orientation of his two

he has not been at work long enough to provide a basis for any

Annual Report For the Period 1 April 1963 - 31 March 1964
Subject
In preparing this memorandum in lieu of submitting Fitness Report Form 45,
is a senior,
I can only set forth my yearly reiteration that
well-experienced, wall-motivated, high caliber KUBARK officer who has been in
his present grade, 08-15, since 1957. His high standard of contribution to
the Station as its Deputy Chief of Station continuos unfailingly. Tokyo Station
operations encompass a broad spectrum of internal and external targets
r
zing denied area operations. To keep on top of this activity it needs
of energy backed up by sound operational knowledge and Subject has carried
this job capably and with a will. I would certainly grade him "S" in performance
evaluation.
Tokyo Station is widely dispersed and I have urged Subject on several
occasions to get out to the various operational elements in an attempt to gat
closer to and stimulate the working case officers. After one or two starts he
has not kept this up on a continuing basis, remaining at his Embassy desk and
I am convinced more
invariably working through the individual branch chiefs.
offort on his part in this field could have resulted in more yield to the
Station from his long area and operations experience.
Subject actively participates in the operational review and budget
preparation of the Station and has show a definite cost consciousness.
Subjectle long tenure in Japan and experience with things Japanese are
well-known and the pro's and con's of the value of an officer remaining in one
area for the major portion of his time with KUBARK (possibly to the detriment
of his career) have been discussed to a sufficient degree as to rule out
further reference in this memorandum. Subjectio scheduled to leave the Japan
Station and enter an assignment where his operational talents will be of great
value.
In any considerations concerning Subject being conducted by any personnel
bourd or by any official of the Agency interested in KUMARK personnel, the
significant points are Subject is a deeply motivated, highly capable officer
who has been in his current grade too long.

This memorandum was read by Subject and discussed
with him in draft. He left the area on TDY and so

1. During the past year it has clearly emerged that the
Honolulu area offers very limited opportunities for CS opera-
tional action. The main target of a Honolulu base, as originally.
Do
conceived by FE Division, was the East-West Center with its
large number of Asian students. Although, during the 1964-65
academic year several prospectivo candidates for the WUENVOY
program were assessed and one recruited, political developments
in Southeast Asia prevented the arrival of any students at the
Burma,
Center from the priority Southeast Asian countries:
Cambodia, Indonesia.
2. It is against this perspective that Subject's performance
during the past year should be evaluated. He approached his job

His comments are as stated below:
Mr. Wheeler is a superior operations officer of wide scope,
experience and imagination. He has over a period of years been.
highly successful in a variety of supervisory roles both operational
and staff. In addition to these attributes he has unique qualifications

A review of the file reflects that
constantly rated as a well-motivated, superior officer always
willing to spend the "extra effort" by a variety of supervisors.
During the rating period there has been no diminution in the
caliber of professionalism or in the time and effort this man has
contributed to the work of the Tokyo Station. He is a distinct
agret. Over and above his drive and professionalism,
brings to the Station a full background concerning intelligence
activities having been associated with such activities in Japan
for the last seventeen years, either with the military or as a
member of the Agency. All of this time he has been in Japan
except for a period of almost three years in Washington.

has a proficiency in the Japanese language and due
to his long tenure in Japan has contacts at a variety of levels.

In sum, the Agency has in
a superior officer with
long background and continuity in Japan, who can and is making a
highly significant contribution to the Agency's objectives in
Japan.
The above has stressed solely
ability to contributo
to KUBARK objectives in Japan. However, there is no doubt in the
rater's mind that
could perform in a superior manner no
matter to what geographical area he was assigned.

PH'61
Subject is a superior officer in every important respect. He is
intelligent, imaginative, resourceful and has balanced judgment. He
understands administrative procedures and knows how to makem
work. As a supervisor, he is firm and fair, and achieves the respect
of his subordinates. As a subordinate, he is unfailingly loyal and
helpful. He has a good overall grasp of the intelligence business and
maintains a healthy attitude of common sense with respect to operations.
He is especially useful in Japan, because of his great knowledge of and
long experience with Japanese affairs, personalities and psychology,
yet I consider he would be a superior officer and supervisor in any
other context. His personal character is of the best.

This is the first Fitness Report made by Rating Officer on Subject since
the latter assumed duties as Deputy for Operations, Tokyo Station.. He has
worked out extremely well in this role. He is intelligent, energetic, hard-
worlding and faultlessly loyal. He pays attention to detail while remaining
mindful of larger considerations. He is effective as a supervisor and
commands the willing allegiance of his subordinates. He has excellent
judgment in both administrative and operational matters. Because of his
extensive background in Japan, his knowledge of things and people Japanese
and his fair-to-good command of the language, he is particularly well suited.
for his present position. However, he would be an asset to any station or
element of Headquarters in a high supervisory position.

fine in his dealings with people whether superiors or subordinates. He did an
excellent job as a member of the FE Division Staff in improving and expediting
the FI and CI activities of the Division. Subject has an excellent background in
all things Japanese and is extremely adept at building rapport with his Japanese

He has the capacity to handle large volumes of work which many times

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Fitness Report on Robert P. WHEELER
1. The attached Fitness Report should be read with the following
facts in mind. The Rating Officer arrived in the Japan Station on
21 January 1956. Mr. Wheeler left Japan on or about 19 March 1956 and
8
was in the United States on TDY until 8 May 1956. From 6 May until he
left Japan PCS on 7 June 1956, Mr. Wheeler was unassigned in the Japan
Station. While the Rating Officer was Chief of Operations, Japan Station,
Mr. Wheeler was in his assigned position simultaneously for less than one
month and it is my understanding Mr. Wheeler did not report to Mr.
Hecksher, but directly to the Chief of Station.
2. I question, therefore, whether Mr. Wheeler was under the Rating
Officer's direct supervision for a sufficient period of time to insure
that the attached report is a complètely equable one. Inasmuch as the
Chief of Station reviewed this report and made no comment, I am in no
position to take issue with it, but suggest that it be viewed in the
context of other Fitness Reports on Mr. Wheeler.

23 February 1971
Secretary, CSCS Board
Recommendation for Promotion
Robert P. Wheeler
->
:
"
1. As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want
to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrenco
and recommendation to two (2) recorded recommendations for
the promotion of Robert P. Wheeler to the grade GS-17. I
find it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation
for this action than that forwarded by my predecessor in
June 1969 (Attached). I can imagine Mr. Mitchell's feeling
when he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970.
(Attached). And yet, I find in February 1971 there has still
been no action. In the year that has passed this promotion
has become even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-
appointmont accompanying such a continuing lack of recogni-
tion, there has been no diminution of enthusiasm, no lowering
of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed because
of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-
dations not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude
that those in control simply do not know what this officer
does and has done. Knowing what he does and how he does it
should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my
strongest recommendation for early and favorable action..
2. This officer has performed in a most outstanding
manner, as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-
cessor, and certainly during my tenure as Chief, MPS for
the past 12 months.

ATTACHMENT TO FIELD REASSIGNMENT QUESTIONNAIRE:
+
:
Re Paragraph C
->>
Preference for Next Assignment:
1. I would like to state that while a tour at Headquarters
should be my preference I believe that for me to leave my cur-
rent assignment at this time for even one year would not be in
the best interests of either KUMARK or CDYOKE. Therefore, I'
request home leave, with approximately one month at Headquarters
for requested training and refresher work and one month of leave,.
returning to current assignment for at least an additional two-
year tour with the proviso that after the first year the situa-
tion be re-examined with the ultimate view of possibly at that
point considering a two-year tour at Headquarters.
2. In my years in work on Japan, approximately ten of
which have been spent consecutively in Japan, I feel that I
have been able to provide a certain degree of intelligence con-
tinuity which could be spoiled by a two-year break. Realizing
that career-wise I should spend at least one tour at Headquarters
in the Niture, I believe that, despite possible reflections
against my career, that two year period' should be delayed until
(a) KUBARK is better established in Japan and (b) the Japanese
governmental and economic situations are on more stable grounds.
I believe that I can play a major role in both those situations,
not because I have any special talent to offer but simply be-
cause I have the continuity which KUBARK as such lacks in Japan.
3. I believe that by experience, training and inclination
I can better serve KUMARK in this country in the type of work in
which I am new engaged than by any other assignment currently
on to me.

COMPRE
:
1. While the Reviewing Officer concure generally with statements made in this
report, it is felt that the over-all impression does not give Subject ou
much credit as he deserved. In the opinion of the Reviewing Officer, Subject's
faults are somewhat over-cmpulzod. Subject's qualities as exhibitod during
past months have proven to be outstanding, particularly in his excellent
judgemont in arriving at logical and workable solutions and in his stability.
under operational exigencies in which Subject has performed excoodingly
well undor heavy pressures of both time and responsibility.
1
2. Working in an area where, in the past, there has buen an unfortunate number
of misunderstandings betwoon UFC and KJGCNN components, and where there
have been the usual difficult personality conflicts, Subject has exhibited.
not only superior tact and diplomacy, but has also been able to smooth out
marry difficulties, and modify aggressively offensive actions. He has
supplied a needed cooperative spirit and sense of humor to prevent, in many
cause, serious antagonisms and unnecessary vituperation so detrimental to a
smooth working organisation. Subject's contribution to bringing about a
friendly, cooperative relationship within the mission and with outaldo
agencies including U.S. military organizations cannot be praised too highly.

IN FAIRNESS TO EMPLOYERS, COMFLISTED NARRATIVE EVALUATIONS
SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH EMPLOYEE CONCERNED
1. Employee is well qualified in substantive fields concerning Japan and the
long background of FEC Intolligence activity in this area. This knowledge,
serves him exceedingly well in the performance of assigned duties. What
knowledge he lacks concerning KUBARN policies or procedures is fast being
supplied by practical field experience.
2.
His judgment at arriving at logical solutions is good user normal con-
ditions, and ho generally comes up with solutions which are workable and
realistic.

which ho makes almost a fetish of meeting. In every sense of the word,
he is a man of action in terms of treating with the recurring problems of
the station.
4. Employee is what excitable and national and, thus, at times of unusu-

9 February 1970
Secretary, Clandestino Service
Career Service Board
Recommendation for the Promotion
of Kr. Robert P. Wheeler to GS-17
:
It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be
promoted to the grade GS-17.
1.
2.
By memorandum dated 5 June 1969 the undersigned
recommended ir. Wheeler for promotion. In that memorandum
was not out the career of Mr. Wheeler from the date he
completed college (1942) until June 1969, and was described
his wartime (1942-1946), immediate post-war (1946-1952)
and Agency (1952-to June 1969) experience, all in the field
of intelligence. Since it is the opinion of the undersigned
that the Board should have the benefit of all the tacts
stated in that memorandum and since there is no change in
the contents thereof, 1 hereby incorporate by reference
the memorandum of 5 June 1969, make it part hereof and
attach it hereto as a significant part of the present memo-
randum.
3. The time passed since 5 June 1969 has served only
to confirm my conviction in Mr. Wheeler's true value to the
CS. He has continued the strong leadership of the Program
Review Panel and his subordinates. His unbounded energy
and incessant championing of the applicable principles of
the PPB System have resulted in office chiefs or othior most
senior officials appearing before the last Program Review
Panel apparently interested and better prepared than ever
bofore. His obvious sincerity and friendly and intelligent
Approach to the job have convinced many of the need for
the better management of their affairs. This is no mean
accomplishment in a world where the normal human resents

even constructive criticism.
Mr. Wheeler is so dedicated
to making the CS the best managed component in the Agency
that he continues to spend his own carnings on books and
periodicals on the subject of management and to encourage
interested parties to read them and pass them on to others.
4. The undersigned is aware that for the past six (6).
months a private interest has dangled an impressive carrot
in front of Mr. Wheeler in an attempt to induce him to:
retire and represent overseas the interests of that private
concern. This fact is not to be considered by the Board
as a sword of Damocles. It is simply to bring to the
Board's attention that if a promotion at this time should
serve to dissuade Mr. Wheeler from accepting the profiered
job, the Board would have been instrumental in retaining

SUBJECT
Head of Career Service
Retirement Planning
1. In order to assist employees in planning for their eventual retire-
ment, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each employee at a point in
service five years prior to the date of scheduled retirement. I am, therefore,
taking this opportunity to advise you that you are scheduled to retire in
October 1975...
.
2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of
life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency
will make available to you various resources which are attuned to the needs
of prospective retirees. In October 1970, the Agency will conduct a Retiro-
ment Information Seminar to which you will be invited. Your spouse, if you
are married, may accompany you to this seminar. Following the seminar, you
will be invited by the Retirement Counselor for your Directorate to an .
individual pro-retirement counseling session (or more than one, if you wish);
this phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own per
ticular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the
retirement system under which you will retire, The individual counseling)
sessions are intended to give you a vide range of information on such matters
as estimates of your annity, survivor benefits, life and health insurance,
Social Security takkes, relocation and movement of household effects and
assistance in obtaining other employment, if appropriate. In addition to the
sessions with your Retirement Counselor, you will be invited to amil yourself.
of selected literature on all aspects of retirement.
3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the scheduled
date, or who wish to commence their planning as early as possible, prefer to
work with their Retirement Counselor vell before the time he would normally
contact them. If you believe you would benefit from such an earlier start
on your personal planning, you are invited to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate. He is assigned from your Directorate to
the Retirement Affairs Division, 212 Nagazine building in Rosslyn, on telephone
extension 3328..
4. Experience has amply demonstrated that careful planning facilitates
the transition_to-retirement. I recommend, strongly, that you avail yourself
of the services the Agency offers you in placing your own retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert P. Wheelor
THROUGH
SUBJECT
1. Administrative Officer, MPS
1 Purchase of Service Credit.
13 MAR 1970
:
1. This is to advise you that your application to purchase
service credit under the CIA Retirement and Disability System has
been processed. The amount of $437.00 will be required to purchase
credit for the period 18 June 1946 through 17 June 1947 when no deduc-
tions were withheld from your salary. Under the current provisions..
of the CIA Retirement System, payment of the above amount will in-
crease your annuity by approximately 2 per cent of your high-three
average salary at the time of retirement. The amount due includos
interest to the present date.
3. It should be explained that under the CIA Retirement and
Disability System, all periods of creditable Federal civilian service
during which retirement deductions were not taken from salary must
ba, purchased by making a deposit in order for the time to be counted
in the computation of the retirement annuity. Under the Civil Service
Retirement System, such periods of Federal service are always
creditable in the computation of annuity, but if not purchased, the
annuity is reduced by 10 per cent of the amount due. For example,
if a deposit of $1,000 in required to purchase credit for those periods
of service during which no deductions were withheld from salary, and
It is not paid, the basic annuity would be reduced by $100 per year,
If the deposit of $1,000 is paid, the retired would have to wait 10 years
to recover his own deposit before profiting from the payment.

3. The Agency has as an aim: legislatively to secure the
Civil Service option, 1.0., credit for periods of non-deduction
service without prior payment therefor, but with reduction of the
basic annuity by 10 per cent of the amount due. Therefore, you may
wish to consider deferring payment. You should be aware that the
interest on the amount duo will continue to accumulate at the rate of
For example,
3 per cent compounded annually if you decide to defer.
If it would take $1,000 to purchase credit today, the amount due one
year later would be $1, 030.
4. After consideration of the above options, if you wish to
purchase credit for the period of non-deduction service noted in
paragraph 1, please make your check payable to the Treasurer of the
United States and forward it to the Chief, Retirement Operations
Branch, 205 Magazine Building. If you prefer, you may mako
Installment payments or arrange for bi-weekly payroll allotments of
$25,00 or multiplos theroof. A receipt showing a statement of your”
account will be sent to you acknowledging each payment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS Career Service Board
SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion to GS-16,
Mr. Robert P. Wheeler.
1. It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be promoted
to GS-16. He has been in grade since December 1957.
2. Mr. Wheeler is serving as Deputy Chief of Station, Tokyo.
To this post he has brought his depth of knowledge of things Japanese,
gained over many years of concentration on this subject. He has
also brought his operational ability and his personal capability of
operating among significant Japanese leaders. He has been of major
value through a most difficult period of very substantial reduction
of the station's staff and the termination of many of its functions.
While Mr. Wheeler may have spent much of his time on things
Japanese, he has also served as Chief, FI, for FE Division in which
post.he demonstrated his ability to operate on non-Japanese matters.
with force, intelligence and dispatch.
3. For these reasons it is recommended that Mr. Wheeler be
promoted to GS-16.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS Career Service Board
SUBJECT:
Recommendation for Promotion to GS-16
-->
Mr. Robert P. Wheeler
1. Mr. Wheeler stands Number Four on the Division's list
of recommended promotions to GS-16. Mr. Wheeler is 47 years old
and has been in grade since December 1957. Most of Mr. Wheeler's
Agency career has been devoted to the Japanese scene although he
served one tour most commendably as Chief Fl for the FE Division.
He is now Deputy Chief of Station, Tokyo, and is an operations officer
and executive of the highest quality. In addition to bearing a very large
share of the administrative burden of a big station, Mr. Wheeler has
acquired a collection of Japanese friends and contacts in important
governmental and business circles unequaled, I believe, by any other
inember of the official American community in Tokyo. Although he
has exploited these contacts most effectively for Agency and U.S.
Governmental purposes, it is the plan of the FE Division to give freer
rein to Mr. Wheeler's operations. In this field by arranging, carefully
and deliberately, unofficial cover for Mr. Wheeler which will permit
him to devote a greater share of his time to the exploitation of this most
important section of Japanese society. We believe that his very con-
siderable talent as en administrator can be adequately replaced but
that his standing among the Japanese and his capability for operational
exploitation of his advantages are unique. I believe that Mr. Wheeler
can well be considered to be the prototype of the high ranking staff officer
wiso can forego bureaucratic advancement for a purely operational career
under deep cover in one area.
F
2. On the basis of his proven ability and past performance as well
as his seniority 1 believe Mr. Wheeler to be fully qualified for promotion

Recommendation for Promotion
from GS-14 to 08-15
1. Mr. Wheeler entered on duty with CIA on 28 September 1952
as a GB-14. He had, previous to that, served in a distinguished
manner with the C-2 Section of the Army in Japan in the early days
of the occupation. His name was submitted for promotion by the
Chief of the Japan Station in November 1955. He entered on duty.
at Headquarters an Deputy Chief of the Japan Eranch in September 1956.
In April, 1957 he became Acting Branch Chief and has been serving in
this position in a superior manner. He in 41 years of age and has
been in grade with the Agency for 4 years.
"
4
2. A review of Mr. Wheeler's Fitness Reports will adequately
reflect his strength and weaknesses, with the possible exception
of the most recent one dated 7 July 1956, in which, in the under-
signed a opinion, the rating officer did not have adequate time to
fairly rate Hr. Wheeler. Granting hip occasional tendency to
allow his emotions to color his work, he is, nevertheless, one of
the hardest working and generally capable officern I have been
associated with. He has great ability in dealing with people, he
is an accurate and meticulous reporter, and he is adjusting rapidly
to the requirements of his job in Headquarters and is turning in al
most effective performance. In view of the length of time in grade,
his age, and above all his performance, I strongly recommend Mr.
Wheeler for promotion. from CS-14 to 05-15. It is planned in the
near future to appoint Kr. Wheeler Chief of the Foreign Intelligence
Staff of the FE division, a most responsiblo GS-15 position.

a. Deputy for
KUFICE and b. Chat of Liaison.. These two positions will be described
separately.
2. Deputy KUFIRS, Japan Base
As the title implies, incumbent is Deputy Chief, Japan Base for KUFIRE
activitios, a position comparable to the Deputies for Administration and
KUGOMI activities. As such, incumbent is the responsible officer for
the KUTIES activities of the Japan Base, responsible to the Chief and Deputy
Chief of Base. These responsibilities include the originating, planning
and supervision of the execution of all Japan Base Ki E activities under
the broad supervision of the Chief of Base, guided and directed by KUMRK
KUFIRE regulations such as the SOI and the TRID. Incumbent supervises
the work of approximately twenty persons ranging in grado from 8-13 to
GS-5 and including such persons as the KUNIRS operations officer, the
special projects officer, the chiefs of the Kurl E soctions of the Sase.
It is incumbent's Further responsibility, generally on the initiative of
the Deputy for Administration, to handle certain porconal matters for
FIRE personnel, matters such as efficiency reports, promotion actions,
disciplinary actions, etc. Incumbent also represents the Baso on all
KUMINE matters, being charged, for example, with most KURE relations
with higher echelons, such as thin Sondor Representative, A, and laterally
with KUFIHE elements of adjacent Rises. As one of five Deputies, incua-
bent assists in setting Base policy, determination of personal assignments,
determination of work assignments, determination of the operational pri-
orities (again under the guidance and direction of KUBARK Headquarters),
and, generally with the Chief of Base but often on his own responsibility,
represents the FITE aspects of the Rose and of KUTAK so far na Jagan is

senfor military officers of all three services and various branch and soc-

activities involves MUULE nattern of high importance. One of the
primary direct responsibilities of incumbent is the origination of KHURK
Maison with these agencies and of equal import is the maintenances of
good Maison relationships, stepping in there there is potential trouble,
where policy decisions have to be mide, where new departures in Haison
are necessary (such as joint operational activities, with other Par or
other ODYOKE agencies).
4. Inherent in both of the current assignments is the planning and review:
function which are both so necessary to effective and continued agura-
tions. This includes the initiation of PPOP's and review o the orig
Anated by personnel under the supervision of incumbent; Included also
is operational review and critical analysis of all KUFI operational
and Rase liaison activities.
5. In addition to the above Ninctions and responsibilities, incumbent is
also the case officer for one political KUFIRE oporation.
6. Aside from the above general description of Incumbent's duties and respon-
sibilities the following seems portinent; incumbent has been on duty
in Japan, with minor interruptions, since September 1945 and in, this per-
fod, seven years was spent with 0-2 of the command (throughout its rany
changes). One result of this service has been an uninterrupted liaison
relationship with many Japanese agencies and more importantly JapanesA
personalities, while, on the other hand, at the same time there has been
a rather unique relationship with the Command and with personnel of the
Command (many of the DNS personnel with whom Kunank is now in Maison
20
are persons with whom incumbent has worked intimately at some period
throughout the past ten years, king for a naturalness of relationship
that has paid innumerable dividends). In rddition incumbant has special-
ized in things Japanuña ez some fifteen years, being nomazhat were than.
a heophyte in Japanese history, economies, language, destors and
Mud
traditions.

the good judgment displayed in anticipating and dealing with diffi-

the success of this operation, as well as the personal inconvenience
caused by your precipitate and prolonged departure from your family,
are fully appreciated. You are further commended on the demonstrated..
fact that this personal inconvenience in no way affected either your.
effectiveness or your contagious enthusiasm which contributed so much
to this operation.

lack therof which are cose partinent to the evaluation of this employne.
Outstanding assets and/or berious limitations should be stated, aloc reasons
for and recommendations as reassignment will be given if appropriate to
this report,
Subject officer is an outstanding addition to KUBARK as a general service
staff officer. He has the aggressive sense of urgency so necessary in any posi-
tion of responsibility together with the necessary qualities of balance, under-
standing of human nature and sincerity of purpose. He would be an asset to any
branch, division or staff of KUBARK home office, and would be capable of assuming
almost any responsible position in an overseas post. If he has any weakness at
present, it is a lack of experience in covert operations; this can be overcome
before the expiration of his present tour..
