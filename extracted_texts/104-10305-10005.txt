Investigation in this matter is based on statements
made by the subject subsequent to his arrest in El
Texas on September 20, 1963, on a bank robbery o
Subject hinted that he might have been attempting to go
to Cuba and that he really did not have the intention of
robbing the State National Bank but committed the act due
to the direction he had taken toward going to Cuba. A
notebook which the subject had on his person when arrested
made reference to Medical Aid to Cuba, Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, the names of purported CIA Agents and other
information.
The April 6, 1960 edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement
announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City
and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate "the
truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the
distorted American press
"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961.
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United
States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on
January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified
himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC.
He also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the
Cuban Government which were applied toward the cost of
the afore-mentioned advertisement.
:
On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the first
two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers
Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the
FPCC and thereby influence FPCC policy. However, during
the past year this source observed there has been a
successful effort by FPCC leadership to minimize the
role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so
that today their influence is negligible.

conscious, confused and hostile, complaining of a pain in his
head The subject was depressed and expressed the wish that
he had died in the crash Subject had facial disfigurement
as a result of the crash. The subject was suspicious of

1955, the hostility had disappeared and his suspicions mad
been lessened. His responses at that time were regarded as

In 1960 the subject's sister, Mrs. GAMBERT, 8225
Grand Avenue, Elmhurst, Long Island, New York, indicated that
the subject could then be contacted through Post Office
Box 76121, Sanford Station, Los Angeles, California.
She indicated that the subject had been discharged from the
United States Army in November, 1959. She also indicated
that the subject still complained of head injuries and when
he was tired he had a twitch in one eye as well as some loss
of mobility in his other eye
:
When contacted on September 30, 1963, EP T-1 was
of the opinion that the subject still apparently needed
psychiatric treatment. He said he was unable to evaluate
the subject's activities subsequent to 1955 in view of the
fact that no contacts had been made with the subject since
that time.

'
ALLEGATION:
Richard Case NAGELL, "a
highly decorated infantry
Captain in the Korean War",
alleges that he became a
CIA agent. He said he
fired the gun in the bank at
'
El Paso, Texas because he
wanted to be in custody when
the assassination of
President KENNEDY took
place. NAGELL charged
that "the FBI illegally
seized from him evidence
crucial to his defense,
such as notebooks containing
the names of certain CIA
employees, photographs, two
Mexican tourist cards (one
in the name of Joseph KRAMER,
the other in the name of
Albert HIDEL) and receipts for
registered mail, including the one
for the letter sent HOOVER
warning of the assassination.
NAGELL daimed he was in-
structed to "arrow" the
patsy, that is kill him
(OSWALD) after the assassi-
nation. He contended he
got cold feet and this was
his reason for the attempted
bank robbery, he would rather
be arrested than commit
murder and treason. The
article alleges that while it
was suggested in court that
an airplane crash NAGELL
survived mentally affected him,
he was given intelligence.
training after the crash.
Also, NAGELL complains he has
been salted away because of
what he knows.
CIA CONNECTION:
None; although, Subject was of
interest to OS in 1964 and early
1965 because of information
furnished to the Agency by the
FBI that he had in his possession
the names of six CIA employees
at the time of his arrest for bank
robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20
September 1963.

facilitate the return of his property Later on the same
day of July 25, 1962, the Police Department did return all
of his property except the automobile, which was returned

hopes to be reinstated so he can clear his name and then he
will resign his position. NAGELL advised that on the
evening of July 16, 1962, he was returning from Oxnard,
California. He noticed an automobile on two occasions
behind him, and at about 8:00 PM stopped his car on the
highway near Malibu, California. Two men from the car
jumped into his car They were dressed in business suits
and he thought at first they were police officers. One of
the men asked him where his gun was, and he told the man it
was locked in the glove compartment He gave this man the
key to his glove compartment, and while the man was opening
the compartment, NAGELL took his gun from his waist. The
man struggled with NAGELL for the gun and four shots were
fired, one hitting NAGELL in the chest. The man said that
if NAGELL had not grabbed for the gun he would not have been
shot.

September 28 1962 and October 1, 1962
On September 28, 1962, the subject appeared of his
own volition at the American Embassy, Mexico City
Mexico City, Mexico,
and volunteered the following information:
He
Although he declined to furnish a local residence
address for himself in Mexico City, he stated he could be
contacted through a friend named ARTHUR GREENSTEIN, Room
#415, Hotel Iuma, whom he said he contacts every day
also exhibited his Tourist Card Number 152087, which listed
his address as 4037 Leeward Avenue, Los Angeles, California
This card showed that it had been issued at Los Angeles on
August 17, 1962 and that NAGELL had entered Mexico through
August 24, 1962. The card also
reflected that he established his identification by
exhibiting United States Passport Number C526729.
Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 02
He related that he had formerly been employed
by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control of the
State of California as a Special Investigator He stated
that as a result of his investigation of some large cafes
and bars in the Los Angeles area, one of which he named as
the Mauna Loa, and some controversy which he had had with

officers of the Los Angeles Police Department during the
course of his investigations, he had been suspended on
June 8, 1962, and later on June 22, 1962, had been
dismissed.
He mentioned that on July 15, 1962 "while
making a meet" between Malibu and Oxnard, he had been shot
in the chest. In connection with this latter incident
he exhibited a brief newspaper clipping which mentioned
that he had refused completely to identify his assailants
or furnish information which would assist the police in
identifying and locating the person or persons involved
He stated further that on August 6, 1962, he had
withdrawn his request for a hearing so that he could get
the money which he alleged was due him from the State of
California, consisting of $800.00 retirement contributions
and $300.00 for unused accumulated leave.
He stated that he felt he had been "let down" by
the United States Government, both in the United States
and during the time he had been in Mexico. He stated that
representatives of the United States Government could have
assisted him in obtaining his money from the State of
California but were only interested in soliciting from
him information concerning hoodlums and other lawless
elements, for the giving of which information he "could
get his head blown off. He stated that he felt he had
been let down by the United States Government in Mexico
because nothing had been done by the Embassy in regard to
his requests to have it assist him in collecting this money
which he alleged was due him from the Stateof California

By way of further background, he claimed to have
served in the United States Army from August 5, 1948, (then
18 years old) until October 29, 1959, and had held the rank
of Captain between the ages of 22 and 29. He stated that
he had received an honorable discharge and had been wounded

He also mentioned that the Veterans Affairs Attache
in the American Embassy had his military record in connection
with a request he had previously made to attend Mexico City
College on the G.I. Bill, but to do that he would have to
enroll first and pay tuition himself which he could not do in
view of his financial straits.
He stated at first that he was behind in his hotel
bill but later indicated that he had been keeping his hotel
charges paid. He also mentioned that he had previously
obtained a small loan from the American Benevolent Society
which he had since repaid.
In regard to finances, he stated that he was
receiving $150.00 disability pension a month because of
wounds received in the Korean hostilities during which
he was wounded three times

He stated that he had come to the Embassy to
state his side in case something should happen and was
told that the statements he was making would be made a matter
of record with the Embassy He was advised not to do anything
he might regret, to which he replied, "What have 1 to lose?”
He stated that unless he received the $1,100.00 soon that the
State of California owed him, he was going to some other
country, and that it would not be the United States

It was noted that he was very tense, nervous
agitated and antagonistic throughout this interview.
On October 1, 1962, this same individual reappeared
at the American Embassy and wanted to know what had been done
in regard to his case. When asked what he meant by this,
he stated he meant in regard to getting the State of California
to pay him the money due him He was told that at his

made of record with the Embassy and he was assured that this
was being done. However, he was told that for any assistance
in regard to his financial situation in Mexico, he should
contact the Protection and Welfare Section to see if that
section could be of any assistance. At first he stated he
would not visit the Protection Section again, but on leaving
he stated he was going there and also asked what section

A short time later on October 1, 1962, he did
contact the Protection and Welfare Section, where he was
advised that the section could not intercede for him
in the collection of his alleged debt from the State of
California
Shortly thereafter he appeared in the Passport
and itizenship Section, where he refused to give his name
but asked what the penalty would be for going to an Iron
Curtain country and what effect it would have on his citizen-
ship. He was advised that such an action would be a violation
of Federal law
NAGELL, also on October 1, 1962, appeared in the
Office of Veterans Affairs, American Embassy, Mexico City
and stated that he was withdrawing his request for G.I
educational benefits as a Korean veteran
A short time later on October 1, 1962, he left

Queens, Long Island, New York, telephone number HA 6-6830,
and was attempting to obtain employment in the New York area
NAGELL advised his present objective was to have the California
ABC exposed, and he was willing to furnish "court room
testimony" that would result in the prosecution of many
Los Angeles hoodlums and their attorneys, who have acted
as go-betweens in securing alcoholic beverage licenses
through payoffs.

desire to expose the ABC, and, as a result, clear his name

NAGELL advised he had spoken with SA "DICK" RICHARDS
of the Los Angeles Office on three or four occasions; however
he had given limited information to him, due to personal
circumstances at the time. He requested that apologies be
conveyed to SA RICHARDS for not "going all the way" on
revealing all he knew concerning individuals in whom SA
RICHARDS expressed an interest.

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by William
W. TURNER
OS INDICES RESULTS:
Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured
by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
•
names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming from the plane crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally
interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal
how he came into the possession these names but no further action is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.
DETAILS:
Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964
when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested
for bank robbery.
The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane
crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from
Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He
served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with
NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash.
The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the
bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination
took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of
chronology)
The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NAGELL a note-
book containing the names of CIA employees is true.
NAGELL's complaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A
ten year prison sentence does appear harsh, considering the documented brain

that the actual trial would not take place until December
next. He stated that he left California in August, 1962, and
went to Mexico, where he remained until October 28, 1962.
He claimed that his wife's attorney knew this and apparently
brought the case on prematurely so that he would be deprived
of his day in court
NAGELL claimed that he has written a protest to the
court granting the divorce, claiming he was deprived of his
right to be heard and to have a jury trial. He stated that
he is consulting the Legal Aid Society and the Veterans

in a little book that he has done or said because he has a poor
memory although some of these memory deficits were not brought
out in the interview with him. He was advised to stay on the
ward for another week or two for further observation but he
felt that he did not have to since nothing more could be done

free and voluntary statement to Edward Joseph Murphy and George
Aiken, who have identified themselves to me as Special
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They have
advised me that the information furnished herein may be used
in court. No threats, promises or force of any kind was used
to get me to make this statement
"I was born in Greenwich, N.Y. on August 5, 1930
was arrested on September 20, 1963, in El Paso,
Texas.
On
September 21, 1963, I was arraigned before the
United States Commissioner in El Paso, Texas, on a charge of
bank robbery, at which time I entered a plea of not guilty and
was bound over for indictment by the Federal Grand Jury. Bail
was set at $25,000. On September 21, 1963 I was incarcerated
in the El Paso County jail, where I since have been and am
presently confined
"On September 24, 1963, the United States District
Court ordered that I be given a psychiatric examination to
determine my mental competency to stand trial, and that if
determined necessary by the examining psychiatrist, to conduct
such examination, to be committed to the Federal Correctional
Institution, La Tuna, Texas for a period not exceding two weeks.
"On November 4, 1963, the court nullified that part
of the aforesaid order, pertaining to the committment and
that I be committed to Beaumont Army Hospital,
Texas, for said psychiatric examination.

"On September 24, 1963 and again on November 4, 1963,
the U.S. District Court ordered that further prosecutive action
against me, be deferred until such time as the Court is in
receipt of the results of said psychiatric examination.
"As of this date I have not received the afore
mentioned psychiatric examination nor have been committed
to either of the aforementioned institutions for such examina
tion, nor have I been indicted by the Federal Grand Jury.
"I believe that an unnecessary and undue delay has
occurred in bringing me to trial, as a result of my reluctance

I had a motive for doing what I did, NAGELL
told Federal Judge R. E. THOMASON. "But my motive was not to
hold up the bank I do not intend to disclose my motive at
this time
"NAGELL, 33, told Judge THOMASON that he is a veteran
of the Korean War, that he was injured three times, and that
'I am a 64 per cent disabled veteran.
The accused man was before the court on a petition
filed by his own hand for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming
he was being held prisoner illegally.

"NAGELL asked Judge THOMASON to discharge Attorney
JAMES HAMMOND), who had been appointed by the court
represent NAGELL.
THOMASON granted the request,
after telling NAGELL that Mr. HAMMOND is considered an able,
1s
conscientious member of El Paso Bar. NAGELL had refused to
talk to Mr HAMMOND before the hearing opened
"The matter of whether NAGELL, would consent to
undergo psychiatric treatment was discussed, and NAGELL
said he would be willing to go to La Tuna Federal Correctional
Institution, and that:
will obey all their rules but I will not cooperate
for any psychiatric examination except an examination conducted
by psychiatrist for the Veterans Administration
Judge THOMASON said he would name a psychiatrist
from William Beaumont Army Hospital to examine NAGELL.
The Judge said he would appoint another attorney to represent
NAGELL."
On November 18, 1963, the subject filed a writ of
habaes corpus in the United States District Court in

mental condition where it is felt that he may be presently
insane or otherwise mentally incompetent as to be unable
to understand the proceedings against him or to properly
assist in his own defense. Assistant U. S. Attorney
MORTON advised that according to this Statute, the examination
can be made with or without the consent of the accused.
Assistant U. S. Attorney MORTON stated
Attorney MORTON stated that the subject
has constantly refused to cooperate with psychiatrists, and
has refused to even speak to them, and that this refusal
on his part has held up any possible psychiatric
examination, necessitating postponing further action.
The subject, who is still incarcerated in the
El Paso County Jail, sent the following note to SA THOMAS B.
WHITE, JR. of the El Paso Office of the FBI, which reads
as follows
Mr White
"When one's actions are motivated by an ideological
conviction, he cannot deviate from his pursued path simply
because society may censure it as wrong But when he becomes
disillusioned with such ideology, and an existing situation
so dictates he must initiate immediate corrective action

The December 10, 1963, issue of the El Paso Times
contained an article on pages 1 and 3-A entitled "Says Bank
Holdup Try 'Patriotic!." According to the article, NAGELL
had submitted several handwritten petitions to the Judge

that any statement that I do make may be used against me in
a court of law. They have advised me that I may have an
attorney if I desire. No threats, promises, force, or
inducements of any kind have been used to get me to furnish
this statement
"I was born on August 5, 1930 at Greenwich, New York
"The following statement is relative to the motive
which actuated my conduct on September 20, 1963.
"In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City a
representative of a foreign government proposed to me that
participate in an act: Such act being a criminal offense and
inimical to the best interests of the United States. At that
time I refused such proposal. In May, 1963 another representa-
tive of the same foreign government made
the same proposal
to me. At that time I agreed to such a proposal.
"In Sept. 1963, I was informed by an American, known
to me as an agent of the same foreign government, that arrange
ments for my participation in the aforementioned act were
completed, At this time I refused the aforesaid proposal
'Approximately one week later was instructed by
this same person to either participate as previously agreed
or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Thereupon I agreed
to follow the instructions of this person, although I did
not intend to do so. This existing situation actuated my
conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I was arrested and
am presently charged.
"I did not actually attempt to rob any bank.

temporary solution to the problem with which I was confronted

always acted from a principle of love for my country and
this same principle actuated my conduct on September 20,
1963, however inappropriate or incomprehensible it may
appear. God and I, and also the FBI, know that I am not
guilty.
"NAGELL is accused of pulling a gun on a teller
at the bank When the teller fled, NAGELL is alleged to have
fired two shots into the bank ceiling.
"NAGELL had previously indicated he might submit to
examination by a psychiatrist at William Beaumont General
Hospital But at the hearing it was brought out he refused
to do so now
"Judge THOMASON then overruled his motion for a
rit and asked that NAGELL's case be taken before a Federal
Grand Jury. Previously the judge had ordered that all
prosecution be deferred until an examination report on
NAGELL's mental competency was obtained.
"The judge said NAGELL's argument on the bond
more thoroughly convinces the court you need psychiatric
help.
When NAGELL was returned to the jail, he would not
tell reporters why he entered the bank. As in the past he
said he would not disclose his motive.
"FRED MORTON Assistant U. S. District Attorney
said Monday afternoon that the case will probably be taken
before a U. S. Grand Jury in January in San Antonio.

On January 3, 1964, GEORGE NORMAN STANGA was

cerated at the El Paso County Jail as a Federal prisoner
for the crime of bank robbery.

STANGA stated that since his arrest and incarceration
at the El Paso County Jail for bad checks, he has become quite
friendly with RICHARD CASE NAGELL. He stated that NAGELL was a
very mixed-up individual, but that he enjoyed the company of
STANGA and confided in him He went on to say that NAGELL
had recently confided in him to the extent that he had told
him why he attempted to hold up the State National Bank of
El Paso Texas. NAGELL told STANGA that after his release
from the United States Army, he drifted from job to job and
became more and more mentally confused as to his political,
religious and economic allegiances. During this confused
period, NAGELL apparently became a member of the Communist
Party of the United States and told STANGA that he did some
minor work for this organization prior to his trip to El Paso
NAGELL also explained to STANGA that he divorced his wife during
this period, and after making several scenes with his wife
was barred by court order from seeing his children. During
this period of his life, NAGELL told STANGA that he lived in
the Los Angeles, California, area
NAGELL explained to STANGA that he came to El Paso,
Texas, after making a decision that everything was against
him in Los Angeles and that he should attempt to leave the
United States for a Communist country in Europe. In line with
this decision to leave the United States, NAGELL made a contact
with the Communist Party in Los Angeles
Los Angeles, and arranged to meet
courier or contact man for the Party in El Paso, Texas This
contact man was allegedly to have a visa and passport for
NAGELL so that he might leave the United States and eventually
end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL then left the Los Angeles
area and drove to El Paso, Texas He told STANGA that during
this trip, he stopped by the side of the road on at least
three occasions and attempted suicide with a pistol which
was in his possession. He explained to STANGA, however
that he did not have the guts to do it and just let things
drift along. After arriving in El Paso, Texas, NAGELL said
that he got a hotel room and again attempted suicide with
the revolver. He again did not have the nerve to "pull the
trigger" and decided that the best way to commit suicide
would be by leaving the hotel and having a "shoot-out" with

In addition to the Communist activities mentioned
above, STANGA reported that NAGELL told him of a number of
rolls of microfilm which contained names, meeting places
and other activities of the Communist Party, which were in his
possession.
NAGELI, explained that these microfilms were hidden
in a gas mask (Japanese type) which was located at his sister's

court room appearances have convinced all that he is

was of no value. Mr. MORTON's confidential source told him
that NAGELL's prior contacts with the FBI were not revealing

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources
gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he
would be permitted to return same to his contact so
he could be of further use to U.S. Government. He
stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man
from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to
individuals whom he believed may have been Soviet Agent.
Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had
taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with
court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.
NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-
ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His
condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,
rigid". Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".
NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-
tempting to rob State National Bank. Slashed wrist night
of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried
to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots
in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.
He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have
been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to
Cuba!!.
A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar
rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
the names of purported CIA agents and other information.
Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him
that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,
decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made
arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to
pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and
eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly
attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but
lost nerve.
(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance
of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,
California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-
davit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was
isṣued a new passport on 6 August 1963.)

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told
U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up
the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL
told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.
I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time.
Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed
acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD
on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledge of NAGELL.
NAGELL furnished a signed statement:
"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a
representative of a foreign government proposed to me
that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal
offense and inimical to the best interest of the United
States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May
1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-
ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I
agreed to such a proposal.
"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,
known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,
that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned
act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid
proposal.
Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this
same person to either participate as previously agreed
or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be
disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-
upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,
although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation
actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I
was arrested and am presently charged.
I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that
my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,
solution to the problem with which I was confronted.
I am not guilty as charged.

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for
bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the
purpose of psychiatric examination.
Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to
serve 10 years.

On February 3, 1964, Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL furnished
the following information to SAS JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and JOSEPH
DOYLE POWELL at her residence at 440 South Union Avenue,
Apartment 12, Los Angeles, California:
She filed for divorce from RICHARD NAGELL in Los

her any money, and did not like the children. She believes
NAGELL's mother resides in the Los Angeles area, but she
does not know the mother's address and has never met her.
She repeatedly asked NAGELL to introduce her to his mother,
but he always refused to do so.
"
Mrs. NAGELL stated NAGELL never exhibited any
political interest, never mentioned communism or the "Fair
Play for Cuba Committee, or Cuba. Once in the summer of
1963 NAGELL was mad about something unrecalled and jokingly
said he was thinking of going to Russia, but Mrs. NAGELL is
certain this was said in jest.
Mrs. NAGELL is of the opinion there is something
mentally wrong with NAGELL. He would fly into violent rages
without apparent reason. She pointed out that her television
set has a split plastic case and stated NAGELL hit the set
with his fist once while angry and this resulted in this
damage.
Although NAGELL did not like his children, during
the marriage, he has frequently complained about not being
with them since the divorce. He sends them cards from various
places in the United States, but has never since the divorce
furnished support for the children or Mrs. NAGELL. As a con-
sequence, Mrs. NAGELL has been supporting herself and the
children through employment as a waitress and has to board
the children out.
On March 6, 1964, Mrs. NAGELL stated to SA HOOSE
that she never knew NAGELL to be involved in espionage in any-
manner. She further commented that they were always in finan-
cial difficulty during their residence in the United States.
During the marriage NAGELL had a bank account at the Bank of
America, Wilshire and Vermont, Los Angeles, but Mrs. NAGELL
doubts there was ever much money in the account. She said
that since the separation in April of 1962, NAGELL has sent
her a total of about $180.00.
There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with Mrs. MITSUKO NAGELL.

After above mentioned incident, RICHARD again
would have nothing to do with her. She kept track of him
through her other son, LOUIS, who is a year and a half older
than RICHARD. Mrs. NAGELL was in a way happy to have the
boys get together after years of estrangement. She
described LOUIS as being an almost hopeless alcoholic.
She thought since both sons had serious problems, they might
be able to help each other. LOUIS has told her, however,
that he was never able to straighten out RICHARD.
She stated that RICHARD never discussed communism,
never mentioned Cuba or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee”
or gave any indication he was in any manner involved in
espionage.
On March 9, 1964, Mrs. NAGELL informed SA HOOSE
that she wanted to point out that RICHARD had never physically
abused her, that the abuse was always vocal. She also mentioned
that she herself has been under psychiatric care for several
years, and she does not think her problem has yet been
eliminated..
There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with Mrs. FRANCES NAGELL.
LOUIS KAUFMAN, true name
LOUIS NAGELL (brother of
RICHARD C. NAGELL)
On March 5, 1964, LOUIS KAUFMAN furnished the
following information to SAS JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and PHILIP.
J. REILLY at his residence at 10130 Samoa Avenue, Tujunga,
California, telephone 353-1224:
LOUIS stated he got in trouble at age 16 and since
that time has used his mother's maiden name as his last name.
He considers himself to be the "black sheep" of the family and
has had little contact with other family members until the last
year or two. At one time in Korea he discovered he was in the
same army outfit as his brother, RICHARD, and looked him up.
RICHARD was an officer in intelligence while LOUIS was an
enlisted man, and RICHARD did not want to have much contact
with LOUIS. However, when their mother told RICHARD that LOUIS

(mother of RICHARD C. NAGELL)
On March 5, 1964, Mrs. FRANCES NAGELL furnished
the following information to SAS JAMES H. HOOSE, JR., and
PHILIP J. REILLY at her residence at 856 South Catalina
Avenue, Apartment 104, Los Angeles:
Mrs. NAGELL stated that for many years and for
various reasons, none of which relate to this case, there
has been dissension in the family. However, until the time
that RICHARD NAGELL was in the airplane crash, they had gotten
along well together. Since the crash there has been a marked
change in RICHARD NAGELL, and Mrs. NAGELL is certain her son has
some form of mental trouble.

into RICHARD by chance on the street in Los Angeles, saw that
he needed help, and thereafter tried to give him both moral and
financial assistance.
Mrs. NAGELL gave her son $1,000.00 on one occasion
and much smaller amounts on other occasions. He never expressed
appreciation for this help. RICHARD never seemed to have enough
money. She does not know if he had a bank account or not.
Mrs. NAGELL was trying to locate RICHARD after he
had disappeared for several days. She knew he could often
be found at The Happy Rabbit, a beer joint at 2709 West Sixth
Street, Los Angeles. She went there and found RICHARD, and
he flew into an uncontrollable rage because she had gone inside
this bar, claiming it was no place for a decent woman.
Mrs. NAGELL stated it was really not that bad a place.
became definitely convinced after this incident that there
was something seriously wrong with her son. But even prior
to this time she observed RICHARD became extremely angry over
nothing, and he would cry without explaining what was troubling
him.

NAGELL never had much money, just his income from
driving a Yellow Cab and from his disability check. JOHN
does not know if NAGELL had a bank account.
There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with FRED JOHN.
BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION
On March 5, 1964, LA T-1, whose information may
not be made public except upon issuance of a subpoena duces
tecum, stated RICHARD C. NAGELL had commercial checking account
number 002-857 at the Wilshire Virgil Branch of the Security
First National Bank, Los Angeles.
-
The account was opened October 2, 1961, with a
deposit of $350.00, closed January 31, 1963, no balance.
NAGELL gave a bank reference of Bank of America, Wilshire
Vermont Branch, Los Angeles. Upon opening, residence was given
as 4712 Saturn Street, telephone WE 4-2739.
LA T-1 recalls NAGELL vividly as he caused a com-
motion every time he came in the bank. He would shout at
the tellers, complain about the service, and threaten to
report the tellers to the management. On one occasion a girl
teller working next to LA T-1 wore a red dress to work on a
day that NAGELL was in the bank. NAGELL shouted at the girl
that only a prostitute would wear a red dress.
LA T-1 thinks some local finance company has been
trying to locate NAGELL recently to collect a debt.
On March 9, 1964, LA T-2, whose information may not
be made public except upon issuance of a subpoena duces tecum,
stated RICHARD NAGELL opened commercial checking account
number 9-4492 on November 6, 1959, at the Wilshire Vermont
Branch of the Bank of America, Los Angeles. NAGELL gave his
address as the Cloud Motel, 3400 West Third Street. His bank
reference was the Union Bank, Mount Holly, New Jersey, and he

had cancer of the throat in 1962, RICHARD went to LOUIS and
offered to help him. LOUIS later discovered he did not have
cancer and also discovered that RICHARD was the one who needed
help. LOUIS frequently saw RICHARD in 1962 and until about
August of 1963 when RICHARD left the Los Angeles area.
LOUIS considers RICHARD to be mentally disturbed.
He recalled an afternoon when both were at The Happy Rabbit
and the newspapers carried an account of the burglary of the
local armory.
RICHARD told LOUIS he had pulled the burglary
and had some machine guns in his car parked on the street
near the beer joint. LOUIS immediately said he would like
to see the machine guns and the two of them welked out to the
car. LOUIS saw no guns and upon asking RICHARD where they were
the latter replied he did not know what LOUIS was talking about.
RICHARD said he had no recollection of telling LOUIS anything
about guns or burglarizing any armory. In addition to this
LOUIS said that RICHARD was usually in a state of deep
depression. RICHARD complained about his wife divorcing him
and about his employment problems.
RICHARD never spoke in favor of communism but he
did say that he thought the American government should do
more for him in view of his army service. He never mentioned
Russia. When RICHARD returned from Mexico City in 1962, he
told LOUIS he had gone to Cuba from Mexico. He gave no
reason for having made this trip. LOUIS has no information
indicating RICHARD was ever involved in espionage.
He never
heard RICHARD mention the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
LOUIS does not know if RICHARD had a bank account;
he does know RICHARD usually was broke.
There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with LOUIS KAUFMAN.

;
JOHN resides in a boarding house at 817 South
Catalina Avenue, Los Angeles. He is employed by the Hartford
Insurance Company, 548 South Spring Street, Los Angeles.
He has known RICHARD NAGELL for about one year.
He met him through BILL LYNN of the California Alcoholic
Beverage Controll at The Happy Rabbit. JOHN does not know
any members of NAGELL's family nor does he know of any other
close friends of NAGELL.
NAGELL left Los Angeles the first or second week of
September, 1963, Just before leaving he told JOHN he would
be traveling and asked him to share his Post Office box so
he could forward on the government disability checks which
he receives monthly. He also asked JOHN to mail him an almanac
whenever it was convenient as he liked to refer to the almanac
from time to time as a general source of information. JOHN
complied with both requests. Near the end of each month JOHN
has sent the checks to NAGELL at a Post Office box in El Paso,
Texas. He also sent him an almanac with a yellow cover as he
becalls it. JOHN did not mark or alter this almanac in any way.
:
JOHN recently received a form letter from a hospital
in Missouri, informing him he had been named as a correspondent
authorized to communicate with RICHARD NAGELL. JOHN has received
no indication that NAGELL is in any sort of trouble, and he
wondered what was behind the hospital letter.
JOHN has never heard anything about his receiving
four reels of microfilm or any personal papers should NAGELL
die. JOHN does not have a key to any safety deposit box and
does not know if NAGELL does or does not have a safety deposit
box. JOHN has heard NAGELL mention his sister but knows
nothing concerning any Japanese gas mask or anything else
stored with her which is to be turned over to him upon NAGELL's
death.
About a month or two after NAGELL left Los Angeles
he wrote to JOHN, probably just on one occasion, and that
concerned paying the rent on the joint postal box.
JOHN is of the opinion NAGELL is a paranoiac in
that he is depressed at the manner his ex-wife treated him
and the manner in which the local, state, and Federal governments
have treated him. JOHN definitely considers NAGELL to be mentally
disturbed.

was not unusual for individuals to retain lists of persons.
in such areas for future reference. U.S. Army, Japan, also
advised that the reason for some names in the subject's
possession at the time of his arrest could not be assessed:
On June 9, 1964, subject sentenced in the United States District

JOHN NOBURO MIYAKI (JACK MIYAKI) stated on
March 23, 1964, to SA HOOSE that he and his wife, CAROLINE
MIYAKI, reside at 645 North Westmoreland Avenue, Los Angeles,
California. MIYAKI did not recognize name or photograph of
RICHARD NAGELL. When further descriptive data was furnished
MIYAKI, he recalled he had met NAGELL on one occasion about
a year ago at The Happy Rabbit, a beer joint at 2709 West
Sixth Street, Los Angeles
NAGELL told MIYAKI he either was or had been a
Yellow Cab driver, that he had a Japanese wife who had
divorced him. MIYAKI said he possibly told NAGELL he worked
as a machinist at Aero-Space Manufacturing Corporation, 3825
Cohasset Street, Burbank, California, but cannot recall having
told NAGELL anything else. MIYAKI stated he thinks NAGELL left
the bar at the same time he did which may account for NAGELL
having MIYAKI's license number. MIYAKI drives a cream
colored 1962 Buick Special, four door, license JOG 823.
(California Department of Motor Vehicles verifies this license
is for this car.) MIYAKI said he does not work on any classi-
fied material and has no clearance. MIYAKI was born in Japan,
naturalized in Hawaii on January 21, 1954, certificate number
7121559.
+
MIYAKI is of the opinion he and NAGELL only con-
versed about ten or fifteen minutes on this one occasion,
and he has no information apart from above concerning NAGELL.
There is no information in the files of the Los
Angeles Office of the FBI identifiable with JOHN (JACK)
MIYAKI or CAROLINE MIYAKI.

States Army in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.
GLENN explained that the names in parentheses in

States District Court, denied the motion for a new trial
and sentenced the subject to serve ten years under the
provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, United States
Code, which provides that the subject can be released under
parole at any time it is deemed advisable. This sentence
was for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States
Code..
The June 17, 1964 issue of "The El Paso Herald
Post", contained an article entitled "Inmate "Serious' After
Suicide Try". According to the article, the subject swallowed
several sleeping pills while lodged at the El Paso County Jail
on June 17, 1964. According to the article, NAGELL was to
be kept under observation all night and was to be transferred
to the William Beaumont General Hospital from the La Tuna
Federal Correctional Institution Hospital unless his condition
improved.
The article further stated that Deputy U.S. Marshal
JACK GRAVES said seconal pills had been prescribed for the
subject and that the subject evidently had been hoarding them.

Reference is made to a memorandum from your Bureau

Washington Field Office have advised that Richard Case Nagell is
currently under arrest for bank robbery and that the following names
and information were contained on material and papers in the posses-

by members of Army Intelligence Units in Korea in order to
protect their real identities from informants.
GLENN also advised that the subject was not
stable mentally and that this instability was probably due
to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplane crash
during the Korean War in which the subject was the only
survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have
a brilliant war record, which was the reason for his
assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should
have been an obvious psychological defect.
GLENN pointed out as an example of the subject's
instability that the subject had turned in allegations
against an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the
subject of extensive investigation. GLENN added that the
subject was subsequently transferred to another Army unit
and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly
way by his new Commanding Officer, who told him he hoped
the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he,
the Commander, would do all he could to make it a worthwhile
tour of duty for the subject.
To this, NAGELL allegedly replied that the Commander
had certainly better see that this was the case as, NAGELL
told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every.
move made by his Commanding Officer and if he stepped out
of line one whit at any time, it would be made the subject
of an immediate report to higher headquarters.
GLENN made available a letter from the Assistant
Chief of Staff, G-2/G-3, United States Army, Japan, which
was in answer to a request for information regarding the
subject and which contained the following information:
SUBJECT, after graduation from the Army Intelligence
School, Fort Holabird, Maryland, in August 1955, served as an
advisor to the First Republic of Korea Army and subsequently
in Sendai, and Tokyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958.
These assignments were concerned with intelligence activities,
6.

--- Image 104-10305-10005_page_193.jpeg ---
13-00000
EP 65-951
as an advisor to the ROK Army in Korea, and as a member of the
US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan. During the
latter tour of duty, the counterintelligence unit was designated
the 3rd Operations Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and
Detachment B in Sendai, as referred to in photographic inclosures
to your letter.
In assignments of this nature it is common practice
for members to become acquainted with personnel of various
Japanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March
5 Memorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Texas. It is not unusual
for individuals assigned counterintelligence duties to retain
lists of these persons for reference in the event they are
again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or
thank you notes from the United States. This would appear
to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency
personnel, although to have retained the list for a number of
years after leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji,
Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results
of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were
publicized in the Japanese press, but SUBJECT'S reason for
including those names in HIS lists cannot be assessed. Also,
no reason can be given for the two or three miscellaneous:
names in NAGELL'S file.
The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic
attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field.
It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persons
with whom he would or had contact, which is not unusual.
Information contained on those rosters, particularly that
portion indicating code names, was and is regarded as classified
information by this office.
Files of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ,
disclosed no information relative to NAGELL or of his aliases.

JOE CRAMER or KRAMER during this contact with CIA.He said he told CIA
the above information and wanted some advise as to whether to go

regard to any knowledge of Nagell and has advised that he has no
recollection of having met any individual by that name. If John
Richard Sloss is identical to "J. Sloes," it is not possible from
available information to even speculate as to how the name came
into the possession of Nagell.
In view of the fact that Richard George Fecteau is currently
în prison in China and the indication that the other six names listed
above may refer to Agency employees, it is requested that the
above information not be disseminated outside your Bureau. It
does not appear that the above information could affect either the
prosecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank rob-
bery and disclosure of the above information could create a later
cover problem for this Agency, as well as directing additional at-
tention to the position of Fecteau.
It would be appreciated if your Bureau would advise this
Agency of any information brought to your attention concerning how
the above names came into the possession of Nagell.

brought in a rifle to have a telescopic
sight mounted; he produced a repair tag
in that name as confirmation (Report,
p. 315). Garland G. Slack and other
target shooters patronizing the Sports
Drome Rifle Range reported that a man
resembling Oswald had practiced there
as late as November; the man made him-
self obvious, at one time incurring
Slack's displeasure by firing on his tar-
get (Report, pp. 318-319).
An incident at Downtown Lincoln-
Mercury is highly revealing. Immedi-
ately after the assassination, salesman
Albert Guy Bogard reported to the FBI
that a man giving the name Lee Oswald,
who closely resembled the accused as-
sassin, came into the showroom on No-
vember 9. Remarking that in several
weeks he would have the money to make
the purchase, he test-drove an expensive
model on the Stemmons Freeway at 60
to 70 miles an hour. Both Bogard and
another salesman, Oren Brown, wrote
down the name Oswald so that
would remember him
would him
going to have to go back to Russia to
buy a car" (Report, p. 320).
Given a lie detector test by the FBI,
Bogard's responses were those "normally
expected of a person telling the truth.".
Nevertheless, the Warren Commission
dismissed the incident by noting that
Oswald supposedly could not operate an
automobile and that on November 9 he
allegedly spent the day drafting a
lengthy letter to the Soviet Embassy. It
evidently never considered the possibility
someone might be impersonating Os-
wald. But Bogard will never identify the
impersonator. He stuck to his story in
news interviews, and subsequently was
beaten to within an inch of his life by an
unknown assailant and arrested by the
Dallas police on seemingly trumped-up
bad check charges. He retreated to his
native Louisiana, where on St. Valen-
tine's Day 1966, he was found dead of
exhaust fumes in his automobile.

The main ingredients of the patsy:
theory are wrapped up in a story that has
gradually filtered out of Leavenworth
Penitentiary: The story is that of inmate
Richard Case Nagell, and paradoxically,
the most cogent confirmation for it is the
manner in which he wound up sentenced
to ten years in federal custody.

Nagell was a highly decorated infantry.
captain in the Korean War who, he
claims, subsequently became a CIA
agent. It is a matter of record that in
1957 he was seriously injured in a plane
crash in Cambodia, which tends to sup-
port his contention, since Cambodia was
not exactly a tourist playground. On
September 20, 1963, Nagell walked into
a bank in El Paso, Texas, fired a gun into
the ceiling, and then sat outside waiting.

There is an incredibly brief FBI inter-

the record he would like to say that his
association with OSWALD (meaning:

"Richard Fecteau, Lynn, Mass." is undoubtedly identical to
Richard George Fecteau who is in prison in Communist China.
Fecteau was taken prisoner by the Communists during an Agency
operation in November 1952.
"Mr. F. Parker" may be identical to John Floyd Parker, cur
rent Agency employee, who was born 2 January 1898, Louisville,
Kentucky.
'Miss Guthries" may be identical to Frances Agnes Guthrie,
born 29 February 1908, Charleston, West Virginia, who is also cur-
rently employed by this Agency,
"Mr. C. Churchill may be identical to Creighton Churchill
who was born 1 October 1912, Cornish, New Hampshire, whose pres-
ent address is not known and whose address in 1952 was 27 West 44th
Street, New York City.
John Floyd Parker and Frances Guthrie have been interviewed
in regard to any knowledge of Nagell but neither individual has any
recollection of having ever met Richard Gase Nagell. Guthrie was em-
ployed by this Agency in Japan in the 1950's. Creighton Churchill and
John Floyd Parker were in Japan in 1952 to interview and debrief
United States servicemen who had been held prisoners of war by the
Communists.
In view of the background of Nagell in the Far East, the possi-
bility exists that Nagell could have obtained the names of Parker,
Guthrie and Churchill in the approximate 1952 period, although a speci-
fic statement concerning this cannot be made in view of the limited in-
formation concerning Nagell.
Mr. E. Leibacher and Mr. Da Vanon" are believed to refer to
Ernst Leibacker and Joseph Frances Davanon of the Los Angeles Field
Office of this Agency. Your Los Angeles Field Office has been previ-
ously aware that Lefbacker and Davanon have no personal knowledge of
Nagell. There is no record of any past interest in Nagell by this
Agency.
"J. Sloss" may refer to John Richard Sloss who was born 24 Sep-
tember 1919, Cleveland, Ohio and is currently employed in Head-
quarters by this Agency. John Richard Sloss has been interviewed in

It was good to hear from you, to learn
you are still at the old shop%; etc..
I got your letter yesterday in New York,
and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my
subconscious would perhaps come out with a peal of
a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But
no bellsrang.
'
I have only a small hunch
a piccolo-toot
in my memory. When I worked for the shop I once went
to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons,
( with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean
liner, years before). You can guess why I wanted to
see Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out
of cages.
Bennett mentioned a guy ( with a questionable
record, as far as he was concerned) who claimed to
know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc.
He had aproached Bennett " as from us". Ed Nagell
rings a piccolo-toot on this, but only
that. Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident.

I have recently become an author an Wines.
After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told
U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up
the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL
told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.
I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."
Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed
acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD
on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledge of NAGELL.
NAGELL furnished a signed statement:
"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a
representative of a foreign government proposed to me
that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal
offense and inimical to the best interest of the United
States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May
1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-
ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I
agreed to such a proposal.

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,
known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,
that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned
act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid
proposal.
Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this
same person to either participate as previously agreed
or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be
disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-
upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,
although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation
actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I
was arrested and am presently charged.
I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that
my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,
solution to the problem with which I was confronted.
I am not guilty as charged.

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for
bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the
purpose of psychiatric examination.
Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources
gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he
would be permitted to return same to his contact so
he could be of further use to U.S. Government. He
stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man
from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to
individuals whom he believed may have been Soviet Agent.
Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had
taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with
court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.
NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-
ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His
condition was diagnosed as 'depression, tearful, nervous,
rigid". . Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".
NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-
tempting to rob State National Bank. Slashed wrist night
of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried
to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots
in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.
He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have
been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to
Cuba".
A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-
rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
the names of purported CIA agents and other information.
Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him
that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,
decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made
arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to
pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and
eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly
attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but
lost nerve.
(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance
of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,
California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-
davit that his passport had been lost or stolen.

Dear Mr. Plant:
24 April 1970
In further reference to my letter from Switzerland: During our conver-
sation of 6 April you made it clear that I must step back into time and prove
the existence of a condition over ten years ago that could and should have
been resolved by the Army then.
a feat that is all the more complicated
by the ABCMR's refusal to interview the appropriate witnesses, view certain
pertinent records and to place the blame for my not receiving an adequate
medical examination where it belongs.
I believe what you really meant to say was that in my particular case
(as opposed to others much less valid) the function of the Board to correct
an injustice does not apply.
So if this assumption is fact, as I have every reason to feel it is, then
you may pass on to the Secretary that before my case is closed the Army will be
confronted with a scandal that will
Make France's Dreyfus affair seem inconse-
quential by comparison. I am not quite the fool that apparently I have been
taken for.

chard C. Hagelt

report states that when the prisoner was
being led from court on January 24,
1964, he "made wild accusations to news-
paper reporters, accusing the FBI of not
attempting to prevent the assassination
of President Kennedy..." (CD 404).
That the charges may not be so wild is
indicated by the fact that the government
threw the book at Nagell, a first offender
who says he expected to be charged only
with discharging a firearm on govern.
ment-protected property. Since his sen-
tencing, he has been shuttled between
Leavenworth and the federal medical
center (a euphemism for mental institu-

government has suggested in court that
his airplane crash mentally affected
Nagell, the fact remains that he was
given intelligence training after the crash.
What Nagell alleges is damning not only
to the FBI, but to the CIA. In brief,
he says that the motive for the assassina-

of a rapprochement with Castro, which

pealed to his ego in setting him up as the
patsy. When the "delivery" site was
shifted to Dallas, Bravo Club enlisted
the aid of a Dallas "subsidiary," Delta
Club.
Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the
plans and sent several agents into the
field to ascertain whether they were "for
real." Nagell says he was one of the
agents dispatched. Within a short time,
he claims, he was pulled in. It had been
verified that the plans were authentic,
that "gusanos [anti-Castroites] were
making the watch tick," and that the
sum of the plot was right-wing in nature.
Nagell says that he was instructed to
"arrow" the patsy, that is kill him, after
the assassination. At this point, he con-
tends, he got cold feet and bailed out. "I ·
would rather be arrested than commit
murder and treason," he declared in a
self-prepared petition for habeas corpus.
In the petition, Nagell asserts that he
used the pseudonyms Robert Nolan and
Joseph Kramer in the U.S. and three
foreign countries under the authorization
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He
states that the files of the FBI and the
CIA contain information that Oswald
was using the aliases Albert Hidel and
Aleksei Hidel. He charges that the FBI
illegally seized from him evidence crucial
to his defense, such as notebooks con-
taining the names of certain CIA em-
ployees, photographs, two: Mexican
tourist cards (one in the name Joseph
Kramer, the other in the name Albert
Hidel), and receipts for registered mail,
including the one for the letter sent
Hoover warning of the assassination.
When Nagell complains he has been
"salted away" because of what he
knows, he just might be making the un-
derstatement of the year.

men while in police custody. A

enough to utter his cry of innocence. But
something had misfired, and. Oswald fell
not into the hands of his would-be exe-

Although the Warren Commission:
concluded that Oswald ducked into his
Oak Cliff rooming house to pick up the
.38 revolver, later confiscated from him
in the Texas Theater, it did not explain
why, if he had gone to work at the School
Book Depository that morning intend-
ing to kill the President and escape,"
he did not take the revolver with him.
That he made a beeline to his rooming
house for the sole purpose of getting the
revolver speaks of a man who desper-

the police. Notwithstanding the mild re-
sistance he put up in his refuge in the
Texas Theater, Oswald's demeanor in

would resolve the great riddle-given

Oswald does not appear to be the only
double-cross victim of that bloody after-

notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Commit-

agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably ment-
ally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in espionage which is
not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of

An editor of a trade journal, whom I first met while on
an intelligence assignment in Latin America, has urged me
for some time to make public the facts dealing with my:
involvement in
in a conspiracy to murder the late Chief
Executive, John F. Kennedy, in 1963 and the circumstances
surrounding my arrest and imprisonment in the United States
and East Germany. For reasons that are more personal than
advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do
better. Put with the copious amount of documentation and
background material on hand, that I feel should be adduced
in any valid
treatise of the subject, it would require
writing no less than a tome, an undertaking for which I am
hardly qualified. Then, too, there is a growing skepticism
on my part concerning the kind of reception that a topic of
this sort would elicit from a society long since inured to
violence, corruption and injustice. Still, after over six
years of relative silence, I've
silence, I've decided that I must say
something about all this, if only to answer the lies and
distortions concocted about me in the press. Thus, I have
compiled this small booklet, a throwaway, which
which may be
easily discarded at the whim of the reader. In it I've
taken the liberty to set forth a reproduction of one of the
least sanitized references to my case that has appeared in
the news media, an article printed last summer in the
OVERSEAS FAMILY, a weekly tabloid catering to U.S. service-
men in Europe. I have utilized this particular article as a
vehicle to tell a bit of my side of the story by writing an
addendum to it.

'I want to find my children'
Ex-Army spook who fingered Oswald claims Uncle Sam hides his family / by Thomas C. Lucey.
UNCLE SAM has given Richard Case
Nagell three Purple Hearts - one.
earned on Christmas Day - and a medal -
for heroism in combat.
But what this ox-Army counterspy and
alleged CIA undercoverman wants is that
Uncle keep a promise to locate his wife
and two small children.
The 38-year-old former officer hasn't
seen them since 1963.
Officials inside the Federal Govern-
ment — most likely FBI and CIA agents

know where they are and deliberately
isolated him from his family, the tall, lean
chain-smoker claims.
Nagell became separated from his
Japanese-born wife Mitsuko Takahashi
and their children, Teresa, now 9, and Ro-
bert, now 8, when he was arrested for.
robbing an El Paso, Tex., bank in Sep-
tember 1963.
He staged the robbery and immedi-
ately surrendered to the police, Nagell
claims, because he had refused to kill
Kennedy-assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and
was afraid he would be killed himself.
The ex-Army captain was convicted of
the crime and sent to Leavenworth, but
Mrs. Nagell was never told where he was,
Since then Nagell has been written
about in national American magazines
and has worked his way inside a politi-
ical prison in Communist East Germany
for the CIA.
Two major magazines intimated that
Nagell had been insane.
New Orleans district attorney Jim Gar-
rison allegedly interviewed Nagell three
times in his controversial probe of what
he called the plot to kill Kennedy.
However, despite all the publicity
about Nagell, no public mention has
been made of his charges that:
- ➤FBI special agents who questioned
Mrs. Nagell about her husband while he
was in prison said they didn't know
where he was;
➤ The CIA used the promise of reunit-
ing Nagell with his family as part of the
incentive for him to undertake a one-man
CIA assignment inside East Germany.
Nagell came to Europe in February
1969 on a hunch that the path to his fam-
ily started in West Berlin. In Zurich he was
almost killed, he says. In Barcelona, he
was watched. And in West Berlin he was
attacked in a side-street bar by two
strangers. - one of whom had been fol-
lowing him for two days and hit on
the top of his head so hard a molar
cracked in half.
--
Fearing that the next attacker might
murder him and reassured that the Gov.
ernment would finally keep its promise
this time, Nagell flew home to the United
States,
-
Now he's back where he started in
1963 when he tipped off the FBI that
Oswald was planning to assassinate Pres-
ident Kennedy.
Working through a source with access
to. documents on the Nagell case, The
FAMILY has been able to reconstruct this
incredible story of the spy who couldn't
come in from the cold.

the FAMILY source said. “But
Nagel never claimed to be a
- CIA agent. For the year that'
he worked off and on for the
CIA the first time, he was
never told what he was. But it
was in the capacity of an in-
vestigator or informant."
Nagell had a good back-
ground for Investigative and
undercover assignments.
In the Army, he was a CIC.
captain who worked in field of-
fices in the United States and
with the then super hush-hush
Field Operations Intelligence in
Japan and Korea.

He had made captain with a

without the prior written per-
mission of the author.
•
During a subsequent tour in
.the Far East with the CIC and
FOI, Nagel met and married
his Japanese wife in the spring
of 1959. Being married to a
foreign national meant an
automatic removal from intel-
ligence work so Nagell decided
to leave the Army.
For two years he was a Cal-
ifornia state special investiga-
tor, working on fraud cases and
liquor violations.
In the summer of 1962 he left
that job to work for the CIA.
His last assignment was to
penetrate the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee, where he met
Oswald. Nagell also briefly in-
vestigated Oswald's Russian-
born wife Marisa. .
Nagell considered Oswald
intelligent, "but some right-
wingers were using him by
feeding his ego. They made
him think he was a big man,
important. Oswald himself was
definitely a left-winger, lean-
ing toward Mao or maybe even
Castro. He wasn't pro-Moscow.
He hated the Russians.
"And when Oswald said he
was going to do something, you
knew he meant it."
In September Oswald told
Nagell, "We will kill him be-
fore the month is out."
-
The "we," according to Na-
gell, were Oswald and two Lat-
'Ins' possibly Cubans-who
belonged to anti-Castro organ-
izations in the United States.
"Him" was President Kennedy.
Nagell reported the threat to
a man known only as Bob, his
CIA contact. According to The
FAMILY's source, "Nagell's in-
structions were to take care of
Oswald. He told him he was an
intelligence man, not a killer,
and he couldn't kill Oswald.
"Threats were made to Na-
gell which indicated to him that
he had better do what he had
been instructed to do.
"Instead, he wrote about
Oswald's assassination plans to
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover
in Washington. Hoover didn't
reply, but Nagell didn't expect
be arrested. He expected to be
held briefly for discharging a
.firearm on Federally insured
property. By that time the as-
sassination would be over and
he'd be safe.
Apparently Nagell felt police
custody would keep him safe
from the CIA and from the
assassins. He feared the CIA
because he didn't "take care
of" Oswald. He feared the

him to. He wanted that letter
as a matter of record.
"After Nagell's tip, the FBI
questioned Oswald and re-
leased him as not being a
danger or a threat."
Two months later Nagell
heard the assassination news
bulletin on the radio. “The FBI
screwed up!" he explained.
"That was Oswald!" This was
before there was any public
mention of Oswald.
"After the assassination the
FBI tried to clean their skirts,"
The FAMILY was told. "FBI
agents insisted to Nagell that
he hadn't told them this about
Oswald or that about Oswald.
But he had."
By this time Nagell was in
Leavenworth penitentiary.
On Sept. 20, 1963, six days
before what Nagell thought
was to be the assassination
date, he went into an El Paso
bank, shot one bullet into the
celling and waited outside to
tentiary," the source smiled.
"All you have to do is be
there."
The source continued:
"In 1966 Nagell's sister
wrote that she had had
letter from his wife. She
⚫ wanted to know where her
husband was and why hadn't
she heard from him.
"Here is the sticky part. In
Mrs. Nagell's letter she said
self-doluded crank or
assassins because he might be
considered one of them.
But the police held Nagell
longer than six days.
He was tried twice, in May
1964 and September 1966, for
attempted robbery with force
and violence and sentenced to
the maximum of 10 years.
"I was bum-rapped," Nagell
complained.
.
"The court instructed that

relatives would have to come

110 OVERSEAS FAMILY article 1 have not sought to refute or
confirm each and every assertion made by its author, Thomas C. Lucey. Mr. Lucey, despite
his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies, has nonetheless depicted a vast area of
what may be termed the fundamental truth. With this in mind, I have tried to set the
record straight only insofar as it pertains to those inaccuracies and omissions
which in my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.

.
I
In order to view Mr. Lucey's account in a somewhat different perspective, I shall
begin by advising that I first went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency much
earlier than August 1962. It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned as a Case
Review Officer with the Counter Intelligence Corps at Los Angeles, that I was initially
recruited into the CIA's farflung network of informants and agents, one of a number,
suppose, within the Defense Department's intelligence community who helped the Agency
keep an eye on its not always tame competitor. My recruitment was handled by a Herbert
Leibacher, an agent of the CIA's Los Angeles office, and a Joe DaVanon, later identified
to me through photographs as an official from CIA headquarters, then located on "E".
street in Washington, D.C. Motivated by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle
reminders that I owed a greater duty to my country than to the military establishment, I
served a8 a non-paid, confidential informant off and on until my resignation from the
Army in October 1959. A complete description of the information I supplied to the Agency
during my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum;
may it suffice to say that it did not always seem germane to intelligence affairs, but
when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary
reasons WAB seldom passed on to the Agency (or for that matter, to our own higher
echelons) through regular channels.

Mr. Lucey's statement, "Being married to a foreign national meant an automatic
removal from intelligence work so Nagell decided to leave the Army," is misleading and
incorrect in its entirety. The only military intelligence organization from which an
individual is normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the CIC
primarily a security type orgen and this rule does not necessarily apply when the agent
is an enlisted man or warrant officer. As a commissioned officer,
As a commissioned officer, I was declared
ineligible for further duty with the CIC effective 14 April 1959, a full year after my
marriage to
to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more
sensitive, MI organizations such as Field Operations Intelligence, then the clandestine
espionage department of military intelligence. As for the reasons I left the Army, they
were clearly if euphemistically explained in my second letter of resignation, dated
31 August 1959, namely: "I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my
civilian education. It is not possible for me to pursue the curriculum of which I am
desirous while on active duty. Also, compassionate reasons of a personal nature exist
for desiring to tender my resignation at this time."

My patronage under the CIA did not end with my discharge from the Army and ensuing
employment in December 1959
1959 as an investigator for the State of California; in fact,
henceforth I was offered remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was.
What my new tasks comprised is of no real pertinence to this addendum or to later
_ developments, except perhaps to mention that one of my contacts said he worked out of
"Domestic Intelligence," possibly the forerunner of the present-day Domestic Operations
Division, which illegally keeps tabs on a wide range of American civilian organizations
and activities. I should also point out that I did not quit my position with the State
of California "to work for the CIA, as implied by Mr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June
1962, at my own option and in my opinion for doing my job. (The following month I was
shot through the right chest during an altercation with a person whose identity I have
never disclosed
not through the left chest by myself, my wife, an Alcoholic
.Beverage Control inspector then under investigation or by a Los Angeles police officer
"because of communistic implications," as has been reported at various times by various
sources).

Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor

Dear Ms. Grenoble:
This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities
printed about me in the article written by William W. Turner, titled
BANK ROBBER, MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE' LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE
which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of the Los Angeles Free Press
I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such lies
and distortions or publish this letter.
Mr. Turner, who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not
unfamiliar to me. He has authored similar articles, both during my
imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the
German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully
cited numerous lies about me. He has proved himself adept at putting
words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend
credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed while
serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. His recent
claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI.
•
Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected
much of his latest baloney, is a character that I feel should either
purchase a hearing aid or consult a psychiatrist. Each of my so-
called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telephone).
were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in fact assert what Mr.
Turner has attributed to him about me, then he too is a liar.
I am listing the following facts in rebuttal to the Turner-Popkin
fable:
The "papers" that I "carried" when arrested did not show me to be a
"decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they reveal anything
about "a career in Army intelligence." More to the point, the docu-
ments found in my possession and under my control (some of which were
returned to me only last year by the FBI) ensured my incarceration
for a longer period than I had anticipated. They also guaranteed my
being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven
months I was not even permitted to read a newspaper), not to mention
the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.
'
My contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald did not entail any "friendship,"
nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.
After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight,

Nagell met Buehel to

Why did he go back to the.
CIA?
"It was the only practical
thing for him to do,” the ·
'source said, "because of his
financial situation."
Almost a month to the day
after he arrived in New York
Nagell jetted to Zurich.
"During his last week of
discussions with Buehel and
another man in New York,"
The FAMILY's source said,
"It was Nagell's understanding
that he was to have himself
arrested by
by East German
authorities. All he had to do
was buy a train ticket from
Zurich, Switzerland, to East
Berlin. The train would go

the MIS (East German Ministry.
for State Security)."
Everything went according
to the CIA's plan-up to a
point.
In Zurich, Nagell reported to
his CIA contact in the Ameri-
can Consulate General. About.
the only thing the CIA agent
seems to have said to Nagell
was to ask him the train com-
partment number on his reser-
vation. Nagell told him, No. 46.
· Early in the morning of
June 10, 1968, around 12:30°
a.m. to 1:30 a.m., Nagell's train
stopped after crossing the East
German border.
"He could hear people get
on the train and clomp down
the aisle, directly to his com-
partment," the source said.
“There were two men in uni-
form and two men in civilian
clothes. They asked Nagell for
his passport-by name. Then
they asked for his transit visa. ·
He didn't know what they

"Next he was driven to an
East Berlin political prison for
extensive Interrogation. They
accused him of espionage and
said they were going to try
him.
“Nagell had been told that if
he was in East Germany for
over three months, his release
would be effected by the agen-
cy (CIA), but he was not told
how. On his own he started to
play crazy because he was
there over four and a half
months and he began to think
there was another reason for
his being there. He felt the
CIA had deserted him and
that, quite frankly, he had
been sent to Germany to get
him out of sight or to get rid
of him.
"He was released on October
23. He didn't know he was go-
ing to be released until he was
taken out of prison and driven
to a Berlin checkpoint identi-
fied to him as Sandkrug-
bruecke."
Waiting to meet Nagell were,
according to the source:
● Andor Klay, head of the
Eastern Affairs Section of the
U.S. Mission in Berlin; ·
● Wolfgang Vogel, a well-
known East Berlin lawyer who
participated on the Feb. 10.4
1962, exchange of Soviet master
spy Col Rudolf Abel and A-
-merican U2 pilot Francis Gary.
Powers and other spies and
accused spies:
● Ricey S. New, a wealthy
Washington lawyer, supposed-
ly "a representative-not a
member—of the CIA";
● Bruce A. Flatin, head of
the U.S. Berlin Mission's
public safety section, allegedly
“a longtime CIA member-and
Flatin is not his real name":
● Dr. (Capt now Maj)
George Raymond Babineau, a
psychiatrist at the U.S. Army
hospital in Berlin, who ap-
peared in civilian clothes, and
• An unidentified man.
-
Nagell was driven to the
U.S. Mission at 170 Clay Allee
and interviewed by Babineau.
"That was probably because
Nagell had played crazy with
the East Germans," the source
said.
Washington lawyer New was
also present.
"Somebody brought Nagell
a cup of coffee," the source
continued. “Nobody else had
coffee. Nagell drank a small
portion of his coffee. It was
black but it tasted more bitter
than ordinary coffee. Approxi-
mately five minutes later he
·
· began feeling sleepy and
thought he was under the In-
fluence of a drug. He went to
the bathroom and looked at
his eyes in a mirror. They were
almost pinpoints and he was
feeling exceedingly sleepy.
“Back in the room he asked.
'Did anybody put something
in my coffee?'
"Dr. Babineau said no: New
said nothing. Nagell began to
feel so sleepy he had to oc-
casionally stand up to stay a-
wake. Finally, he asked to be
-examined by a civilian psychi-
atrist if there was any ques-
tion of his sanity.
"No,' the doctor said, 'as far
as I'm concerned you're free
to go.'
-
"New spoke to the doctor in
a corner _ the doctor kept
shaking his head no
_ and
then New told-Nagell, 'I think
you ought to leave for the
United States. The German
newspapers are going to pick
this thing up any moment' and
might want to talk to you. I
don't think you should talk to
titem."
-
"Nagell said he wanted to go
back to Zurich first to pick up
his belongings to be exact,
certain documents in a safe de-
posit box. Nagell keeps records,
plenty of them."
When Nagell was driven to
Tempelhof Airport, New ac-
companied him and walted un-
til he boarded the plane. Some
time during their talk New
asked Nagell about his disabil-
ity-Nagell was getting a 60
percent disability for service-

he had checked out for the U.S.
(Later, back in Washington,
New allegedly explained it, had
been "unadvisable” to go to Zu-
rich because the East Germans
might have tapped his phone
and he didn't want them to
know Nagell was there. Nagell
didn't buy that.)
With New hot showing up to
discuss the search for his faml-
ly, Nagell violated his instruc-
tions and went to the consulate
for help.
On his first visit Nagell found
"they had a classified file on
him and knew he had been in
East Berlin," the source con-
tinued. "But he refused to an-
swer questions about his im-
prisonment and told them about
New's promise.
"The next time, he told the
consulate he was angry that he
had not heard from New and
that if he didn't get help he was
going to the news media. This
is when he was offered State
-
Department help in locating his
family predicated on his
early return to the United
States. Nagell agreed and flew
back to New York."
In New York, Nagell walted
about two or three weeks to
hear from the State Dept. When
he didn't he contacted a State
Dept, agency in New York and
was allegedly told that a letter
would be sent to Washington.
“That was the last time Na-
gell heard from them," the
source said. “He never received
a copy of the letter to Washing-
ton, as promised, and they were
always unavailable when he
called."
Meanwhile, Nagell was see-
ing New in Washington and
called in person at the State
Dept.
"They told him that the
State Department didn't have
the facilities to search for the
children," the source said, "but
on account of the circumstances
surrounding the case and 'be-
cause one of our employes ap-
parently made a promise in Zu-
rich, they would conduct a
search for his children and de-
termine whether he was mar-
ried or divorced.

determine whether he could

was no "evidence or finding

All this runaround in

that no one in the States was

On Feb. 21 of this year he
flew from Mexico City to
Zurich. But the vice-consul who
had promised State Dept. help
last fall was no longer there.
Nagell asked for the man he
claimed to be the CIA station
chief. He, too, was gone.
Sent to the consulate's politi-
cal section, Nagell told them
of the promises he'd been
given and threatened to go to
Swiss newspapers about a
CIA agent in Bern, the Swiss
capital.
"He never heard from them "A member of the consulate
again. When he called they asked Nagell to give them two
were quote unavailable un-weeks and telexed Washing-
quote."
Through a lawyer in New's
office, described as a luxurious
suite visited by Pentagon of-
ficers in civilian clothes, Nagell
got an appointment at the VA
for "a-two-and-a-half-minute
physical with his clothes on,”
according to the source. "Two
hours later he was awarded a
100 percent disability allow-
ance for a nervous condition. “
"Nagell went back to New
and told him they wanted to
tag him (Nagell) with a nervous
condition to destroy his credi-
bility."
.
For good reason, Nagell wor-
ried that a nervous condition
might be used to tag him as a
nut who didn't know what he
was talking about.
In July 1968, while Nagell
was in the Communist prison,
Edward Jay Epstein, author of
a book on the Warren Com-
mission, wrote an article in
the New Yorker magazine at-
tacking New Orleans District
Attorney Jim Garrison's in-
vestigation of the Kennedy as-
sassination.
Epstein described Nagell as
..
Kenneth Hill in the passport
section.
"A week or two later," the
source continued, "they finally
got confirmation from Washing-
ton that they had been unable
to locate Nagell's children so
far but were continuing their
efforts.
"So he finally agreed to go
back to the States as long as
the State Department was con-
tinuing their efforts.”
Pointing out that he had
spent a great deal of his money
"running around," Nagell asked
for Government transportation
home and was refused.
On April 19 or 20 Nagell real-
ized he was under surveillance.
"Around 10:30 on the night
of April 22, Nagell was walk-
ing down Kurfurstendamm
when he lost his tail," the
source continued. They just
disappeared. He didn't try to
lose them.
“Nagell then went down a
side street and into a small res-
taurant with a bar.
"He ordered a beer and was
standing at the bar, talking to
a guy on his right, when he
saw the door open and (wo
men came directly toward him.
"Nagell was getting ready to
tell the men he didn't speak
· German when he saw one pick
something out of his pocket
and swing at him. Nagell
turned and was hit on the back
of the head."
Police took Nagell to the
Albrecht Achilles Hospital.
When he told the Germans he
thought he had been hit by
the CIA, "they called an
American from the CID, a
British representative (ap-
parently the side street was in
the British Sector) and a mem-
ber of the Berlin political
.police."
Around midnight Nagell
went to the U.S. Mission and
asked for Hill in the passport
section. Instead, he got the
Army staff duty officer and a
CIC agent.
"He gave his bloody shirt
and T-shirt in a bag to the
CIC agent," the source said,
“and told him to give it to Hill.
"If something happens to
me,' he told the agent, the
responsibility is going to be
pinned because I'm going to
the papers.'
"Back in his hotel, Nagell
was worried that he was going
to be killed."
In the morning: he went to
the Army hospital and then to
Hill in the consulate.
"Hill had the bloody cloth-
ing. You must get out of
Berlin, he told Nagell. 'We
cannot give you protection
here. The German police think
it's either mistaken identity or
· ton,” the source said. "But then
one night there was an at-the MIS,'
tempt on Nagell's life and he
left for Barcelona the next
day.
-
"There he contacted the U.S.
Consulate General and told
them why he had left Zurich
and asked that Zurich's reply
from Washington be sent to
Barcelona.
"Nagell was in Barcelona for
two weeks. But then he real-
ized he was being watched and
left to see an ex-Army intelli-
gence officer at the American
Embassy in Madrid..
"Again he stayed for two
weeks. The embassy gave him
no satisfaction, not even telling
him what Washington had
said. So he decided to go back
to Berlin where this thing
started and made some prom-
ises to himself - one of them
being that if he didn't find his
children he would go to the
news media.”
He was referred to Andor
Klay and Bruce Flatin, two of
the men who had met Nagell
when he came from East
Berlin, and eventually to a
" 'Last night I thought some-
body wanted to kill me,' Nagell
replied. 'Now I take it as (only)
a warning."
"
(Later, Hill told The FAMILY
he considered Nagell merely
"a private American citizen
traveling abroad." He added:
"Ninety-nine and a half per-
cent of his story is fantasy.”
Hill confirmed that he had re-
ceived Nagell's bloody clothing
and that Nagell had come to
him with a stitched-up head
wound. But he would only
say that the attack "Is his
story, not that I have any
other story about it.")
But shortly after that Nagell
was placed on orders as an
ambulatory patient and sent on
the Berlin duty train to Frank-
furt. His orders also put him
on a military flight back to the
States.
That's where he apparently
is now.
But he still doesn't know if
he's married or divorced and
the whereabouts of his nil-
dren.

I was employed by the Agency in a capacity which can be
described as that of an agent, in every sense of the word. My assignments
varied and necessitated travel to three Latin American nations and many states, including
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. They
They also necessitated my taking on cover employment
⠀ for one week in New York and for about ten weeks in Los Angeles, though usually I posed
as a tourist, an investigator for the Immigration & Naturalization Service
researcher for a private firm, the appropriate credentials being furnished to me by the
CIA. To sum it up briefly, I operated in Mexico City at the onset of the Cuban Missile
* Crisis in an effort aimed chiefly at the Soviet government; I conducted inquiries
relative to "dissident" members of several Cuban refugee groups based in the United
States; I checked out an alleged connection between a Miami resident named Eladio Del
Valle and New Orleans CIA informant Sergio Arcacha-Smith; I investigated an associate of
the now
deceased right-wing extremist David W. Ferrie of New Orleans, as I did the
activities of left-wingers Vaughn L. Snipes and his wife, Priscilla, near Venice,
California, and others; I conducted a surveillance on a man said to have been an ex-CIA
employee, observed talking to MRP leader Manuel Artime and former Cuban senator/racketeer
Rolando Masferrer; I inquired into an allegation that Marina Oswald intended to divorce
her husband and return to the U.S.S.R. (although I never stated that I met her personally,
as was reported by the FBI and Secret Service); and I performed courier duties and acted
as a cut-out. At the time of my arrest I was operating in an undercover role, having
become involved in a domestic-inspired plot to assassinate President Kennedy and,
leastwise ostensibly, other highly-placed government officials.

,
Mr. Lucey goes on to state that my last assignment at the time "was to penetrate the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, where he met Oswald." Such statement is also incorrect. I
was never a member, bona-fide or otherwise, of the FPCC. And my conversations with FPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts, an official of
of the Socialist Workers Party at Los.
Angeles, could hardly be construed as a penetration. Furthermore, I had been introduced
to Mr. Oswald long before the FPCC came into existence, albeit under an assumed name.
As to the allusion that I told "Bob" I was an intelligence man, not a killer,
therefore I couldn't kill Mr. Oswald, while the reference is true its connotation is
deceptive. I had killed before and I had participated in homicides under the auspices of
both MI and the CIA (one instance being the part I played in the February 1958 abduction-
interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. soldier, MSGT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
Pa., suspected of having defected in place to the Chinese), under the guise that an
American variation of the Soviet "wet affair" was the only alternative, that it was
Weither essential to some overall intelligence effort or in the best interests of our
national security. And it was a similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a
that was advanced to me by Robert Graham as an incentive to dispose of Mr. Oswald
in September 1963. But my refusal to do so had absolutely no bearing on the reason for
effecting my arrest in the manner I chose, nor did it engender in me fear of reprisal by
the CIA.

Pertaining to
arrest and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official
spokesmen and the press have so neatly labeled as being for "bank robbery," let one of
the government's own spurious records, the appelate court decision that finally yawned a
judgement of acquittal in my case, give its version: "The charge was then, and is now,
entering a federally insured bank with intent to rob.* What the record aptly ignores is
the fact that two juries, incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the
courtroom (and by the ramifications of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisons
report made available to the jury during its deliberations at the second trial though
never formally admitted into evidence) that I was a Communist, no doubt a very red spy,

Most of them are adequaly detailed in my 1967 Memorandum in Support of Petition for
Writ of Habeas Corpus, sworn to and subscribed before William R. Martin (a former member
of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by his own admission is still in "the reserves").
But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he did,
I would not have been brought to trial on charges of commiting a felony.
While my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only "practical
"thing" for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a few.
old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that Mr. Lucey
has portrayed). Nor was it because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me
on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 4 years earlier, love of country, masochis-
tic tendencies or wont of further intrigue. And while it remains axiomatic in my mind
that the sole requisite for one's use by the Agency is his qualification to fit into
whatever may happen to be the scheme of things, even this did not apply in my
circumstance, not really. I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly
for personal reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

In
My mission inside East Germany if indeed it was a mission was neither as well-
defined nor as elementary as Mr. Lucey has perceived. I am sure the CIA knows all it
needs to know about American defectors in Berlin and the modus operandi of the NfS.
fact, the mission was not directed against East Germany, per se. Preparations bore the
trademarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another
nation. That I was unable to comprehend the German language, that I had been a recent,
unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public records,
etc., merely served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather
than by design.
Paradoxically, the chinks in the armor were that the cover was not
wholly untrue, the Ufs (unlike the FBI) not in the least irresponsible to the laws and
policies of its government. In the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence
activities hositle to other socialist states, to which as an integral part of my
I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected
to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violation of
the criminal statutes of the GDR, warranting a maximum penalty of death upon conviction.
By inadvertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament. If
I had confessed to my real mission, assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I would
have been spared execution, probably even escaped long-term imprisonment. Instead, I
selected what I considered to be a better alternative
and gained my freedom. As

With regard to my marital status and my children, the foremost area that Mr. Lucey
appears to have exploited, I have never claimed that "Uncle Sam hides my family"
stated that FBI and CIA agents deliberately isolated me from my wife and children;
have I claimed that the Agency used the promise of reuniting me with my family as part of
the incentive for accepting the assignment in the GDR. My accusations in this respect
centered around my children and they were leveled at the State Department as the result
of a promise made to me shortly after my release from the GDR. Since returning to the
United States last spring a reliable source has informed me that my wife was granted a
final decree of divorce at some period during my imprisonment in the USA and although I
have never been served with a copy of the decree or other notification of divorce (or
notice of a divorce hearing) I see no cause to dispute the advisement.
Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to
say only that I have never in my life been certified psychotic by any U.S. medical
authority or adjudicated mentally-incompetent in a court of law, notwithstanding the
conflicting legal and medical opinions as to my mental condition on the day of my arrest
in Texas, over six years ago.

I have never stated to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that
in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state,
under oath, that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during
part of 1963. Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months
after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their
suspicion that I had "acted as an unregistered agent for a foreign
power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence
services (several years later the CIA, through one of its "former"
case officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy: still later,
one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).
;
The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the
13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga-
tion (if not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two Cuban refugees.
I certainly "assumed" that some "action" would be taken by the FBI.
I was not the least bit "frantic" about anything in September 1963.
I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month.
To my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides." The main
distinction between some American intelligence officers that I knew
and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their
victims and/or the methods used to disassociate themselves and the
U. S. government from their crimes.
I had no fear of being implicated "in the planned assassination" at
the time of my arrest or prior thereto.
The two letters that I mailed to James L. Rankin, General Counsel to
the Warren Commission, were not sent through "private channels." They
were sent through proper jail authority.
I have never claimed that I "squirreled away a snapshot of (myself)
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963.
I have never stated that I am "willing to surface and tell (any) story
to Congress" or to anybody. And I did not reveal any details about
Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

#264170
State Dept. Airgram No. A-903 from Berlin
-
Subject: Psychiatrist's
Report on Richard Case NAGELL, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR
-
Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and
fills in gaps in the chronology of events in Subject's life of interest
to the Agency. Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted
on 29 April 1968 after his claim of temporary insanity at the time of
the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American
neurologist, Dr. Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue
of RAMPARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGELL had been involved
in the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been
"salted away". Subject denied any involvement in any conspiracy and denied.
that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his
fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted in his mind by
Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2 of interview report). On page 3 of the interview
report Subject states he no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the
CIA was trying to kill him.
'
George R. BABINEAU, Cpt., MC, the psychiatrist at the U. S. Army Hospital,
Berlin who interviewed Subject, was granted a continuing liaison clearance
on 17 October 1968 at the request of DDP/E/G/IS.
Dr. Edwin A. WEINSTEIN was security approved as a continuing contact
through SECRET for/the Medical Staff on 13 July 1965. WEINSTEIN is with the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D. C.
'
.
Ricey S. NEW, Jr. NAGELL's attorney who was present during the
interview, is with the Washington, D. C. law firm of NEW, MACKEY and
GEORGE. Newspaper clippings from the WASHINGTON STAR for 17 March 1966
and the NEW YORK TIMES for 29 August 1965 reflect that NICEY has been
associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGEL and West Berlin
attorney, Juergen STANCE, in a number of cases involving the release
of Americans from East Germany. According to an FBI report dated 3
February 1967 these releases usually involved the payment of specified
sums of money and VOGEL and STANGE were allegedly reaping large monetary
benefits for their services.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Garrison and the Kennedy Assassination:
Richard Case Nagell (201-746537)
1. Subject was born 5 August 1930 at Greenwich, New York
City, N. Y. He is a U. S. citizen with passport J 543069 -
2. Subject is not associated with CIA and has not been so
associated.
3. He entered the U.S. Army on 5 August 1948, his eighteenth
birthday. His military career was distinguished. He was awarded
many military decorations for his service in Korea. He was never
AWOL or court-martialled.
4. On 28 November 1954 Subject was one of six men in a
B-25 which crashed near Friendship Airport. Nagell was the sole
survivor. The plane was not found for 11 1/2 hours. Nagell suffered
severe injury to the head and facial disfigurement. He was honorably
discharged from the Army on 20 October 1959 with the rank of captain.
In December 1959 he was employed as a special investigator by the
Department of Alcoholic Control, State of California. He was dismissed
from this position in June 1962. In July 1962 he was shot in the chest
but refused to provide the police with further information. In August
1962 he went to Mexico City. In September and again in October 1962.
he appeared at the American Embassy in Mexico City. He asked for
help in collecting money from the State of California. He claimed that
he had been approached for aspionage recruitment while in Mexico
City but refused to provide any particulars. He said that he wanted to
renounce his U.S. citizenship. He left Mexico City on 28 October
1962. On 16 November and 15 December 1962 he was in touch with the
FBI in New York City and Jacksonville, Florida. During the latter
meeting he said that he had been approached in Washington, D. C., by
someone whom he considered to be working for the Soviets.

a. Our records show that Richard G. Fecteau was
aboard an American plane shot down over Manchuria in
November 1952 and that he is serving in Peiping a twenty
year sentence on spy charges. Fecteau, an OPC employee,
was quoted in the press as saying that he worked for CIA.
b. F. Parker was not identified. He may possibly be
John Floyd Parker, an Agency employee in 1964 who was in
Japan in 1962.
c. There is no pertinent identifiable information about
Mrs. Inu Guthries. She may be Frances Agnes Guthrie, an
Agency employee in 1964.
d. C. Churchill was not identified. He may be Creighton
Churchill, who was in Japan in 1952.
• J. Sloss may be John Richard Sloss, an Agency
employee in 1964.
f. E. Lelbacher could be identical with Ernst Leibacker
who in 1964 was in the Los Angeles field office of the DCS.
g. J. Davanon may refer to Joseph Frances Davanon,
also in the Los Angeles field office at the time.
9. John Floyd Parker, Frances Guthrie, Ernst Lelbacker,
Joseph Frances Davanon, and John Richard Sloss all stated to the best
of their knowledge they had never met Nagell. It is possible, however,
that Nagell knew or knew of Parker, Churchill, and Guthrie through
their work in the Far East. As for Lelbacker and Davanon, Nagell
lived in Los Angeles in 1962.
10. "On 16 April 1964 Nagell sent to the FBI a letter claiming
that in September 1963 he had sent to the Bureau a registered letter
signed "Jack Kramer". The 1964 letter implied that the 1963 letter
had warned the FBI about the impending assassination. The FBI, of
course, did not receive such a letter.
11. In January 1968 William T. Turner stated in an article in
Ramparts, "The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of

5. In December 1962 and January 1963 Nagell was examined
at the VA hospital at Bay Pines, Florida. The diagnosis was
"chronic brain syndrome associated with brain trauma with behavioral
reaction characterized by passive aggressive and paranoid features."
(An FBI memorandum of 12 June 1964 noted that Nagell was considered
mentally disturbed by his mother, his brother, an ex-wife, and a
friend. The mother, who said that she had been under psychiatric care
for several years, described Subject's brother, Louis, as an almost
hopeless alcoholic.)
6. On 20 September 1963 Subject was arrested in El Paso,
Texas, on the charge of having tried to rob the State National Bank.
A cell mate concluded from Subject's remarks that he had become a
Communist Party member after his discharge from the army, that he
had attempted suicide three times after his arrest, and that he had made
arrangements with the CP in Los Angeles to pick up his passport in
El Paso so that he could go to Czechoslovakia.
:
7. In a letter of 6 January 1964 Nagell advised the FBI in
El Paso that in September of 1963 he had been instructed by an agent
of a foreign government to comply with an agreement made in May 1963
to participate in a criminal offense against the U.S. or be exposed to
the FBL. It was this threat, said Nagell, that led him to try to hold up the
bank. The reference appears to be to the assassination of President
Kennedy. At any rate, sometime after the assassination Nagell claimed
that he had known both Oswald and his wife. Pictures of Nagell were
shown to Marina Oswald on 18 January 1964. She said that she did not
know him.
8. At the time of his arrest Subject had in his possession a
notebook which made reference to "Medical Aid to Cuba", the "Fair
Play for Cuba Committee," the names of six persons alleged to be
CIA agents, and other information. The FBI informed the Office of
Security on 12 March 1964 that at the time of arrest Nagell also had a
list of six names, marked CIA. The names were F. Parker, Mrs.
Guthries, C. Churchill, J. Sloss, E. Leibacher, and J. Davanon. It
was later determined that Richard Fecteau also appeared on this list,
where he was marked as "Lynn, Mass.", and "DAC (CIA)".

:
a noted American neurologist, who found his electroencephalograms
abnormal, and as a result he was released from prison on 29 April 1968.
Nagell said that because of the Ramparts article of January 1968 he
was paid a visit by Jim Garrison. He told Garrison that he had no
information of any use to him. The interview left him, however, with
two fears: that Garrison might try to subpoena him and that CIA might
try to "eliminate" him. (By the time he was providing this information
in Berlin Nagell was well aware that he was not involved in any conspiracy
to assassinate President Kennedy.) He said that his fear of CIA was
planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison.
After his release he went to New York, where a sister lives. He
was almost hit by a car driven without lights and decided to go to Europe
to escape being killed by CIA. In June he appeared in Zurich. He next
net out for West Berlin but was taken off the train on 11 June 1968.
For several months he was repeatedly asked to admit that he was a spy.
Eventually he concluded that the only way to obtain his release was to
pretend that he was mentally ill. He did so, was examined by a
psychiatrist, and was released.
"He no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the CIA was
trying to kill him." He termed himself "chronically paranoid". The
Army psychiatrist concluded "Currently he is not psychotic and seems
competent in a legal and psychiatric sense
Nagell's final remark was, "Well, I'll tell you one thing, that's
the last time I ever take a train through East Germany."

President Kennedy", p. 56, that Nagell was then still confined
at Leavenworth, that he had been a highly decorated infantry captain
in the Korean War, and that he claimed to have become a CIA agent
thereafter. Ramparts shifted the plane crash in which Nagell was
injured from 1954 and Maryland to 1957 and Cambodia. The article
repeated the allegation that he staged a phony holdup in order to be
under arrest when the assassination occurred.
12. On 6 June 1968 the American Consulate in Zurich cabled
Washington to say that Richard Case Nagell, passport J 543069, had
appeared at the consulate on 4 June and had said that he was working
for a secret U.S. Government agency on a mission to Geneva, where
he was to meet some Japanese. He asked for money. He returned to
the consulate the next day, was incoherent, and seemed psychotic. He
claimed that on 14-16 May 1968 he had been interviewed by District
Attorney Jim Garrison. He said that Garrison had warned him that he
was in danger of being killed and that he wanted to inform CIA that he
was in Zurich.
15. On 7 September 1968 another William Turner piece was
printed by Ramparts under the heading " _ Assassinations 7 Epstein's
Garrison". It referred to Nagell as a former U.S. intelligence agent
and repeated much the same story that it had told in January. Turner
and Ramparts may have been unaware that Nagell was out of jail by then.
14. On 25 October 1968 the Washington Post reported that after-
holding Nagell for four months, the East Germans had released him
on 23 October at an East-West Berlin crossing-point. Nagell left-by
plane for the U.S. on 25 October. "Informed sources" said that Nagell
was taken off a train en route through East Germany to Berlin because
he made some remarks which the East Germans considered derogatory.
15. On 31 October 1968 State forwarded the text of a report by a
U. S. Army psychiatrist who examined Nagell on 23 October. Nagell
said that he was on active duty with the army from 1948 to 1959 and that
from 1953 to 1959 he was an officer in military intelligence. He also
provided accurate information about the 1954 plane crash and its results
among them, in his own words, his "unstable personality and immature
or impulsive behaviour". He said that he draws 64% disability pay. He
lost his job in California because one night in 1962, while drunk, he tried
to break down the door of the apartment of his estranged wife.
After his confused attempt in 1963 to rob the El Paso bank, he
spent 4 1/2 years in prison. He was examined by Dr. Edwin Weinstein,

Bank robber, 'Manchurian Candidate'
linked to JFK assassination probe
ED. NOTE: Recent exposure of
what many consider to be im-
proper CIA activity, both at
home and abroad, has
reawakened interest in decade-
old challenges to official ver-
sions of the assassinations of
John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy
and Martin Luther King. As new
facts also begin to emerge,
Congress faces growing
pressure to reinvestigate the
JFK assassination.

What follows are the strange
stories, disclosed here for the
first time, of two figures
Richard Case Nagell and Luis
Angel Castillo - long of interest:
to assassination researchers.

WILLIAM W. TURNER
SAN DIEGO, (PNS) — On Sept.
20, 1963, a rangy man with a
vertical scar on his forehead
strade into the State National
Bank in El Paso, Tex., and re-
quested $100 in travelers'
checks. Before the teller could
. comply, he whipped out a pistol
and fired two shots into the ceil-
ing. Then he waited to be
arrested.
Police quickly realized that
the suspect, Richard Case
Nagell, 32, was no ordinary
bank robber. Papers he carried
showed that he was a decorated
hero of the Korean War who had
gone on to a career in Army
Intelligence before being dis-
charged with the rank of captain
in 1959.
Popkin, a philosophy professor
at Washington University in St.
Louis, stepped off a plane in the
nation's capital lugging a brief-
case containing documents il-
luminating the strange case of
the man who shot a bank. Also
crammed into the briefcase was
a thick sheaf of papers relating
to a bizarre "Manchurian Can-
didate" episode in the Philip-
pines in 1967.
.
Both the El Paso and Manila
incidents, Popkin said in an in-
terview before leaving for
Washington, were linked to the
Dallas assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They
would "crack the case wide
open," he predicted.
The slight, bearded academi-
cian was stopping in
Washington to present his dis-
coveries to Attorney General
Edward Levi and the Senate
Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities before go-
ing on to a conference of learn-
ed philosophers.
The Second Oswald
Popkin is no stranger to the
JFK investigation. In 1966 he
JFK investigation. In 1966 he
published The Second Oswald,
which chronicled several in-
stances of someone imper-
sonating the man later accused
of slaying the president. At the
time the book gained scant
attention, but recently it was dis-
closed that as early as June 3,
1960, FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover himself wrote an in-.
terdepartmental memorandum

robbery?
imposter. The FBI knew Oswald
at that time as a defector to
Russia, and, some conspiracy
theorists believe, as a possible
CIA agent.
•
Popkin said he had been in
touch with Richard Nagell, now
living near San Diego, and had
learned about Nagell's
friendship with Lee Harvey
Oswald. Nagell has fascinated
assassination researchers ever
since an FBI report filed with the
Warren Commission quoted
him as saying he had met with
Oswald in Mexico City and Tex-
as. But the former intelligence
officer had been inacessible. He
remained in prison for the El
Paso caper until his conviction
was reversed for insufficient
evidence in 1967, after which he
dropped from sight.
Nagell's Version
Nevertheless. researchers.
were able to glean some picture
of Nagell's significance from his
defense pleadings and cryptic
letters from prison.
In August 1963 Nagell, work-
ing as a CIA agent, learned of a
domestic plot to assassinate the
president, involving Oswald and
anti-Castro Cubans. He in-
formed his CIA superior but
feared nothing would be done.
because he lacked details. On
Sept. 13 he dispatched a letter
warning J. Edgar Hoover of the
plot but again assumed no ac-
tion would be taken.
As Nagell understood it,
Kennedy was to be shot in

Subject is one of the characters in the GARRISON case. See summary
dtd 18 January 1968 in his file. He was arrested for bank robbery at El
Paso, Texas on 20 September 1963 and sentenced to Leavenworth penitentiary.
In June 1968 CIA received a cable from Berm in which NAGELL was quoted as
m[B
telling the CONGEN he wanted them to "inform CIA he in Zurich".
The details of how and why NAGELL is in Europe, in particular East
Berlin, are missing. State Telegram No. 2538 from Berlin states that
the charges are still unknown. "Basic documents -- are still in hand of State
Security authorities."
Subject was released by East German authorities together with one
Leon Burris JAMES. An intensive review of JAMES' file (#266602) failed
to reveal any connection between JAMES and Subject. State Department
reported both cases simultaneously because JAMES and Subject are currently
in the same situation in East Berlin. JAMES is also mentally unstable and
has cause embarrassment abroad for the State Department since 1964. He was of
Agency interest in 1965 because he had in his possession while in Switzerland
the names of two Agency employees who were in a covert status. It was never
determined how JAMES obtained these names.

SIRHAN'S MOTIVES
Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan
has lived to tell of his motivations-but he
has chosen to remain silent. The only other
potential source of information is his
family, which had not, spoken to the press.
Mahmoud Abdel-Hadl, an Egyptian
correspondent for Akhbar Elyoum in
· Cairo, recently gained access to Sirhan's
family. Based upon information supplied
him by the family, he has written exclusiv-
ely for RAMPARTS the following account
of Sirhan's motivations and the strategy
he plans for his trial.
voracious reader, Sirhan is confident
about his own ability to cope with his
predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif,
told me that Sirhan studies the intrica--
cies of his case as many as ten hours a
day in his cell. Shereif recalls that Sirhan
recently said to him, “I do not need a
lawyer. I understand my case and know
how to defend myself." But even so,
Attorney Russell Parsons is defending
his client, and doing it on Sirhan's own
grounds. "The main issue," Parsons told
me, "is to answer this question: why, for
what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert
Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who
saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but
no one seems to know why he did it."
Sirhan and his attorney hope that the
defense-presuming that the television

Because of the forthcoming trial and
the difficulty of dealing with this subject
without emotional involvement, the editors
of RAMPARTS have elected to present this
information of historic interest to our
readers without display, and in as ob-room-will show that Sirhan did not
jective a form as possible.
B
ECAUSE I AM AN arab I was able to
break through the barrier of sus-
picion that had stopped other
journalists cold and obtain the first in-
depth interviews the Sirhan family has
given since the assassination. From their
comments and from what Sirhan has said
to them, a picture of the man and his
motives begins to emerge, replacing the
misleading portraits which have swamped
the U.S. press.
The fact that Sirhan has not publicly
discussed his trial is no accident. It is his
own strategy, something he developed
after thinking about it for long hours in
his specially made jail cell. In fact, he
has confided to his family that he will
never make any statement unless special
provisions are made for the courtroom
proceedings. What Sirhan wants is,
quite simply, publicity. He wants the
major television networks to be allowed
to broadcast the entire trial. If they do
this, he says, he will tell all. "And if they
refuse?” his brother Adel recently asked
him. "Then I shall go to the gas chamber
-
-silent,” Sirhan replied.
To understand why Sirhan is indeed
capable of such an act, one múst under-
stand that he is first and foremost an
Arab, borti in Palestine and consumed
with interest in the Middle Eastern con-
thet. He is deeply committed to making
his trial a public and political forum for
the Arab position.
College educated, articulate and a
have "malice aforethought" in shoot-
ing Kennedy because the act was a polit-
ical gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan
at least, was merely a symbol. His
brother Adel notes that "if Sirhan was
just an assassin, he could have done it in
another way, just by having a gun with a
telescope. He went to the Ambassador
Hotel expecting to get caught; that is
why he left his notes at home. I believe
that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that
he could say what he believes."
:
'HEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with
W
the Sirhan family, I was re-
fused. Security is extremely
heavy around them, and they are under-
standably wary of new faces. Later, when
I finally obtained an invitation to meet
with them, Mrs. Sirhan apologized, I
believe for having been inhospitable to
a fellow Arab.
This family, which fled Jordan to seek
greater safety and security than it had
known, is now living in terror. They are
somewhat at a loss to understand the
events which have suddenly catapulted
them into history. None of the four
brothers goes to his job; they all feel that
death follows them everywhere, and they
move carefully, with a heavy guard.
“Why don't you just leave this country?"
I asked Shereif, "Where shall we go?"
he answered. "To whom shall we leave
our brother? Our land is under Israel's
occupation." Shereif clarified his state-
ment: “Our brother is in jail; we have to
stay."
.
'
I sensed not only the Sirhans' con-
fusion, but also some bitterness. They
have not received any aid from the Arab
countries, as they originally thought they
might. Parsons is also somewhat sur-
prised; he had hoped that the various
local Arab consulates would help defray
court costs.
Indeed, Los Angeles' Jordanian con-
sul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan's
request, indicated to me that the accused
assassin had expected the Arab people
to treat him as a hero. However, except
for some Palestinian extremists, his act
has been universally repudiated by the
Arab world. One Arab newspaper has
said editorially, "We don't feel any
responsibility for this. It is the society.
that fed him with hostility, the society
that gave him the gun, that is responsi-
ble." Members of the Arab Students'
Association, of which Sirhan was once
an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy
was a terrible mistake. One of them said
to me, "What are we going to do with
the rest of the American candidates? Kill
them all because they want to help
Israel?"
Still, the Sirhans' friends are primarily.
Arab, and they live in an atmosphere
that is more Arab than American. The
entire family spent a good deal of time:
discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The
mother says, that Sirhan was the most
sensitive and the most involved during
these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan
once saw a television report of Robert
Kennedy addressing the members of the
Neveh Shalom Temple in Portland,
Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken-
nedy, wearing a yarmulke, declared that
the United States must help Israel
against aggression from whatever source.
"Unlike the South Vietnamese,” Ken-
nedy said, “the Israelis have shown they
are willing to fight for their own survival.
Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of
Vietnam: the Israeli government is very
democratic, effective and free of corrup-
tion. Its people are united in its support."
The senator then urged the Johnson Ad-
ministration to proceed at once with the
sale of 50 Phantom jet fighters to the
Isrnell Air Force and to cut off economic
aid to the Aráb countries. This whole
episode made Sichan very angry, Shereif
recalls. “He left the room putting his
hands on his ears and almost weeping."

I asked Sirhan's mother why she
thought her son had shot Kennedy.
“Everything in this country was helping
Sirhan," she maintained. "It was push-
ing him to the danger point. Everything,
the propaganda of the Zionists, every-
thing, was against his country, against
his people."
Adel described Sirhan's current state
of mind: "He feels he has done a terrible
thing, but he feels now it is too late to be
sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen
to something they have never listened
: to."
And at their first meeting in the jail,
Sirhan's mother said to him, “Shame on
you. Why have you done such a thing?"
He replied, “It's too late to speak of it..
But all the Americans will know why."

EPSTEIN'S GARRISON
[WO SUMMERS AGO a tandem attack
on the Warren Report all but rele-
gated that work to the fiction
section of your local library. The first
was Mark Lane's Rush to Judgment,
which convincingly demonstrated-us-
ing the Warren Commission's own evi-
dence that Oswald could not have done
it alone, and drew the first dim outlines
of the conspiracy theory. The second
was Edward Jay Epstein's Inquest, which
exposed the rather shoddy inner work-
ings of the Commission and laid bare the
tortured logic it finally employed to dis-
pel notions of a conspiracy.
Both books became best sellers, but
their authors have since gonec different
ways, Lane, who shuttered his law prac-
tice and struggled for years to get his
manuscript published in the United
States (it was first published in Britain),
has stumped the country in support of
District Attorney Jim Garrison's theory
that the assassination was curried out by
an anti-Castro paramilitary team super-
'
vised by persons with CIA affiliations,
Epstein, whose book was a converted
Cornell University master's thesis-the
subject was urged upon him by his men-
tor, Andrew Hacker-has emerged as
one of Garrison's most fervid accusers.
His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the
issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-
word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's
investigation a fraud.
The New Yorker article had its genesis
over a year ago, when the author showed
up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.
According to Chief Investigator Louis
Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in
town, some three hours at the office, and
. hasn't been seen since. Much of what he
writes about has occurred since this
touch-and-go visit and is obviously hear-
say on his part, yet he writes with the
authoritative tone of a participant. Un-
doubtedly this technique is convincing |
to his audience, which assumedly is un-
familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's
investigation. But to those familiar with
the facts, the article is badly slanted.
:
For example, Philosophy Professor
Richard Popkin of the University of
California at San Diego, author of the
book The Second Oswald (propounding
the theory of an Oswald double) and
"Garrison's Case" in The New York
Review of Books (September 14, 1967),
recently commented on the article:
“I found it a queer mix of facts, half-
facts, rumors and very dubious informa-
tion from people hostile to Garrison.
Epstein has compressed all this to make
it look like everything's on the same
level. I think it would take an awful lot
of work to disentangle what he's saying
on almost any page as to how much of
it has a factual base, how much of it is
rumor that he has heard from people,
how much of it are charges that have
been made by people like [William] Gur-
vich [who volunteered to work on the
investigation without pay, passed him-
self off as the Chief Investigator, then
* turned on Garrison] against Garrison,
which haven't been substantiated any-
where except by Gurvich's statement of
them. And also that he tends to take
facts and information and rumors and so
on, that occurred over a year and a half's
period, and compress them all into
simultaneous events, so that a statement
made by Garrison at one time is
pounced upon on the basis of informa
tion or statements he made a year and a
half later in a totally different context,
So 1 think it's a quite unfair presenta
tion, which has some factual base, but
which also has a lot of very dubious
elements in it.".
One of the dubious elements is Ep-
stein's version of the testimony of Dean
Andrews Jr., a colorful attorney who
numbers among his former clients Os-
wald (who wanted his undesirable dis-
charge from the Marine Corps rectified)
and the late David William Ferrie, a
central figure in the Garrison investiga-
tion. The day after the assassination,
Andrews told the Commission he re-
ceived a phone call from a man he knew.
as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as :
a "lawyer without a briefcase" for local
homosexuals. Bertrand asked him to go
to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison
contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom
he has charged with conspiracy.
According to Epstein, Andrews ini-
tially gave the FBI "several different de-
scriptions" of Bertrand, and finally ad-
mitted that Bertrand "was merely a
figment of his imagination." Later, be-
fore the Commission, Andrews stated
that he had recently seen Bertrand in a
bar and, Epstein says, described him as
"a boy" who was "five feet eight inches"
and had "sandy hair." "No other clues
to Bertrand's identity turned up, how-
ever," writes: Epstein, "and Wesley J.
Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con-
ducted the investigation in this arca, said
he was convinced that no such person
existed."
An objective reading of Andrews
testimony, however, reveals that he
told the FBI that Bertrand was “approxi-
mately six feet one inch to six feet two
inches in height, brown hair, and well
dressed"-a description that closely
matches the tall, aristocratic Shaw. As
for Bertrand being a figment of his
imagination, Andrews declared, “That's
what the Feebees [FBI] put on." He re-
counted that G-men had pestered him
to the point where he told them, "Write
what you want, that I am nuts. I don't
care." As for his later remark to the
Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Ber-
trand was only five feet, eight inches,
Andrews explained that "this time I was
looking for the fellow, he was sitting
down." Nowhere does he refer to Ber-
trand as a "boy." Epstein was perhaps
confused by his exclamation: "I don't
play Boy Scout and measure them."

bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.
GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation

1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached. This
file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 preepared

rison's case, Epstein evidently failed to
check the police records prepared upon
Shaw's arrest. Thoroughly shaken by the
arrest. Shaw blurted out, according to
Patrolman Aloysius Habighorst, that he
had used the alias “Clay Bertrand.“ The
alias was duly entered on the fingerprint
card and booking sheet.
One of the most fascinating charac-
ters in the conspiracy drama is Richard
Case Nagell, a former U.S. Intelligence
agent who claims he encountered Oswald
in Mexico City in 1963, and had been
instructed by his spy superiors to deter-
mine if the rumors of an assassination
attempt had any foundation. Nagell says
he learned that the first attempt against
Kennedy was scheduled for September
26 in Washington, D.C., and that Oswald
(who crossed the border into Mexico the
day before) was to be set up as the
"patsy" and shot in front of the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City. When the anti-
Castro paramilitary team could not
penetrate the Presidential security in
Washington, Oswald got a reprieve. But
Nagell, who says he was sure the attempt
would come off but failed to get the FBI
to listen, faked a bank robbery in El
Paso on September 20 so that he would.
be arrested and in federal custody when
the assassination occurred.
Epstein dismisses Nagell as being
mentally unbalanced, noting that "court
records indicated that Nagell had suf-
fered brain damage in an airplane crash
in 1957” and that, following the bank
episode, he was “an inmate of a federal
institution for the criminally insane in
Springfield, Missouri." As he does so
frequently throughout the article, Ep-
stein delivers a version which if devel-
oped fully would throw a different light
on the matter. Nagell was in a plane
crash, but he was given Intelligence
:
training after his recovery, indicating
that he had no permanent brain injury.
Moreover, the fact that he stood trial
implies that he was legally sane. Re-
cently, he was released from Leaven-
worth Penitentiary-he had been at
Springfield only temporarily.
The publication of the Epstein article
came at an opportune time for Clay
Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his at-
torneys entered it as evidence before a
three-judge federal panel which was hear-
ing arguments that the DA was "con-
ducting a rein of terror” and “perse-
cuting" the defendant. Apparently the
panel was unimpressed, for it unani-
mously rejected the defense's argument
and ordered the case to trial.
If Garrison does get his day in court-
a day Epstein has struggled to deny him
-chances are his case will hold up better
than The New Yorker's brief for the
defense.

“HERE COME DE JUDGE”
ONSIDER THE REVOLT ON THE LEFT
C
if the following occured:
The President, on the eve of
his abdication, arranged to accept the
resignation of the chief justice of the
United States Supreme Court in order
to replace him with the President's
former lawyer, then an associate justice;
As a parlay, the President submitted
to the Senate the name of his oldest hand-
holding crony to fill the vacancy created
by the promotion of his former lawyer;
The chief justice, who had written a
famous report designed to satisfy the
people that the assassination of the
President's predecessor was sans con-
spiracy and the sole act of a demented
mind, conditioned his resignation on the
Senate's approval of the appointments;
The President's ex-lawyer, when called
to testify before a Senate committee,
conceded that during his three years on
the high court he had continued to act
as the President's advisor;
That pursuant to this role, he had sat
in on numerous cabinet-level meetings,
but that he had nierely "summarized"
the views of others for the benefit of the
President;
That as a justice he had dressed down
a prominent businessman who had criti-
[Law
cized war spending, though whether his
call was made at the President's request
he could not say and remain faithful to
the Separation of Powers;
That the businessman had retracted
his statement, though in the end it
proved to be accurate;
That the justice could not answer
questions concerning his judicial opin-
ions since the Constitution specifies that
members of Congress may not be ques-
tioned about their acts in any place other
than in Congress;
That despite this asserted Constitu-
tional bar, the justice pointed to his dis-
senting vote against extending the 'one-
man-one-vote principle to local govern-
ment as proof of his devotion to State's
rights;
That although he had been at the
President's disposal as advisor-summar-
izer, he had never been involved in dis-
cussions that could conceivably reach
the Court;
That the issues under discussion at the
top-level meetings had ranged from the
Vietnam War to riots in the cities;
That the justice had voted to jail đruft
card burners and had voted against
taking up for consideration the legality
of the war;
That he voted to give the police sweep-
ing rights to stop-and-frisk suspects on
suspicion alone;
That within two months of his pro-
posed elevation he had authored a book-
let, "Concerning Dissent and Disobedi-
ence," which limited the moral right to
disobey laws to those "basically offensive
to fundamental values of life or the Con-
stitution” and held that even in such
cases no legal defense could be urged,
but jailing must be willingly accepted;
That shortly after that book was pub-
lished, the justice denounced, in a ritre
interview from Washington, the activities
of some of the Columbia University
protestors as "totally inexcusable, from
the point of even primitive morality”;
That during his first term on the
Court, he cast the deciding vote uphold-
ing the conviction and five-year sentence
of Ralph Ginzburg for “pandering” a
non-obscene magazine;
That during each of his three terms he
nearly always voted for business interests
and against efforts to cut down the
trusts;
That throughout his years on the
Court he was widely immored to have
been one of the President's most hawkish
advisors on the Vietnam War.
Consider the revolt on the left if any-
thing like this happened in 1968.

INATION
(continued from e 4)
Washington about Sept. 26 (as
It turned out, JFK left Sept. 25
for a whirlwind tour of the West).
Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana
on Sept. 19 to see if Castro
aides could shed light on the
assassination plot, but the only
advice they could offer was to
execute Oswald in the hope that
would stop the plan.
But Nagell left Cuba deciding
that he "was an intelligence
agent, not a killer." Flying to El
Paso via Mexico City, he walked
into the bank the next day for
"the sole purpose of having
myself arrested and detained by
federal authorities" ap-
parently. fearing that his
that his
association with Oswald would
implicate himself in the planned.
assassination.
-
Nagell was in the El Paso jail
when Kennedy was shot in
· Dallas two months later. He sent
an offer to testify before the
Warren Commission through
"private channels" but received
no reply.
Dedicated Leftist
In his recent discussions with
Popkin, Nagell has revealed
new details about Oswald. He
first met Oswald, he said, in the
late fifties at the U.S. naval base
at Atsugi, Japan, where Oswald
was a Marine Corps radar
specialist. They became friends
but didn't encounter one
another again until August 1963
when Nagell learned of the plot
against Kennedy.
'Disputing claims that Oswald
had ties with the CIA, Nagell
belleves that Oswald was a
dedicated leftist who was duped
by anti-Castro exiles involved in
the conspiracy. Posing as
Castro G-2 intelligence agents,
the exiles wheedled Oswald into
becoming a "fall guy" by playing
on his Castro sympathies, pain-
ting Kennedy as anti-Castro and
promising that he would be
spirited to Havana after the
assassination.
Nagell told Popkin he met
with Oswald both in Mexico City
and New Orleans, hotbeds of
the anti-Castro movement.
"Nagell claims he has squirrel-
ed away a snapshot of himself
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken
in Jackson Square in New
Orleans in 1963," Popkin as-
serted. "In the picture are two
other men, both anti-Castro
Cubans, who were pretending

.
is
If this photograph does exist
it would lend credibility to
Nagell's account. And Ne is
willing to surface and tè
story to Congress, Popkin says,
provided protective conditions
are met.
"
"Manchurian Candidate"
Popkin is also convinced that
the Manila "Manchurian Can-
didate" case was connected to
the JFK assassination. On
March 2, 1967, a man named
Luis Angel Castillo was detain-
ed by the Philippine National
Bureau of Investigation after he
had contacted left-wing · Huk
guerrillas. Questioned under
guerrillas. Questioned under
truth serum and hypnosis.
Castillo blurted out a tale of hav-
ing been taken to a building in
Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy
was shot, handed a rifle
assembled from components
hidden in a bowling bag and in-
structed to fire at a man in an
open car sitting next to a lady.
The signal to fire would be given
by mirror flashes.
The story caused a brief sen-
sation at the time. The Manila
Times bannered: " 'JFK Plotter'
in Manila!" Wire service dis-
patches to the United States
said Castillo was a “Cuban-
trained Communist agent" who
hadn't shot because he heard
that a man named Joe "had
already shot the man in the
open car." The story was so im-
plausible that it quickly died.
Not long ago the hypnotist
who conducted the interroga-
tion of Castilio for the Philippine
authorities arrived in this coun-
try under the name Vincente R.
Sanchez. When Popkin took a
look at his reports, his eyes
popped.
The reports termed Castillo a
"zombie"
a hyp-
noprogrammed robot.
Double-Agent Network
Sanchez extracted Castillo's
rambling story over a period of
weeks. Castillo, then 28, was in-
ducted around 1960 into a
"Special Operations Group"
which afforded him paramilitary
training. In 1961 he participated
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a
pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he
infiltrated a double-agent
network, posing as a Com-..
munist in Venezuela and li-
quidating a Communist agent in
Mexico.
-
In talking about the JFK
assassination, Castillo
despite some disjointed
phrases was nevertheless
able to describe in some detail
-
:
-
And now 111s contur agent
ordered, "They got him already.
Let's get out of here." After the
rifle was disassembled and
stuffed in the bowling bag, he
was hustled into the car which
had brought him to the building..
It stopped twice within blocks to
pick up other men.
In 1967, according to
Sanchez. Castillo was
programmed to assassinate
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos after openly associating
with the leftist Huks which
would implicate them in the
assassination. Popkin points
out that this is a similar ploy to
the one Nagell attributed to the
anti-Castro Cubans' use of
Oswald.'
Until recently, the Castillo
episode might have seemed a
logcial impossibility. But the
release of the Rockefeller
Report, with its revelations
about secret CIA projects to in-
duce behavior modification in
unsuspecting subjects, make.
the possibility of a "Manchurian
Candidate" more than mere
fantasy. (In the Robert Kennedy
assassination, Dr. Bernard Dia-
mond, who examined Sirhan
Sirhan for the defense, testified
that he believed Sirhan was
hypnotized at the time of the
shooting.)
Although the current
whereabouts of Castillo is un-
known, the Sanchez reports
contain the names of six per-
sons who supposedly ran his
network, including the "control
officer" and a woman who hyp-
notized him. Popkin's own in-
vestigations have shown that
these people do exist.
Through Popkin their stories
have now been passed on to the
Attorney General and the
Church Committee.
William Turner's latest book.
The Cuba Project, the story of
the CIA's secret war against
Castro, will be published this fall
by Houghton Mifflin.

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by William
W. TURNED
OS INDICES RESULT.
Subject tecsze of interest to the office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
he time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Tems on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this mase see captured
by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employses. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
nomes in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet egent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His file contains mostly FRI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming from the plane crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that RACHELL be personally
interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that F0III, might reveal
how he emme into the possession there names but no further ection is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.
DETAILS:
Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in his prior to March 1964
when the names of CIA employees were found in his possessica when arrested
for bank robbery.
The SMMPARTS clain that he received intelligence training after the plane
crash is true. The crash occurred 29 November 1954 and he graduated fron
Army Intelligence School, Pt. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He
served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating about 1958. A Lt. Col. Rad W. QURIT vho served with
NAGELL personally in Korea advised that MAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability ves probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash.
The KAMPARTS erticle's claim that HAURLL said he fired the gun in the
bank at El Paso, Texas because be umsted to be in custody when the assassination
took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of
chronology)
The RAMPARTS article's allegation that the FBI took from NACELL e note-
containing the names of CIA employees is true.
HAGELL's omplaint that he was "salted away" is open to speculation. A
ten year prison sentence does sppear harsh, considering the documented brain

Mabley's Report:
arrison Case
Can We Afford
Not to Listen?
"
BY JACK MABLEY
THE INVESTIGATION INTO the assassination of Presi-
dent Kennedy is being reopened. It is being conducted by a
prosecutor with the power of subpena and a grand jury
with the power to indict.
JIM GARRISON.
It would be better for the country
if the fodoral government were mak-
ing the investigation rather than a
"New Orleans official who has been
accused of being unstable and of
seeking headlines.
However, the federal government
shows no signs of wanting to reopen
the matter, and the prosecutor, Jim
Garrison, appears to be quite insistent
on carrying it thru.
'
A number of writers and self-
appointed investigators also are dis-
satisfied with conflicting facts and
unanswered questions, and they con-
tinue to publish evidence to rebut the
Warren commission conclusion that
Lee Harvey Oswald alone was involved in the assassination.
ONE OF THE MOST persistent critics of the Warren
conclusion is Ramparts magazine. This is a liberal, no, a
radical publication which represents the viewpoint of a small
minority. However, if has done some effective investigative
reporting, particularly in exposing the CIA infiltration into
college activities.
:
Ramparts assigned an investigator, William W. Turner,
who they say is a former FBI agent, to spend 9 months
looking into the New Orleans evidence.
"I have worked closely with the D. A. [Garrison] and his
staff," Turner reports. "In my opinion, there is no question
that they have uncovered a conspiracy."
The gist of the New Orleans case is that. Oswald was
involved with a heterogeneous group of adventurers, anti-
Castro Cubans, and radical righters who included members
of the Minutemen and American Nazis. .
Their common cause was to encourage or mount a revolt
in Cuba against Castro. They also were strongly anti-
Nommunist.
There is no question this group existed. Garrison has
semence that Oswald was part of it. Garrison's investigators
ve evidence that Oswald's pro-Russian leanings actually
a front, or a disguise to conceal his real role as an
ommunist.
GARRISON BELIEVES THAT Oswald was schooled in
covert operations by the CIA while in the marine corps.
at Atsugi naval station in Japan. Supporting evidence is
Oswald's proficiency in the Russian language, the source of
which was never explained, the ease with which he entered
Russia, and the lack of censure by the government-on his
return, or by the marine corps in his discharge.
'
In effect, Garrison feels Oswald was either a CIA agent
or was involved with CIA activities.
-
The New Orleans group was angry at President Kennedy
because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation and
because they thought Kennedy wasn't sufficiently anti-
communist:
..
Garrison has dozens of witnesses he will subpena to fit
bits and pieces into the puzzle, Individually, many can be
dismissed as unreliable, but collectively they raise many
questions that an objective observer would like to see
...resolved.
'
It certainly is within the power of the federal govern-
ment to disprove every one of these witnesses' stories, if.
they can be disproved. Presumably, the federal government
does not want to dignify Garrison's allegations with formal
denials.
"
5
IF THERE IS ANY substance to Garrison's charges,
two powerful agencies of the federal government stand to be
discredited. Garrison has interviewed one witness, Richard
Cass Nagell a highly decorated Korean war veteran who
claims to have been a CIA agent, who says he sent a
registered letter to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the
assassination plot. If this is true, Hoover and the FBI would
be guilty of dreadful dereliction of duty.
The CIA and CIA fronts are deeply involved in the
activities of the men Garrison believes plotted the Presi-
dent's murder.
-Turner, the Ramparts investigator, believes powerful
government agencies are doing everything in their power
to discredit Garrison.
Ten persons involved in the case have died, most of
them violently, since the assassination. All went to their
graves with information Garrison considers pertinent to his
investigation.
Unless Garrison is killed or removed from office in
some way, it is difficult to see what can stop him from
airing these stories, probably in a court of law that the
public may judge their validity.

SUBJECT: Item in East Village Other, August 20, 1969
DATE: September 2, 1969
This past weekend, I visited a friend who had just returned from New
York City, bringing back a copy of a New York underground newspaper,
the East Village Other, dated August 20, 1969.
Out of curiosity, I paged through the paper and, on page 17, found a
so-called classified section, consisting generally of ads for male and
female artists models and offerings of books alleged to instruct one
in the art of synthesizing hallucinogenics.
In the personal columns of this section, the following was noted, a
verbatim transcript of which is set forth:
"Caught In The Act. Notice to the CIA and all SY
sshitheads who participated in Project Purple Shaft:
After that fiasco in the GDR you worms did your best
to screw, blue and tattoo me. You even tried to have
my ass dusted in Berlin 。。 you fuckups. Now its
my turn to do a little shafting.
Cordially, R. C. NAGELL."
Card indices in SY/E reflect no indication that anyone named R. C.
NAGELL or any variation thereof, including NAGLE or NOGELL, has
ever been granted clearance in this office.

A check in SY files reflected a record on Richard Case NAGELL, born
August 5, 1930, who apprently is identical with the individual who
authored the above item. A cursory review of the file reflects that
NAGELL has been of interest to both the FBI and the Department in
recent years.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE
While NAGELL may be something of a crackpot, the item does appear to
contain somewhat of an implied threat. For this reason, the informa-
tion is forwarded for your consideration and for any action which may
be considered necessary.

Background
My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was expelled
from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibly
propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin.
As we initially escorted Mr. Nagell back to US Army Hospital
Berlin in the US Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where
he was, and who we were, as well as being angry and belligerent
about his treatment by the East Germans. In the course of
the two hour interview which was then conducted at the
hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and
gave a more cooperative and coherent history. At his
insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the
attorney Mr. Ricey S. New, Jr., who acted in an unofficial
capacity as a legally oriented "friend."
'
The salient aspects of Mr. Nagell's history are as follows.
He says he was on active military duty (Army) from 1948 until
1959. For the first three of these years he was an enlisted
man, and for the last six he was an officer, working in
military intelligence. In 1954 he was the sole survivor in
a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, numerous
physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalization.
Mr. Nagell now claims that he believes it was this head
injury which resulted in his "unstable personality and
immature or impulsive behaviour." He attributes to this
instability his marital difficulties and his decision to
resign his commission in 1959, something which he now considers
unwise. At the time of his leaving the service he was not
awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later
able to successfully petition the VA for a "64% disability."
He claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist during his
military career.
From 1959 to 1962 he says that he worked for the State of
California as an investigator for various bureaus. itis
marital difficulties had increased and his wife insisted on
separation, keeping with her their two children. Hagell
says that one night in 1962 he became intoxicated, and tried
to break down the door to her apartment. On this basis he
says he lost his job and says that for the next year the
"just drifted," apparently without motivation to work,
supporting himself on his disability pension and financial
aid from his sister. le is not certain about whether or not
the divorce from his wife has ever been legally completed.

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which
The now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness
and desperation. lle claims that in a confused way he
attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily appre-
hended. For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated
series of trials, appeals and retrials. In addition to
spending these years in prison, he also had at least three
prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation. His
appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was
"temporarily insane" at the time of the crime. He was not
considered insane at any time during his imprisonment, and
his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert
testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin
Weinstein. Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted Nagell's
EEG's (electro-encephalograms) as being abnormal and argued
that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and
instability" on the basis of his brain injury. This conten-
tion was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but
in any case Nagell was officially acquitted on April 29 of ☑
this year.
'
On
Nagell says he then went to the New York area, where his
sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an
additional complication in his life had risen in that he
had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee Harvey Oswald, and
had been implicated in a possible plot to assassinate
President Kennedy in an article in RAMPARTS magazine which
appeared in January 1968. Mr. Nagell firmly denies that he
was involved in any way with any such conspiracy, and was
in fact imprisoned at the time of the assassination.
the basis of this magazine article Nagell says that
Mr. Garrison, the attorney general from New Orleans who is
arguing that a conspiracy existed in the assassination,
came up to New York to interview him. Nagell says that he
denied that he had any information of use to Mr. Garrison,
but that the interview left him with two fears. One fear
was that Garrison might subpoena him to testify in the New
Orleans proceedings, and the other fear was that the CIA
might try to "eliminate" him, a suspicion which he says
was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison. He says that soon
afterwards while walking down a street at night in New York
City he was almost run over by a car without lights.
fle
interpreted this as being an attempt at murder by the CIA
and in some haste left the country for a tour of Europe.

overall suspiciousness, and his fears about the CIA, there
was no overt evidence of psychosis. His nutritional state
and general well-being both appeared to be good.
Summary
In summary then we seem to be dealing with a person who has
had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested
by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, a tendency
to be litigious, and a general suspicious or paranoic
orientation. It is difficult to know how much of what he
is saying is factual, but it may be that in June of this
year he was becoming "borderline" or even delusional in his
thinking about possible attempts on his life, and this
probably explains his flight to Europe. Currently, he is
not psychotic and seems competent in a legal and psychiatric.
sense to negotiate his own affairs and be a free citizen
again.
His own closing words provide a lighter note to what other-
wise has been a complicated and serious mishap. "Well, I'll
tell you one thing, that's the last time I ever take a train
through East Germany!"

In June, shortly thereafter, he discussed with an American
consular official in Zurich his recurrent fear that the
CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to
West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was
traversing the DDR, he says that he was taken off the
train and illegally detained. He is not certain why he
was taken off the train but admits to having talked freely
on the train to other passengers about his life history,
and he was also carrying with him a heavy portfolio of all
of his Army and government records involved with his service
career, disability, and imprisonment. For several months
Nagell claims that he was interrogated by the East Germans
and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or govern-
ment agent.
Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the
only way to be released would be to feign mental illness,
which he says he proceeded to do. This was several weeks
ago and he says he was soon examined by an East German
psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated
in his release today, four and one-half months after his
detention began.
Mr. Nagell's plans for the future center around returning
to the United States and beginning an appeal to the govern-
ment to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as well
as for his physical disability, on the basis of his head
injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think
that the CIA was trying to kill him.
Mental Status Exam
Mr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who shows the evidence
of a prior head injury in the form of extensive scars on
the left side of his face, facial asymmetry due to seventh-
nerve injury, reconstructive surgery on his left ear, etc.
In addition he shows some healed incisions on his left wrist
which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflicted
at the time of his first imprisonment in 1963, and again a
few weeks ago in the DDR. He denies that in either instance
he seriously intended to kill himself. He is of superior
intelligence and shows a remarkable memory for dates and
names. Initially he was belligerent, angry, and suspicious
of every effort made to help him. Over the span of two
hours, he gradually became more cooperative and rational.
He is in his own terms a "chronically paranoid person" by.
which he means that he is always highly suspicious and tends
to impute intentions where none may exist. Despite his

3 MAR 1965 ·
GIST: SLOSS, a staff employee since 1948, has recently been
repolygraphed with inconclusive results, having reacted to questions
regarding disclosure of classified information, association with a com-
munist sympathiser, and homosexuality. He has also been involved
with cooperation in an extramarital affair which liminated in a black-
mail attempt on one of the parties. His name is perhaps identical
a name among six names of Agency employees found on a mentally dis-
turbed and disaffected former CIC intelligence office who alleges contact
with Russian and Cuban Intelligence agents. Details of these questionable
areas in regard to SLOSS are set forth below. Recommend intensive and
thorough investigation of SLOSS including surveillance of activities.
DETAILS: 1. Mr. John Richard SLOSS, born 24 September 1919
at Cleveland, Ohio, has been a staff employee of this Agency since 1948.
His parents are American born. He graduated from Yale University in
1941 and was assigned to Military Intelligence Training Center, Camp
Ritchie, Maryland, as an instructor, from January 1943 to July 1945.
He attended Columbia University, School of International Affairs and the
Russian Institute from 1946 to 1948, receiving an M. A. Degree in Inter-
national Affairs.
2. SLOSS is currently a Special Intelligence Duty Officer in
OCI, GS-14. During his assignment in Germany 1953-1955 and on a TDY
to Germany in 1958, he had been authorized to deal with foreign intelli-
gence elements in the OCI overseas liaison program. SLOSS was poly-
graphed in 1950 and 1953 with favorable results; in 1955 with unfavorable
results; and twice in 1964 with inconclusive results regarding giving CIA
documents or classified information to unauthorized persons, contact
with a possible communist sympathiser, and engaging in homosexual acti-
vities since working for CIA. He was granted a "Q" Clearance in October
1963. His Top Secret Clearance was certified to the White House on 23

February 1965 in connection with a visit to a Presidential relocation site,
3. The name of John SLOSS may be identical with the name J.
SLOSS found on the person of Richard O NAGELL when arrested in con
nection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1963. A
notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Commit-
tes, the addresses of Foreign Embassies, the names of purported CIA
agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably ment-
ally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in espionage which is
not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of
why the name J. SLOSS as well as five other names of CIA personnel
should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGELL. The weird
story of NAGELL is contained in a chronological listing of his activities
appended to this memorandum,
4. A review of the Security file on SLOSS in connection with the
Richard Case NAGELL matter revealed that SLOSS, for the past few years.
1960-1964, had provided his apartment as a place of assignation in the
adulterous relationship of Philip Barry KENNEDY, a GS-15 Intelligence of-
fice, assigned to OCI and Mrs. Betty BARKER, a former employee of the
Central Intelligence Agency from 19 October 1953 until 26 July 1962. The
relationship between Kennedy and Barker was disclosed on 19 May 1964
when KENNEDY reported to the Office of Security that Mrs. BARKER had
received a strange telephone call from an unknown male on 18 May 1964
who advised her that he knew what was going on between her and her boy
friend and that he had pictures. The unknown caller attempted to black-
mail Mrs. BARKER into meeting him. Mrs. BARKER apparently told
her husband the whole story and informed (KENNEDY 3
13.

5. It is noteworthy in the $LOSS KENNEDY-BARKER matter
that SLOSS has been involved in cooperating in an unlawful and immoral
activity which, according to the direct testimony of one of the parties,
(believed to be true because the report was against her own interest)
resulted in a blackmail attempt against her in May 1964.
6
6. Of particular concern should be the results of the latest
two polygraph examinations, the validity of which, because of medication
including a tranquilizer type drug and alcohol in the Subject's system, was
deemed to be inconclusive.
7. During the 1955 polygraph examination, the Subject admitted
to homosexual desires but stated that these had never caused a personal
problem and had never resulted in his participation in a homosexual act
During the 24 April 1964 examination, the Subject showed consistent re-
actions to the homosexual question which indicated deception. During

further specific questioning on 22 May 1964 covering the various homosexual
areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that Subject might
be practicing deception on the specific question regarding engaging in homo-
sexual activities since working for CIA.
8. In connection with the phase of questions concerning contact
with any possible communist sympathizer, the Subject reflected overall
disturbance indicating that all the questions obviously bothered him and
that deception was being practiced within that phase. The polygraph opera-
tor noted that there were outstanding reactions to the following two questions:
20 b. "Other than your comments about FISHER, during your
undergraduate period at Yale did you have any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?
20
Answer: No. "
During your CIA employment, have you had any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?
Answer: No."
9. It is particularly noteworthy that during his examination on
22 May 1964 when asked nine questions as to whether he had been acquaint-
ed with certain individuals. Subject only reacted when he answered "no"
to having been acquainted with Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON. These
names had been submitted to Subject based upon pure conjecture that there
possibly might have been some connection with these individuals at Camp
Ritchie Military Intelligence Training Center. Since the fact that both
Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON have cooperated with Soviet Intelligence
should have been unknown to SLOSS and he declared he is not acquainted
with them, there should have been no reason for him to react to these names.
The polygraph operator states that SLOSS was not pressed further regarding
FISHER (whom he had characterized as "left of center") or his own possible
knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTAN since it was obvious that SLOSS was
beginning to feel harassed on this matter and stated that he did not enjoy
being asked these questions.
10. During SLOSS' interview on 4 April 1964, SLOSS reflected
consistent reactions on the questions:
"Since working for CIA,have you given CIA documents or
classified information to unauthorized persons?"

CONCLUSION:
1. SLOSS has lied in his most recent polygraph examination and
has evidenced Indications of deception in areas concerning divulging
classified information to unauthorized individuals, association with a
communist sympathizer and homosexual inclinations. SLOSS' reaction
to the names of Jerry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON has not been fully ex-
plored. The polygraph operator has recommended further investigation
and a repolygraph because the recent tests are inconclusive.
2. SLOSS has been involved in an immoral and illegal extra-
marital activity between a Staff employee and a former Staff employee
where one of the parties was subjected to a blackmail attempt.
3. The name J. SLOSS (possibly identical to Subject) appeared
on a list of CIA employees found on the person of a self-designated "dis-
affected American" arrested by the FBI for bank robbery in September
1963. This individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence ex-
perience has declared that he was approached by Soviet Intelligence while
and/or after he was in Mexico City in September 1962.
4. It is suggested that the extent of the adverse security implica-
tions concerning SLOSS is such, that if SLOSS is ever found to be a security
risk, the failure at this time to pursus an aggressive investigation of all
his contacts and activities to resolve all areas of doubt could possibly lead
to a conclusion that we have been remiss in our duties. The undersigned
recommends the following action:
That physical and technical surveillance of at least two
weeks duration be made of SLOSS to determine his contacte and
activities after working hours.
b. That current seven way National Agency Checks be made
on SLOSS.
That Richard B. FISHER, a friend of SLOSS', characterized
by him as having been involved in radical and left of center ideas
while en undergraduate at Yale,be fully identified, his present lo-
cation be ascertained and the degree of his association with SLOSS
be determined by a personal interview with FISHER.
d. That Richard Case NAGELL be personally interviewed by
the undersigned in the hope that by a sympathetic approach he may
reveal how he came into the possession of the name J. SLOSS and
other employees of CIA.

"Have you ever deliberately given classified information on
documents to any unauthorised person?"
In explanation, Subject said he was bothered by this idea, but
that he had no knowledge of any particular situation wherein he had di-
vulged information to anyone who was unauthorized to receive it or who
would have used it against the Agency's interest. On the test administered
on 22 May 1964 to resolve any possible compromise to communist or foreign
intelligence organisations, it was determined that there were no significant
reactions to relevant questions in this area.
1. It should be especially noted that the polygraph operator,during
the 4 April 1964 interview, detected an odd smell on Subject's breath and
noted his flushed face, frequent silly grins and lethargic movements, sug-
gesting that the Subject may have been slightly intoxicated. The operator
did not ask during this interview whether the Subject had taken any drug
or alcohol prior to the interview but recalled an incident wherein the Sub-
ject when arrested for drunken driving in 1963 had produced evidence that
he was a diabetic and had taken medication prior to the incident. Conse
quently, during the second interview on 22 May 1964, Subject was questioned
regarding his physical health. He replied that he had stopped taking medi-
cation for diabetes in November 1963. He explained that he took three or
four diuretic pills. He specifically denied that he had taken any other drug,
narcotic or alcohol. When this question was asked during interrogation,
he reflected reaction indicative of deception and then admitted that for
breakfast he had taken one glass of vodka with some orange juice. He
stated that he drank vodka for breakfast sometimes whenever he was tense
or nervous over anything.
12. The polygraph operator in his report concluded that the
"validity of final test charts is held in question and there is no
strong evidence that the specific areas of concern have been
conclusively resolved at this time. It is recommended that a
further study be conducted on this case and that information
resulting from such a study be sent to IRD for possible reinter-
view of the Subject and polygraph resolution".
13. SLOSS has indicated reactions indicative of deception during
the polygraph examinations. In one specific question where these re-
actions were present, he admitted to lying. This was in the question as
to whether or not he had taken any alcohol prior to the examination.

Eleanore Gambert was contacted at her home
located at 82-25 Grand Avenue, Queens, New York, on
February 28, 1964, by Special Agents Thomas J. Dowling
and Benjamin P. Grogan, who identified themselves to
her as Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
She was told that the Special Agents wished to talk to her
about her brother, Richard Case Nagell; that she would not
have to speak with the interviewing agents; that anything
she might say could be used in court; and that she had
a right to counsel before making any statement. Nrs.
Gambert advised that she had no objection to being interviewed
and that she would cooperate in any way possible.
She advised that her brother, Richard Case
Nagell, last resided with her in her home for a 5 or 6
week period which ended just prior to Christmas, 1962.
While in New York, he was for the most partunemployed and
seeking a position. She noted that he did obtain a
position as a store detective but that this lasted
for only several days when he decided that this was not
the type of investigative work he wanted to do.
When questioned as to whether or not she knew
of any activity on the part of her brother which could
have been of a subversive nature, she stated that she
knew of no such activity; that she did not believe her
brother capable of taking part in such activity; and
that if she ever became aware that he was engaging at
any time in such activity she would have nothing to do
with him.. At this point she noted that approximately
a month prior to the interview she had received several
letters that were returned to her from El Paso, Texas,
which she had written to her brother, indicating that
he was no longer at the El Paso County Jail. She
subsequently received a letter from her brother indicating
that he was at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners,
Springfield, Missouri. She noted that she answered this
letter immediately, but has not as yet heard from her

brother. She stated that she expected to hear from her
brother immediately after he received her letter and the
fact that she has not heard has made her uneasy. She
noted that she offered, if permitted, to visit him, and
that she hoped to ascertain as a result of this visit,
the reason he attempted to rob a bank in El Paso, Texas,
on September 20, 1963. She advised that she has had no
reason to believe that her brother is not responsible for
his actions, and she noted that in one letter he wrote
to her that the bank robbery attempt was a pre-meditated
action on his part. She advised that her brother has
been in a depressed state of mind ever since he had been
accused of taking a bribe and fired from his position
with the California State Liquor Authority. She noted
that she believed, as her brother claims, that this
purported bribe was set up to remove her brother from his
position with the California State Liquor Authority
because of his honesty and failure to handle investigations
as insturated by superiors.
When questioned as to whether or not her brother,
Richard Case Nagell, maintains any type of property at her
residence, she advised that he does maintain a military
type metal foot locker, and that he has maintained it at
her residence since his discharge from the United
States Army. She noted that as this foot locker is
her brother's property, she is not aware of its contents,
although she believes it contains mementoes of his
military service, including his medals and a complete
uniform. She advised that she does not even know whether or
not the foot locker is open or locked.
It is noted that during the course of the inter-
view of Eleanore Gambert, her husband, Louis Gambert
was present.
