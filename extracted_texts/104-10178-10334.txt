It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate ODACID and GDURSE officials for the purpose
of removing Identity A's name from the denied admissions
list mince her close connection with a member of the Cuban
Communist Party, which presumably was the basin of the
derogatory information, is no longer a fact.

1. Identity A, who is the mother of AMICE/31, a Station asset,
has been twice denied permission to enter the United States as a

1956 from the Swise abansy and arrived in the United States by air
on 28 Fabriary,
3. Identity A was the wife of Identity D, a camber of the
Cuban Communist Party for some twenty years, at the time of her
first application to leave Cuba. Identity D diod in October of
1965 and according to AMICE/31 lost his Communist Party membership
card about a year prior to his death. According to AMICE/31,
Identity A has never foined on bean a gember of the Cow unist
Party although there is a possibility that her husband may hava
placed her name on the mumbershin lista, AMICE/31 slso stated that
she has long been a racticing Catholic and that she is very anti-
Communist. Sent an at sove attachments are two statements
From the Alshon of Glenfce and the Assistant Bishop of Havana

Querido Amigo:
LORET
Paso a contestar tu atenta nota de fecha 2
del actual. - Rapidamente, trataré de darte un panorama de lo que
ocurre aquí y de algunas ideas para la FLAT.- Para mejor informa-
ción tuya, te acompaño además un informe sobre la situación inter-
na de la CGT Argentina y algunos problemas que nos afectan muy agu-
damente a los trabajadores de esta parte de Latinoamerica.-
1.-
-
La huelga general de los obreros del puerto
lleva ya al día de la fecha 53 días de duración.- A pesar de la
solidaridad que han recibido de muchos gremios y de todas las fuer-
zas populares, la situación de estos compañeros es muy dura.- Los
motivos de la huelga los encontrarás en el informe adjunto.-
La ITF ha "recomendado" el boycott interna-
-
cional en apoyo de los portuarios argentinos.- La medida es justa,
pero ha resultado bastante limitada ya que no todos los sindicatos
adheridos a la ITF lo han puesto en práctica, además en algunes lu-
gares se aplicó mal, pues se boycoteaba a los barcos argentinos, pero
no a los de otros banderas que venían con mercaderías de Argentina;
esto no es eficaz y se presta a maniobras turbias.- YO ESCRIBE A LA
CLASC y a la CISC pidiendo un apoyo decidido a los portuarios argen-
tinos, pero aun no hemos recibido aquí la documentación sobre las me-
didas que hayan adoptada nuestras centrales internacionales.-
2.-
1
Otro conflicto sumamente grave, es el que
enfrentamos en este momento los ferroviarios.- El gobierno ha sancio-
nado por lay un nuevo reglamento de trabajo que nos retrotras a 50
años atras en muchos aspectos; además el plan oficial prevé la redu
ción de los 25 talleras con 51 líneas de producción que existen, a
solamente 19 talleros con 31 líneas de producción. Esto significa
RESOSUPACIÓN y además, perjudica al sistema ferreviarlo y al país. -
Es necesario presionar a la Federación In-
ternacional de Sindicatos Cristianos del Transporte de la CISC, y a
las organizaciones de base de la FLAT, para que se prenuncien tambien
en este grave conflicto, crucial para el movimiento obrero argentino,
YA QUE LA UNION FERROVIARIA ES EL SINDICATO MAS PODEROSO DE LA AR-
GENTINA,
3.-
-
La CCT Argentina se ha lanzado ya a un en-
frentamiento abierto contra el gobierno militar de Onganfa. El proxi-
mo miercoles 14 habra un paro general de 24 horas, como protesta con-
tra el escandaloso aumento del costo de vida, contra el "arbitraja
obligatoria" y en apoyo de los gremios en conflicto,»*

4.-
En el aspecto interno de la FLAT, te dire
que como secretario general, me he visto totalmente frenado por
la falta de recursos, ya que ni para imprimir papel membretado
tengo dinero.-
A pesar de esta dificultad, he tratado de
hacer algunas tareas mínimas: enviar información a la CLASC y a
la CISC sobre los problemas del transporte que existen en Argentina,
y mantener un minimo de cohesion y de organización del grupo de
sindicalistas cristianes del transporte que actúa en mi pais.-
Lo que estoy necesitando, son las direcciones
de las organizaciones afiliadas a la FLAT. En Panama no las tome,
porque se nos había prometido una lista completa de nombres y
direcciones de todos los participantes del Congreso de CLASC; pero
esto nunca llego.
5.-
Estoy completamente de acuerdo contigo, en la
necesidad de presionar al Buro y al Comite Ejecutivo de CLASC, para
que pongan en marcha las FEDERACIONES PROFESIONALES.- Tambien deberán
solucionar tu situación (es necesario que vengas a Latinoamerica),
proveer de algunos recursos mínimos a la FLAT, y CONCRETAR DEFINITIVA-
MENTE EL CURSO-CONGRESO DEL TRANSPORTE.-
Siempre a tus órdenes, te saluda fraternalmente,
1 143

No₂ AMICE-31 had only the following to add concerning
Raimundo ONGARO and his activities: After ONGARO had made his
“violent speech on television in Santo Domingo he was cornered
by the Cuban (exile) delegation the members of which were in-
censed by his allegations concerning Cuban exiles and his
misinformation about the Castro regime. According to AMICE-31
their arguments prevailed and ONGARO in the end was quite
apologetic and admitted to them (AMICE-31 thought sincerely)
that he had been in error. As proof of the sincerity of
ONGARO's change of mind on the Cuban question AMICE-31 pointed
to the fact that, on behalf of the Cuban delegation, ONGARO
approached Juan Luis GALLO Estevez, the intransigent Uruguayan
whose negative vote (the only one) doomed the Cuban-sponsored
resolution on political prisoners to defeat, and tried to get
him to go along with the majority.
2. AMICE-31 called ONGARO basically "un buen muchacho"
and non-Communist. He reported that ONGARO was a strong
He added this
peronista and a "good, practicing Catholic".
latter description with some wonderment because he had always
placed "good, practicing Catholics" automatically in the pro-
U.S., anti-Castro camp.

There seems no useful purpose to be served
by covering AMICE-31's personal expenses for
the trip described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of
the referenced dispatch as WOFACT has good
coverage from other sources.
Headquarters has no interest in AMICE-31's

ABSTRACT
1. Attached is AMICE-31's report on the meeting of the

de Sindicatos Cristianos (CLASC, Latin American Confederation
of Christian Trade Unions), held in Medellin, Colombia, from
5 to 14 January 1966.
If any
2. Since the Station has not received copies of any
disseminations that may have been made from information cabled
during the meeting at Medellin, no attempt has been made to
prepare portions of AMICE-31's report for dissemination.
of the report is disseminated at Headquarters, the Station would
appreciate receiving copies, along with copies of any reports
that may already have been disseminated on the meeting at
Medellin, and any future disseminations on the CLASC.
3. Also attached, under separate cover, is a copy of a
report by Keith G. BONGIRNO which includes a list of AMICE-31's
achievements at the meeting and his impressions of and attitudes
toward certain delegates and issues.

6. It looks that our friend who talked to Pico in Medellin and Bogota was
disgusted because Pico was satisfied with the results of the meeting. Pico's
satisfaction stemmed from the strong anti-Castro stand the Council adopted
and it is obvious that the fuming problem so important to us could not a upset
him.
1
7. Pico reports that there is a good chance that Dagoberto Gonzalez( Soc.Gen.of
Trabajadores Copeyanes) will be elected as CLASC president at the next CLASC
Congress. According to him Jose Goldsack will become Treasurer and present
treasurer Alfredo di Pacce will hord new CLASC office dedicated to raise funds
from the LA affiliates.
Pico considers Gonzalez as a staunch anti-communist and better disposed toward |
than Raspero. Ho thinks that flanked by Gonzalez and Gold sack, Maspero wall
not have so much to say and his power will be limited. Gonzalez is apparently a
much more forceful personality than Goldsack, who doesn't have enough guts to
oppose Maspero.
8. Pico believes that Maspero is less aggressive and anti-US as he used to be. He
thinks that the pressure from CISC and ISI plus a strong anti-communist posture
pf the affiliates accounts for this.
In the cables received from our Colombia office there is a strong criticism of
Picò as a sort of Maspero's stooge. After discussiong this topic several times
with Pico I think that his opinion of Maspero X is s
educated
Maspero is a forceful, dinamic and well prepared leader. Ash Argentine and
ex-peronista he has more drive and is a better organizer than the others in
CLASC. Besides he offers CLASC a promise of bringing CTG into an alliance with
thom, a feat which only he can accomplish. For Pico's taste Maspero is too
demagogic and he doesn't like his anti-US and soft of commies attitude, however,
Pico claims that Maspero lately is much more aware of commie danger. As Maspero
is without doubt the most powerful single individual in CLASC and as Pico positi
is weak (his Federation is not created yet and he has to be confirmed as Secretar
General) he sees no use of bucking Maspere especially as no organized and strong
opposition exists. Pico,however, would see with sympathy "aspero power restricte
or it will not bother him al all to see Maspero removed completely. Put as long
as he exists Pico believes that for his personal good and in order to be able te
push strong anti-Castro stand (in which he is mainly interested) he has to work
and live with Maspero.
This position impresses me as a sensible one.
III MISC. REMARKS
1. There is some inconsistence in the cables we received. In one of them Romano
schumi, CLASC Executive Secretary for the Dutch Antilles and President of CEDJU
is described as " widely considered insignificant and unipresive element*. In
another cable this same Tschumio is quoted as a source ( direct source not via
Pico as Pico said that he didn't know about campesinos sold out) and as a new
CLASC Asst Secretary General (Pigg also claims that he doesn't know about it even
if he was criticised before xxx getting his info from such a lousy source
as "schuale).
798.1914.
2. Pico reports that in Carsons
he met Carl Morden from IGI Benn office in
CLASC office. Carlos Moria( vice-directors of Instituto de Estudios Pociales di
Caribe), Mariano Bonites (Centro Dodusentacion -aracas) Santiago Tortosa(See Gen
of CODESA), sequiel Borges(CIS) were also present. Nerden reported that the

PICO'S TRIP TO MEDELLIN
After reading Pico's report and talking to him twice I reached following
conclusions ›
I ACHIEVEMENTS of Price
1. Achieved with the cooperation of Edgar Maduro to soften the anti-US
line in the Declaration of Principles and elimination of US namo which
was XK replaced by "imperialisms".
2. RXHXXNĢIKXXXXXXX*XX*XXMI Together with the Venezuelan delegates drafted
the motion condemning the Tricontinental Conference. and participated actively
in druming up the support for this motion.
3. Pushed thru the motion condemning Castro's regime.
4. Excercised a strong anti-communist and anti-Castro influence among the
delegates.
* II PICO'S IMPRESSIONS OF THE MEDELLIN MEETING
1. Pico cane back favorably impressed by strongly anti-communist stand of the
delegates. He says that even if Maspere would try to cooperate with the
commies the rank and file will not let him to do so.
2. Pico noted only three rabid anti-US delegates & Miguel Cardoso (Accion
Sindical Uruguays). Diogenes Gutierrez ( Federacion Istmeña de Trabajadores
Cristianos -Panama) and Hellodoro Agudelo Rivera (Accion Sindical Antioqueña).
3. Pico informs that Henry Molina( Sec. Gen. of Confederacion Autonoma de Sindicatos
Cristianos CASC-D.R.) even if highly critical of US intervention in D.R. is
an outspoken ſcommunist and he recommends him as a material for recruitment.
4. Molina spoke very favorably of Conrado Rodriguez who during his stay in D.R.
as FORDC delegate made an excellent-impression and became good friend of
CASC .
5. It is evident from the briefing instructions received from HQ and cables
received from "our man in Medellin* that a strong opposition te CLASC 30
stand (or Maspero's) to the new funding proposal by CISC and ISI was expected.
Pico says that he could not discover auch opposition and that three national
unions which already applied for direct funding according th the instructions
received from CISC quickly withrow their application. Rico alse did not nete
any "betrayal" on the part of Federacion Campesina.
Thus I see two possibilities a) the opposition to CLASC HQ stand that all
funding should go thru HQ was exaggerated b) Pico is considered as close fuent
© "aspero and was not trusted by the opposition.
According to Pico the fooling was quite unanimous the the funding should ge
thru CLASC HJ and the CISC attempt of direct funding was resented as an effort
to underaine CIASC Executive Cosmittes.

US Embassy in Bonn informed them on Sunday Jan. 16th in the morning about
Jan.16th
all important topics discussed, resolutions etc adopted in Modellin. While
impressed by the fast work and correct reporting Norden expressed his
curiosity as to how it was possible that the embassy in Bonn was so fast
informed ( NOTE: I am surprised even more that a blubber-mouth like Norden
was informed about such report!). The general consensus of the present was that
CIA must have few men infiltrated among the delegates.....
3. According to the new by-laws Pico's Transport Federation (in formation) will hav
3 votos during the next Congress, equal to other L.A. Federations and national
delegations. Threfore it is important for us that we continue to work with Pico.
4. Pico should also go to the CLASC meeting in Guatemala in March when the Central
American Confederation will be created. CLASC also wants to create Central
American Transport Federation and there where Pico's presence is requested.
5. I asked Pico if his CLASC friends don't'resent the fact that he works for FORDC.
He said that this problem was solved once for ever. CLASC executives know that
only two principal currents exists among the Cuban exiled laber: the batistian
and the revolutionaries. The Batistianos are the Mujalistas of CTC aided by ORIT
and CLASC is against the Hujalistas. They are in favor of the revolutionaries an
they are in FORDC, which is the only really active exile labor organizations.
CLASC leaders know that FORDC is being supported by the US government, but they
accept it as a necessity and understand that it is inevitable as neither the
batistianos or the communists will support it and CLASC has no funds to do so.
SUMMING UP
may
By no means I consider that Pico is an ideal agent. He aight be influenced or awed
by Maspero. He also is sometimes impulsive and puts his foot in the mouth. On the
other hand he is young, agressive, better educated than average Cuban labor loade;
He is accepted in CLASC, his organization ORT is a Ext member and he will be the
head of the Latin American Transport Federation which will give him following
advantages : a) voice and 3 votes at CLASC meetings b) can influence CLASC decisions
c) will bring strong anti-Castro and anti-communist influence d) will soften up
antiº§ outbursts a) will report to us, even if he have to take his reliability wit
a grain of salt.

•
He advises that the Copeyanes gained the control of the Sindicato Portuario in
Puerto Cabello wrestling it away from Correa after it was found that 200,000
bolivares were missing from the treasury. Pico also reports that there aro
widespread rumors that Correa is living it up at the expense of the boycott
and that he is blackmailing Spanish, Japanese and British embassies getting hard
cash for not boycotting the ships...………

Identity. A has been placed on a denied admissions list because of
information supplied by ODACID.
2. According to AMICE/31, Identity A applied for admission to
Identi-
the United States with her daughters, Identities B and C.
ties B and C received the necessary authorization on 24 February
1966 from the Swiss Embassy and arrived in the United States by air

4. It is requested that Headquarters contact the
appropriate ODACID and ODURGE officials for the purpose
of removing Identity A's name from the denied admissions
list since her close connection with a member of the Cuban
Communist Party, which presumably was the basis of the
derogatory information, is no longer a fact.
