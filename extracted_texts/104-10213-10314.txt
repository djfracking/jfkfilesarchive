2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel
2 August 1978
Director of Security
FROM
:
S.D. Breckinridge
SUBJECT
: HSCA Request of 20 July 1978
OLC-78-2728
-
:
1. Attached is correspondence from the DDO focal
point on the ISCA investigation, responding to Question
#2 of reference. It states that there are and have been
no agreements (at least not as described in the HSCA
request) between CIA and the FBI, or other government
agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities
to report on U.S. citizens abroad who contact Communist
embassies or officials. It also states that current
legislation forbids such reporting.
2. Attached are copies of papers collected by
O/IG during the Rockefeller Commission's inquiry; I
recall that there was a 1966 agreement, which is not in
these papers.
In any event they do not seem to contain
a specific provision such as is envisioned in the report.
It is possible that interpretations of NSCID and DCID
provisions resulted in routine reporting of such con-'
tacts, although there were no agreements, per se, for
such action. Since the promulgation of Executive
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on
reporting on U.S. persons, which may affect past practice.
However, this office is not in a position to provide an
Agency position on this issue.
3. It is requested that you coordinate with the
DDO in preparing an answer to an Agency response to
the HSCA question.

2. UE. WERE ESPECIALLY GRATIFIED WITH THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS OF
THE LETTER WHICH EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT FR IS CARRYING OUT A U.S.
GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT IN ITS RECRUITMENT OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
SOURCES, AND THAT THIS ACTIVITY IS BEING CONDUCTED IN THE USA WITH
ANOTHER BASIC POINT WHICH THE LETTER MAKES
FULL BUREAU CONCURRENCE.
IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GUIEDELINES (1966 AGREEMENT) IS TO PROTECT
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE U.S.EGOVERNMENT, NOT ENABLE THE BUREAU TO
MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS.
