moviehouse. LIRING/3 stated that he took trip and was approached in lobby
by same xxxxx young Guatemalan woman (with criental features) whos he had
net in Guatemala City during his last trip. This woman simply informed him
that a comarade would contact him (1/3) at his bone in next few days and
discuss future operations. TIRING/3 continued that he returned to Mexico'
City next day and was contacted at his home by Guatemalan aged about 45,
mustache, glasses, balding head, slightly booked nose, wearing hat ixuBtx=Rİ

in Mexico past twenty years.

teered to ar ange meeting in near future.

28 July, 1957
Subject: Wallace B. Rorton Meeting with IIRI. 6/3.
1
1. On the morning of 27 July, 1967, the day after his return to Mexico
City, Howton contacted IIPING/3 at his home and arranged for a meeting
at the safehouse at 4130 that same morning. 2/3 commented that he was
greatly relieved that Roston had returned safely since many things had
happened during his absence and 1/3 had felt uncertain about what he shoul
do in the event Howton had been delayed any longer.
1.
:
2. At the 1130 meeting at the safehouse, LIRING/3 reported that he and
LIRING/4 had accompanied 1/3's half brother in his car to Jabinas, Coah.,
on the afternoon và 10 July { the day that onepted ). HO
related that immediately on arrival he had his half-brother introduce him
as planned to the judge in Nueva Rosita, a small village near Sabinas. L/3
reported to Rowton that the judge is named Francisco Mario Valdez Hernández
and is actually a "Juez Memor" but also a notario publico and an "agente
del Ministério Público", and, as such, has authority to issue important
documents. According to L/3, judge Valdez, who gave the appearance of a
homosexual, spoke openly about his ability and willingness to issue false
documents and arrange for a passport for 1/3 in the alias Alberto Zárate.
He promised to take care of the matter for the sum of 2,000 pesos, but ac-
cepted a down payment of 1,500 pesos and gave 1/3 a receipt for this amount
"para el areglo de un pasaporte mexicano", addressed to Alberto Zárate Vi-
dal. In addition IIBING/3's half-brother persuaded the judge to iss arranng,
for the issuance to Alberto Zárate of an identity card showing that. Ifrate
was an "uctuario" of the Ministry of Labor, and for a driver's license, so
that Zárate would have additional documents attesting to his identity.
3. LIRING/3 commented that he was certain that he could arrange for false
papers for Rowton in the event the latter felt he could use such papers.
1/3 continued that he and L/4 then proceeded to Nuevo Loredo and picked
up the three Cuban passports that his half-brother had purchased on his
behalf for the sum of 500 pesos. L/3 explained that although the persons
to whom the passports were issued were dead they might conceivably be of
use to Rowton in the future. He added that the hotel clerk who sold the
documents to his half-brother had originally asked 1,500 pesos but appa-
rently was glad to get the 500 when it was offered in cash on the table.
4. LIRING/3 continued that he and L/4 returned to Mexico City on 14 July

taking the bus at Torreón LIRING/3 then announced jubilantly that a few
days after his return, while he was visiting the safehouse in the bope
of Rowton's return or at least a telephone call, be received a telephone
call from an anonymous man, obviously a Guatemalan, who asked whether he
could make a trip to Tapachula in order to meet with a friend. When 1/3
indicated that he could make the trip, the person instructed him to wait
in the lobby of the Figueroa movie house until he was approached by the
"friend". LINING/3 5:11 Royton that he then proceeded by train to Tapachu-
la (on 19 July) and waited in the lobby as instructed. To his great sur-
prise, he was approached by the same Guatemalan young woman who had met
biz in GuatemalaCity in late January, 1967, and told that a certain "Valen-
tín" would contact bix at his home in Mexico City in the near future and
that this person was to be his new contact with FAR. HIRING/3 continued
that in this be que sole purpose of the trip, he returned
to Mexico City on 21 July in order to await the arrival of "Valentín". Ac-
cording to LIRING/3 this occurred in a rather strange way. ben te returned
home he found a note under the door with a brief text stating that some-
one had passed by to see his. The mote was signed with a five-pointed star
rather crudely drawn in the place of a signature. / stated that he was
completely puzzled at this, but on reflexion felt that the five-pointed
star seant 1700 and be therefore went to the safehouse at 1700 that day
to await further contact. According to L/3, a person did telephone him
shortly after he arrived and identfied himself as "Valentin" He asked L/3
to await another call at 1030 the following day so that a meeting could be
arranged. I/3 continued that he finally succeeded in mesting with "Valentir
and brought him to the safehouse on the evening of 25 July. He stated that
he talked with this person until 0400 the following morning.
5. LIRING/3 reported that "Valentín", who identified himself by true name
as Koisés Crozco Leal, Calle Tempis 83, Apt 5, Zona 21, Country Club, Col.
Churubusco, Mexico City, D.F. Orozco stated to 1/3 that he had been in Me-
xico some twenty years and had been engaged in propaganda work for the FåR.
Ee added that recently he had received instructions to contact L/3 and talk
with him "very frankly" concerning the procurement problem. He explained
to 1/3 that Far had had very disappointing experiences in the past and was
in desperate need of secure and efficient channels for the procurement of
arms and ammunition from the W.3. and Mexico. He stated that FAR had the
cash necessary to purchase the arms and hoped that LINING/3's commercial
network could handle the procurement and transport. He indicated to 1/3
that FAR had checked him out with favorable results both locally and with

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7
A
1462
1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER. LITAMII,-7, who
is a female, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy
for more than 30 years. She was originally recruited by former
Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject
was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on
activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In
approximately 1969-70, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,
ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss
of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with
the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason the Station
maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too
was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly
upon retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This
was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when
she was working in the embassy.
2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-
imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in
view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the
embassy, our relations with her would be terminated. However, if
she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work
part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,
of course, never happened.
3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive
spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received
occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The

Subject's Station file has just been reviewed for purging,
and it was noted that his OA is still active and no final dispatch
has been written closing this file, even though we are no longer
in contact with Subject. Since Gerald D. FAHLANGER was the last
Case Officer in contact with LITAMIL-7, it is requested that
Headquarters have FAHLANGER (now assigned Headquarters) prepare
a memorandum describing his last relationship with LI TAMIL-7 and
requesting that his 4 granted on 7 PohmIA PO 10CQ (unw_161101
be cancelled and file be closed. The Station plans no further
contact with LITAMIL-7. Contact was dropped with LITAMIL-7 by 3
mutual consent; he was not a paid agent and was not anxious to
play an aggressive role against the PBRUMEN target. See MEXICO
CITY 4955 of 26 March 1969.

every year worked, and she had worked for LIRING 38
years. She was notified on 28 March that on
instructions from the Foreign Ministry her employment
with LIRING was being terminated effective 31 March
1968. On 28 March, all her phone books, keys, et
cetera were taken away, and her appearance on
29 March was a mere formality. Her termination pay
_
($6,000 U.S.) is being given in three installments,
with the last one the end of April. LITANIL-7 gave
her Case Officer no advance notice of her release,
probably for fear of compromising her retirement
benefits. Station will, however, continue to main-
tain casual contact with her after she receives the
last installment of her severance pay. She may be
of help in the future in identifying LIRING visitors
or newcomers. Now that LITAMIL-7 is gone, the Station
plans to activate LISAMPAN/CHARLIE, which, it is
hoped, will become a regular source of information
on LIRING.

Summary: During the period of this report, LITAMIL-7
was met on a weekly basis. Most of the meetings with LITAMIL-7
were conducted in the presence of LITAMIL-3, who has known
o ine unly preson vno can pressure her
into reporting information on the daily LIRING activities.
Unfortunately, LITAHIL-7 has reported only routine information,
much of which the Station already obtained through other moans.
In many cases, however, her information served to support
information the Station suspected or needed to confirm. The
following were factors that contributed to LITAMIL-7's apathy
and reluctance to collect and report information of value.
First, there was the problem of her health. Although she
did have high blood pressure, most of her preoccupation over
this condition was psychosomatic. It appeared that it provided
her with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station
requirements. Second, and this was probably the most signifi-
cant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully, she
was aware of the LIRING attitude towards retention of foreign
employees in that office. in January 1998, LIRING released
all local employees except LITAHIL-7, and as the months went
by it became increasingly evident that it was only a matter
of time before she would be released also. Evidence of her

the Cubans. In the course of conversation "Valentín" mentioned that Doc-
tora Hercedes Pereira, whom 1/3 had met in Navaza, was currently in Nexi-
co. "Valentín" stated that it was a very critical time for FAR and that
everyone hoped that something would be solved in Havana ith regard to
concrete aid from the Cubans. It indicated that in the past both the Cubans
and the Soviets had done more talking that producing in both material and
hard cash. In speaking of the most immediate needs, "Valentín" stated that
FAR needed a docutor urgently to train the revolutionaries in first aid,
and he asked 1/3 whether he could recommend a doctor that might be willing
to visit FAR headquarters for about ten days for this purpose. L/3 told
Howton that he promised to look into the latter socnest, alling that he had
in mind his friend Rail Horeno Honchee, who was a medical student and pro-
bably qualified to give first aid instruction.
5. LIRING/3 continued that he expressed hie viltie
arms procurement effort, but would prefer to be able to talk directly with
FAR leaders to get first-hand information as to their needs, and arrange
secure methods of payment. Then L/3 referred to the delinquent account
(medicine and radio tubes) Walerin" relgied that unfortunately only part
of the redicine had arrived intact, the other part presumedly having been
captured by the Guatemalan army. He promised that 1/3 would be paid mix
for the material furnished and apologized for not having the money with his
be added that he receives not financial assistence from FAR and has to live
Es best he can from his own resources. In reply to 2/3's query, "Valentin"
stated that he did not personally know "Gardia", since Far insisted on con-
partmentation, and there had been no need for him to meet "Garcia" in the
past. He then lectured 1/3 on security, stating that FAR prinicipal pro-
blem to date had been within the organization itself result from lamess
on the part of revolutionarisis and outright betrayal by some members. He
added that IIRING/3 had been assigned the battle-name "Rafael" and that
henceforth he should use that name whenever dealing with FAR members.
6. LIRING/3 told Rowten that, in the course of conversation regarding possib-
le supply channels, th mentioned the possibility of air-drops from small
privately chartered planes, using the Raúl Moreno as a pilot. According to
1/3, "Valentír" showed immediate interest in this, commenting that he was
certain FAR would be most interested. He then stated that he felt 1/3 was
an important enough asset to meet directly with César Montes himself and
he promised to look into the possibility of arranging a personal interview.
1/3 replied that he would welcome this opportunity since it would clarify

imminent termination was given by the fact that she was given
less duties as the months passed, until at the very end she
did little more than put in her time. With the spectre of
unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMIL-7 was reluctant
to take any risk that might have compromised ner situation at
LIRING. At stake was a sizable termination payment which the
PERUMENers were obligated to pay her according to local
employment regulations. Obviously, she would do nothing to
jeopardize this payment, which amounted to approximately
$6,000 (U.S.). A further deterrent to her collaboration with
the Station, even after her release by LIBING on 31 March,
was the LIRING arrangement to make the termination payment in
three increments, the last to be made at the end of April 1968.
In view of this latest development in this operation, the
Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the Station
Case Officer and LITAMIL-7.
1. Introduction: During the period covered by this
report, LITAMIL-7 was met and debriefed on a weekly basis.
Her information was very limited and usually dealt with internal
activities of a routine nature in LIRING. As pointed out above,
her supervisors isolated her iium ail but he Bust suuline
administrative duties. Consequently, she lost access to
virtually everything that may have been of interest to the
Station. The Station asked her to bring out the book of
addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over
the years, but she refused for fear that it would be missed
Curing the afternoon when she was not on cuty. The Station
then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a
few pages each day. She agreed, but before she began this
process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed.
She then began to compile a new book of addresses and telephone
numbers, which she intended to bring out, but one of the LIRING
officers asked for it on the day she was fired. In the end,
the sum total of LITAMIL-7 LIRING information during the first
three months of 1968 was the identification of several
photographs of LIKING employees, the tentative identification
of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had
not been in the second floor area since 1961, thus much of
the identification was from memory), and finally, LITAMIL-7
confirmed telephone numbers assigned to specific LIRING
personnel and furnished telephone numbers of individuals and
companies servicing LIRING maintenance requirements (dry
cleaners, pharmacy, typewriter repairmen, etc.). LITAMIL-7
volunteered to provide additional information on LIRING to the
Station provided it was within her capability, and after she
received her final severance payment from LIRING.
2. Finance: LITAMIL-7 received no salary and no termina-
tion bonus from the Station.
}
3. Security: Since all contact with LITAMIL-7 was
maintained through LITAMIL-3, LITAMIL-7 does not have a Station
telephone number. She does not know the true names of any of
the Station Case Officers who handled her. All meetings with
her were held in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and
she was never seen with Case Officers in public. She had no
telephone, so no contacts were made with her by phone.' From
the security point of view, the LITAMIL-7 operation enjoyed
a long life, January 1961 through March 1968. Taking into
account her fear and apprehension, plus the fact that she
maintained good relations with LITAMIL-3, this record is all
the more remarkable. From the intelligence point of view, it
is unfortunate that her production' was so minimal.

4. Future of the Operation: Although for all intents
and purposes the LITAMIL-7 operation has come to an end, the
Station intends to maintain a casual contact with her. It
is very likely that she may know new personnel assigned to
LIRING and may be able to furnish information on these }
individuals. There may also be developments in LIRING which,
on the basis of her lengthy service in LIRING, she might be
able to assess and clarify. Since LITAMIL-7 was not a
salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing
more than the investment of Case Officer time, and an
occasional gift of flowers. In view of her intense pride,
there is little reason to believe that she will accept money
in the future. If she is able to provide information to the
Station it will probably be done without any thought of
compensation.

H. LITAMIL-7: The Station was successful in
obtaining limited operational support intelligence
from LITAMIL-7 during February. She was again sick
almost half the month and unavailable for meetings.
The Station is also using LITAMIL-7 as a source of
information in its physical target study of LIRING.

at their next Lecting then he requisted for a 28 July, promising
to come to 1/3's home between 1500 and 1700. "Valentin" explained that
although the safehouse appeared to be an excellent seating place, it was
Få policy not to use the same apartment or place of meating more than
cace.

7. Rowton net with HIRING/3 again at 1430 on 29 July, 1957, at the safebruse
The second zeeting had been scheduled for 1900 on 22 July, but on arrival
at hte safehouse, Rowton found a note from I/3 stating that he would not
be able to make the 1900 meeting but would see Rowton at 1430 the follow-
ing day. The only explanation in the note for the delay was "cosas muy
importantes han sucedido". When Roston met with TTOTUG/3 thelat
1430, the latter explained that "Valentin" bad left a note at his home
saying the meeting would be delayed, and then appeared unannounced when
1/3 was not at home and talked briefly with LIRING/4. 1/3 stated that he
alarred LIRING/4 by stating that be ("Valentín") had a wounded man that
must be taken care of urgently and asked 1/4 to pass on the message to 2/3

trusted doctor. "Valentin" pr mised to come back to the ouse as soon as
he could. According to I/3, "Valentin" reappeared unannounced at about
be
1000 on 29 July, and showed 1/3 a telegram which he had just received from
Guatemala City. The telegram contained the t-xt " If you are interested
in further details concerning the business, present yourself here", and
was addressed to "Valentin" in his true maze and address. 1/3 stated that
he could not recall the sender's aane or address but he assumed that it
would be an alias in any case.
}
8. According to L/3, "Valentin" explained to bis that the telegram meant.
that a meeting with César Montes could be arranged and that L/3 should as-
cordingly prepare himself for the trip. In reply to 1/3's query, "Valez-
ta" stated that this took priority over the operation involving the woun-

he himself would not know what was in the envelope and would himself pre-
ceed on into Guatemala with the Fan contact who delivered the letter. He
added that 1/3 would then have to return to Mexico City and fly into Guate-

publicized death of "Che" Guevara and the roll-up of
the commo system of the revolutionaries in Bolivia.
They were especially useful in monitoring the reaction
of LIRING-2 who was very closely tied to this commo
net and against whom the Station was planning an opera-
tion.

C. Through LITAINT-2, two denigation leaflets were
produced attacking the LIRING staff in Mexico. One on

proceed on to Guatemala City from Hapachula by air (the apport being
small and all travelers being subject to the curiosity and pcuting of
the local officials). Tritentín then stated that 1/2 should be able to
pass through the Bustezala City airport ithout difficulty provided be
kept his eye out for a certain José Licaces, an ex-Thief of Folice who
worked for the North-American Embassy and had a complete file on all sus-
pect persons who might enter or leave the import. "Valentin" described
Linares as a man of short stature, thin, grey hair combed in a bigh peak
in front, usually iressed in a double-brested jacket. "Valentía" added that
Linares was considered the most dangerous nan at the airport, although he
is not an offici but simply a secret agent of the North Aericans.
-
9. "Valentin" then, according to 1/3, stated that the latter should procure
the folloning itens at once so that he could or when to spaccula with
him:
1) Thaki shirt and trousers(pantalón y carisa de lona may guests)
2) Leather combat boots ( zapatos de campaña)
411
3) Browning or Walter 9mm automatic weapon with 3 clips and 50
rounds of ammunition.
4) Detonators with wick or electric fuse
5) Gauze for medical treatment
6) Three pills of most potent poison avialkable.
"Valentin" explained that the Torwning automatic was the best since it
could be converted easily into a machinegun" with its clip of 13 cart-
ridges. The Halter was also good since it could be fitted with a silencer.
"Valentín" also explained that the pois: capsules were desirable to be
taken in the event of capture by the army to avoid the possibility of any-
one confessing under torture. He added that one was for the use of 1/3
and the other two for the comrades who would be his escorts.
10. "Valentín" further explained that I should open the sealed envelope
he had received in Tapachula when he was aboard the plane enroute to Qua-
temala City, memoriz: the name and address and then destroy the paper. He
added quickly that he realized I/3 could open the envelope any time after
be received it in Tapachula, and he was free to do so, but it was hoped
for security reasons that he would open it only after he had left Mexico
City airport. "Valentin" added that he himself had no idea of what nane
would appear on the paper, but in any case he was sure that it would be
the name of a person not directly involved in revolutionary sctivities.

1. LITAMIL-7, an aging spinster, is a penetration agent of the Mexico
Station inside the PBRUMEN Embassy. She has recently been seriously ill on
two occasions and has been shabbily treated by her employers while the Station
has lavished attention on her. As a result of this contract in demonstrated
concern for her wellbeing, LITAKIL-7 has shown a determination to be of mich
more active service to the Station than in the past.
2. LITAMIL-7 is a devout and practicine Roman Cathalie
understanding that certificates of Papal blessing can be obtained without too
mich difficulty in home. If this is the case, and the Rome Station can securely
obtain such a certificate, it is believed that its presentation to her would
cinch her already demonstrated determination to help the Station with its anti-
ANTHUG work.
3. A blessing of LITAMIL-7's home or prayer for her continued health or
any other appropriate form of certificate would be much appreciated. Please
T/A any costs to the Mexico Station. LITAMIL-7's identity follows by separate
cover attachment.

MIEILG/3 was to pay a friendly visit to this person, making no reference
to politicis, but simply using a prearranged code word in the conversation.
This recognition signal would lead to the first meeting with the courades
(probably two) who would escort LIHING/3 to César Montes.

11. DIRIRO/3 stated that he had another meeting with "Talentin" at 2200
that same evening ( 29 July) at the Café Literario where he hopes to ob-
tain more detail regarding the timing of the trips. 2/3 said that he pre-
be
ferred to make the first trip (to Tapachula) on 1 August since DINING/4
was greatly upset over the recent developments and had to be claxed down.
He added that I was very pessimistic crer I/2's chances of retraing

to take the trip to Tapachula, and in fact retealed traffic indicating that
HIRING/3 was in Mexico City during the perici 19-21 July, when he claimed
to be in Tapachula, Norton stated that he did not believe L/b's story re-
garding his initial contact with "Talentín" and his trip to Tapachula. Since
Rort 's telephone ansering service reported repeated message's from "señor
Juarez" and 2/3 himself in true name, he felt he could use this rather than
intinate in any way that 1/3's (safehouse) phone was tapped. HENG/3 be-
cate thoroughly upset, as he had done on the previous occasion when Rowton
bad impugned his veracity, and assured Rowton with tears in his eyes that
he had always been "fundamentally" Eccest, although he right have exagge-
rated in the matter of details and exact dates. 2/3 was so emotionally dis-
turbed that he felt it ise to pass he atter further at that time and
proposed to 1/3 that he (Newton) meet with G/4 that evening at 2200,
when he would te zeeting with "Valentín" again. Howton turned down 1/3's
invitation to be present at the Café Literaris so that be could get a look
at "Valentín" hisself,since Rowten hoped that the meeting would be covered
in any case by the Station team (which had 1/3 under surveillance since
the previous afternoon).

consequences of revolutionary activities that bad suddenly become a
reality for her. The complained that 1/3 kept her in the dark about hany
things and that she could not understand his willingness to fist his
life and the happiness of his fasily "so precipitously" The Soton
questioned her discreetly as to I/3's trip to Tapachula) she stated is
uncontrolable sobs (they appeared to kisten quite genuine) that he
M
sudienyl left the preceding week, saying he was going to Chiapes and dis-
appeared for 34 days. She said she was so upse she could not remember

anything but the feeling of abandonment. She then complained that although
Roston was the only person she could turn to in crisis like the one she
vent through last week, she could not locate his anywhere. She called bis
telephone ( answering service; repeatedly and then in desperation called
LIRING/7 in the hose that he would know something (T/monitor the bo
di not know "which Harris" she was referring to). DIBING/4 then stated
that she realized sudienyl that if I/3 were to disappear she would be sub-
ject to deportation to Cuba, a fate which she apparently genuinely dreaded.
Rowton assured her that he would do everything possible to see that she
was taken care of in this eventuality, but she protested that I/3 xas the
only person she could ope to find happiness with and Rowton could not
bring him back if anything happened to him.
i
14. Rowton then stated that before L/3 could take such a trip with serious
risks involved, he would have to study the situation thoroughly. He ex-
plained that at the moment he had serious doubts regarding the contacts
that have brought L/3 to this point. 1/4 replied that she herself had seen
the latest contact ("Valentín") only once when he came to the house and
gave her the message regarding the wounded person. he Rowton queried her
again concerning the trip to Hapachula, she stated that 1/3 had told her
upon his return that he had asked someone else to make daily calls to Row-
ton's answering service, and upbraided her for calling. ( This would ex-
plain what appeared to be 1/3's daily calls during the period 19-21 July,
but it would not explain 1/3's conversations with Bert igisser and Ser-
gio Valdëz on 20/7/67 and his rezark to Berta higisser on 21/7/67 that
he Tid not go out of town after all"
15. Rowten felt that, although his meeting with 1/4 was not particularly
productive, it served its purpose in advising L/3 indirectly that he did.
not accept 1/3's story of the trip to Tapachula and his initial contact
with "Valentín”.

1/3 reported that miss
Crozco Leal, who claimabe 2/3's new FAR Maison for procurement of
arms, currently staying in his apartrent on Calzada Techbaya. 1/3 ex-
plained to Royton that at 2200 29 July testing with Crepes,latter stated
that he had from FAR headquarters to escort / to Tapachula

for contact instructions and instructed 1/3 procure immediately Browning
or Walter = automatic with 50 three clips and at least 50 cartridges
plus detonators with normal or eletric fuse and three poison tablets of
highest possible potency which he would needs on trip from Suatemala City
to Hontes Leadquarters. Crozco, Lorever, insisted that 4/3 bring these
items with his to Tapachula and added that he would finale get that
they were safely delivered to Guatemala City for eventual pick-up by I/3.
2. At end of meeting Orozco asked 1/3 to put him up for the night at his
home “since it was very late and in any case he wanted to discuss their
travel plans further". 1/3 did so without the least suspicion Orozco's
true motives, and appeared to Rowton to have accepted Chorco's tone fides
although he admitted that he had never heard of Crozco before latter's
expected approach to biz 25 July. L/3 stressed to howton that Crosco
revealed an astounding mowledge Guatemalan revolution, Outa, as vell
as 1/3's past activities and dates his trips to Guatemala.

in all probability a isserter from FAR who actually using 1/3's apartment
as a hideout. Rowton confessed he could not understand why Orozco would
want to return to Guatemala with or without Dame/3, but urged 1/3
to attempt to get the truth from Grozco posing as sympathetic but indi-
cating that he was awere of Crozce's true status in the pope that Crozco
could be moved to a safehouse and made available for thorough interroga-
tion. I/3 agreed and arrangements made for Hoston/2/3 resting at t
midnight 1 August.
4. when L/3 appeared at CC30 he reported enthusiastically that he had.
succeed in breaking Crozco down but that he had had to call on his friends
fo help..
Sergio-Valdez and Raúl Horeng. Orezco stated that he had been sent to coun-
tains to organice querrilla bands but found everyone "stupid” and his
tark impossible. He added that David Casasola who was with his was un-
disciplined and made mistakes that led to capture of many of his men and
probably to his own capture. Crozco continued insisting that be was the

2. There is little question that LIRING-3 seized the opportunity, given
him by the sudden apparition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis his
wife a few days of misbehaving. Instead of proceeding to Tapachula to receive
from the FAR new contract instructions in Mexico City (an awkward arrangement
to say the least), LIRING-3 remained at the safe house he uses in the capital
to receive the visit (as indicated by LIFEAT) of Berta VIGISSER his "regular"
mistress, Silvia DURAN (of Lee Harvey OSWALD fame) and possibly a certain
Yolanda (who appears for the first time in this operation and whose phone
number is not in the Station reversed Mexico City telephone directory)
Pinned down on the fact that he was in Mexico. City during the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted that he was but felt that he had to tell
another lie rather than admit his misbehavior. This lie was that he did not
want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so
made his first meeting with OROZCO "more intriguing" by inventing the trip
to Tapachula. To add credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING-3 previously
asked his wife to impress ROWTON with her concern for him, telling ROUTON
that he had disappeared for three days without telling her where he went.
This she did very convincingly with much sobbing and crying. The LIROSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly that day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have
it LIROSIN live monitored a conversation between LIRING-3 and his wife
during which the latter reported that her tears seemed to have convinced
wretty kimmt talk with
LIRING-3 concerned the mention of the alias which ROWTON uses with LIRING-3
and 4 to various persons with whom LIRING-3 is in touch. LIFEAT coverage
had indicated, for example, that LIRING-3 mentioned ROSTOW in alias to
Sergio VALUEZ. This LIRING-3 denied. He produced on 3 August 1967 a
written review of all the people of interest to ROWTON with shom he has
been in contact indicating whether or not he mentioned ROWTON's alias to
them.
This review is attached to one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.
3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING-3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul
MORENO is explained in detail in ROUTON's reports forwarded with this
dispatch. A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and CRCZCO at LIRING_3's
sefebouse was live-monitored by LIROSIN when the latter returned home from
his regular bartending job in the early hours of the morning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder was once more inoperative) to basically confirm
LIRING-3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWTOM. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MORENO were present during the night of 31 July - 1 August when
LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 information
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL-1 and 2). The two men
arrived at LIRING-3's apartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO
had admitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the
truth. Thirdly, LURING-3 haists that he told OROZCO nothing about his
plastic flower business and it's contemplated use to cover activities in
support of the Guatemalan rebels. According to him, CROZCO already knew
this as well as other details of his dealings with the FAR. LIRING-3
presumes that OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups of the FAR guerrillas
while in the hills. OROZCO mistakenly apparently thought that LIRING-3 was
in the actual arms procurement business whereas his discussions with the
FAR have been limited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the FAR assuming
the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatemalan border),
LIRING-3's plastic flower business designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the FAR, is not, as a matter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO
was badly informed of LIRING-3's activities. How OROZCO hoped to obtain arms
from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to deliver som at the Guatemalan
border area, in view of the fact (as he later admitted) that he was stone
broke, is a matter of conjecture. A desperate man my do desperate things
and LIRING-3 could have found himself in serious trouble. Judging from the
FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing in any case that OROZCO was not.

1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threaten him.

8. Rewton, not excluding the possiblity of Crozco's commiting suicide
in 1/3's apartment or attracting attention of the neighbors, recommended
that 1/3, Horeno and Valdez enter the spartment soonest and remain inside
with Crozco until howton could work out some plan to remove him from the
apartment carly Izexfz that same morning. 1/3 promised to try but was
not at all sure that he could convince Crozco to open the door (which he
had bolted from the inside). In any case be assured howton that he and
his two friends would remain on guard cutside so that they could Burveil
or seize Crozco the moment he left the premises. L/3 stated that he was
quite certain that Orozco was unarmed and without funds and could easily
be controlled by thrxafx Moreno and Valdez, thus perzitting him
(L/3) to communicate with Nowton.
9. Alternatives in this sensitive situation appear to be following:
(a) Rowton instruct L/3 deliver Orozco to specified place where
he can be turned over to "pistoleros" hired by Howton for pur-
pose of getting Crozco off hands of 1/3 and his friends and
detaining him long enough for interrogation. 1/3; assured Howton
that he able make delivery and agrees desirability thorough
interrogation by Rowton or person designated by him. Delivery
could possibly be arranged without presence Valdez and Moreno,
(b) LIRING/3 reveal entire affair to
and/or a (acly
iz
via Ernesto Capoano de Vecchio) and let decision rest with them,
interrogating Crozco as best he could in the meantire in bis
apartment.
(c) Let Crozco escape, after giving him enough money to make his way
out of town or to another hideout.
T
permit lengthy interrogation but would
10. Alernative (a) would/involve eventual disposal of Crozco that would
be acceptable Horeno and Valdez ( I/3 would accept Rowton final decision).
1/3 could allege subsequently that Crozco disposed of by Howton pistoleros
and report this to XIRING and FAR. Alternative (b) would mean loss to
ACFACT of valuable debriefing if this deemed desirable. Alternative (c)
according to LIRING/3 probably not feasible since Valdez and Moreno
fanatic enough to kill Crozco themselves rather than see him escape.
11. L/3 insists that he has not revealed Rowton's coaching in this affair
to either Valdez or Horeno.

3 August, 1957
DIRING/3 Report on Developments in Miss Orozco Case.
1. During the early morning tours of ↑ Lugust, 1207, Roston remained in
constant contact with L/3, either through brief meetings with him or
through LIRING/4 who acted as a cut-out at the ppone of the safehouse..
When Howton telephoned 1/4 at the safetouse at about 0730 on 1 August,
she stated that L/3 had called a few minutes before and passed the res-
sage that "things were a itiile better, but be needed help". Rowton knew
that I/3 and Sergio Valdez together with Raúl Moreno were surveilling the
Tacubaya apartment house in order to pick up Croze if and when he tried
to leave the premises. 1/3 had told hoston at an earlier meeting (0400)
that morning that when Crozco refused to accompany bin peacefully to a
kotel, he gave Crozco two alternatives. Hirst be stated (bluffing) that
Le had a direct channel to FAR and would query FAR about Crozco and bring
with him a FAR representative at 1000 that morning and if Orozco had a
clear conscience he would have nothing to worry about; secondly, if Croz-
co did not desire this be could take 300% pesos which I/3 put in an en-
velope and leave the apartment for some other place of refuge. 1/3 ex-
lained to Rowton that he hoped Crozco would take the second alternative
so that be and Valdez and Moreno could follow him or seize him as he left
the apartient. L/3 asked Rowton to assist in this ceration by providing
a few pistolercs. Rowton, feeling that he might be able to arrange to take
Crozco off I/3's hands once he was out of the apartment (provided the
Station could provide a safehouse and several unilateral agents to guard
Crozco and eventually interrogate him) promised to hire several pistoleros
who would be unwitting of the true situation to help 1/3 and his friends.
1/3 also asked for a weapon which he said might be necessary if Crozco gave
biz any trouble. Rowton, of course, refused to comply, saying that since
Crozco was unarmed it was unnecessary at that time.
2. Then Rowton talked again to 1/3 on the phone (from the safehouse) the
latter reported that things were still quite difficult. He explained that
Crozco was still in the apartment and refused to answer the doorbell,cb-
viously terrorized that 1/3 had already notified the FAR of his whereabouts
L/3 reported in addition that Raúl Moreno had taken off in his car, apparen-
tly too tired to continue the surveillance; he and Sergio Valdez were con
sequently left alone without a car to surveil Crozco in the event he left
the apartment. 1/3 again appealed to Router for help. Rowton stalled since

be was unable to confirm whether the Station had any unilateral assets
to assist or in fact was interested in taking over Crocco from 1/3 until
after 0900 that morning. When Roston talked to L/3 again on the phone
at about 0915, 1/3 reported that Crozco had left the apartment at 0830
and proceeded directly via pesero to his mother's house (menis 188/5)
in Colinia Country Club and that I/3 and ergio Valiez had succeeded in
surveilling him there and were at that moment watching the house from Lear-
by. About 20 zinutes later 1/3 reported that Crozco had left the house
and was at that moment in a nearby barbershop. I/3 added that he and Val-
dez could not carry on the surveillance zuch longer since they were be-
coming conspicuous ( as later reported, a police car (unmarked) was spot-
ted by Valdez in the vicinity and misht have approachedi them if the house
was actually under surveillance by the Hexican police).
3. Howton therefore reported to the Station that he had instructed 1/3 to
rezain on surveillance for about 20 minutes more and that unless Station
assets could take over the surveillance would have to be abandoned. Howton
was informed that a decision had been made to request the Mexican police
to arrest Crosco at the home of his mother and that therefore L/3 could be
taken off the case. Rowton met with 1/3 again at the safehouse at about
1030 and the latter reported that he and bergio Valdez had been forced to
abandon the surveillance effort. Howton alleged that in the meant me he
had rounded up three "pistoleros" and sent them to the house but shortly
thereafter had received from them a "danger signal", indicating that the
bouse was being watched by the Mexican police and that they could not be-
come involved. As a result they had left the area and could not be of any
further use. ( Howton felt constrained to invent this story since he was
aware that Crozco's arrest was imminent and in order to throw the blame off
himself when the report reached 1/3 and Valdez).
4. Howton met with I/3 that afternoon at 1700 at a small coffeeshop on
Reforma and denied to L/3 that he had any knowledge of what had happened
to Crozco in the meantime. L/3 reported that he ant Valdez were attempting
to lake plans as to the best course of action. Rowton advised L/3 to coẸ-
tact Jacobo Redriquez Fadilla and through in to attempt to contact - FAR
a
representative in Mexics City (ossibly, the lawyer Impesto Capoano). L/3.
agreed that this was essential since he and Valdez had come to the con-
clusion that Crozco must somehow be "eliminated" before he fel; into the
hands of the Mexican police since he knew too much, especially about 1/3's

1/3 promised to meet with Jacobo the following morning and press him for
contact with the PAR. In the meantime to continued to feign ignorace
of the arrest of Crozco (which took place about 1000 on 1 August, 1967).
5. Rowton met again with 1/3 at his Tacubaga apartment at 1200 on 2 August.
1/3 reported that he had talked with Jacco Rodriguez Padilla at 1200 that
xxxx day in the Café literario but with disappointing results. Jacobo as
usual appeared very fenful of involving himself in any way politically,
and when 1/3 informed be that he had to see someone from FAR urgently and
it occurred to him that the lawyer Ernesto Capoano Hight be able to ar-
range the contact, Jacobo replied that he could not vouch for Capcano at
all as far as political matters were concerned. He stated that Capoano was
generally helpful for Gatemalans seeking papers and legalizing their sta-
tus (for which he gave his services gratis) but he was not sure that Ca-
pcano would stick out his neck for 1/3. According to 1/3 he then dropped
the matter, without diclosing to Jacobo that he was interested in Croico,
feeling that it would be too risky to bring Capoano into the picture (al-
the gh Jacobo had offerred to arrange a meeting with him for L/3).
s
C. 1/3 continued that he felt his only other alternative was to talk the
matter over x with Cepeda in/IRING office. He therefore went directly
there after having talked with Jacobo, and, not finding Cepeda in, went
to the office of Curbelo. He canaged to see Curbelo privately and related
to him the entire affair. He explained that originally he had had a very
discreet con not with FAR but that unexpectedly this contact had disappea-
red ( "Garcia"). Recently however, equally unexpectedly, a new contact in
the person of Moisés Crozco Leal had appeared claiming that he was a tona
fide FAR representative and had been referred to 1/3 by Alberto Domingo of
Siempre. L/3 purposely stressed this, commenting that he assumed that Al-
berto was in touch with HIRING and therefore a person to be trusted. I/3
then informed Curbelo that he found several loop-holes in Crocco's story
and decided to check on him. He contacted a friend in Guatemala and dis-
covered to his amazement that Orozco had deserted from FAR and was actually
in hiding in Mexico. L/3 revealed to Curbelo that Crozco had locked himself
in 1/3's apartment the preceding right after he had confessed to 1/3 his
true status. 1/3 conluded that as far as he knew Crozco was currently in
hiding at his mother's home. I/3 then stated that he needed desperately to
communicate these facts to FAR so that appropriate action could be taken
to eliminate Crosco before he fell into the hands of the Mexican police

and revealed very sensitive information about FAR as well as about his
own(L/3's) involvement. 1/3 commented to howton that Curbelo appeared
throoughly shaken by this and his hand trembled as he made notes. He re-
plied to 1/3 that he would comicate this development impedicely to
FAR Cuba inthe hope that he would receive some guidance to pass along to
I/3.

gusted with Raúl Mores for having left then holding the bag and did not
recontact him again) had decided that it was essential to dicover whether
Orozco had been arrested so that they could plan some sort of action to
"eliminate" him before he could be deserted to Cuntemala. I/3 reported that
the
Valdez had sent his girl-frid

the home of Imazon's motham in
tempt to determine whether orozco was
still there or arrested in the reantime. I/3 later (at; 2200) that evening
reported that no one had answered the door at the apartment and hence the
woman friend of Valdez had been unable to learn anything about the fate of
Orozco. 1/3 added that he and Valdez had struck upon another plan which
they hoped would flush out the true facts. In the meantime he asked Rowten
to attempt to determine whether Crozco had been arrested. When Rowton tele-
phoned 1/3 the following morning at 0900 as he had promised he againg de-
nied any knowledge and suggested that L/3 go ahead with the plan and re-
port to Roston that evening at 1800. (Reuton did not wish to have prior
knowledge of the plan since he felt it better for 1/3 and Valdez to pro-
ceed on their own in a spontaneous manner so that I/3 would have a well
backstopped story to give Curbelo when he met with him again.)

3 August, 1967
Subject: Honthly Report of Developments in the LINING/C Operation.
1. During the month of July, 1957, the most important development in the
LIRING/3 operation was the approach made to LINING/3 by Mosés Crocco Leal,
who purportedly conveyed instructions to 1/3 from the FAR of Guatemala for
a personal Ieeting with César Montes in the mountains of Guatemala.
new contact was reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 at the first meeting follow-
ing Rowton's return from 737 in Goergetown, Guyana (26 July, 1967). When
Station traces revealed that Hoisés Crozco had actually deserted the TAB
forces some time after May, 1267, and that FAR was actively looking for his
Bost probably to eliminate him and thus prevent his revealing sentsitive in-
Ination the nexicans and/or Guatemalans regarding FAR plans and acti-
vities, Rowton warned LIRING/3 against taking Crozco's statements and claims
seriously and suggested that he question him carefully concerning his past
connections with FAR. 1/3 did so at his 31 July, 1967, meeting with Crozco,who
was then living in 1/3's apartment (on Calzada Tacubaya), and informed Howton
later that evening that he had "broken" Crozco, and that the latter had admit-
ted that he had deserted the FAR forces and claimed to be in the process of
forming his own guerrilla movement to be called "Frimer del Mayo".
2. In consultation with Bouton through the early morning hours of 1 August,
IIMING/3 with the help of his friends Sergio Valdez and Raúl Moreno, attempt-
ed to persuade Crozco to leave 1/3's apartment and remain in hiding in a near-
by hotel ( Which Norris K. Umphlett had rented in an alias "Antonio Sanchez"
at Rowton's request). Crozco, however, refused to leave L/3's apartment with
them by sneaked out at 0030 when he apparently thought that 1/3 was not in the
vicinity. 2/3 and Sergio Valdez, however, were watching the apartment house
and manged to surveil Orozco to the home of his mother in Colonia Country Club.
1/3, however, on Rowton's instructions, aboandoned the surveillance of the
house at about 0930 that morning. I/3 subsequently reported the affair to
Curbelo of the LIRING office in the hope of getting word to AR of the where-
abouts of Crozco and of the muse be attempted to play on I/3: The latter said
that he str-ssed to Curbelo that it was Alberto Domingo of Siempre who had ori-
ginally sent Crozco to LIRING/3 (through Sergio Valdez).
3. LIRING/3 continued to monitor the activities of his friend Sergio Valdez
who during the month set up a company (Colrlus) in the workshop of his Nexi-
can firend, señorita Alejandra Urbina Torres, at Flaza Miravalle in Mexico

City. In view of the response of the Venesuela Station (discouraging Rowton
from directing 1/3 into Vensuslan guerrilla notivites with Corgio Valdez and
Raúl Moreno) Howton instructed 1/3 to refrain from involvement with them in
this aspect of the operation. He agreed, hoever, with 1/3 that the new com-
pany gave him much-necied sdditional financial cover, especially in the eyes
of the FERUMENS in the likely event that they would quistion him more closely
during a future trip into their area.

4. Pping the month, on a tri- to Sabinas, Coth., I/3/succesfed through his
half-brother in meeting Judge Trancisco Mario Valdez of Nuera Rosita who pro-
mised to arrange for the issuance to 2/3 in the alias Alberto Ifrate Tidal of
a (false) passport. III/3 feels that the possession of such a false docu-
ment will enhance his potential in the eyes of the well as FAR.

5. During his trip to northern Mexico III/3 also managed to "purchase" the
passports of three (deceased) Cubans who had left the documents together with
other papers at the hotel in Nuevo Loredo where they had stayed prior to their
supposedly clandestine entry into the U.S. 2/3 procured these documents with
Howton's prior approval on the asumption that they might prove useful to Rowton
at some future date.
5.
In connection with the Moisés Orozco affair, Royton uncovered an important
instance of deception on the part of both LIRING/3 and LIHING/4. A review of
LIFEAT interecepts revealed that L/3 was in the safehouse during the period
19–21 July, when he had claimed to Rowton that he was on a trip to Tapachula
to receive contact instructions for his first meeting with Crozco. LIRING/3
apparently asked 1/4 to backstop his story when Rowton queried her separately,
since she did so (although claiming ignorance of the purpose of the trip). I/3
subsequently admitted to howton that he had not made the trip to Tapachula but
had actually net Orozco through Sergi: Waldez (who had been referre" to him by
Alberto Domingo of Siempre) and that he had not wanted to reveal this to howton
until heªcould figure out how Valdez fitted into the picture".` Since Howton and
the Station felt that this was another opportunity to SCSHIRI LIRING/3, a re-
quest was repeated to Headquarters for a Spanish-speaking operator. The request
could not be complied with at the time and Rowton bas had to continue checking
LIRING/3's reports as carefully as he can without benefit of the technical in-
terrogation.

4. This Station believes that the LIRING-3 Operation has reached
critical point as a result of the OROZCO affair. Both the Cubans and the
FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANO Del Vecchio) have been notified by LIRING-3 of
OROZCO's conduct and statements (a copy of OROZCO's masage forwarded as
Attachment Two was given CAPUANO). If the FAR is at all interested in
LIRING-3 he will somehow hear from the Guatemalan guerrillas and negociations
concerning arms and equipment will be reamped. LIRING-3 her not heard from
"GARCIA" since June and does not even know if the latter is in Mexico.
It is the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly
from the Cubers.
5. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the
relative ease with which LIRING-3 claims to be obtaining a false passport
and other identity papers. The Cubed's passports that LIRING-3 purchased
in Nuevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, were issued in 1953 and 1959
and may be of marginal value. They will nevertheless be forwarded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these
passports.

Analysis of LIFE: Traffic Testing to LING/3 operation.
for the Neriod 29 June to 1 August,1957.
1. During this period the most significant operational support pro-
vided by LITEAT intercepts occurred during the period 17 July to I August,
the period of DIKING/3's contact with Hoisés Crocco Ital. On 27 July, the
first meeting Rolton had with 1/3 after Holton's ratum from for to Gu-
yano, 1/3 reported that he had been contacted in a mysterious panner by
a FAR representative who identified hiuself by true name as Crozco. He
related that he had received a telephone call requesting him to travel to
be
Tapachule, and that bend made the trip 19-21 July, and received contact
instructions to meet with a certain "Valentía" in
tercepts revealed, however, that 1/3 was physically in Nexico City during
the period 18-81 July. SAN 33(0.2) reveals that I/3 telephoned sra. Perta
Nigisser and made a date for 1930 on 21/7/67 at the safehouse apartment.
He commented that he did not go out of town after all. Furthermore Acwton's
telephone answering service reported to him regular calls from¡ I/3_asiln¿
gor Rowton daily during the period he was allegedly out of town. This gave
Rowton sufficient evidence to challenge 1/3's story at his meeting on 29
July. In order to prtect the security of LIFT Rowton used the evidence
of his telephone asnwering service and his own intuition and logic to dis-
count 1/3's story of his original contact with Orozco. LIRING/3 finally
confessed that he had made up the story because of the involvement of his
friend Sergio Taldez ( who it now appears zet Crozco through Alberto Do-
mingo and introduced him to L/3). HIRING/3 felt that reporting the true
facts to Rowton would not have been as intriguing in Howton's eyes and
would have made him appear dependent on Valdez for this productive aspect
of the operation. On the morning of 31 July, LIRING/3 justified his action
by stating that he continued to feel under extreme psychological pressure
to "produce" for Rowton since he felt deeply obliged to him for the con-
fidence and financial support he had been giving hin. He now states that be
realizes that he can repay Rowton only by reporting accurately (and fully
all deveopments in his dealings with FAR and other revolutionary troups.
2. All other LIFHAT intercepts relating to the Orozco affair check out with
reports given to Rowton by LIRING/3, including the latter's effort to con-
tact Capoano through Jacobo Redriqguez Padilla ( SAN-35(22). In SAN-33(10.2)
it is apparent that I/3 has discussed "señor Harris" or at least some con-
tact he has with forgio Valdez, since he states that "he" has not yet

important faction from that area and suddenly asked me to arran e

Did he ask for a revolver? -

Yes, but a special one - a Browning automatic with three clips and
fifty cartridges, canvas clothes and, most surprising three poison
pills. He said there items were to be for my own use once I entered

light of t. previous contacts. The other people hai never asked for

1. Routen net with DINING/3 at 1700 at the Incubays apartment and re-
ye
mained with hir until about 4000. III/3 reported that he bad tel=-
phoned Irnesto Captano at his officem 4/6/67, after having obtained
At phone number from César Tejeda Fonseca, the husband of the daughter
Otis Rubio ( ex-President). I/3 stated that he did not identify biz-
self to Capocano, but stated imply that he wanted to talk with him re-
garding a sensitive matter. tccording to I/3 Capanne said quickly:\"Don't
Sention any names, but give ne sono idea of what it's all about". 1/2
continued that he replied simply that it concerned "the medicine". At
the mention of this, Capcane requested that the caller telephone bir again
770707 for an apolniment, explaining that he had to leave town
over the week-end. 1/3 reported Capcano's number as 18-62-09.
2. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that when he called again or 7/8/87 as
requested, still not identifying hisself, Capcano asked to het him in
front of Gobernación at 1200. Each gave a general descriptich of the other
for recognition. When, however, 1/3 appeared in front of Cobernación at
the time appointed, he saw Lo sign of anyone answering the description of
Capoano (about 15 years old, wearing dark glasses, with green suit); nor
was he approached by anyone. After waiting about 30 minutes in the vicinity
1/3 told Roston that he left. /3 then stated that he planned to drop in
to Capoaco's bone that same evening since obviously the phone call had not
smoked him out. He gave the address of Capcano as Calle Eucareli 125, apt.
C-7, which Le stated he received froz César Tejeda.
3. When Rowton met with 1/3 again at 1000 on 8 August, the latter reported
that finally he had managed to contact Capoano at his hone (and office).
Ee reported that at about 1930 he rang the bell and was shown into a spa-
cious and nce elegant apartment and asked to take a seat in what served as
a waiting room. After about twenty minutes Capoano appeared, introduced
himself, and led 1/3 into his office. ·
4. The following is a verbatim account of the conversation between Capoano
and LIRING/3, as recalled by Roston from 1/3's report:
1/3: I have çoze to see you on a rather delicate matter that is of
great concern to me personally. Can we talk safely here?
Cap: Yes, I think it is private enough here in my office.

duran friend inkx Havana on 17/7/67. DIRING/3 subsequently received the
latter from Ochoa mentioned in the intercept and passed the original to

person showed obvious alarm at this, I said that he could, however,
if he choose, leave my home of his own free will and I gave him some
money 300 pesos

I felt very concerned about my commercial affairs and wanted to se-
perate myself from this person as soon as possible. I had no desire
to do him any harm, despite the fact that by that time I realized that
he had tried to trick me and even place by life in jeopardy. In any
event he left the apartment on his own the following morning, leaving

SHOULD BE VIEWED AS MAJOR CONSIDERATION, RELEASE OF CROZCO IN MEXICO
