Handwriting Assessment Report
=
The writer seems to be a very clever individual of a high
intellectual level who handles his affairs in a independent
manner. Endowed with a good intelligence, he is well educated
and cultured. He has not only absorbed but, also, assimilated
the material he has read and studied and utilizes it in a pur
poseful fashion. His thinking is clear, logical and versatile.
His intellectual faculties are well trained and differentiated,
and, to a large extent, they support his practical talents and
interests constructively. He discards superfluous matters, and,
whenever possible, he deals with only the vital points in a
problem or a situation. He possesses impressive mental agility
with well developed analyzing and synthesizing faculties. He
is quite intuitive and senses instinctively the implications of
happenings around him.
He is an alert and astute observer of small details which
he relates correctly to their larger aspects. Being quite re-
sourceful, he combines imagination with sober matter-of-factness.
He follows prescribed rules and regulations when absolutely
necessary and, whenever possible, exercises his mental indepen-
.dence. He forms his own opinion and judgment and keeps his own
counsel in making decisions. He may accept somebody else's
suggestions that he considers suitable for his purposes but he
is not actually influenced by others. At times, he may deliber-
ately make somebody feel as if he is seeking his advice and
following it, but, in reality, he does what he considers best.
He is very critical and evaluates by high standards. He can be
very outspoken in his criticism or he can cautiously withhold it
depending on his appraisal of the circumstances. His interests
cover small items of information to large size projects and
operations. While he notices everything that is going on, he
can concentrate on his work. When required, he can switch quickly
from one task to another. His memory functions well and he can
reproduce facts easily.

A
The writer has administrative ability on a supervisory level.
Within a military setup, he could take orders as well as issue
them, although he prefers the latter. He can be systematic and
methodical in his approach. He can work out a blueprint of an
intricate undertaking and supervise its proper execution. He will
quickly and easily adapt to fluctuations in a situation and change
his tactics accordingly.
He is skillful in manipulating numbers, and he can think in
large terms and transactions. Apparently, he is quite interested
in money, and he seems to
and he seems to know how to get the best possible
advantage out of a financial transaction
He possesses great facility in expressing himself orally and
'n writing. He can make his points palatable and can be quite
convincing in his arguments. Also, he can formulate his ideas
and purposes in different ways, depending on with whom he is
dealing. He should have talent for learning foreign languages.
He is a gifted person who will exploit his talents in line with
the demands that are put before him. He also seems to have
physical training and skills. He has a natural feeling for
form, sound and color. He probably has developed artistic
appreciation and may have an artistic hobby, possibly music.
-
Emotionally, the writer is complex but fairly well balanced.
Innately impressionable and sensitive, he has hardened himself
in the course of his life in order to be less vulnerable. He
has his feelings and impulses under fairly good control and avoids
being carried away by them. In his private life, though, he may
tend to be somewhat excitable and irritable. He is self-centered
and most interested in his personal advantage. This is a trait
that he tries to cover up by being smooth and pleasing in his
dealings with people. He possesses natural psychological under-
standing and can be very diplomatic. He manages to appear out-
going and social while basically he is quite reserved and detached.
He seems to avoid emotional involvements in order to preserve his
objectivity.

His appearance is poised and sophisticated, and he knows
how to handle himself under different conditions. Being an
independent and sophisticated individual, he has developed his
own philosophy and code of ethics by which he lives. He does
rot seem to have any qualms about doing things that would not
be conventionally acceptable. He is very broad-minded about
himself and others, and he detests pettyness, even in wrong-
doing. The purpose justifies the means for him as long as the
transaction takes place on a large scale. He is most skillful
in practicing various types of deception and he is quite adroit
in manipulating people and situations He is very active and
could have "his fingers in a number of pies." He is emotionally
Somewhat strained, but he has sifficient stamina to support his
general functioning.
The writer is apparently an unusually talented person who
could function in different types of positions. He could be a
military officer, a business executive
a business executive, a politician, an intelli-
gence agent or he could be a diplomat. He would not be suitable
for any kind of routine work, but he is well qualified for
mentally challenging assignments--the more challenging the better.
He is a diligent worker who is somewhat vain in showing off his
competence. He likes to demonstrate how successfully he can
carry out a complicated and delicate job. When he is willing
to accept an assignment, one can expect a high quality of work
performance, but anybody who would expect loyalty from him would
probably be disappointed.

HOARE stated he going London about 12 March to
check on Yemen deal. HOARE had previously received
letter from Alastair WICKS in London offering him
job with good pay and conditions. He believes this
job concerns Yemen.
Attached a letter from WICKS to HOARE, indicating WICKS
unable to develop proposition further. HOARE estimates
that the WICKS proposition relates to recruitment of mer-
cenaries for service in Yemen. His only basis for this is develop..
ment reported in AZPA 2200.

HAWANT TO AZPA
March 70
We are still held up in one business and I have had to call
in my own supplies to give an estimate as the previous one,
who was virtually unknown to me, did sot seem to understand
the importance of security in the industrial field today. This
in fact should suit us better as I am sure I can do a better
deal for us with our own man.
T
I have had to put off my departure for one week as a result
of this as it was important to keep my fingers on the pulse at
this moment. I have a meeting with the partners tomorrow when
I hope to get things moving and a firm proposal sent to bankers.
I mentioned to the partners that you had some novel ideas
to solve the delivery problem and in view of the possible extra
cost, they have asked me to get an outline from you as to what
your ideas are, both from the point of view of additional expense
which, if adopted, would need to be included in the budget and also
to give some added encouragement since this particular problem
comes up again and again and so far I have refused to be drawn
on the subject though you know my first ideas. I think a letter
to the Club Nautico will reach me safely though it would obviously
be inadvisable to mention the Spice Islands.
I hear there is much afoot in your part of the world and both
Brazzaville and the Sudan have been mentioned, also another
operation. I hope you will not return to that sort of thing
least until we have fully explored the possibilities of the new
company.

BIG PROBLEM OF MERCENARIES
INCLUDING SÉCARCB/1 HIMSELF. FOUR MERCENARY COMMANDO UNITS ARE
THE FIELD. THEY ARE LOCATED AT BUKAVU, LISALA, GENENA, INGENDE.
THERE ARE THREE: LEFT AND WARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE FOR ONE HUNDRED
MORE MEN. THESE MEN WILL ARRIVE SOON AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEM
ARE BEING MADE BY SECARO3/1 PERSONALLY, SINCE ALISTAIR SICKS AND
PATRICK O'MALLEY HAVE MADE SUCH A MESS OF PREVIOUS RECRUITING.
THE MERCENARIES ARE GENERALLY IN GOOD SPIRITS AND SECAROB/1
ESTIMATES THAT THE REBELS WILL BE SUBDUED IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS IF
HE IS ALLOWED TO USE HIS JUDGEMENT IN FIGHTING. SECAROB/1
BELIEVES THAT THE BELGIANS ARE NOT ANXIOUS FOR THE WAR TO BE OVER
TOO SOON AS THEY ARE BUILDING UP ANOTHER SPHERE OF INFLUENCE IN
THE CONGO WITH DOZENS OF OFFICERS AND MEN RUNNING HEADQUARTERS AND
LOGISTICAL TEAMS.
