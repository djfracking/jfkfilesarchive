Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395
SECRET
Elliff was also interested in knowing whether our
legal attaches were operational in the counterintelligence field.
He was advised they were not. Elliff also asked whether CIA
made available to the FBI their latest technical developments.
He was advised that we believed they did.
Finally, Elliff desired to know whether the FBI had JFK(1)(B)
received, any documents from another Government agency (CIA)
wherein the Bureau was requested to surreptitiously enter the
Chilean Embassy in Washington, DC. :C:.:.:(:):) He was advised that this
would have to be researched and that we would be in touch with
him on this particular subject.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) We have already begun to examine the material asked
for regarding the FBI's legal authority and implication of
sensitive investigative techniques. Once examined and analyzed,
we will submit recommendations as to how we should proceed taking
into consideration the observations and suggestions of Elliff.
(2) We are pulling together the documents regarding
the Chilean Embassy episode and with approval will suggest
Elliff submit his specific request in writing through the AG.
