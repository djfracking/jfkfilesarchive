vas under asylum in the Brazilian Embassy (sic, Argentine
Embassy?), when TOMKU gained political asylum. When Osiel
finally received his safe conduct from the Embassy, he vent
to Puerto Rico and, TOMEU postulates that Owiel is now again
with KENOTO in either the United States or Puerto Rico.
Two snap shots (to be returned) were provided by
TOMU of himself and six other individuals who were in asylum
at the same time. Be identified these, in the photograph in
which Monsignor Eduardo BOZA Masvidal is seated, as, from
left to right: Manuel VILLAMANAN, Oliverio TOMEU, Nils DIAZ
(believed to be in US), Publio RUIZ (US), Jorge Del VALLE
(Nex?), and Quiel GONZÁLEZ (US or Puerto Rico?).
7. Upon completing the debriefing, Stroud and TOMEU
"exchanged small talk" for a while until TOMEU finally stated
that he still wished there was something more he could do to
help free Cube, and asked "What do you think I should do?"
Stroud replied that no person could really make that type of
decision for another individual, and countered by asking TOMEU
what alternatives he had in mind, other than remaining in the
13 Army as a career military officer.
8. TOMEU replied that, of course, he was once an
agriculturalist, but that there were few job opportunities in
which he could apply his past experience. His sister had also
asked him if he felt he and his family would want to live with
her in Spain or Mexico, but he didn't think too much of this
idea. He then stated that he had been asked by Manuel ARTINK
to take a job as an instructor. Without indicating any
association of even awareness of ARTIME's activities, or of
ARTIME's contact with TOMEU (as incicated in TOMEU's 201),
vas askod what he thought of ARTIME's proposition.
stated that he would no longer follow any man as “a
individual or as a leader, because a man's ideals, outlook,
and objectiven change with time, For example, the people of
Cuba followed Fidel because of the ideals he advocated. When
Fidel took over, his accomplishments gradually became quirg
different from the ideals he had espoused. TOMEU continued
by saying he would “no longer follow a man, One could only
trust his ideals or an organization which followed those
ideals, since a good organization would be less likely of
being controlled by a single man.' When saked for an example
of the type of organization he had in mind, TOMEU replied he
was most favorably inclined towards the ideals and goals of
the JURE. (The JURE or JRC is an organization created by
Manolo RAY Rivero around a nuɑleus of former 26 July Movement
leaders. See nemo and attachment dated 23 July 1963 from John
Hugh Crimmins, Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, ARA, Departmens
of State in TOMKU's 201–283206.):

It should, perhaps, be noted here that in an informal
exchange with Mrs. Donald WEBSTER, TOMEU's supervisor at the
Defense Language Institute, Anacostia Naval Annex, 4 June 64,
Kra. VÆRSTER volunteered the information that "all of the other
'Brigade students here' have told me they think very highly
of TOMEU, and that he is a very brave man; because he and his
family were very wealthy in Cuba and he gave it all up to
into exile and fight the Castro Regins."
