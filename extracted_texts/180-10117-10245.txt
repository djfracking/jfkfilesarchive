Foster remarked that the Bolden case was unique in his
experience because of the nondisclosure by authorities
of information that is automatically released to the
probation officer in a given case.
Specifically, in every other case which Mr. Foster
has processed, the prosecutor gave the probation officer
a "version," i.e., a recital of fact about the crime and
the circumstances surrounding it. Only in cases where an
undercover informant is under parole supervision is the
name of the informant withheld, but even then a version is
always presented despite the witholding of the name. In
Bolden's case, the prosecutor gave the probation officer
only the indictment.
T. Sykes.
Bolden's prosecutor was named Richard
Mr. Foster's statement about Mr. Bolden's record while
under parole supervision was that Mr. Bolden violated parole
by talking to the media in order to convey his information
that the Secret Service knew about the assassination three
or four weeks before Dallas. However, for reasons which
were not disclosed either to Mr. Foster or on the record
Mr. Bolden's parole status was not revoked.
that his records show that Bolden's statement was published
in the April 12, 1970 Chicago Sun-Times.
Foster recounted
Mr. Foster also set forth certain materials about Mr.
Bolden's prosecution and conviction, supplying enough detail
to make clear that at least one of the witnesses upon whose
testimony the conviction was based subsequently recanted his
testimony. The recantation, however, did not enable Bolden

Summary of Contact:
In re:
Former SS Agent Abraham Bolden DOB 1/19/35; Social
Security No. 330-28-2266. A trace of Abraham Bolden's prison
record was developed from a newspaper article found in the
LBJ Library which mentioned initial incarceration in Spring-
field, Mo. Mr. Bolden was transferred from Springfield to
Maxwell Field Federal Prison Camp (Montgomery, Alabama) and was
placed on parole in September of 1959. Maxwell retained no
records except for an indication that at some time Bolden
stated that he had had "a residence in Chicago. This lead
suggested that an inquiry be made to the Federal Probation
service for the Chicago area.
Coincidentally, Mr. Foster was the probation officer who
personally supervised Mr. Bolden while Bolden was on probation.
