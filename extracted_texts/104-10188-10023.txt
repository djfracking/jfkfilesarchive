was content with termination bonus of $1,736. Following termination, offec-
tive 31 May 1968, the LIMITED base house went out of existence

not retain apartment since coverage from LILYRIC is completely satisfactory.
LILYRIC personnel have done such good work that station now has better coverage

Headquarters' confusion regarding the various LIEMPTY
properties is understandable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved. The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyms. Up to this point, LIMITED had been
in a building owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE fronting for WOFIRM),
LILYRIC had been renting an apartment in a building in which
WOFIRN had no financial interest. In 1965, however, LIMOUSINE
bought the property containing the building in which LIMITED had
been located, razed the building, and built a new building in
which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,
was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
payment on the loan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building). For various operational reasons it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building
instead of the LIMITED crew. LIMITED was therefore moved into the
building which LILYRIC had occupied. At this point, of course,
new cryptonyms should probably have been assigned in order to
avoid the confusion which has evidently developed. (This was not,
however, simply a switch of personnel - each base house retained..
its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were
not changed). As far as LICALLA is concerned, the confusion

case with old LILYRIC, the rent zoney is not returned to the
Station OIRY has no financial interest in the building. Thus
it is evident that the LIEMPTY project renewal, which used to
say 'LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned to Station by.
LIMOUSINN and credited to Station miscellaneous receipts" should
how carry the footnote "LICALLA rent is returned to the Station
and credited to expense; LILYRIC rent is, and will be through
September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited
to miscellaneous receipts as partial payment on Station loan to
LIMOUSINE."
6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom is the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC, LIMITED, and LIENTRAP are
developed, printed, and (on request) enlarged by LIEMPTY-4.
This darkroom is located in GERENDS's apartment, and he is paid
1,000 pesos per month for maintenance of the darkroom in
recognition of the fact that one room in his living quarters
has been turned into a darkroom, and his electric and water
bills are substantially higher than they would normally be with-
out a darkroom on the premises. GERENDE 18 building a house
which he expects to occupy in February 1968. His plans for the
house specifically include a LIEMPTY darkroom, and he will continue
to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this. To cover this payment
in the new house, MEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded
to Headquarters shortly.

LICALLA has been in operation at its present

September 1957 the building in which LICALLA is located
(which consists of four units, collectively known as
LIMUST) was purchased by the Station, with LIMOUSINE acting
as a front.
(4) Actual cost is nothing, since property is
owned by WOFIRM. The original purchase price for the
four units was $40,000.00 with an additional $20,000.00
spent on renovation. Rent is paid for cover purposes at
the annual rate of $1,248.00
(5) Cost of utilities is estimated at $552.00

probably stems from the fact that, while its location has not
changed, it is located within the LIMUST building, which is
owned by BOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE acting as "front") and which is
administered within the LIMESA project. As stated, however, all
of this has been carefully documented for Headquarters. The
LIMOUSINE purchase of the old LIMITED building generated consid-
erable correspondence (see particularly MEXI Ziby and DIR 77743
of January 1965). HILMA-28322 and HMMA-30403 spelled out the
reasons for switching LILYRIC and LIMITED, and the completion
of the move was reported in HMALY-30687, Finally, sketches and
plans of the LILYRIC and LIMITED houses in their new locations
were forwarded with HMMA-31303, dated 7 February 1967. As far
as LICALLA is concerned, its location and status was never open´
to question, and its location in the LIMUST complex is regularly
mentioned in LIMESA progress renewal requests. The Station under-
stands that a meno describing the locations of the various base
houses was attached to the most recent LIMESA project renewal
request when it was submitted to the staffs by WH/1.
I: J
!
2. Personnel within the base houses is also well-documented
(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
in each house), and the personnel have never been switched from
house to house. Perhaps the best rundown of these persönnel is
Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA-31164,
24 January 1967.
'
3. Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (MEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current condi-
tions. MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA. Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent and utilities for the
following reasons: first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment. Secondly, the rent,
even though returned to the Station because WOFIRM owns the
building, must. physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA.
He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE. LIMOUSINE
eventually returns the money, at which time it is credited to
expense. This could, of course, be handled differently, but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a semi-
annual basis. The reimbursement, therefore, often comes, many
months after the payment.
4.

!
The Station neglected to cancel MEXI-41, which should
be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966. LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE. Rent payments are, as originally intended,
being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as instructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station is crediting this money
to miscellaneous receipts. There can be, therefore, no question
of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in
the LIEMPTY project. LILYRIC rent is, and has been since the
apartment was occupied in October 1966, 3,000 pesos per month,
which amounts to $2,880 per year ($3,200 has been requested in
order to include utilities). Headquarters is correct in stating
that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building
was 2,300 pesos per month. Station files indicate that the
reason for the increase (and this apparently was not reported
to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major part
of LIMOUSINE's loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment. The Station had, of course, no choice
but to go along with this.
5. The Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely
that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed
purchased by WOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955. But since that
building was later purchased and razed by LIMOUSINE, the old
LIMITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously
housed LILYRIC (but not to the same apartment), and LIMITED is

1. The presence of so many new desk personnel at
headquarters people who are unfamiliar with station
history means that we must turn to you with questions
oftener than you might wish. Our present question
concerns property involved in LIEMPTY. (We are submitting
the project as received from the field, but do not
understand the background very well.)
2. HMMA-11257 of 16 January 1959, a project renewal, said
that "approximately one year ago the LICALLA base was
purchased by KUBARK through: LIMOUSINE", and we have not found
any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that
status. Does MEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Report
of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If so, and if we own
LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and
utilities? (Up until the submission dated 1963 the project
renewal used to say "LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned.
to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellaneous
receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliminated.)

3. LIMITED is a different problem complicated by
the fact that we are no longer sure what the name refers
to.
Originally we bought LIMITED and then sold it in
January 1965 to LIMOUSINE who put up a new building on
LIMOUSINE
the lot and saved an apartment for our use.
-
now owns the new building, but "MEXI 02, LIMITED Safehouse"
is shown on the Real Property Report as "purchased" by
WOFIRM in 1955 should this not be corrected? A further
complication is that HMMA -31164, GERENDE's January 1967
security review, speaks of LILYRIC in its present new
location, inhabited by LIEMPTY/13, 14 and /27. Has the
old LIMITED been re-christened LILYRIC because of its new
inhabitants? When was it completed and are we still
withholding rent from LIMOUSINE in settlement of his
payment to us for the property. The REAL Property Report shows
LILYRIC, MEXI 41, having been leased in 1958 and
costing $1030 to maintain ($856 rent, $44 reparis, and $130.
utilities). It also shows MEXI 132 LINEPTY, LIMOUSINE, LILYRIC
as having been rented in October 1966 for $2880 a year-
(which is more than the 2,300 monthly rent for the flat
in his new building which LIMOUSINE agreed that we would
withhold for a period of two years after completion in.
partial settlement of his purchase of the LIMITED property.)
(HMMA 25310, 3 February 1965.)
4. What does the LIEMPTY darkroom consist of?
5.
We are, as you can see, confused. Would you be
kind enough to send us a brief summary of each of the four

part, the number of floors of the building located at Gelati #2 was given
incorrectly in Reference B. The plans forwarded as attachments to Reference.
B were correct. The description in the dispatch should be corrected to show
a ground-floor, three floors with two apartments each and a penthouse.

LIEMIRACE/LIEMPTY - Transfer of Responsibility for the Vehicle
ACTION REQUIRED · REFERENCES

MEXICO CITY-2600
MEXICO CITY-2654:
1. In July 1967 the responsibility for the LIEMPTY Project passed from
the Station Support Section to the REITOP Section, where it more reasombly
belongs. However, the LIFTRAP segment of the LIEMPTY Project bas little
to do with RESTOP Activities and more rightly belongs in the Support Section.
The Station, therefore, decided to transfer the LIFETRAP vehicle, LIEMPTY-10
and LD-NETY-11 to the LIEMBRACE Project with LIEMEVION-3 to be the Principal
Agent. This decision was based on both security and operational efficiency
consideretions. The formal change of command was made on 10 August 1967 in
a meeting between GERENDE, LUMPTY-10 and LIENIRACE-3.
2. Certain members of the LIMACE surveillance teen vere already
knowledgeable of the existance of the LIDARAP vehicle and its operion
from pest operations and also from the old LIPSTICK Project. Conversely,
LIEMPTY-10 was knowledgeable of the existence of the surveillance team and
knew some of the members of the team (LIRRACE-4 is the step-son of LIEMPTY-10)
W placing the vehicle under the command of LIKSIRACE-3, there was no break-
down of compertmentation.
Distribution:
(3) Chief/ED
continued...
16 Oct 57:
Oral message sent back to station via Al Reynolds to the effect
that we feel it impolitic to present a surveil ance poject in
the neighborhood of $62,000, so please keep the truck under
LIEMPTY for admin. purposes (and use it anyway you want.)
C/WH/1 did not want to send a written message on this.

3. On the other hand, the LIENTRAP vehicle was the most vulnerable jart
of the LIEMPTY complex and a roll-up of the truck could lead to Reymond H.
GESENDS, Principal Agent for LIEMPTY, and from ORD to the sensitive
LIEMITY photo baschouces. Thus, by attaching the LIENIAP vehicle to the
LIEMEFACE surveillance team we have actually improved the security of the
LIEGTI Project somewhat.
b. On the operational efficiency side, the bonefits which will accrue
from having the truck tied-in with the surveillance team for use in dispatching
are obvious. In many areas of the city, such as around the market areas
:
and third class hotels, an ostensibly empty truck attracts mich less attention
than a person on foot or even a passenger car. The ability to dispatch a
target and at the same time take photographs of the target and any companion's
has its operational silvantages. Hopefully, in some of the target-of-opportunity
coverages now provided by the surveillance team, it will be possible to take
photographs of the person with whom the PJSTEAL officer moets. Certainly, if
the team taken an unidentified subject home after a target-of-opportunity
discovery, by allowing the team leador to place the photo truck on the home
we will speed-up the receipt of photographs.
5. LIEMBRACE-3 was told that LIEMPTY-10 and 11 have certain accomodation
addresses which they must check on a routine basis and that any assistance
given the LIEMBRACK team should not interfere with this task. It was stressed
to LIEMBRACE-3 that under no circumstances should team members transport or
otherwise assist in the servicing of the accomodation addresses. LIEMBRACE-3
was briefed on the normal activity of the LIENTRAP truck in providing
photographie coverage of addresses in which the Station has an interest.
handling the use of the truck, the following caveats were laid upon LIEMERACE-31
LIEMERACE-3 should discuss the normal activities of LIENTRAP only
with LIMRACE-1, the assistant team leader.
The truck is not to be used in active mobile surveillance without
the approval of the Station.
As for
The truck will be used for dispatching purposes only in those areas
in which passenger vehicle and/or foot dispatching are not feasible.
d. `LIEMPTY-10 and LIEMPTY-11 will not be used for active surveillance
nor will they be introduced to team members who do not presently
know their true identities.
6. Operationally, the efficacy of the use of the LIENTRAP truck in
coordination with the LIEMBRACE team has been proven in the coverage and
murveillance of a letter-drop on Mexico City. Please seo references for details
of this operation, which could not have been accomplished in a secure manner
without the truck assisting the team. No problems have been noted as a result.
of the change in command structure for the LIENTRAP truck.
7. Financially, one possible problem is evident in the new arrangement.
Headquarters has limited the costs of the LIEMBRACE Project to US$ 50,000 per
year and it will not be possible for the Project to remain within this figure
with the LISNTRAP vehicle and personnel included the rein. The Station does
not see this as a great problem because the Operational Program includes the
cost of these assets in the LIEMPTY Project and the transfer will merely man
a decrease in LIEMPTY equal to the increase in LIEMBRACE.

1. LIEMPTY-5 is the wife of LIEMPTY-4, the operator of the photography
baso used in processing the pictorial take received from the various units
within the LIERTY complex. As such, she sometimes assiste LIEMPTY-4 in the
photo processing work. She is carried as a part-time basshousekeeper because
sho must remain at home as added security when photographs are being processed
and/or being held until the scheduled meeting between LIFMPTY-1 and Raymond
H. GERENDE takes place and the photographs passed for onward transmittal to the
Station.
'
2. The Station regrets that LIEMPTY-5 was not included in the last Project
Renoval Request, but the oversight probably resulted because LIEMPTY-5 does not
receive a salary at the present time. The Station wishes to keep her present
Memorandum of Oral Commitments, which calls for an hourly salary, in effect
in case her services as a salaried asset are needed in the future.

MICROFILM
1. Primary responsibility for the operational and
administrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the REDTOP..
to the Operational Support Section, This transfer was made
as part of our effort to consolidate basic support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP
Section of activities which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit of priority recruitment targets. However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points. It will also be the main provid-
er of guidance and requests for special LILYRIC/LICALLA
coverage.
2. The previous REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H. FERNALD)
introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T. BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY-
9, -13, and -14 in early December. LIMOUSINE, owner of the
LILYRIC property, will continue to be handled by Timothy M.
ARCHBOLD of the REDTOP Section.

Justification for Automobiles under Project LIEPTY
7
1. It is requested that the Mexico City Station be authorised to
purchase three used sedans for use by the Y surveillance team. The
Station plans to expand the LIEPTY surveillance team into a larger, well-
trained physical surveillance asset. They will need thre automobiles.
Frivate automobiles or commercial transportation will not be satisfactory
since the cars must be outfitted with two-way radios.
2. Authority is also requested to purchase a panel truck to be used
in the LLETRAP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-
graphic surveillances.
3. It is also requested that a quasi-personal cer be authorized for
Oliver C. Scantling (ps). Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral
contract. A car is a prerequisite for his work for KRK which includes
casings, Burveillances, and investigations. Fachuse of the sensitive
nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has
decided that Scantling should be furnished a car.
4. LIMITY &gents were formerly carried under the LIETKY
LIPSTICK Projects. The vehicles used by the LIGHPTY agents under these
other projects will be disposed of and new ones will be purchased after
the above TVA has been approved. The vehicles which will be replaced.
are HV 2148, HV 2147, MY 2138, and MV 2041. Q: of the surveillance
cars will be new and will not replace an old car. It was decided that
these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIGHTY
Project for security reasons and because of the age of the automobiles.
The automobiles are 1951 and 1952 models and have been used for sensitive
curveillance work for over two yearn. The panel truck which was used in
the LI-MRAP Operation under the LIPTICK Project has been operating for
two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The
fact that the LIP TICK surveillance tena knows that the truck exists,
evon to the point that one of the team members is the listed owner of the
truck, also dictates replacement of this vehicle.
