from AEPADDLE. He was recruited in April 1959 by the Frankfurt Station,
for a REDGOX operation. There had been some difficulty in the initial
_ recruitment, since it could not be resolved as to whether or not he
could work amicably with another agent in the proposed operation. Af-
ter psychological assessments and LCFLUTTER examination, it was decided
to recruit subject. He was assigned the crypto AEASPIC. In April 1959
subject was brought to the DOB, via a HBRAINBOW flight. Subject was
trained in the AESENTRAL project for a black mission into the USSR as a
member of a REDSOX team. This project was postponed for a year. In
the interim he was assigned to TED, where he was employed at a covert
site, involving the cataloguing of specific information from East
German Documents, and developing and/or improving tools and methods for
picking locks. On 17 June 1960, it was decided that Project AESENTŢHEL
would not be carried out. On receipt of this information SR/DOB en-
deavored to place mibject elsewhere, where his training would be bene-
ficial. The African Division expressed interest and had agreed to uti-
lize him as a result of assessments. During the period from the 21st
of October until dispatch, subject will be carried on OOA funds.

employment in Berlin. He was in contact with the construction firm of Arthur Döll
and Son and after he wrote to them on 24. 7. 58 he received a reply that this firm was

GENERAL INFORMATION TO BE NOTED
Subject was issued the following documents:
.
1. Austrian (Ordinary) Passport Nr. 546.226 in Vienna at the main Passport
Office located in Wien I, Postrasse 9, which is near the main Post Office and also near
Schwedenplatz. As noted in the passport entries, document was issued in 1955 and was.
valid until 1960, when it was again renewed for another five years. The lack of exit
and entry cachets of very frequent travel to Germany and Berlin is explained by the fact
that generally since late 1955 Austrians entering Germany no longer were stamped in or
out. For this reason, Subject can claim that he made many trips to Germany and back
each time remaining as long as three months without special permits. (Austrians need
a residence permit only when they remain more than three months at one time.)
As noted above, that passport was first issued by the main Passport office, however,
the renewal was obtained at a sub station, Wien IV, Taubstummengasse 11. This can
be explained by the fact that at that time subject lived in that part of Vienna after
he returned from Berlin.

indicated authority on which permit was issued, but since this is his first permit no
such entry is made.

went to see Dr. Ladislaus Tomsich, General Practitioner, Wien III, Marokkanergasse 133.
This Doctor, had the necessary vaccines for smallpox and yellow fever and he took both
vaccines on 12 November 1959. Smallpox vaccinations are generally valid for three years.
The yellow fever shots are good for 6 years.

14. Making

ab was
Subject ims originally consider for a project
subsequently cancelled. Throughout the file tre recommendations that
in dealing with the subject hy s. tion should cert very definite
uthority. For tuple, the recommendation of CCB Frankfurt, 13/11/58:
"The handling of subject fro this point on must be ruthless
and calculated..He would recomiendainst paying more than
the absolute minimum he needs to survive until the mission is
completed"
20 September 1960 Africa Division picked subject up for an
assignment in the Congo. In conjunction with this mission, subject
was furnished Austrian documentation; which, according to a Dir
comusication dated 22 November 1960, we to be used in order to
travel from West Germany to Leo vi ierland Italy, and should
be returned when no longer needed.
The Director's communication to Leo in reiterated that subject
would take fin onlors and should be dealt with in a positive manner.
Unfortunately, shortly after arriving in the Congo subject got into
financial difficulty, created security problems with his conduct, and
then jumped into a new position with the CAF that moved so stiftly as
to preclude any effective station direction.
On 30 June 1961 the Director recomended termination of subject
since he was becoming too great a security risk. Subject was returned
to the U.., then was sent back to Frankfurt, given 12,000.00 pay and
put on his own. There is no indiction of any hard feelings on the
part of the subject but it is admitted that he "wondered" why he was
let go.
On 20 September 1961, subject turned up on his om in the Congo and
begin to approach station personnel with offers of help, no matter
what the shined or where they wanted him. Of 12 Jecember 1951
the station a bed hit subject is a security haward of sorts and
asked for some direction
The Security Division it heuarters st is that the incumentation
originally furnished subject were zwiecking retained by him since he
had no other citizenshipwort. Once these documorto run out it will
be i bible for into renew them.
In the light of the generous termination terms, in the repeated
statements to subject that KU ARK could not utilize his pervices, and
the possible security hasard, it would seem best to completely sever
any relationships with hin. Judging from the psychiatric opinion, as
well as opinions of personnel who have worked with subject, he fully
understands
by and will not question stem authority.

GETRET
For this reason it is recommended that either one of the two following
courses of action may be taken, preferably the first.
1. In very unequivocal language inform subject that his official
connection to the U.). interests in the Congo have been and continic to.
bined contact with those interests could result in
This apprehension (if for nothing else for posessing forged documents).
Instruct him that he clearly understood that his relationship with this
organization could be terminated under the terms of the contract and
Although we are appreciative of his past efforts; he is now on his own.
2. Bring him back to the U.S. and go formr with the original
plan to resettle subject in Helico. We made preliminary inquiries about
this possibility 19 August 1960 before he came with Africa Division
and the only thing that stopped the transfer plans was the possibility
that he could be used in the Congo.
On the other
Solution number one runs the risk of having subject get disgruntled,
and then runing to the wrong people to tell all he nows.
hand, if the man reacts to direction as we are told he does this may be
all that he needs to stay clear of the station. It is apparent that at
sone point in time he has to be given the gate.
Solution na ber to ruis into the financial problem as well as
dealing with an individual who is no longer connected with this org mization
However, it does me tone of the "requirements" laid down by the CO2
in Frankfurt back in 1958, ie., "Given some money and a job he could
be resettled in any South American country without difficulty". The
second colution is inviting, if for no other reason, in terms of getti

POTENTIAL SECURITY HAZARD. WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HAS ADVICE RE
POSSIBLE SOLUTION. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE CONVERT MONEY
AT STATION RATE AND HAVE KUBARK GERMANY PICK UP HIS DOCUMENTATION
WHILE HE IN GERMANY. THIS WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING CONGO
AS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE DOCUMENTATION IN NAME UNDER WHICH HE NOW

5. At meetings held 5 and 6 March WIROGUE supplied the following
details concerning his new job he was to meet the Minister of National
Defense ad interim, Fernand KAGADI, on 7 March to sign a contract. He
finally did meet KASADI (whom IOGUS knows only as H. le Ministre) on
9 March but no contruct was yet signed. As of 15 March WIROGUE had not
yet signed a contruct but this is pending, he tells us, any day. (A
copy of this contract will be forwarded to Headquarters when obtained.)
The terms of the agreement include; he states,that he will provide
through his European contacts at least three pilot instructors and three
mechanic instructors within thirty days. (Thirty days from when is an
open question.) More instructors will be needed at a later date, the
possible total number being set at ten, five for flying and five for
mechanical instruction These iñstructors will be paid 20,000 Belgian
Congo Francs a month plus 10,000 BCP bonus. NIROGUE will receive 25,000.
BCF and 10,000 50F bonus each month, with housing to be supplied in all
SF
CURES. If the instructors have filio, funily transport in addition
to their cm will be provided by the Congolese govemment, In addition.
medical care and a fifteen day vacation each year is to be provided
The work week is to consist of a 5 day week.
5. WIRCQUE has said that he is totally dependent upon KUBARK
support to supply the needed instructors. He also feels he must provide
documentation to prove he is an ex-captain in the German Army and is quite
anxious concerning this point. (Answered by part 3, Ref A). WIROGUE
also feels that the instructors should be other than PBPRIME in order
to better buck up is cover story, Since PRIME instructors might point.
the finger of suspicion in his direction. One or two PEPRILLIC candi-
dates, however could be included providing a proper cover story were
provided. WIROGUE needs names of candidates as quickly as possible, though
a dumny list of names "to whom he has written" can be supplied if either
PIERROT or KAIADI become too insistent. All candidates must be French
speaking. In addition, WIRCUS needs a good 35 mm camera and feels thai.
this was promised to him, with other equipment, and though his targeting
has shifted he still has great use for it. Currently WIROGUE has one of
the station-Leica's on short loan in order to photograph the N'Dolo sïr-
port facilities for PIERROT.
7. Recruited instructors should be provided a means of outside
contact with the Station separate from IROGUE, which could be implemented
if needed, at a later date. The actual hiring and correspondence rela-
ting to their contracts should be sent over to WIRCQUE as though he were
handling the entire matter himself on behalf of the Congolese government.
The addre's which should be used for all corres; ondence on an overt
basis is included with this dispatch as Attachment 3, with the title of
Hajor preceding the name provided in Attachment A of ACLW-192
8. With a set sulary from the Congolese Covenument, it is WIROGUE's
wish to commence repayment of the $4,000 loan mude to him for his business.
Also, this particular situation could be fairly short-lived in view of
United Nation's offer to the Air Force to assist in Congolese Air Force
training. It is obvious that PIERROT and the Congolese Goverment are
trying to develop several sources at once to quarantee training for their
embryo Air are, and the final outcome is difficult to determine. The
Station is also aware that PIERROT and KAZADI could be using WIROGUE at
this juncture to obtain instructors for the air force, but might ease him

of their own accord later on, either deeming him rot worth keeing be-
cause he is not a profesional airman, or because he will have done
something to antagonize them. Also, the Station of Headquarters may deem
it advisable to esse him out of this job, us Headquarters has suggested
in Ref A, after he has provided in entree for putting some instructors
on the scene. We believe this situation represents a worthwhile gain,
However, if WIRCONS does obtain the contruct as presently constituted.
9. Attachment C provides some information concerning Paul Arnold
PIERROT and the Congolese Air Force which was provided by the Air Attache,
Leopoldville, and which has already been reported through their channels.
PIERROT is obviously trying to develop a training program and build up
the Congolese Air Force from several sources at once, and if several
of these sources provide the desired aid it is debatable if his own
program (with WIROGUE) would become very extensive or even be imple-
mented. It is also possible that WIROGUE's role in the training picture
could shift at any time feel that at this time we can only go
along with developments as they occur and try to realize the maximum
benefit from the situation Headquarters will be kept informed of any
changes in the situation, and be provided more specific data when avail-
able.
.
10. In all fairness to WIROGUE, it should be pointed out that
until recently the station has not had the time to properly target WIRO-
GUE.
As he appears to be untrained in KUPUBS and KUCAGE operations, he
requires a great deal of case officer time, an item which is in short
supply in this station. We believe WIROGUE may develop into a worth-
while asset, if the time and attention he requires can be spent on him.
however.
The station is taking the appropriate steps in this direction.

1. On 29 November 1961 IROGUE told the undersigned that he felt his
position vis-a-vis the Congolese Government was rapidly weakening. First,
WIROGUE had endorsed sending one of the advisors with the Congolese Air
Force to Europe to purchase planes and later found WIZARD/4 was at least
Cognizant of a second GOC representative sent to Europe on the same mission.
WIROGUE made vague references to some 2,000,000 Congolese France of the
40,000,000 available for airplane purchases "going into someone's pocket."
WIROGUE was incensed at the move of the GOC in sending a parallel mission
to Europe and not informing him of it. He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about
this other mission. WIZARD/2 apparently informed WIZARD/4 about
WIROGUS's visit and since then, for a period of the last five days,
WIZARD/4 has refused to see or talk to WINOGUE.
2. The GOC has also apparently proposed sending HIROGUE on an
intelligence gathering mission to Katanga. WIROGUE asked if KUBARK were
interested in this undertaking. We advised him strongly against this
move and added we had no interest whatsoever in the project.
3° HIROGUE has also met the ODOATH representative and showed him
the model submarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH
representative evinced interest in this model and through the ODUNIT
representative, whon WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed
the problem of purchasing planes for the GOC, the ODOATH representative
was aware that WIROGUS has an Ordre de Mission signed by WIZARD/2 to
travel to PEPRING. He said for WIROGUE to inform him when he was ready
to depart and he would arrange for WIROGUE to contest appropriate ODOATH
people in PEPRIME to discuss the model.
To
4. WIROGUE approached GUTHMAN on November 24 and SALVACK on November
29 with a request whether he might be of use to KUBARK either in Africa
or elsewhere in the world, and that he would like to be taken back into
the fold. He is obviously concerned about his position in the COC at this
time and feels with the diplomatic relations being established between
Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly weɛker.
reemphasize past assessments of HIROGUE, he is far too disorganized an
individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where
action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. The station
agrees with an early statement made concerning WIHOGUE that he has a
peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and
extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of
an action type.

SUBJECT: Paul Arnold PIERROT - Background Information provided by
Air Attache. Leopoldville
1 N' DOLO airport is currently being evacuated by the U.N.O.C.
forces and turned over to the Congolese government for use by the
Congolese Air Force There are some 150 cadets who have received some
training and are considered ready for advanced training, but as of this
time, have nowhere to be trained PIERROT has made extensive efforts
to obtain aid from many sources to train these cadets The AIRA re-
Forts that FIERACT has requested aid from the Belgians, the British,
United Nations, and asked the AIRA to request aid from the French for
the Congolese Air Force About 30 cadets are in training in Tunisia at
the present time. On 11 March the AIRA recommended aid be extended to
the Congolese Air Force, but under the auspices of the United Nations.
r
2 PIERROT also reported 11 March that he had 6 Koth and 9 Har-
vard 7-6 aircraft being delivered near the end of March, and asked if
the United Nations Command would allow them to enter the Congo. He
even offered to let the planes remain under U.N. control.
:3 PIERROT is a mulatto and claims to have a white grandmother
in Dallas, Texas He was trained by the Belgians and claims to have
flown C-47's and T-33 jet planes, though he has not been on flying sta-
tus since 1956 due to goiter trouble At this time accurate bio duta
is not availalbe His assistant is Lt K.J. LEMAN who is reportedly
completely devoted to PIERRCT. FIERROT is personally ambitious and at
one point in the fall of 1960, he approached TRELIDE authorities with
a plan to take over the government if they would help him His plan
was too transparent and weak for any serious consideration at that
time.

BY QUAURED HQ. DESK ONLY
1. On 2 October 1961 telephoned Lester H. SALVACK
and said that he had something important to discuss with him.
WIRE requested SALVACK to come to his house in Binza, a
suburb of Leopoläville.
2. WIRONE had two requests. The first was to ask "Dan" to
forward the two laissez-paissez's which IROGUE states he turned
over to Dan and never got back. WIROGLE was quite emphatic that
he deeds these documents. SALVAT suested that WIROGUE write
a note stating 'exactly what he wanted and give it to him to
forward. WEROGUE did and the note is forwarded as a separate
cover attachment to this dispatch.
3. WIROGUE then showed SALVANH a model of a one man
submarine on which he had been working in conjunction with
a Belgian engineer (Identity #1) who is also a Congolese
Air Force advisor. He claimed that this submarine would
be capable of speeds up to 100 kilometers an hour on short
runs, and would have a cruising distance of 500 kilometers.
The model, being built to 1/7 scale, is approximately half
completed, and, of course, has never been tested. WIROGUE
said he had discussed this model and his plans fully when in
headquarters, and hat made a full report concerning all
details. SALVACK said that (1) he was not an engineer and
(2) was in no position to make any pronize or commitment.
All that he could do was to report that the model was in
the process of construction and to further report that WIROQUE
wanted to make sure that the est got it instead of the Communist
bloc.
4. WIRQUE expressed fuil willingness to show the model,
and have his companion explain it fully, to anyone SALVACK
wished to bring to WIROGE's house. SA nade no commitment
other than to report the conversation. It should be noted
that WINOGUE had never mentioned this its before to Station
personnel, and told Salvack that neither he nor his companion
had said anything to anyone in The Congo concerning it up to
this point.)
...
5. If Headquarters is willing, the station suggests that the
ODOACH attache be put into contact with IROGUE concerning this
item. He could conduct any necessary tests or experiments.
Because of WINCL's past, however, and the nature of his
documentation, the Station requests Headquarters guidance and
approval prior to taking any nation.

6. On returning to the Congo I crossed the Congo
river from Brazzaville successfully in suite of the ferries
being closed to all out diplomatic travel, but it involved
a prolonged argument for more than an hour with the imiration
authorities at the ferry landing. SIRGUE hes never fully
admitted what he did to successfully enter The Congo, though
knowing the situation, he probably indulged in some small
bribery. Fince he had merely disappeared for a short while
after mentioning that he might need medical attention, his
Congolese Air Force job was still open. (There are many OC.
advisory positions vacant, and for someone to obtain such a
position with any sort of qualifications is not too difficult."
When a position is vacated it is seldom refilled, certainly
not quickly.) He has reiterated strongly at each of the three
meetings SALVAC has had with him that he is willing to help
PBPRINE any way possible.

GENERAL
On 7 September 1961, the SUBJECT, David TZITZICHVILI, and Case

Washington, D. C. at 0900 hours. At this time the case officer ex-
plained to the SUBJECT that the reporting agent would have in his
possession documents for SUBJECT and two thousand dollars in cash
which was to be given to SUBJECT after their arrival in Frankfurt,
Germany. At this time the SUBJECT executed a signed receipt for the
money and documents and this receipt was kept by the case officer.
"
The SUBJECT and reporting agent departed Union Station, Washington,
D. C. via Pennsylvania Railroad Train #174, the Colonial, and arrived
at Trenton, New Jersey, at 1300 hours, 7 September 1961. The SUBJECT
and reporting agent then proceeded via taxi-cab, Trenton, New Jersey, to.

Frankfurt, Germany, at 0830 hours at the Rhein-Main Airport on 8 September
1961.
After arrival at Rhein-Main Airport SUBJECT and the reporting agent
proceeded via taxi-cab to downtown Frankfurt. At this time the money and.
documents were given to SUBJECT. He executed a signed receipt for this
matorial which is attached to this report as Exhibit #1. After SUBJECT
received the documents and money he departed the company of the reporting
agent at the train station in Frankfurt, Germany.
During the course of the trip to Germany SUBJECT stated that he would
possibly remain in Germany for a few weeks and that he was also contemplating
moving to Switzerland or returning to the Congo. SUBJECT seemed well satis-
fied with the termination agreement and at no time displayed any dissatis-
faction concerning his treatment during the past several months.
The reporting agent departed Frankfurt, Germany via Pan American
Airlines Flight #73 et 1400 hours, 11 September 1961, and arrived at
