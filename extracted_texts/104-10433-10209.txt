On 4-28-68, a representative of CIA advised the
Bureau that a German doctor, Klaus Steer, German Director,
Scientific Department, Africa, E. Merck Aktiengesellschast,
Karmstady, Germany, had advised the American Embassy,
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that he believed he had seen an
individual whom he thought to be Eric Starvo Galt at the
Bristol Hotel, Lagos Nigeria, on the afternoon of 4-23-68.
The individual was identified as Joe Musgaque, who is
reportedly an employee of the Wilder Oil Company (address
unknown).

Norman Pulin, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), advised
this date that a german doctor, Klaus Steer, German Director,
Scientific Department, Africa, E. Merck Aktiengesellschast,
Karmstady, Germany, had advised the American Embassy, Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, that he believed he had seen an individual whom he
thought to be Eric Starvo Galt at the Bristol Hotel, Lagos,
Nigeria, on the afternoon of 4/23/68. Because he thought the
individual looked like Galt he made an effort to get some
information concerning him. He found he was registered at the
hotel as Joe Musgaque, Room 403, receipt number D52138,
account number 08325. The doctor did not know if Musgaque had
registered at the hotel as an American. In conversation with
Musgaque the doctor learned that Musgaque was employed by the
Wilder Oil Company (adress unknown) and was en route to Warri
Oil Field, Nigeria.

Bufiles contain no references to Joe Musgaque or the
Wilder Oil Company.
Mr. Pulin, CIA, was advised that Bufiles contain no

At 6:35 pm 4/22/68, John Mapother, Clandestine Service,
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), furnished the following
information to Night Supervisor James F. McGuire by telephone:
CIA sources in Panama have reported two American citizens
are being detained in Panama City, Panama, at the request of the
Costa Rican authorities. Allegedly, they are being detained in
connection with the assassination of Martin Luther King. These
individuals are identified as Tom Wolman, born 7/17/44 in New York.
Wolman has Passport Number J085474, issued 1/29/68, and his
permanent residence is shown as 30 Larrys Lane, Pleasantville,
New York. The other individual is identified as Douglas Harry
Hulbard, Passport Number 330926. Hulbard is described as a former
soldier who has returned to Panama to be married. CIA did not
have any further descriptive data regarding Hulbard.
These two individuals were traveling in a Chevrolet,
License Number 23GH19, Motor Number 13 387 13 113711. The vehicle
and license plates could not be further described by CIA. According
to CIA, Wolman's passport indicates he had entered and departed
El Salvador and Honduras on 4/17/68; Nicaragua on 4/18/68.
Mr. Mapother advised he has no indication why the Costa
Rican authorities have requested the detention of the above-
described individuals. Further, he does not know of any factual
connection of these individuals with the King case. He said CIA
sources were trying to develop this matter further. He also
advised that CIA would send the FBI a written communication
concerning this matter on 4/23/68.
At 9:10 pm 4/22/68, Norman Poulin, CIA, orally advised
that a check had been made with the Costa Rican authorities and
determined that Costa Rica has no information regarding the above-
mentioned individuals; that Costa Rica did not request Panamanian
authorities to hold these individuals, that they have no request
from any American authorities to detain them; and that they have

furnished the following to the Liaison Agent on April 17, 1968:
A CIA source, characterized as being very reliable,
advised that on or about April 15, 1968, an individual identi-
fying himself as Gerald Lee Richards, a U. S. seaman, called
Lee!
at the Tokyo, Japan, office of the National Maritime Union and
asked to be signed on a ship as soon as possible. (It should
be noted that reference is being made to the office of the U.S.
National Maritime Union.) He was asked to furnish his local
address in Tokyo, and he refused to do so. He became very
agitated and then left. So far he has not returned to the
aforementioned office. CIA's source stated that Richards ·
answers, the general description of the suspect in the instant
case as reported in newspapers.

·Richards volunteered information indicating that
he applied for seaman's papers in San Pedro, California,
June 16, 1964, and that he registered as a member of the
National Maritime Union in San Pedro on February 21, 1968.
He has Social Security number 562-46-5078 and U. S. Coast
Guard identifying document Z2711-782. He was born April 8,
1937, in Missouri (town not given). CIA's source described
him as 5'10"; 155 pounds; brown hair, receding hairline on
both sides; a scar, not prominent, about two and one half
inches long across the center of his forehead. His most
outstanding characteristic was his grin, described as "dis-

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
_
One of the most promising leads developed so far is the laundry
tags appearing on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts apparently abandoned by
the subject with the rifle that is believed to be the murder weapon. It
has been determined that these laundry marks were made by a Thermo Seal
marking machine manufactured by the Textile Marking Machine Company,
Syracuse, New York. The manufacturer of this machine has advised that
the laundry marks in question are unusual in that they consist of five
characters whereas the usual code contains six characters.
WH
These markings are also unusual because the first two characters ✓
are in smaller type while the remaining three characters are in larger
☐ type. The normal arrangement is for the first three characters to be in
smaller type and for the following characters to be in larger type. The
Textile Marking Machine Company has stated only a limited number of
machines have been manufactured which print laundry marks in this
manner. Investigation is proceeding on an expedited basis to locate these
machines for the purpose of identifying the laundry marks.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
RE: MURKIN..
:
H
-
He has been a chronic letter writer to the Central Intelligence Agency
criticizing them and the Government. By letter of 12/29/67 Kramer
requested the Central Intelligence Agency to pay him $100,000 monthly
for six months for a paper on geopolitical economy he had previously
submitted. He concluded his letter with the statement, "In the event that
you fail to acknowledge my request, I can accept no responsibility for
any future efforts necessary to gain the combined ends of ideal
government and financial recompense.
The only record of Kramer found in Bureau files is a
memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency, 1/18/68, advising
us of his letters to the Central Intelligence Agency. No record can be
located in the Identification Division but Kramer's fingerprints are being
obtained from the Berkeley police.
_
A. C. Hayden, Intra-Division Information Unit of the Department,
advised on the evening of 4/8/68 that Beatrice Rosenberg, a secretary in
the Attorney General's office, had received a telephone call from a
man identifying himself as Frederick Dunstan who said he resided at
Route 350, Whitefield, North Carolina. Dunstan said he was calling the
Attorney General to report that a white man was in his house, was drunk,
had a gun and said he had killed Martin Luther King, Jr.
There is no Whitefield, North Carolina. There is a Whiteville,
North Carolina. Investigation by the Charlotte Division has failed to
locate a Route 350, Box 350, or Highway 350 in the Whiteville area and
no record of a Frederick Dunstan has been located. No record of Dunstan
could be found in Bureau files.
A pair of duckbill pliers was found among the personal effects
believed to have been abandoned by the subject. These pliers bear a
trademark of the Rompage Hardware Company, Los Angeles. Employees
at the hardware company believe this is one of twelve pliers purchased in
October, 1966. Employees have no recollection of the sale of these
pliers but an exhaustive search is being made of charge sale records.
"SE
It is noted that the rifle believed to be the murder weapon was
purchased in Birmingham, Alabama, 3/30/68. Binoculars found with the
rifle were purchased in Memphis, 4/4/68. A latent fingerprint found on
the rifle is identical with a latent fingerprint found on the binoculars. This
presents a strong probability that these fingerprints are those of the subject,

This is the matter involving the assassination
of Dr. Martin Luther King.
Liaison advised of the receipt of information
from Richard Helms, Director of CIA, that one Robert
X Kramer was a possible suspect. According to Information
furnished by Howard Osborn, Director of Security of
CIA, Kramer, who is a doctor, has been a source of
trouble to CIA for some time. Only recently Mr. Helms
received a very cryptic telegram from Kramer. In reviewing
Kramer's file, they noted a photograph which bears a
very strong resemblance to recent pictures of artist
drawings of the killer which have appeared in local papers.
The likeness was so striking that Mr. Helms thought it
should be brought to the attention of the FBI immediately.
ACTION:
Senior Resident Agent Jesse Hall, Alexandria,
Virginia, was telephonically contacted and instructed to
obtain full details from the files of CIA Headquarters
at Langley, Virginia, together with all background infor-
mation on Kramer, as well as a photograph, so that this
matter could be thoroughly checked out.

Dear Mr. Lesar:
21 JUN 1976
This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976
on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions
of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records
dealing with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray
and any of his alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr. King's
assassination.
I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in
further communication with you once the search has been completed
and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.
As you may know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Information
requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back-
logs. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated
by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject
to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee. It would seem
more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request
and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could
be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we
will assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.
For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule.
If the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you
with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance
of processing.
Sincerely,
/s/GFW

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established
for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be
granted..
You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's
request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,
respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-
prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,
this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized.
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King
about a waiver by her. In the meantime, I request that you proceed
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-
quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

We find that we are unable to respond to your request as it

of personal information from official records. In that light,
please be advised that we can proceed no further with your request
unless and until we are in receipt of notarized statements of re-
lease from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray, respectively.
These statements should be quito specific as to what areas of
personal information are and are not authorized for release by this
Agency to you and your client. If all information in our records
is releasable, that should be so stated; if only such information
as relates to specific incidents or to specific periods of time is
releasable, those caveats should be clearly stated.
Finally, we must ask that you provide a statement of willing-
ness to pay search and duplication fees as required by this request
and in line with the fee schedule enclosed. It has been estimated
that such charges could approach $1000. Along with the notarized
statements above, and the statement of willingness to pay all search
and copying charges (or those up to an established limit), we would
require a down payment of half the anticipated charges. Payment
should be made to this office in the form of a check or money order
payable to Treasurer of the United States.

Dear Mr. Wilson:
In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold
Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay search
and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are
required by his Freedom of Information Act request for records
pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination.
Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,
I enclose a check for $500.00:
This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in
connection with this request are tendered with the express reserva-
tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them.
C.I.A. regulations provide:
Records shall be furnished without charge
or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-
tor determines that waiver or reduction of
the charge is in the public interest because
furnishing the information can be considered
as primarily benefiting the general public.
The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the
charge whenever he determines that the inte-
rest of the government would be served there-
by. 32 C.F.R. $1900.25(a).
9 | 11 PM '76
In accordance with this regulation, I call upon you to
determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to
waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.
Weisberg's request. Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy
Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request
of the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter
for granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant
a waiver.
Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by
myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for a
waiver of the search and copying charges for these records.
If you
do wish supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would

OSI COMMENT: The CHARLES PARKER mentioned above is believed
to be the same individual as CHARLES LINCOLN PARKE, who
resigned a commission in the U.8. Naval Reserve because of
admitted pro-Russian sympathies. BOYKO's continual agitation,
past association with Communists, and apparent association
with PARKER, certainly places both individuals in a category
which is, at least, highly questionable.
4. Further inquiry concerning ESTHER M. ENCELEMSKI revealed she
recently divorced WILFORD BAVOY and reportedly returned to the Homer,
Alanks area.
OSI COMMENT : Liaison has been effected with another govern-
ment agency in the Ninelchik area in an effort to determine
the present whereabouts of SUBJECT.
5. The Alaskan Labor Defender, a monthly news publication, has
recently reappeared in the Fairbanks area with its first publication
dated May 1956. Previous editions of this newspaper appeared in the
Fairbanks area in early 1955, but it was discontinued after publica–
tion of two editions due to the refusal of a local printing firm to
print subsequent copies. Among editorials appearing in the Alaskan
Labor Defender are several articles condensed from the "MILITANT,"
publication of the Socialist Workers Party, which is cited by the
U. 8. Attorney General as subversive. One article quoted a speech
ade by a (tr) DU BOIS at a rally held at Carnegie Hall in New York on
29 March 1956 which relates, in referring to the Montgomery, Alabama
bus protest, * "Led by clear thinking, they (the Negros) have dis-
covered that the race problem was at bottom an economic problem.
Umrittingly they have discovered Earl Marx." * * * (In referring to
EARL MARX, they were probably referring to KARL MARX, co-author of
the Communist Manifesto)
Quoted below are portions of another article under the caption
"It's Time to Think" written by ERNEST ORIFFIN, Independent Candidate
from Fairbanks, Alaska, for the House of Representatives:
* *Today there seems to be little or no attention paid to the
xamples made by the founders of this now nation, the Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence, or the Negro people as citizens of
these United States."
* (In reference to the Constitution of
the United States) » " * "Although this Constitution ranks above
every other written Constitution for excellence of its scheme, its
simplicity, the precision of its language, and its judicious mixture
of definiteness in principle, it has become a neglected Constitution.”

OSI COMMENT: Although there is no evidence that this nove-
paper is associated with the Communist Party or its front
organisations, it is interesting to note that in many articles,
the paper has quoted publications or officials of organisa-
tions which have been cited by the U. 8. Attorney General as
either subversive or Communist infiltrated and controlled.
It is further interesting to note that MIKE COLLINTER, an
editor of this newspaper, and ROY BATISTE, owner of the Fair-
banks Recreation Center and Cafe, the only advertiser in
this edition are both listed as Category I, Alaskan Command
Surveillance List.

" *"But we can be destroyed when we lose faith or hope and when life
itself seems like a story told by a mad man, as it must seem to the
members and supporters of the White Citizens Council…………….
The Negro people of the South have been marking time, making
excuses and accepting conditions that exist in the South. Until a fow
brave man in Alabama turned what seemed to be a tragedy into an oppor-
tunity by having courage enough to challenge the Jim Crow laws.
Quoted below is a portion of an editorial under the caption "The Longest
Picket Line in the World", also appearing in the May 1956 publication of
the Alaskan Labor Defender:
'Every union local, every worker in office, factory or work-
shop, must make it a personal obligation to take action now! This is
no time for passing the buck! This is the time to collect it and send
it to the Montgomery Improvement Association, care of the Rev. M. L.
King, Dexter Ave. Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.
The above statement was issued by Farrell Dobbs, presidential
candidate of the Socialist Workers Party, and refers to the 50,000
Negros in Montgomery, Alabama who are in a struggle against Jim Crow
on the buses of that city.” *
• *”Actually the struggle goes deeper and wider than that. The
present wave of race terror and hatred in the South is being fanned by
the White Citisens Council. What is not generally known is that this
terror is directed against any white workers who dare to solidarize
with Negroes. The murderous White Citisens Council are not only rabidly
Jim Crow but Anti-Semitic and Anti-Labor. Their aim is to preserve
the system of color segregation and siscrimination as the foundation
upon which rests the open shop structure of the "Right to Work" South",
Also appearing in this issue is an article relating that the
Catholic Worker has protested the padlocking of the Daily Worker as a
violation of the freedom of the press.
An article appearing under the caption "Auto Workers Take Home Pay
Declines" reflects the "demand for a 30 hour weak at 40 hours pay" by
the UAW, Ford Local 600, and the AFL-C10. Another article under
caption "Employment Falling Off; Productivity is Increasing", quotes
JOHN CLARK, president of the International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, as stating that his union "Intends to do something"
about declining employment in the metals industry. Also set forth in
this issue of the Alaskan Labor Defender is the "platform" of DONALD
W. HOLTON, Independent Candidate for the Senate, ERNEST GRIFFIN, MIKE
DOLLINTER, and HIILO KAPONEN, Independent Candidates for the House of
Representatives. Two of the issues listed on the "platform" are "Stop

It's the first lie detector that
can be used on a dead
man. It works on tapes and
other voice recordings
by George O'Toole
Assassination Tapes
The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either
at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.
Plato: The Republic, Book Three
It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with
- a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological
Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect. a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs
no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.
It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph
record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on
• a dead man.
Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use
it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on
of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-
recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the
pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,
Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.
I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?
Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw-do they support the Commission's
lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?
Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?
Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not
all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.
The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function
it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool
for historical research. To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know some-
thing about the device itself.
I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of
its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both
former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form
a company called Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second
career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one
could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your
key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and
small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices
to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph
experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

During the lunch break I took Kradz aside

for that. Where there was no stress, I could
be confident that the speaker was telling
the truth. However, when I did find stress,
I had to be very careful about reaching con-
clusions about its cause; it could result from
something other than deception. But if I

I had despaired of ever learning the truth.
Now I knew what to do with the PSE..
It was all there: the statements made
before television cameras by eyewitnesses,
policemen, medical examiners, members
of the Warren Commission. Somewhere in
a network-television vault were the sound
tracks, with the tiny, inaudible variations in
voice frequency that could settle once and
for all the question, "Did Oswald, acting
alone, shoot and kill John F. Kennedy?"
My immediate problem was getting

Encouraged, I reviewed the list of recent

first to come to mind. The ITT affair was
also of recent interest. The Kent State inci-
dent had never been fully cleared up. But
one subject seemed to loom above all the
rest-the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Like many others, I have found it difficult
to believe the Warren Report. When Mark
Lane's book came out, I read it carefully.

television networks would have them, but
I wasn't sure exactly what to ask for. There
must be thousands of hours of sound
recordings relating to the assassination.
Where, among all this talk, was the critical
testimony?
I started digging and soon discovered
the existence of a group called the National
Committee to Investigate Assassinations,
located in Washington, D.C. I called the
number listed in the telephone directory
and was soon speaking to Bob Smith, the
Committee's Research Director. I told Smith
that I was a writer and wanted to do a piece
on the John F. Kennedy assassination. I
asked him for an interview, and he agreed.

. These included a private detective
in Pennsylvania, a New York chain
African country. The instructor was Mike
Kradz, a criminologist and retired police
officer. Kradz projects the tough-cop
image, but he is a living rebuttal to the Po-
lish joke. There is nothing about forensic
science, from fingerprints to polygraphy, on
which the man is not an expert.
The first morning of the course was
devoted to the physical operation of the
PSE. The device is used in conjunction with
a Uher tape recorder, which has four speeds
and can be manually wound back to locate
a particular point on the tape. The testimony
to be evaluated is recorded at a tape speed
of 7½ inches per second, them played back
and stopped at the beginning of the utter-
ance in question. The recorder is slowed
to 15:16 inches per second and piayed. The
sound, no longer recognizable as a human
voice, is a long, low rumble.
The PSE itself is built into an attaché case.
The case opens to reveal a chart drive, sim-
ilar to an electrocardiograph, and a number
of buttons and knobs. A single cable con-
nects the PSE to the tape recorder.
As the tape recorder reels slowly turn,
and a rumble issues from its speaker, the
PSE stylus dances back and forth across
the moving chart paper, leaving behind a
ragged trail. Then the recorder is stopped,
the chart paper is stopped, and that's all
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper
with a squiggly line. The rest is up to the
human eye and brain.
On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz
showed us what to look for. The unstressed
voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with
stalks of different heights sticking up (and
down) at irregular intervals. But add some
stress, and that hedge begins to look

smoother the shape. If the subject was
experiencing the hard stress which accom-
panies deception, the over-all outline of the
figure tends to take on a rectangular shape,
a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz
showed slide after slide of charts made dur-
ing actual police interrogations. He told us
the background of each case and pointed
out the tell-tale signs of deception, when-
ever they were present.
That night each student took a PSE back
to his room to practice operating it. Some
coordination must be learned to become
facile in handling the recorder and the PSE,
but clearly the difficult part of the course
would be learning how to read and interpret
the charts.

the PSE. There is, first of all, the matter of
the "outside issue."
Most people, Kradz pointed out, have
some sort of deep secret they don't want
known. When faced with a polygraph exami-
nation, a person may be more concemed
that this outside issue may come to light
than he is about the actual substance of
the interrogation. This can produce irrele-
vant stress in some of his answers, and mis-
lead the examiner. Therefore it is is neces-
sary for the examiner to interview the sub-
ject before the examination, go over all of
the questions he intends to ask, and assure
the subject he will ask only these questions.
I had reason to remember this later, when
I ran my first real interrogation tape.
The interrogation always includes the
question, "Are you afraid that I will ask you
about something we have not discussed?"
A negative answer with no sign of stress
eliminates the outside-issue problem. Also,
the examiner always asks some innocuous
questions, such as, "Do you like the color
blue?" in order to observe the subject's
general state of tension. And there is always
one "red-herring" question.
The red herring is used to identify the
"guilt complex responder." Such a person
shows stress when he responds to any
accusatory question. The examiner may
ask, "Did you steal the watch?" when it is
money, not a watch, that is missing. A
stressed denial will alert the examiner, who
carefully compares this response to the
stress produced by questions about the
missing money.
That night the class was given tapes of
real police interrogations. In most cases,
Kradz was the examiner, and in every case,
he knew the background and resolution of
the matter. One case I was assigned cor-
cerned a young man accused of stealing
money from his father's store. Kradz started
by asking the "outside-issue” question. No,
the young man replied, he was not afraid
Kradz would ask him a question they hadn't
discussed. Then the following exchange
⚫ took place:
"Do you live in Howard County?"
"Yes."
"Do you suspect someone of having taken
the money?"
"No."
"Are you wearing a white shirt?"
"Yes."
"Do you know who took the money?"
"No."
"
“Are you wearing a ring?”
"Yes."
"
"Did you take the money?"
"No."
"
There were a few red-herring questions
to check for the guilt complex response.
The questions about wearing a white shirt
and a ring and living in Howard County had
been included to measure the background
stress elicited by irrelevant issues.
I ran the tape and charted it on the PSE.

valid evidence linking Shaw to the assassi-

tion of prosecutors, invented the rest of his
case. But Shaw's stress could easily be the
resuit of his predicament, and Garrison's
might also be the result of some outside
issue. The situation was ambiguous.
I ran the testimony of Lee Odom. Odom,
a Dallas businessman, was attempting to
explain the mysterious coincidence of the
post office box numbers. It seems that the
Dalias post office box number 11906
appeared in the notebooks of both Clay
Shaw and Lee Harvey Oswald. In his tes-

he had given it to Shaw, whom he'd met
by chance on a business trip to New
Orleans. The PSE showed hard stress dur-
ing his statement. No unrelated control
statement was available for me to run for
comparison.
This didn't really clear things up. There

unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom
may have felt extremely uncomfortable
about linking himself to this man in any way.
The coincidence of the box numbers
seemed very suspicious, but Bob Smith of
the Committee had pointed out to me that
both Shaw's and Oswald's notebooks were
filled with numbers, so the chance of such
a coincidence was not that remote.
At this point I began to wonder if the tele-
vision camera was the "outside issue" in
every case. Perhaps just being on television
will so thoroughly rattle the average person
that, lying or not, he is going to show stress
on the PSE. I checked this out by recording
and charting a number of people on tele-
vision programs-public officials, men in
the street, even witnesses to a particularly
gruesome accident. There was occasional
stress. but it never reached the high level
I was finding in the assassination tapes.
I also recalled something else which put
my mind to rest on this point: the PSE had
been used to analyze the statements of con-
and-so" with an accuracy of better than 94
percent. The problem obviously was not the
television camera.
I ran the testimony of William Gurvich on
the PSE. Gurvich had been Garrison's chief
aide in the investigation of Clay Shaw until
he resigned, charging Garrison with wrong-
doing. He said. "The truth as I see it is that
Mr. Shaw should never have been arrested."
He was asked if Garrison had known of cer-
tain illegal and unethical methods Gurvich
had alleged were being used by Garrison's
staff. He answered, “Yeah, of course he did.
He ordered it." There was no stress in Mr.
Gurvich's statements. The PSE showed that
he believed what he was saying.
Obviously I did not have enough tes-
timony from a large enough number of wit-
nesses to create a detailed picture of the
Garrison-Shaw affair, but it seems probable.
that, at the very least. Garrison did not have
much of a case against Shaw (a view later
held by a New Orleans jury) and likely that
Shaw was completely innocent of complic-
ity in the assassination. The lesson of this
episode is twofold. First, stress in any one
person's testimony does not prove decep-
tion. Second, given enough testimony by
different witnesses, the PSE can arrive at
the truth.
The first person I ran on the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination
was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu-
nately, only one of her statements was on
the CBS tapes-that Oswald had owned a
rifle. The PSE said she was telling the truth.
The rifle had been one of the major points
of controversy raised by critics of the War-
ren Report. The debate centered on two
points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the
Texas School Book Depository, and whether
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon.
On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson, an
employee of Parkland Hospital, testified
that he had found a rifle bullet on a stretcher
which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. There was no stress in his state-
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth.
Dr. Joseph D. Nicol, Superintendent of
the Bureau of Criminal Investigation for the
State of litinois. ran ballistic tests on bullet
fragments found in the presidential limou-
sine, and on the intact bullet found by Tom-
linson. Nicol testified that both the intact
bullet and the bullet fragments had been
fired by the: Mannlicher-Carcano. He. too.
was apparently telling the truth.
Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman of
the Dallas police claimed that he found
Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano on the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository.
However, on the day of the assassination,
he had told the press that the rifle he'd found
was a German Mauser. The following day
the signed an affidavit to that effect. But on
the CBS tapes he testified that he had been
mistaken about that point, that it had really

stress, which accompanies real deception
is not always present.
I obtained a tape recording from CBS
News of a portion of a Sixty Minutes program
in which Mike Wallace interviewed Clifford
Irving. The interview took place during the
height of the controversy, while Irving was
still claiming to have gotten Howard
Hughes' life story through a series of inter-
views with the billionaire. It was a consum-
mate job of lying, embellished with such
convincing details as Irving's disagreement
with his colleague Susskind about whether
Hughes kept his organic prunes in a paper
or a plastic bag. Sixty Minutes re-ran the
segment after Irving's confession because
the man's sheer virtuosity as a prevaricator
was amazing. I was interested in the inter-
view for a different reason: at the height
of the controversy, Irving had been given
a polygraph examination and had passed
it. I wanted to see if the man who had beaten
the conventional lie detector could also
beat the PSE.
I selected a point in the interview at which
Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had not
interviewed Howard Hughes, but had hap-
pened on some transcripts of Hughes' state-
ments. Irving asked how he could have hap-
pened on them. Wallace rejoined, "Where
did you happen on those transcripts?" Irv-
ing replied. "I got the transcripts from
Howard Hughes." I charted this statement
on the PSE.
It was a perfect example of total stress,
horizontally blocked, with the smooth,
"trimmed-hedge" wave form. Clifford Irving
was a master liar, and he had beaten the
polygraph, but he would have been caught
by the PSE.
A few days after our first meeting, 1
received a call from Bob Smith. He had
turned up a few things for me. I visited him
at the Committee's office in downtown
Washington. He gave me a tape recording
and a typewritten transcript. The recording
was the Louis Lomax television program of
Sunday, October 16, 1966. Wesley Liebler,
a member of the Warren Commission's staff,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS
News television program entitled The War-
ren Report, which had been broadcast in
four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27
and 28, 1967.
I examined the transcript. The programs
had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and
other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every
major point of controversy that had been
raised by the critics of the Warren Report,
interviewing eyewitnesses. Dallas police-
men, medical examiners. ballistic special-
ists and many others who had some inside
knowledge of the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. For what I had in mind, it was
a gold mine. I telephoned CBS and learned
that I could get a copy of the program's
I
Next I played the Lomax-Liebler tape.
Apparently Mark Lane had been on an
earlier Lomax program, and now Liebler
was on to rebut him. I didn't need the PSE
to know that Liebler was stressed. He
seemed very agitated, and his breathing
audibly indicated his tension. He was angry
about the things Lane had said, the ques-
tions Lomax was asking him, and the reac-
tion of the studio audience. Given his highly
emotional state, he did not seem a very
promising subject for the PSE. Nonetheless,
decided to give it a try.
Charting a tape with the PSE is a long
and tedious process. and it was impractical
to chart the entire program. I ran some of
Liebler's statements which were not in dis-
pute and discovered, as I had expected.
a great deal of stress. He was pretty
charged up.
Most of the exchange between Liebler;
Lomax and the audience was argumenta-
tive and did not deal with specific factual
points. I found two key statements by Lieb-
ler, though, and I charted them.
The first statement, in response to a ques-
tion by Lomax, was. "I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Report.'
Plenty of stress was evident, but not much
more than in other statements.
The second statement related to those
Warren Commission documents which were
not included in the Report-they were
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which would alter Liebler's
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-
ments and, if they would alter his opinion,
they would already have done so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the documents
would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant, he answered quickly,
"Oh, none, none at all." The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of
Liebler's other statements.
it
It was all pretty confused and fuzzy, and
didn't tell me more than I'd already known:
Wesley Liebler was pretty upset when he
appeared on the Louis Lomax program. I
hoped that the CBS tapes would yield more
enlightening results.
I finally received a call from CBS's
Washington office saying the tapes had
arrived. I broke a few traffic laws getting
there to pick up the tapes and returning
to my apartment. I had already selected the
points I wanted to check from the transcript
of the program. I mounted the first tape on
the recorder, ran it down to the first point
of interest. and turned on the PSE.
For the next three days and nights, I ran
charts. When I finished. I had a splitting
headache, my kitchen floor was ankle deep
in chart paper, but I had a much clearer
idea of what did and did not happen that

lously high-70 percent. In other words, we
are assuming that 70 percent of the times
the PSE finds stress in testimony, it results
from something other than lying.
Now, let's ignore the deception indicated
in the testimony of the eyewitnesses; even
if present, it might have resulted from mere
desire for attention. That leaves eight "in-
siders" who have demonstrated stress when
Commission found evidence of a conspir-
acy but didn't believe it, so they covered
it up in order to present a tidy package to
the public. Later, at least one member of

ton nothing worse than blundering.
I could say all this with certainty if I knew
that stress always equals deception. Unfor-
tunately, I do not know that. But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fresh
doubt regarding the Warren. Report. This
doubt rises not only from specific points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,
government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every case, of an out-
side issue?
iner, Captain Humes; Commission staffer
Wesley Liebler, Commission member John
McCloy; former Chief Justice Earl Warren.
Assuming that there is a 70 percent
chance that any single instance of stress
is "outside issue," what is the probability
that all eight instances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bility theory tells us that it is seven-tenths
raised to the eighth power, or approximately
6 percent.
In other words, even making some fairly
conservative assumptions, there is a 94 per-
cent chance that at least one of these eight
men is lying.
My own personal opinion? I don't know.
I remember the young man with the ring.
He said he was wearing it, and he was,
but he stressed. He stressed not because
he was lying, but because there was some-
thing about that ring that really bothered
him, something he didn't want the world to
know. Perhaps that is also true of these men
who, in one way or another, leamed some
part of the truth about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.
-
I suppose I'm not absolutely sure even
of that. When I first met Bob Smith of the
Committee, I asked him if there was any
one thing the government could do to clear
up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one
thing that would help more than anything
else would be to make available the physi-
cal evidence _ the detailed FBI lab re-
ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs,
the microscopic slides, the bloodstained
clothing, yes, even the President's brain,
wherever it has been hidden. These things,
he said, would go far toward answering the
questions about what actually happened
that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even
confirm the Warren Report.
So when I say I'm not absolutely certain
these men are concealing something, I
mean I can think of something that could
conceivably change my mind. That is, if the
government would open all its files on this
matter to us and prove that we are wrong
_ we, the people who ten years later still
believe we haven't yet heard the full account
of the events of November 22, 1963.

The PSE said he was telling the truth.
John McCloy. a member of the Warren
Commission, said much the same thing.
and added that he had seen no credible
evidence to contradict the findings of the
Commission. The PSE backed him up on
this. but it failed to do so when, speaking
of the Warren Report, he said, "There was
nothing fraudulent about it." Here the PSE
showed hard stress.
If Specter and McCloy were as confident
as the PSE shows them to be in the truthful-
ness of the Warren Report. What could be
fraudulent about it? Perhaps the snipping
off of a few loose ends, the suppression
of a few pieces of inconvenient evidence
which conflicted with a version of events
they believed to be essentially true.
The one man who could be expected to
have the most informed opinion regarding
the work of the Warren Commission is
former Chief Justice Earl Warren himself.
He had declined to be interviewed on the
CBS program in 1967, but he did appear
on television in May, 1972, in an interview
"... we found no evidence
of any kind that there was
any conspiracy."
There was very hard stress
on "no evidence"
which was part of a series called The Bran-
deis Television Recollections. Bob Smith of
the Committee provided me with the tape.
The interview was an hour long, but the
Kennedy assassination and the Warren
Commission came up only once. The inter-
viewer, Abram Sachar, Chancellor of Bran-
deis University, was friendly and deferen-
tial. I charted some of Warren's remarks
unrelated to the assassination and found
that he was generally unstressed. Sachar
raised the subject of the Commission
obliquely, and Warren volunteered several
rather lengthy statements about it
Warren said that immediately after the as-
sassination there were two theories, one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
killing, the other that a group of right-wing
Texas oilmen were responsible. He said:
"We explored both of those theories for
ten months and found no evidence that
either of them was involved in it."
The PSE showed hard stress.
He continued:
41
have discovered any evidence of any kind
that we didn't discover and use in determin-
ing the case as we did."
Hard stress once again. The word "never”
was a perfectly "trimmed hedge."
"I have found nothing since that time.”
he continued, "to change my view, nor have
I heard of anything that has changed the
view of any member of the commission
since that time."
The stress was hard. As I had now come
to expect, the word "nothing" seemed a
particularly beautiful example of stress.
Another word seemed to show even more
stress: "member." Could he have been
thinking of someone in particular? On Janu-
ary 19, 1970, Senator Richard B. Russell,
a member of the Warren Commission, re-
vealed that he had never believed that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone.
I had charted the last of the assassination
tapes. Of course, these few thousand feet
of recording tape are only a small fraction
of the relevant testimony recorded and
stored away in the archives of television
news departments. There is, for example,
Lee Harvey Oswald, as he was led through
the Dallas police station, denying that he
had killed the President. There are state-
ments by Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby and
by others.
I have no doubt that with these tapes,
a Psychological Stress Evaluator, and time
to work on them, a very detailed picture
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy
could be reconstructed, a picture that might
even reveal the identities of the assassins
and their co-conspirators. I hope that sooner
or later someone does this. I have gone as
far as the private resources of a free-lance
writer permit.
What, given the sample of testimony I
have processed with the PSE, can I say
about the assassination?
We should first examine the testimony in
which no stress was found, since it is almost
certain that these people were telling the
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the following:
1. Oswald owned a rifle.
2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found
on Governor Connally's stretcher at Park-
land Hospital.
3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine also
came from Oswald's rifle.
4. At least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equally certain no shots came.
from that direction.
5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt.
6. At least one member of the Warren
Commission and one member of the Com-
….. we found no evidence of any kind mission's staff really believe in the validity
that there was any conspiracy."
Again there was stress, and particularly
hard stress on the words "no evidence."
"I have read everything." said Justice
Warren, "that has come to my notice in the
of the Warren Report.
7. Jim Garrison had little or no case
against Clay Shaw.
Almost all of this tends to support, in one
way or another, the Warren Report. But now

e alleged that Tippitt and Oswald were
in together in Jack Ruby's nightclub.

The Dallas police radio dispatcher,
cer Murray Jackson, was asked if he
ught Tippitt knew Oswald. "No." he
lied, "I don't think he knew Oswald." Did
kson know Oswald? "No." answered
kson, "I didn't either." The PSE showed
vy stress in both statements.
erhaps the greatest source of con-
ersy over the Warren Report is it's claim
: all the shots were fired by one gunman.
ne eyewitnesses claim to have heard
ts and seen gunsmoke in the area of

ne to be known as "the grassy knoll."
e of these witnesses was a railroad
ker named S.M. Holland, who observed
PENTHOUSE
The PSE confirmed that he thought he had
seen a puff of smoke on the knoll, but it
could not support his claim that he had
heard a shot from that direction.
Another witness, Charles Brehm, was
quoted by Mark Lane as having said that
he had seen a portion of the President's
skull flying back over the left rear end of
the limousine. Lane offered this as evidence
of a shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS
tapes. Brehm stated heatedly that he had
been quoted out of context, and emphatic-
ally denied that any shots had come from
the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there
was almost no stress in this statement.
Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the limousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.
Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther,
Arnold Rowland and Howard Brennan,
claimed to have seen gunmen in the win-
dows of the Texas School Book Depository
building. Mrs. Walther said she saw two
men, one armed with a rifle, the second
Chief Justice Warren:
"We explored both these
theories and found
no evidence that
either group was involved"
with a shorter gun. Rowland told the Warren
Commission he had seen two men, one an
elderly Negro, in the window Oswald is
alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS
tapes he claimed he had seen an armed
man at a different window. The Commission
relied heavily on the testimony of Brennan,
who claimed to have seen a gunman in the
"Oswald window" actually firing the last of
the shots. The PSE showed hard stress in
the testimony of all three witnesses.
The PSE analysis of the eyewitnesses'
testimony regarding the source of the shots
is ambiguous. It supports Holland's claim
to have seen a puff of smoke on the knoll,
and Brehm's denial that any shots came
from that direction, and it raises serious
doubts about all other claims and counter-
claims. This contradiction seems to result
from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-
nesses, perhaps compounded by a fair
amount of fabrication. Deception, if it is
present here, may have been motivated
merely by a desire for attention. Or there
may have been darker reasons.
There is, however, other evidence and
testimony that could shed some light on the
existence, number and location of assas-
sins other than Oswald. This brings us to
perhaps the most dubious and controversial
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event-the autopsy.
-
nedy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
colm Perry tried to save his life. The physi-
cian saw that the President had suffered
a massive head wound and a smaller wound
in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos
tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attempt to open a breathing passage.
Afterward, when hope for the President had
been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and declared that the wound in the front
of the neck had been an entry wound.
The President's body was flown to
Washington, D.C. There, approximately
eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy
was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Because of the tracheostomy, the nature of
the neck wound could no longer be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the
Bethesda pathologists concluded that it
was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,
one low in the rear scalp and one at the
right base of the neck; and two exit wounds,
the throat wound and a large irregular
wound on the right side of the head.
The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy
reported that a wound had been found in
the President's back, and that no corre-
sponding exit wound had been located.
Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed
to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders,
not at the base of the neck. What became
of the bullet? The agents reported that
Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempted external heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Governor Connally.
X-rays and color photographs of the au-
topsy were made. The brain was removed
from the body. Brain and skin tissue slides
were prepared for microscopic examina-
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
never asked to see any of this evidence,
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes, one of the
pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance
of the brain, the slides, and some of the
photographs, which were alleged to have
been turned over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he'd seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seemed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, talking in-
stead about the difficulty of making such
a determination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's life. Then the interviewer asked him
directly whether he had thought at the time
that it was an entry wound. "Actually, I didn't
really give it much thought,” he replied. He

Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,
Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973
The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to
have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D. C.
(at 1520 16th Street, N. W.). In the four years of its existence the
Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing
house for the study of assassinations. It maintains contact with
other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be
at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area.
2. In addition to research, the Committee acts to help
individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus
files suits for private persons demanding access to classified
information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles
relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of
movies. It publishes a newsletter.
3.
The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of
its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University
was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee
free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee
will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a
repository and research center.
4. The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay
of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation
of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a
tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an
attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After
deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press
✅representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150,
if that many.

5. Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a
sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that
morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on the case
of Martin Luther King was white.
6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The
chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another
speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned
out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert
Forman and someone whose name sounded like "Ed Kirkley".
7. The chairman announced that all the speeches would be
tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the
audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these,
"Burn", was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement
would be shown at local movie theaters, The latter were connected
with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the President's murder
was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the
organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their
attention upon the Oswald case.
8. The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every
speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of
November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman
Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular
attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.
9. A table at the back of the audience presented recommended
literature. The books included H. Weissberg's Whitewash and
Peter Noyes' Legacy of Doubt. For some reason there was a copy
of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's "Assassination Tapes".
There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword
to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the
Committee.

A publication circulated during the conference was the
November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to
be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People.
The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which
concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of
a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man
in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted
to the profession of data processing and the use of computers.
The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in
Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an
abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate
published in the past year.
11.
:
Another organization which received publicity at the
Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the
Intelligence Community (CARIC).
12. A representative of Computers and Automation handed out
this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took
notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said
during the proceedings.
13. The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again
during the morning session. The absence of current may have
affected the tape recording.
14. The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after
1:30 p. m.
By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch,
and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a
later hour.
15. No document of any kind was issued to the persons who
paid $15.00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name
of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings
that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently
not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were
taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No
information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

23.
Although the National Archives are the repository for the
Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the CIA are
responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet
of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has
released 3,000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of
the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom
of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on
other matters. Some material was not even turned over to the
Warren Commission. The FBI and the Justice Department are alone
in knowing the results of some tests.
24. In the non-governmental area, much has been published,
and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.
25. Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson. Mr. Hanson has become
the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer
and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which
he says he has lost, he should have remained an engineer instead of
becoming an attorney.)
Mr. Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless.
The trial was based on a 100 per cent belief in Sirhan's guilt.
Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention
was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that
Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed
the crime. But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill
Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's
case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and
funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on
the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was
acting under hypnotic influence.
26. Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the
Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent,
and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for
wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The
persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray
case investigation. No private agency only a government agency
can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts
honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today,
we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers
who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open
·hearing.

27.
Speech by Ronald Van Doren. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a
follower of Governor Wallace. He began by commenting on the sad
situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make
conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is
no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the
political situation at the time of his action. Wallace was by far the
leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates,
and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to
both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in
the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced
the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the
two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President.
History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred.
28. The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly
dropped. No proper investigation was conducted. As usual in
assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was
acting alone and was deranged. Read as a piece of literature, the
diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell.
There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if
one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different
person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage
to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was
he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment
he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford
to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he
involved?
29. All this should be looked into. Watergate brought the
electoral campaign to the fore. Why has discussion of the Bremer
shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer was a part
of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of
Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back.
30.
Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode. Ms. Rode was very brief.
She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell
in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively.
The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice.
No funds are available for defense.

16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the
most striking presentation during the Friday morning session.
Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.
17. Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as
powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The
obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not
found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable
question.
1. 18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the
world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as
amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has
been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has
thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has
brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations
which bring no wide response.
19.
A nation which rejects its own history is on the path to a
totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to
change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore
rely upon hypothesis. The history of the last ten years has been
made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. They range
from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any
particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are
engaging in a world conspiracy.
20.
The present conference must help us to learn whether
there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these
questions.
21. Speech by Robert P. Smith. Mr. Smith was described as
the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one
of the major motive forces in this organization.
22.
Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years
studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but
nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in
the last nine years.

The headlines in American newspapers have for years told of Army
reillance of civilians, U.S. spy planes being shot down over other
caies, attempted coups and intrigue initiated by the CIA and
prestrained FBI wiretapping. We all know that Big Brother is
watching, but no one in our government has taken the time to explain
he is being spiel upon, and why we are being watched. Too often, we
American citizens don't even know who Big Brother is.
In 1955, President Eisenhower accepted the report of the Hoover
Consmission en U.S. Intelligence. Among other recommendations, the
Commission emphasized the need for two "watchdog" committees on
Welligence within the executive and lcg:slative branches of
overnment. Although a Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (FIAB)
As stablished to serve the President, Congress by an overwhelming
maurity has refused to establish a committee within the legislative
anch. Now, in the midst of the Watergate scandals, there is some
nevement within Congress to establish committees on the separate
Stelligence agencies. The result will be divided oversight with no
gomance that Congress will be able to stop illegal and unjustified
pring. With Congress abrogating its responsibilities, there is no agency
1 government, directly responsible to the public, monitoring the
Jucted States Intelligence Community.
Now former intelligence workers and concerned citizens have
ormed a national association to provide the vital information an aware
ublic needs to know about government operations. The Committee for
tion/Research on the Intelligence Comniunity (CARIC) is an
✓ pendent "watchdog" on the government spy apparatus. CARIC,
ponsored entirely by donations from American citizens, serves as an
Hernative source of analysis and information on the practices,.
*ganization and objectives of U.S. Intelligence. What clandestine
perations are being carried out in the name of America? Is the CIA
reparing to entangle us in another war similar to the Indochina War?
Phat information is going into Federal, State, local and private data
waks on innocent American citizens? Is the FBI becoming a "sccret
elle force?" Whose phones are tapped in America? These are some of
tucstions CARIC is answering.
CARIC knows that all conscientious Americans are closely watching
Hevents that have unfolded since the arrests made at the Watergate
corkling. We share the hope of most Americans that the illegal
pinnage practices that have now been expose will no longer be a part
American political life. However, the dismantling of one espionage
at loyal to one group of politicians does not insure that this abuse
hatever will not be repeated by future politicians.
Who knows what future political espionage will occur under the
guise of so-called "national security" or loyalty to an administration?
Only time will tell, but through diligence and your help CARIC will
anticipate and bring to your attention situations within the government
that are likely to produce a new "Watergate."
Although CARIC does believe that a massive government spy
apparatus is at work in the world, we hope to dispel some of the
paranoia citizens naturally feel when there is talk of spics and wiretaps.
We know that the FBI does not have agents behind every tree, but there
are agents in every major community in this country who have spied on
innocent private and public citizens. Only a full and undisguised look
into this hidden world can displace unwarranted fears, and guide the
public effort to end this illegal and unjustified espionage. The secrecy
with which the government surrounds itself must end.
CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from all
walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end
to the government's war in Indochina - a war that has taken new forms
under the direction of U.S. Intelligence agencies. CARIC hopes that
these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of
our government which bring this new form of covert war and the
Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to
mobilize to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Please join us in
our effort.
THE COMMITTEE FOR ACTION/RESEARCH
ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (CARIC)
INTELLIGENCE
REPORT
• CARIC ORGANIZATION
CARIC is organized to reflect the operating procedures of a typical
intelligence organization. Our research process involves collecting
information from a wide variety of sources both public and private. Our
analysis is the collective product of CARIC participants and eliminates
any compartmentalization of knowledge. The information and our
analysis is then disseminated through CARIC publications and separate
works by CARIC participants. In addition, CARIC provides information
o'other journalists and qualified researchers.
● INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTATION CENTER (IDC)
CARIC is continuously collecting information on intelligence from a
variety of sources including official government oublications and
documents, previous investigations, public account; and interviews
conducted with hundreds of former intelligence and police agor ts. Tho
information forms the data-base of the Intelligence Documentation
Center maintained by CARIC. The IDC is a library of information on
U.S. Intelligence available upon request to journalists, qualified
researchers and members of CARIC.
• SPEAKERS BUREAU AND WORKSHƆPS
CARIC maintains a listing of members available to speak before
groups on a variety of subjects ranging from the foreign intelligence
programs of our government to the problems of criminal justice in this
country. Our speakers include former intelligence workers, police
agents and informers and others familiar with American intelligence.
CARIC will periodically conduct workshops for church, falior,
school or community organizations. Workshop topics inclure:
OPERATION PHOENIX – CIA assassination in Vietnan·
-
• SALEM HOUSE - Preparation for the coup in Cambodia
• The CIA in Laos
.
• OPERATION BOULDER - An introduction to the next American
war
Right-wing terrorism in America
Federal Planning for civil disturbances: Riots and demonstrations
• The Internal Security apparatus and Watergate
• MULTI-MEDIA BRIEFING
CARIC will soon augment our workshops with a multi-media
briefing on U.S. intelligence featuring films, video tapes, disp ays and
recorded interviews. The exhibit will dramatically illustrate Intelligence
as practiced by our government. Our hope is to creat a super-conscious
realization by our audience of the concepts presented in the display.
The first element of the multi-media briefing is a slide show tracing
the growth of the internal security apparatus of our governn ent and
demonstrating how this apparatus influenced the Watergate scandals.
The slide show terminates with suggestions for limiting fature growth
of the internal security apparatus.

THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:
THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS
TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
by
Richard E. Sprague
Hartsdale, New York
Part 1. Introduction
Who Assassinated President Kennedy?
On November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, President
John F. Kennedy, while riding in an open limousine
through Dealey Plaza and waving to the surrounding
crowds, was shot to death. Lee Harvey Oswald, an
ex-Marine, and former visitor to the Soviet Union.
was arrested that afternoon in a movie theatre in
another section of Dallas; that night he was charged
with shooting President Kennedy from the sixth floor
easternmost window of the Texas School Book Deposi-
tory Building overlooking Dealey Plaza. This act
Oswald denied steadily through two days of question-
ing (no record of questions and answers was ever
preserved). Two days later while Oswald was being
transferred from one jail to another, he was shot
by Jack Ruby, a Dallas night-club owner, in the
basement of the Dallas police station, while mil-
lions of Americans watched on television. The com-
mission of investigation, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, and headed by Chief Justice Earl
Warren of the U. S. Supreme Court, published its
report in September 1964, and concluded that Oswald
was the sole assassin and that there was no conspir-
acy.
In view of the authority of the Warren Commis-
sion, that conclusion was accepted by many Americans
for a long time. But the conclusion cannot be con-
sidered true by any person who carefully considers.
the crucial evidence - such as the physics of the
shooting, the timing of a number of events, and
other important and undeniable facts. In other
words, Oswald was not the sole assassin, and there
was a conspiracy.
· This article will develop that thesis, prove it
to be true on the basis of substantial, conclusive
evidence, and in particular some analysis of the
photographic evidence.
There was in fact a conspiracy.
Oswald played
a role in the conspiracy, although there is con-
clusive evidence that on November 22, 1963, he did
no shooting at President Kennedy, and that, just
as he claimed when he was in the Dallas jail. he
was a "patsy." At least three gunmen (and proba-
bly four) - none of whom were in the sixth floor
easternmost window of the Texas School Book Depos-
itory building where the Warren Commission placed
Oswald - fired a total of six shots at President
Kennedy.
One of these shots missed entirely; one hit
Governor John B. Connally, Jr. of Texas, riding
with Kennedy; and four hit President Kennedy, one
in his throat, one in his back, and two in his
head. (The bulk of the undeniable evidence for
these statements about the shots consists of:
(a) the physics of the motions of Kennedy and Con-
nally shown in some 60 frames of the famous film
by Abraham Zapruder; (b) the locations of the in-
juries in Kennedy and in Connally; and (c) more
than 100 pictures, consisting of more than 30
still photographs and more than 70 frames of mo-
vies.)
More than 50 persons were involved in the con-
spiracy at the time of firing the shots. These
persons included members of the Dallas police force
(but not all of the Dallas police and that ac-

THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH
The magazine Computers and Automation has for more
than three years followed an unusual publication policy:
-
The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro-
cessing, for the benefit of people,
and an unusual belief:
-
That computers are too important to be left to
computer experts and must be integrated into a
socially responsible profession of information
engineering.
Where this policy has operated most is in publishing
information, articles, and reports on subjects which a
great many liberal and progressive newspapers and peri-
odicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:
-
-
The political conspiracies which have led to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena-
tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and
others - and their coverups
· The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection
with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator-
ship by the Saigon regime
- The connections of President Richard M. Nixon
with organized crime and the Mafia
-
The Watergate crimes
If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting
on the most important topics for the welfare of the
people of the United States today, we urge you to sub-
scribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost
every one is in print). Please help us pursue the important
truth and report on it, by buying our products.
Edmund C.Berkeley
Edmund C. Berkeley, Editor
Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical ...
Computers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-
puters and data processing, believes that the pro-
fession of information engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in a professional and engineering sense, for:
-
The reliability and social significance of
pertinent input data;
The social value and truth of the output
results.
In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.
Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information
related to socially useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
-
but productive of thought and an improved and
safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.
The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-
sion, and many more.

REASONS TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FIELD OF
COMMON SENSE, WISDOM, AND GENERAL SCIENCE
COMPUTERS are important
-
But the computer field is over 25 years old. Here is a new
field where you can get in on the ground floor to make
your mark.
MATHEMATICS is important
-
But this field is more important than mathematics, because
common sense, wisdom, and general science have more
applications.
WISDOM is important
-
This field can be reasonably called "the engineering of
wisdom".
COMMON SENSE is important
-
This field includes the systematic study and development of
common sense.
SCIENCE is important
-
This field includes what is common to all the sciences, what
is generally true and important in the sciences.
MISTAKES are costly and to be AVOIDED -
This field includes the systematic study of the prevention of
mistakes.
MONEY is important
The systematic prevention of mistakes in your organization
might save 10 to 20% of its expenses per year.
OPPORTUNITY is important
-
If you enter or renew your subscription to both Computers
and Automation and the Notebook on Common Sense at

The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers
Proposition: Computers are making long strides towards
understanding natural language as used by human
beings, and will eventually understand such language
as well as many human beings do.
What do we mean by: computers? understanding lan-
guage? natural language? And what is the evidence for this
proposition?
The word "computers" here refers to powerful comput-
ers that have appropriate programs written by human be-
ings plus the programmed capacity to improve their pro-
grams by using experience. An example of such improve-
ment is Dr. A. L. Samuels' famous checker-playing pro-
gram, which can learn from experience, and which plays
far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play.
The experience may consist of the following at least:
Answers from human beings to questions posed by
the computer;
Differences between computed results and a priori
specified results;
Signals from the environment, such as instrument
readings;
Information obtained by “looks" at the environment,
as for example recognition of the character A, as
in optical character recognition;
The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN ex-
pressions.
Probably there are even more categories of experience
which a powerful computer program can use to modify it-
self to become even a better program.
In regard to "understanding language”, there are over
500 languages which computers have been programmed to
understand, when written precisely according to stated
rules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many
kinds of machine language, etc.
"Natural language" is the ordinary language used by hu-
man beings, subject to the requirement that for a computer
implicit understandings must be stated. For example, when
a speaker exclaims "Ouch!", a great deal of the meaning
comes from the listener's observations of the speaker. But
a computer, like a blind man, cannot “see” the situation,
and must be told more than the ordinary, listener.
With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evi-
dence for the main proposition stated above. This evidence
includes the information published in several recent ar-
ticles in Computers and Automation.
-
The article "Do What I Mean' The Programmer's As-
sistant", by Warren Teitelman, in the April 1972 issue,
described a "programmer's assistant", called "DWIM"; this
was a “front end” or preprocessor to an interactive pro-
gram for operating with LISP expressions. The front end
was tolerant of the programmer's mistakes in typing, in low-
mistake occurred, it would inquire of the human program-
mer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alter-
native, and so on. In this way the human programmer was
relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself ex-
actly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in
using the LISP interactive program greatly increased.
The three articles "Computer Programming Using Natu-
ral Language” by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and
Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues,
demonstrated the understanding by a computer program
called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordi-
nary natural language. The vocabulary though small was
free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words
together, with about a 90% chance of complete under-
standing. The computer program that did this could be
called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it
was still in an early stage of development.
The article "Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and
Sing - and May Outthink Man" by David Brand, in the
October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of com-
puters (and robots equipped with computers) which could
deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of
the programs mentioned could for example decipher natu-
ral language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks
of various shapes, sizes, and colors.
The main tasks for understanding natural language ap-
pear to be the following:
Recognition of the framework of a sentence;
Recognition of the common meaning of groups of
synonyms, the collection of words that "say
the same thing”;
Knowledge of context: the context is regularly
specified to the computer, so that it does not
have to deduce the context from "what is being
said";
Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of per-
haps 300 to 500 words - knowledge in the sense
that the computer program can attach meaning to
the words either by themselves or in phrases, as
for example it may attach the meaning of doing
something three times to the numeral 3;
Capacity to accept variation in the way something is
stated by a human programmer.
The three articles referred to above show instances of
the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combin-
ing all the achievements should not be too hard, especially
since children as young as four years old show complete
capacities to listen to many kinds of natural language, un-
derstand, and respond.

"Because of general dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service bureau clients
planned to discontinue using service bureaus.”
Computer Use
A recent study of 2,500 companies conducted by
the Research Institute of America, revealed that 55%
of the firms regularly use computers in conducting
their business. Further breakdown of the study
shows that an average of 32% own or lease their own
computers, and 23% use an outside service bureau for
processing data.l
While a majority of the companies surveyed do use
computers in some form, a significant 45% of the re-

study revealed that most service bureau clients are
not effectively using their service bureau and, as
a result, are receiving few, if any, of the advan-
tages of electronic data processing (EDP). Most
of the surveyed service bureau clients were:3
1. Receiving routine services which do not save
them money.
2. Not planning to expand into more sophisticated,
higher-payoff applications.
3. Not receiving indirect benefits and savings.
such as improved information for decision
making.
4. Not satisfied with current services.
The study also disclosed that because of the gen-
eral dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service
bureau clients planned to discontinue using service
bureaus and purchase in-house computers.4
Cooperative Service Bureaus
Both non-users and dissatisfied service bureau
clients, therefore, offer a ready market for a newer
approach to obtaining the advantages of EDP - the
formation of a cooperative service bureau. A coop-
erative service bureau consists of several sponsor-
ing firms who jointly own a computer and share in
its operating costs at a much lower expense than in-
dividual ownership of a computer. If carefully
planned before operations begin, a cooperative ser-
vice bureau will provide its sponsors with all the
advantages of EDP plus many other advantages unique
to jointly-shared facilities and personnel.
Among these additional advantages are:
1. The sponsors would purchase a computer tai-
lored to their specific needs.
2. They would have exclusive use of the computer.
3. Their computer would be available for use at
any time.
4. They could share the costs of any computer
programs developed.
5. They could share the costs of any package or
canned computer programs purchased.
6. They would have available for their exclusive
use a staff of data processing experts and
a computer at a fraction of the cost of
individual ownership.

Factors Insuring the Success of the Cooperative
The first step in forming a successful coopera-
tive service bureau is to enroll an appropriate num-
ber of comapnies. Ideally the cooperative should be
limited to five or six sponsoring firms. A larger
number may create unmanageable problems involving
operations, communications, control, scheduling of
computer time, and so forth. A smaller number may
make the venture economically unfeasible.

Lack of Interest
At the present time, widespread lack of interest
is joining a cooperative is more of a problem to po-
testial organizers than too much demand. The author
contacted a number of public accounting firms about
the feasibility of forming cooperatives and found
that three firms who had already made such an at-
tempt could not interest enough firms to join. Their
comments were:
- We tried to organize one several years ago;
the firms contacted were not interested.
We would like to explore this possibility
but we can't get anyone else interested.
-
.
At present there appears to be a tragic lack
of interest locally by other CPA firms.
Cnquestionably, one reason for the lack of inter-
est is a misunderstanding of the true nature of a
cooperative. Interested companies must therefore be
prepared to sell the idea to others. As more pub-
lished material becomes available in the field, this
problem should be alleviated.
Confidential Information
▲ second major reason for lack of interest is
that companies fear for the control and security of
their confidential or sensitive information. Such a
concern is certainly legitimate and underscores the
need for a cooperative that is to be successful, to
devise an adequate system for quality control and
security. A committee responsible for such a system
should be established at the outset by the sponsor-
ing firms.
Protection
One of its duties should be to adequately safe-
guard the sponsors' records and documents against
fire, theft, water, and other hazards and disasters.
Statistics compiled by the Safe Manufacturers Na-
tional Association show that about one-half of com-
panies whose important records and documents were
destroyed through some catastrophe never resumed
business or were permanently closed down within six
Bonths; an additional 13% suffered serious economic
Impairment and were able to remain in business only
under severe operating handicaps.5 For this reason
the quality control and security committee must see
that the cooperative service bureau maintains:
protective devices
fireproof vaults
a method of reconstructing any destroyed
records
adequate insurance to cover loss of impor-
tant client records or documents
The committee must also take measures to prevent
one client's records from becoming commingled with
another client's records a not-unlikely occurrence
in such an environment.
-
Preventing Disclosure
Finally, the committee should determine how to
prevent disclosure of confidential information. For
example, no member of any sponsoring company should
be allowed in certain strategic parts of the com-
puter center. Likewise, each company's records
should be coded and the code number known only to
hey computer center personnel. In cases requiring
utmost security, the actual processing of data
should be monitored by a key employee of the com-
puter center or possibly by a representative of a
disinterested third party, such as a firm of inde-
pendent public accountants.
Sharing of Expenses: Startup Costs
With an adequate number of sponsoring firms lined
up and a sound security system worked out. the third
necessity in establishing a successful cooperative
is to determine methods of sharing the expenses.
There are two categories of costs to consider:
1. Startup costs. These include all costs incur-
red prior to the time that the cooperative commences
operations. Startup costs are either directly
traceable to a particular firm or are joint or com-
mon to all firms. An example of a direct cost would
be that of analyzing, modifying, and redesigning of
systems prior to conversion to the computer. An ex-
ample of a joint or common cost would be the cost of
computer housing, including air conditioning, engi -
neering supervision, false floors, ducts and pipes,
tranformers or motor generators, cabling and wiring.
and overhead racks and supports.
Each sponsoring firm should pay for its own di-
rect costs. Joint costs should be shared equally or
apportioned among the firms according to some equi-
table formula.
Operating Costs
2. Operating costs. These include the monthly
hardware and software costs to operate the coopera-
tive. Hardware costs refer to the periodic rental
or purchase charge for the computer equipment. As a
minimum the computer equipment consists of an input
unit, a central processing unit, and an output unit.
Software costs include personnel costs. programming
costs, testing and debugging costs, magnetic tapes.
disc packs, punched cards, paper, paper tapes, re-
pair parts, power, telecommunication lines, and so
on.
Operating costs that are directly traceable
should be paid by the using firm. Joint or common
costs can be shared equally or can be allocated to
each firm based on the number of transactions pro-
cessed or the actual computer processing time used
during the period. In addition, if so desired, a
sponsor could be required to pay a minimum or maxi-
mum monthly charge.
Management
Fourthly, the sponsoring companies should decide
how to manage the venture. It is advisable to form
a committee to oversee the management and operation
of the cooperative. A decision must be made whether
each member regardless of size should have one vote
or whether another basis of voting should be used.
This decision should assure participants that no one
firm will dominate or control the cooperative.
Common Line of Business
A factor not to be overlooked when forming a co-
operative, one which will avoid frustrations, com-
plications, and extra expenses, is to see that each
member is in the same industry or business category.
Thus all sponsoring firms will have similar operat-
ing problems that can be simultaneously solved by
the computer personnel, resulting in the allocation
of smaller costs to each firm for each problem
solved. Also computer programs developed or pack-
aged programs purchased can be shared by all spon-
sors with minimum modifications, thus resulting in
considerable programming cost savings.

Need for Protection
Due to the increasing popularity of computing
services, the issue of control and security pro-
tection has become more important. It is evident
that time-sharing systems present few obstacles to
authorized parties. The security problem has been
sade much more critical by the growing number of
people trained in computers and by the fading of the
computer mystique. In addition, communication by
means of time-sharing systems has no more protection
than telephone conversations or Morse-coded methods.
since the technological skills necessary to inter-
pret computerized data are widespread. More and
sore companies are appointing security monitors from
their EDP staffs to centralize security matters.
Trade organizations such as the American Management
Association and the Bank Administration Institute,
computer firms, and research firms such as Advance-
at Management Research, Inc. find their seminars
computer security overcrowded by data processing
sasagers and security officers from business and
government.
Target of Attacks
Computers have become an important source of in-
formation and, as a result, the target of many at-
lacks. Some of the general information targets for
industrial espionage are sales and service informa-
tion, market analysis strategies, bid prices, cor-
porate finance, stockholder information, legal ne-
gotiations, planned policy changes, expansion plans,
product developments, personnel changes, payroll
data, general administrative matters; and the list
could be expanded even more.
Threats
The case of an 18 year-old Cincinnati youth who
wird long distance telephone to tap the lines of a
time-sharing system firm in Louisville, Kentucky,
and extracted data from its ledgers, as well as rec-
erds of its customers, is representative of the type
of risk to which computer installations are exposed.
Accidents can have serious consequences such as
the incident in which income tax return records for
10 were erased by energy emitted from the radar of
• nearby airport in Austin, Texas.
Safeguards
It is important to consider that too much control
and too many security safeguards can become bother-
some and costly.
The measures to protect data from
sawthorized access vary from one system to another.
According to Richard F. Cross, Security Office for
the Bank of New York. security systems should in-
clude each of the following segments: physical se-
curity; personnel security; procedural security;
audit control; insurance; and any needed interfacing.
The quality and level of protection required de-
pends on the sensitivity of the data handled. Never-
theless, control and security in a time-sharing en-
vironment should encompass the whole system, since
it is well known that even the strongest control
measures can be violated at the weakest point. These
measures should be taken in the central processing
unit, software, personnel, communication lines, the
terminal, and its users.
Methods and Provisions
Central Processing Unit
-
The central processor is threatened mostly by
sabotage, fire, water, theft, EDP equipment mal-
functions, human accidental errors and environmen-
tal problems.
The computer center of any company is the heart
of the organization, and protection of the equip-
ment against these threats can be provided by a
carefully planned computer room. Luis Scoma, Presi-
dent of Data Processing Security, Inc., recommends
that the computer center be located out of the main
traffic areas. It must be fireproof, dustfree, and
waterproof and provided with temperature and humid-
ity control and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.
Water lines should not run through the computer
room. A separate, fireproof storage area should be
provided for data files, documentation, and oper-
ating supplies. It should also have alarm devices
sensitive to magnetism, humidity, heat, pressure,
dust, theft, power blackout, etc. There should be
strong access control including armed guards,
fenced areas, TV monitors, personnel identification
(visual, voice print, fingerprint, badge, passwords,
etc.), well-performed maintenance service, and a
number of extra provisions for protection.
Data Processing Security, Inc. has developed, for
high security necessities, an electronically oper-
ated double door entry system for access control in-
to the computer room. When a person enters the buf-
fer zone, the door locks behind him while he is sub-
jected to electronic search. If something is de-
tected, the system freezes and automatically alerts
the security guard. The second door can be opened
only with a special badge key.
A carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguishing system.
such as the one installed at the Chase Manhattan
Bank's New York City headquarters, has proved use-
ful. Engineered by Walter Kidde & Co., Inc., this
system uses a battery of remotely located cylinders
containing the liquid gas. When activated by smoke
detectors, the gas discharges and builds up an in-
ert atmosphere in the immediately surrounding area,
extinguishing the fire without damaging equipment or
data files. Employees can go back to work within
five minutes after the fire has been put out and the
ventilation systems restarted.
Another fire-fighting system which has been de-
veloped by the Ansul Company uses Halon extinguish-
ing agents which are discharged in the form of a
colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. "Since Halon
agents do not work by diluting oxygen, they are
well-suited for areas where humans are present.
The Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. of Worcester,
Mass., has adopted another approach to fire-fighting,
a system installed by Security Control Systems which
detects fire, smoke and excessive temperatures and
humidity fluctuations and causes a monitoring and

Control in Time-Sharing Systems
Fermin Caro del Castillo
6043 Westridge Lane
Fort Worth, Texas 76116
"A time-sharing installation (like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major
dangers: fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, equipment malfunctions, and human errors."
:
Introduction
This article has as its main objective to furnish
and define some methods and provisions for control
and security in a computer time-sharing environment.
It is evident that computer time-sharing has be-
come very popular during recent years. More and
more confidential information is being handled by
these systems, creating an urgent need for strong
measures of control and security.
Description of the System
The service provided by a single computer to many
telecommunications terminals has been called "com-
puter time-sharing". With this type of service each
user shares simultaneously in the processing capa-
bilities of the central processor. This new com-
puter facility makes this service available to small
companies and/or other users who have little need
for their own computer.
Computing services that may go under the heading
of time-sharing include:
Commercial computing; text editing; databank
information retrieval services; application
services such as colleges' records, inventory
control, payrolls of small companies, and ac-
count receivables; administrative messages;
switching and collection services; and more.
Among the great number of time-sharing users are
hospitals (Welch Hospital, one of the biggest in
Europe, has acquired the large ICL 1904S computer
with 7020 terminals), banks (Gosbank, the national
bank of the USSR, has ordered two large-scale Honey-
well series 600 with 100 terminals), schools and
colleges (British schools and colleges have started
using terminals), airlines (Continental Airlines
uses the Sonic 360 reservation system with 550 on-
line terminals).
Trends
The growth in computer time-sharing has been phe-
nomenal in recent years in spite of a short business
recession between 1970 and 1972. Time sharing was a
broker's dream in the '60s%; many companies realized
its potential, entered the market, and failed be-
cause of: one, strong competitive pressure, and two,
because of the countless thefts and violations suf-
fered. The highly competitive situation benefited
the user in regard to pricing, but the offsetting
consequence of lower profits caused a high casualty
rate among these companies. As a result, the number
of time-sharing firms dropped from 150 to 50 between
1969 and 1972.
A few of the companies which survived and which
account for most of today's time-sharing business
are Rapidata Corporation, Teletype Corporation (a
subsidiary of AT&T), Tymeshare Incorporated (the
largest independent firm and second only in size to
IBM and Honeywell time-sharing operations), and IBM
Jerry Dreyer, executive president of ADAPSO, an
association of data processing service organizations
estimates that one time-sharing company out of three
was profitable in 1971, two out of five in 1972, and
probably three out of six in 1973. Nowadays, this
computer facility is coming back to its original
trend, and it is expected that the number of com-
puters with terminals will grow from 32% at the end
of 1971 to 45% at the end of 1975, with the average
central processing unit driving 15 to 20 terminals.
One consultant, Creative Strategies of Palo Alto,
California, predicts that time-sharing sales by 1976
will increase to 2 billion from 331 million last
year. By 1975, says ADAPSO's Dreyer, time-sharing
will account for 1/3 of the $4.5 billion computer
services industry.
Technological Advances
Most important technological advances have been
achieved recently on on-line terminals linked to
central processors. Some of the improvements made
include solid state keyboards, which have greater
reliability and lower cost; visual display methods,
which incorporate more capacity, economy, and aes-
thetic appeal; non-impact printing techniques, which
provide faster, quieter and more reliable opera-
tions; improved lower cost memories; more powerful
logic capability; and faster and more accurate
modern techniques and improvements in central proc-
essor software.
This is only the beginning. It is foreseen that
in the future the equipment itself will change in
nature and will probably not be recognizable as
terminals per se. Rather, terminals will be modu-
lar systems consisting of the required input/output
functions for specific jobs, built around basic con-
troller and communication interfaces; in many in-
stances, terminals will become special purpose de-
vices.
Hazards
A time-sharing installation, like every computer
environment, is exposed to the seven major dangers
of fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, EDP equip-
ment malfunctions, and human errors. Fire is con-
sidered to be the greatest threat to magnetic tapes.
Water does not constitute an important hazard to
magnetic tapes, but it does to computer installa-

Alienation and the Systems Analyst
Alan E. Brill
Supervising Systems Analyst
The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A.
New York, N.Y. 10005
"Systems analysts
must be seen as full-fledged members of the firm."
:..
A Wall of Managerial Attitudes
In most large organizations, the systems and data
processing departments are separated from the rest
of the firm by a wall of managerial attitudes. While
employees in most jobs are encouraged to gain a wide
variety of experience in various departments as they
rise through various management levels, it is rare
that a systems analyst or a programmer is given an
equal opportunity. The general attitude is "He's a
computer man, not a manager (or a businessman, or a
banker). He wouldn't fit in. Besides, he's doing a
good job where he is."
As a result, the analyst has exactly no motiva-
tion to think of himself as an insurance man or a
businessman, or a banker, or an accountant. He is
made to feel like a consultant. He can serve the
organization, but he isn't free to move within it.
To make matters worse, some firms rotate the people
in their management development programs through a
stint in the systems department. It is little won-
der that there is a high turnover in systems ana-
lysts. The company does very little to make him
feel like a member of the family.
Potential Source of Talent
But beyond the problems brought about by the per-
sonnel turbulence, the firm is ignoring a potential
source of fine managerial talent. Many analysts
joining major corporations hold degrees as Master.
Business Administration. Their educational back-
grounds, when combined with their ability to objec-
tively define problems and see solutions, and the
detailed working knowledge of the company gained in
"1
the system design process, should put them in the
management spotlight. Instead, the system analyst
finds that he has been given the indelible label of
'computer person" and that his upward mobility is
limited to the systems department. As a result,
systems analysts leave the firm, and often leave the
systems profession.
If companies hope to attract and hold talented
personnel for their systems activities, they need
to offer them an equal chance to develop to their
full potential. They must be seen as full-fledged
members of the firm — not as consultants who are
here today, but who could move on tomorrow.
-
Experience in Systems
As businesses come more and more to depend upon
data processing to support their operations, it
will be desirable for a significant number of man-
agement team members to have experience in systems.
Yet, by their actions, managements have forced many
talented people to avoid beginning their careers in
data processing for fear of becoming stereotyped.
So it would seem that a number of the problems
that businesses face in their systems activities are
a result of a regrettable but widespread management
attitude.
Only when systems analysts are regarded as having
a potential for advancement to positions in general
management, and are given an equal chance to rise in
the organization, will the systems man lose his al-
ienation and see himself as a member of the company
team.

car. software and data are not covered. Business
interruption insurance protects you in the event of
fire or other interruptions to normal business but
dors not cover the consequences. Boiler explosion
policies which also insure other heating mishaps do
not cover computer operations. Theft and employee
sishonesty are also insured in terms of general
rish. Valuable papers and records' coverage pro-
sides protection in the event of destruction of such
istangibles as notes and account receivable records
bat does not include such computer media as valuable
papers. Public liability insures the company for
its acts or omission of acts which give rise to
claims by outsiders against the company.
Insurance can prevent an unfortunate event from
becoming a catastrophe. When a person buys an in-
urance policy, he knows that he will be indemnified
if a loss does occur.
Some of the insurance companies which write EDP
policies are the Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insur-
ance Co., Insurance Company of North America, The
Moar Insurance Co., and Royal Assurance of America.
Insurance premiums generally correspond to the
regular fire policy rates plus an added loading fac-
tor for the additional EDP perils.
Undoubtedly any computer installation, regardless
of the quality and level of its security system,
cennot approach the state of no risk of loss. Se-
curity is based on a "cost-benefit" concept; in
other words the cost of violating the system should
be greater than the gain derived therefrom.

Procedure for Withdrawal
Sixth, a procedure should be established for
withdrawal from the cooperative. If the withdraw-
ing firm has not been a member for a predetermined
time, perhaps one or two years, a sliding scale
penalty fee for withdrawal should be established.
Procedure for Admission
Finally, procedures must be determined to govern
the admission of new members into the cooperative.
Perhaps a unanimous affirmative vote by current mem-
bers should be required to admit a new member. The
current members should also decide if a newly admit-
ted member should be required to pay a predetermined
portion of the cooperative's startup costs and if
the cooperative should limit membership to firms of
the same approximate size as current members.
Conclusion
With due care taken in following the above steps.
establishing a successful cooperative service bureau
should be relatively easy. Companies would be well
advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooper-
ative service bureaus offer a viable and in many ways su-
perior alternative to the more costly inhouse computer
and the less satisfactory outside service bureau.

Strategy and Action on World Trade
James H. Binger, Chairman
Honeywell Inc.
2701 Fourth Ave. S.
Minneapolis, Minn. 55408
"What we [the United States) have is a little corner of the world, and we must find a
way to live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of whom are every bit as
good as we are at almost everything we do."
The theme of my remarks is the intensifying con-
troversy over the conditions that influence our
well-being here in the United States - particularly
the threat of another unfortunate experience with
protectionism.
I am well aware that I cannot go deeply into this
subject in a short space. This I know because I was
privileged to serve on the President's Commission on
International Trade and Investment Policy. For over
a year we studied every way in which this and other
countries are affected by international trade and
investment policies.
Protectionist Attitude
Let there be no doubt where I stand on the prin-
cipal issue. I believe that the threat of the protec-
tionist attitude in America is far more than an is-
sue involving business and jobs. I sincerely be-
lieve that this issue embraces many powerful forces
that will have an important bearing on whether or
not all the peoples of the world make the most of
their opportunities in the years to come.
I recognize that there are strong and honest dif-
ferences of opinion on the proper direction of our
nation's foreign trade policies. There are many
persons and suppliers who have been adversely af-
fected by foreign competition. It would be unreal-
istic not to acknowledge this fact of life.
Complexity
These differences of opinion, and these disloca-
tions of people's lives, point up the complexities
of the problem. Who among us can honestly say he
understands all of the ramifications involved in the
balance of trade? Where is there an unchallenged
expert on monetary policy? What type of restraints,
if any, could or should be made on the world-wide
transfer of technology? What is the proper level
of East-West trade relations, and are the national
defense implications of yesterday still appropriate
Based on a talk before the Board of Governors of the Electronic Indus-
tries Association, Phoenix, Ariz., January, 1973.
today? Should the United States government be sup-
porting broad research and development to match the
funds that foreign countries are investing in their
industry? Can we preserve the rise in productivity
that underlies the American miracle - which is the
production of goods at low cost while wages, taxes
and dividends all rise steadily?
These are just some of the questions which must
be asked in the discussion now developing, particu-
larly in the halls of Congress, but also at various
other governmental and community. levels.
Facing these and still other complexities, we
know that Congressional hearings soon to begin
could result in new laws and regulations which
could be detrimental.
Action
Because this is so, it will not do for anyone
with a qualified viewpoint backed by experience, to
be simply an observer. I am convinced that this
present controversy can be resolved positively. but
it will require action.
-
What kind of action will be most effective? the
kind of action which is in the public interest?
not special pleadings based on the experience of a
single company, or a single industry, or even a
single community.
It is, of course, important to gather this sup-
porting information and be aware of all the facts
that bear on our needs, our experience and the op-
tions that governments can take to effect them. But
going beyond this, we must be prepared to discuss
with everyone who will exert influence on our elected
lawmakers the more important question I what do all
these statistics and contentions mean to me?
The Concerns of U.S. Citizens
-ba
The concerns of the great body of United States
citizens are how to assure and enhance their jobs
and living conditions and be involved in what was
once unashamedly described as "the pursuit of hap-
piness".

reporting device to alert four pre-selected phone
numbers for help.
Software
Protection of data files, whether in the form of
punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, is the key
element in any computer facility.
Some specific examples of software security con-
trol measures are audit trails, access regulations,
strong supervision of computer operators, the use
and control of programs utilizing program documen-
tation methods, the use of a log for all significant
events (such as user identification, file use and
attempts of unauthorized use), regulations to pre-
vent unauthorized personnel from browsing through
the files, and the use of a semi-automatic data in-
ventory control system.
Personnel
Physical control as to who is allowed near the
computer and the files is advisable. Note that this
does not mean "employees only"; it implies a careful
screening of employees, repairmen, and visitors to
determine which of them should be allowed this prox-
imity to the system. Intimately involved with time-
sharing installations are three types of personnel:
operators, programmers, and maintenance engineers.
According to Dennis Van Tassel, mathematician and
head programmer at San Jose State College, all oper-
ators must understand that there exists a protection
philosophy. If personnel are expected to help en-
force and to comply with this protection philosophy,
it must be clearly defined and specified.
It is advisable to use the following provisions
for personnel control: control of logs and monitor,
division of responsibilities, rotation of duties,
adequate supervision to reduce the risk of losses
caused by accident or error, careful handling of
data files, cleanliness regulations, control access
to private files, and appropriate instruction in
case of disasters.
Terminals
Some of the most common pitfalls encountered
when using terminals are frequent communication in-
terruptions, risk of communication interception,
difficult access control, and noisy lines.
Among the greatest disadvantages of time-sharing
services are those in connection with the communi-
cation lines which link the terminals to the central
processing unit. Telephone lines are designed for
voice communication rather than data communication.
and the results have been that such lines are too
noisy and have too many interruptions for appropri-
ate handling of data communication.
There have been some recent developments in the
improvement of data transmissions. Bell System has
developed its Digital Data Service (DDS), a data
transmission system which has been introduced early
this year in five cities (New York, Boston, Phila-
delphia, Washington, and Chicago); and, by the end
of 1974, twenty-four cities are expected to have it.
Bell further plans to provide continuous monitoring
of their DDS channels. When errors of transmission
are detected, DDS will notify the customer. Deci-
sion on retransmission will be the customer's re-
sponsibility. Another development in data communi-
cation is DUV (data under voice). By late 1973 this
technique will be in service between New York and
Chicago; consequently, communication problems should
become virtually nonexistent within the near future,
and this system will become even more popular.
Telephone lines are vulnerable to three types of
security problems: wire tapping. piggyback, and
user's sign-off signal cancellation. These common
threats may be avoided by the use of a privacy
transformation method (also called scramblers or
cryptographic techniques). This is a non-singular
(reversible) operation which conceals the original
message either by the substitution of new characters,
rearrangement of the characters, or by the adding of
strings of digits to the original message.
Some new techniques for encrypting data have
evolved, such as high speed transmission and signal
scrambling. In spite of all of these new tech-
niques, it is still possible to intercept and tap
the information. According to Tuckerman, unauthor-
ized users (intruders) who possess only limited ma-
terial and information with which to work, can read-
ily extract the original text of enciphered mes-
sages by making use of the speed, capacity, and
computational abilities of the computer.
The greater the efficiency of the privacy trans-
formation, the more difficult it becomes for unauth-
orized copying of files.
Access Control
Access to the system throughout the communication
lines should be controlled by the central processing
unit and by the user's own procedures. This is pos-
sible by cryptographic and scramble techniques, per-
sonnel regulations, user identification, appropriate
terminal location, or by ciphering and deciphering
hardware.
Computer software packages have been written to
cipher data transmissions. Ciphering software is
an attractive technique because it can be done auto-
matically by the program which creates the data and
at a very low cost. Only programs using the match-
ing deciphering technique are able to use this data.
These special hardware cipher devices can be located
at the terminal and at the computer to protect
transmitted data.
Scramblers or voice privacy devices are currently
being used by people who readily acknowledge the in-
security of transmitted information. Scramblers are
used by large corporations such as the oil industry
as well as by union representatives during contract
negotiation time. (Scramble phones are currently a
20 to 30 million-dollar business, excluding law en-
forcement and military purchases). Scramble devices
are now being built for time-sharing operations.
These devices offer protection similar to encryption.
Scramblers convert data into something resembling
channel noise or a malfunctioning circuit.
Other features for terminals include print in-
hibit, security keylock, operator identification
card reader, and the use of a terminal identifier.
With print inhibit the terminal operator can enter
data, such as security passwords, without its being
physically displayed. A physical keylock can be at-
tached to the terminal which will not allow the
entry of data. The operator identification card
reader reads magnetically encoded information on a
magnetic strip card. The card can be used to supply
the user's password and/or name.
Direct access device security features include
file mask, volume detection, and write-exhibit
switch. The file mask controls or allows read-only

Let's look at just one major concern: about 1.3
million new American families are formed every year.
Approximately eight million people change their jobs
every year. About 3.7 million people join the labor
force and 2.1 million leave it. By 1980 full em-
ployment in the United States will require jobs for
100 million people, 18 million more than were em-
ployed at the end of 1972. These, quite clearly,
are the priority considerations in the minds of mil-
lions who do not clearly understand how the enter-
prise system meets their needs.
If they and the representatives of large numbers
of voters do not understand, how can we expect their
support?
I would like to review the arguments for their
support in as familiar terms as I can muster.
The Days of U.S. Preeminence are Gone
First, let's examine one portion of the real
economic world we inhabit.
Of primary importance is the fact that the days
of almost total U.S. preeminence since the close of
World War II are gone.
-
We must learn to live and work in a world where
forevermore we will be dependent on other portions
of the globe for some of our more basic needs — and
some portions will be dependent on us. The U.S. is
not self-sufficient in materials, nor does it have a
corner on the world's technology, the world's inno-
vative ability, the world's marketing savvy, the
world's production know-how. What we have is a lit-
tle corner of the world, and we must find a way to
live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of
whom are every bit as good as we are at almost
everything we do.
The Energy Crisis
I hesitate, somewhat, to use the energy crisis as
an example of this dependency, because I recognize
that there are those who question whether the crisis
really exists, or who maintain that new technology
will solve the problem before it reaches crisis
stage. I can say at this point that there is an
energy shortage, if not a crisis; for example, the
fuel oil allotment for our Minneapolis operations
has been cut by 25 per cent for January and February,
and similar cutbacks have been imposed on other com-
panies, our schools, our common carriers.
Let's look at the dependency which is developing
in the oil industry. In the past, the repatriated
earnings of oil companies have exceeded the value of
imported oil and were a favorable factor in our in-
ternational balance of payments. By 1985, however,
our needs for oil and natural gas could create for
us a trade deficit approaching twenty billion dol-
lars a year.
As no doubt you know, we currently import IO to
15 per cent of both crude oil and copper, 30 per
cent of our iron ore, and more than 80 per cent of
our bauxite needs. We must import all or most of
our tin, natural rubber, nickel and chrome.
-
.
Trade with the World
We cannot go it alone. We must trade with the
world — and to trade, you give something to get
something, with the hope that both traders get what
they want and need. Unfortunately, we have not yet
been able to fully realize this goal, and much of
the controversy over this nation's foreign-trade
policies revolves around the best way to achieve it.
There is a strong and vocal body of opinion which
believes that protectionist measures will achieve
what is best for American workers and companies in
the arena of world trade. One of their principal
targets are companies like Honeywell - multina-
tional companies with substantial investments, em-
ployees and sales outside the United States.
“Exporting Jobs"?
It is claimed that U.S. multinational corpora-
tions are "exporting jobs" overseas; that U.S. com-
panies invest overseas to take advantage of lower
wages; that imports from the overseas subsidiaries
of U.S. companies cause unemployment here at home;
that if U.S. companies were prevented from investing
and manufacturing abroad these companies would be
forced to expand their operations in the United
States, creating more jobs here: that multinational
companies invest abroad in order to avoid paying
taxes; that American corporations are exporting U.S.
technology and therefore are helping non-U.S. com-
panies compete in our own and other countries.
The Burke-Hartke bill has been proposed as the
solution to these problems; and protectionist senti-
ment also underlies other proposals which may emerge
for the consideration of Congress.
At this point, there may be those who will accuse
me of making a tactical blunder by even mentioning
the allegations of our critics. But I'll go one
step further. If someone could prove to me that
these allegations are factual. I'd be one of the
major supporters of moves to inhibit the growth of
multinational companies.
The Opposite is True: Making Jobs
Thanks to various companies, government agencies
and trade associations who have accumulated the
facts and published them, I know otherwise.
I am convinced, thanks to these studies, and my
experience with Honeywell, that multinational com-
panies do not export jobs, but create jobs in the
United States faster than other U.S. companies. I
am convinced that U.S. companies invest abroad to
gain participation in markets in other countries.
not to take advantage of lower wages or so-called
tax loopholes. I am convinced by these studies that
imports from the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. com-
panies have not been a major factor in U.S. unem-
ployment.
To be more specific, I'd like to give you some
information taken from a survey conducted by the
Emergency Committee on American Trade, of which I
am a member. This committee researched the domestic
and international operations of 74 U.S. corporations
representing a broad group of large multinational
corporations. This survey reveals that in the
years between 1960 and 1970, when these companies
were increasing their overseas operations. they also
provided 900,000 new jobs in the United States. They
also increased their sales from American facilities
_ work performed in this country - from $58 bil-
lion to $113 billion - nearly doubled, in fact.
Their exports from the United States nearly tripled
in this period, rising from $4.3 billion to $12.2
billion. In the all-important balance of payments
category, they increased their net surplus of ex-
ports over imports from $3.2 billion to $6.6 billion
more than doubled.

Computer Art: The Search Beyond Manipulation
Grace C. Hertlein
California State University-Chico
Chico, Calif. 95926
"Computer arts are still in the highly experimental stage of emergence.
:
In present computer art, the naive onlooker could
readily misconstrue that mathematical processing of
data and manipulation of design represent the total
modus operandi of this new form, rather than just
the initial phases of exploration. A review of the
varied computer arts reveals diverse input of pat-
terns and subsequent manipulation or transformation,
creating a series of new, perceptual audio or visual
images. There appears a similarity of approaches
and some variation of the techniques utilized by
practitioners of the cybernetic arts: graphics,
sculpture, film, dance, music, textile design, weav-
ing, poetry, and architecture.
There is a tendency to forget that the computer
arts are still in the highly experimental stages of
emergence, and although some attractive and very
pleasing works have been accomplished. this new me-
dium has generally not progressed much beyond its
mathematical and scientific origins. At times, in
viewing or hearing the output of the computer arts,
one would relegate the resultant art form to the
category of interesting sound or visual patterns,
experimental/initial exercises, or mathematical and
scientific visualization, rather than as works of
art per se. (This latter statement is equally true
of contemporary manual experimental art.) There is.
at the present time, a tendency for the computer
arts to relate to an elite coterie, made up of
scientists and intellectuals, rather than the public
at large. However, as this new art medium is given
greater space in the mass media, this audience
should enlarge greatly, as exposure acquaints the
general audience with the potential of this new art
form.
This article is reprinted by permission from the Proceedings of the
Invitational International Exhibit of Computer Arts, T-5, Zagreb,
Yugoslavia, June-July 1973. Grace C. Hertlein is Assistant Professor
in the Computer Science Department at California State University—
Chico, Chico, Calif. 95926. Her computer art has been published for
many years in Computers and Automation and currently some of
her computer art is being exhibited at an art exhibition in Bordeaux,
France.
Pattern Manipulation
Manipulation of design by the computer may be de-
liberate, (or at times highly experimental) as
change or transformation of the original pattern is
achieved via a host of techniques developed within
the past twelve years. However, in attempting to
see precedent in manipulation of design. one ob-
serves ample evidence of a growing interest by ar-
tists and critics in combining (manually) mathemat-
ics and art. Since the turn of the century, such
techniques and philosophy have been practiced and
even more verbally expressed by electronic and con-
crete musicians. Further, the concept of pattern
manipulation is as old as man's art, and one finds
ample evidence of this concept throughout art his-
tory. A few such examples are: Offset X/Y patterns
in Persian sculptural reliefs; repetitions of design
in serial imagery from early Greek vases; reversals
of pattern in the compositions of Bach; mirror im-
ages and mathematical progressions of design in the
Foundation Course exercises of the Bauhaus School;
juxtaposition and superposition of musical patterns
throughout musical history; and randomization of
musical variations via throwing of dice, as prac-
ticed by Mozart. The world was quite ready philo-
sophically and mathematically for further explora-
tions in such transformation of pattern, yet it was
not until the speed of the computer afforded this
electronic manipulation, that it became feasible to
such a degree. (Alteration, change, and transforma-
tion of pattern is revealed in other technological
systems that may or may not use the computer as an aid in
creation: synthesized video, sound, and the film.) In
other words, science and technology now afford fur-
ther exploration of ideas and techniques that have
been practiced by experimental artists for years.
The philosophy and practice of twentieth century
music shows a very great similarity between the ma-
nipulative techniques used by musicians since the
early 1900's and the present-day computer procedures.
Examination of the philosophy of the Bauhaus and
study of the works emanating from this revolutionary
school, also reveals great similarities in the ap-
proaches to creation, and in the final works of art
of this school and present-day computer arts.

International Investment Activities
of Multinational Companies
These figures, and other results of the survey,
lead to one major conclusion: That the interna-
tional investment activities of these representative
multinational companies played an important role in
their rapid export growth and consequently made a
major positive contribution to their domestic - and
I emphasize the word domestic sales, investment
and employment growth.
-
Double Taxation
I have tried to speak in familiar language; so I
have some misgivings about discussing the issue of
taxes. But the tax issue is an important one, and
I'd like to cover some specific areas which are com-
ing more and more into public'discussion.
'
issue is the section of U.S. tax law which al-
lows American corporations a tax credit for the in-
come taxes they pay to foreign countries on income
earned in such countries. The purpose of this tax
credit is to avoid taxing the foreign earnings of
U.S. corporations twice _ once in a foreign country
and again when the earnings are remitted to the
United States.
-
Opponents of this tax credit argue that since do-
mestic firms are not allowed a federal tax credit
for the state taxes they pay, the current method of
taxing income from foreign sources is inconsistent
with the way domestic income is taxed.
Taxation by U.S. States
A major fallacy in this argument is that it is
based on the incorrect assumption that the taxation
of domestic income by city, state and the federal
government is analogous to the United States taxing
the foreign earnings of American subsidiaries which
have already been taxed by the host country.
The proper analogy is between the way states
treat corporate income earned in two or more states
and the way the U.S. government treats income earned
in two or more countries. Every state which has a
state income tax provides a method of allocating the
income of a multi-state company among the various
states in order to avoid duplicate taxation of the
same income. As a matter of fact, the constitution
requires this. Thus the current methods of taxing
foreign and domestic income are consistent.
Further, where one domestic corporation in the
United States has an ownership position in another
domestic corporation, the federal income tax law
quite properly prevents duplication of corporate in-
come taxes. The parent company is taxed on earnings
of the owned company only when such earnings are
distributed as a dividend - and then at no more
than a nominal rate. What logic can there be in the
Burke-Hartke proposal that earnings of an overseas
subsidiary in most cases earnings already taxed
in the foreign country at rates comparable to or
higher than U.S. rates should be immediately re-
taxed at full U.S. income tax rates?
-
-
International Competition by
American Industry
Another fundamental element of the issue is the
tax credit's relationship to the ability of American
industry to compete internationally. According to a
recent survey by the National Association of Manufac-
turers, if the United States were to repeal the tax
credit for foreign taxes paid and tax all foreign
subsidiary income before it is paid out in dividends
to the parent company. U.S. firms with foreign oper-
ations would be forced to pay an average effective
tax on their foreign earnings of over 70 per cent.
Given this added tax handicap, few American firms
could continue to compete with foreign-controlled
companies for world markets.
You can appreciate how useful it is to have these
facts for presentation where contradictory allega-
tions are being made. Let's keep the record straight!
Also useful to the undertaking on which we must
all embark is the factual story of what imports and
exports do, beneficially to create jobs.
Imports Produce One Million U.S. Jobs
Labor Department figures document the finding
that one million jobs in the United States are de-
pendent on imports - jobs for food processors, ship
and dock workers, truck drivers and railroaders,
warehouse employees and retail clerks. And it's
equally impressive to corsider that every billion
dollars worth of exports creates 60-to-80,000 jobs
in the United States.
As we assess the situation, let us not forget the
dilemma our government faced in August 1971. As
Mr. Peter Peterson wrote, the New Economic Policy
announced that month was not, and I quote, "a one-
shot reaction to a one-time crisis. It marked the
beginning of a new era of more flexible. enduring.
and viable economic relationships among nations. The
years behind us were by and large an era of success.
but an era based upon a system which had become out-
grown, outworn and increasingly crisis-prone.
-
Tariffs and Free Trade
"
Mr. Peterson was referring to the tremendous in-
pact that international trade and monetary factors
were having on our people. We have since come to
learn the difficulty of achieving universally ap-
proved corrective action. And now we must reckon
with this reality: U.S. negotiators are preparing
to enter economic talks next fall that could shape
future international relationships for many years to
Our government can and should strive in these
talks to put an end to present attitudes and trends
that point ominously to another "balkanization" of
world trade.
It can and should seek agreement to reduce, and
if possible end, all tariffs on industrial trade by
the end of this century.
It can and should try to create far freer trade
conditions for farm products.
It can and should seek the harmonization among
nations of the present hodgepodge of non-tariff
trade barriers and preferences.
But these objectives will remain forlorn hopes.
unless our negotiators can go into these hard bar-
gaining sessions with the clear backing of the Amer-
ican people and their Congress. We must give them
that.
Spurring Internal Transition to
Successful Competitive Enterprise
Meanwhile, we face and must do something about
the undeniable tolls and grievances resulting from

The 'computer artist is manipulating patterns, be-
'cause this is an inherent potential of the computer
medium. The manual artist (or scholar), by con-
trast, is bound to laborious manual processing of
data and pattern, and thus generally discovers to a
lesser degree, further sources of innovative and
perceptual changes, i.e.. manipulation as practiced
in the computer arts is not feasible manually. When
perceptual change is accomplished manually (many of
the works in Graphis afford excellent examples),
such change is not only excessively time-consuming.
but represents a manual tour de force. It could be
more readily accomplished via the computer.
The manual artist is generally not concerned with
perceptual change or alteration of the original im-
age. On the other hand, since the computer readily
affords such changes, the cybernetic artist may
literally exploit component designs, taking them
through what may appear to be unlimited design
changes. The more abstract the component design,
the more readily it lends itself to mathematical
variation and processing, termed design state
variation.
Design State Variation
This is a term devised by the writer, adapted
from given "state" variations used in printmaking.
in which one may revise a plate or stone, and al-
ter it by additions and/or changes of pattern, re-
sulting in a series of new works. The term denotes
known variations of pattern that are possible, which
may be used as sub-routines or stored on the com-
puter library and merely called by the user, who de-
fines the values of the given parameters of the spe-
cific algorithms being utilized. One of the most
provocative concepts emerging in computer art is
that of being to literally predict innumerable de-
sign state variations, in which a basal component
will be visually or auditorially pleasing. The art-
ist may use only those design states that reflect
personal expression of design. (One might compare
design state variations to the many kinds of chisels
the sculptor may use in execution of a work of art.
each giving unique effects.) Further, this library
of manipulative design state variations is constantly
being enlarged by experimenters in the computer
arts. A brief listing follows:
Offsets of pattern on the X, Y, X/Y (pro-
gressions in music)
Mirror images or reversals on the X, Y, X/Y
Scalar variations or duration of pattern in
superposition of form
Rotation, in open or closed forms
Irregular radiation of images and forms with
growing scalar values
Redundant serial imagery in closed form
Polygon serial imagery, with circular, square,
or varied final form
Positive and negative variations of repeated
or design-related patterns
Disintegrating variants of images and sounds
in redundant or transform pattern
Metamorphic variations of images or sounds
in predetermined sequences
Transformations of pattern, in which one de-
sign becomes another
Alterations of design by mathematical algor-
ithms
Pseudo-randomizations of patterns with artist-
imposed parameters
Overlays of images and sounds in dimensional
forms
Combinations of related patterns, using any of
the above design states
Multi-media combinations, using any of the
aforementioned
Prior to design state variation, the artistic
idea is stated in coherent, sequential steps. It may
be flow-charted before translation into a computer
program. Thus the art idea is transformed into ana-
lyzed data, using synthetic machine languages, and
is then subject to processing and manipulation via
the computer using design state variations, reveal-
ing innumerable new, final works. Examples include:
The warp and weft patterns in weaving
Classical ballet positions, with designations
of the head, arms, and feet
Structural modules in sculpture and archi-
tecture
Derivations of design from art or musical
history, including the archaic, the classi-
cal, or the contemporary
Formulae and transformations from science or
mathematics
Stylistic analysis of a given artist's style,
with designation and statement of a speci-
fic set of definitions describing the style
Artistic composition of a given musical era,
with parameters of such rules
Thus the art idea is initially expressed in the
manner of science, but it does not end there. The
choice of the art idea or problem should express the
personal philosophy of the originator, whether it is
mathematical formulae, natural derivations from the
environment, or analyses of prior styles of artists.
The personal focus of the original idea, ensuing
variation and execution cannot be too strongly
stressed! The design state variations allow the
artist to choose the given direction of psychic ex-
pression. Further, selection of specific computer
systems and art materials affords a highly individ-
ual element within cybernetic creation. And lastly.
the varying techniques of execution, which may be
preplanned or participant, add a unique and personal
opportunity to spontaneously participate within the
formation of the work of art, or to maximize the ca-
pacities of the computer in artistic execution, us-
ing preplanned or heuristic modes.
Diverse Philosophies of Computer Art
Stylistic analysis and resultant design deriva-
tion are highly visible in the computer arts and
possess decided benefits: these techniques allow one
to analyze more thoroughly the subject under study.
and in addition, they allow the artist to gain per-
ceptual variations and permutations of the original
source not obtainable by manual methods. (The writer
and many others have often found these new departures
from the design source to be as or more aesthetic
than the original input source.) There is, however,
a great tendency among humanists to concern them-
selves with past styles and subject matter, as being
more "pure" aesthetically than the present. On the
other hand, there is an equal tendency among scien-
tists to exploit mathematical manipulation, disre-
gard art totally, and to have the computer and its
peripheral devices accomplish the work of art, with-
out intervention by man. Here one finds two ex-
tremes, with beginning dogmatic statements by art-
ists of varying capacities and philosophies. The in-
sightful computer artist, however, seeks to unite
personal philosophy and expression with the highest
level of computer usage.in a statement of artistic
unity.
However, one is conscious of new visions
emerging throughout history, which are subsequently
categorized and "cast in bronze," as "the way." Com-
puter art appears to be no exception to this great

Computers in Science Fiction - II
Marcia Ascher
Professor of Mathematics
Ithaca College
Ithaca, N.Y. 14850
"In science fiction writing, non-specialists attempt to involve other non-specialists in
the human questions arising from computer use."
In "The Computer and the Poet." Norman Cousins
emphasizes that the role of poets. "those who have
respect for and speak to the human spirit," becomes
even more important as computer usage increases (32).
Science fiction writers should indeed be included as
poets in our technological age. All too often in
our society, problems arising from technology are
left to technologists because others are too unsure
of their own knowledge to question or criticize. The
science fiction writings directly involving comput-
ers are one of the few places where non-specialists
attempt to involve other non-specialists in the
human questions arising from computer use.
Emphasis on Man
These
Perhaps the most recurrent science fiction theme
is the difference between computers and man.
raise the question of the proper role for machines
versus the proper role for humans or emphasize the
aspects that make man unique. In one story (Asimov,
"Someday") children in a society where reading and
writing are no longer needed form a secret society
to learn just for the joy of it; in another (Weir,
"What Happened to the Teaching Machine") where all
learning is by machine, only uneducated children
still know how to pose questions. A super-computer
is defeated by a human because he can bluff or "lose
to win" and it cannot (Caiden, The God Machine);
another super-computer is robbed of its control be-
cause of a group of humans whose main desire is
freedom (Pohl, Starchild); and to others (Dick. "The
Variable Man"; Sheckley. "Fool's Mate") human unpre-
dictability continues to be a problem. This distinc-
tive aspect of man is very directly stated by the
computer builder in a French science fiction story
(Boulie, "The Perfect Robot"). In trying to make
the computer more like man, he progressively adds to
its ability to deal with data, the ability to play
chess, language, concepts of love, the ability to
engender new machines, concepts of good and evil.
and finally what he considers to be the crucial
missing element "I have unhinged them". Mike, a
super-computer capable of running an entire revolu-
tion (Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress), can-
not understand why a joke is funny, and the computer
-
AM (Ellison, "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream")
hates people because unlike them "he could not wan-
der, he could not wonder, he could not belong, he
could merely be".
Science fiction writers persist in confronting.
their readers with a question that receives little
direct discussion but is of current concern.
As ex-
pressed by the historian Bruce Mazelish (33). just
as continuities were established with the material
universe, the animal kingdom, and our, subconscious.
we are faced with transcending the 4th discontinuity
of harmonizing our existence and those of mach-
ines in a technological society. Or, as expressed
by Weizenbaum ("On the Impact of the Computer on So-
ciety") the insights of science such as those pro-
vided earlier by the work of Galileo, Darwin, and
Freud, and now provoked by the advent of the com-
puter, shake man's self-esteem because, when viewed
superficially, they seem to diminish man.
-
Mechanistic View of Man
We diminish man and in our anxiety grow more dis-
dainful of ourselves and ambivalent towards comput-
ers if computer usage is predicated on a mechanistic
view of man and this mechanistic view becomes our
self-image. Too many statements made by systems
analysts or computer scientists display that a com-
puter-usable view of man is being substituted for
the whole man. Keep in mind the above list of human
attributes contrasted to computers by science-fic-
tion writers as you read the following statement
from the widely read and much discussed book Limits
of Growth written by well-motivated systems analysts:
Some considered the model too 'technocratic'
observing that it did not include eritical so-
cial factors, such as the effects of adoption
of different value systems. The chairman of
the Moscow meeting summed up this point when
he said, 'Man is no mere biocybernetic device'.
This criticism is readily admitted. The pres-
ent model considers man only in his material
system because valid social elements simply

--- Image 104-10433-10209_page_218.jpeg ---
13-00000
'
could not be devised and introduced in this
first effort. Yet, despite the model's mater-
ial orientation, the conclusions of the study
point to the need for fundamental changes in
the values of society. (34. p. 191)
Admission that the world model has a minor flaw of
omitting "critical social factors" followed so
blithely by conclusions about fundamental value
changes surely conveys to the reader that the fac-
tors that have been dealt with are the more essen-
tial and more significant.
Again recall the human attributes as you read:
By the same token since the thinking human
being is also an information processor. it
should be possible to study his processes and
their organization independently of the details
of the biological mechanisms - the 'hardware'
that implement them. (Simon and Newell,
✔ Information-Processing in Computers and Man",
Pp. 256)
That the theories
.
-
are mechanistic that they postulate
only the processes capable of being effected
by mechanism - is guaranteed by simulating
the behavior predicated by ordinary digital
computers. (ibid. p. 258)
"
To reemphasize the contribution of science fic-
tion, let us trace through one well-written and pop-
ular book, Stand on Zanzibar (Brunner). In the 21st
century over-populated world, there is a very ad-
vanced computer Shalmaneser owned by General Tech-
nic, a company large enough to be contemplating the
subsidization, modernization, and management of a
small underdeveloped country Beninia. Beninia is
unique since it alone has retained peacefulness and
trust and humane behavior. Computer analysis is un-
dertaken of the feasibility of the G.T. project and
for alternative plans of carrying it out. With re-
gard to the possibility of computer analysis of what
makes Beninia attractive, one sensitive character in
the book says
when they get love down to a
bunch of factors you can analyze with a computer,
there'll be nothing left of whatever makes it worth
being human". Shalmaneser eventually rejects the
data on Beninia because it is inconsistant with re-
ality. Mulligan, a cynical sociologist, gets the
computer to process the data by adding the additional
assumption that an unknown force is active in that
population. Mulligan points out that the scientists
who have been working toward consciousness for the
super-computer have been successful because the re-
jection of the data was a display of its first human
characteristic - "orneriness" or "bloody-minded-
ness". When faced with something different, it chose
to reject it instead of broadening its view of the
possible. Mulligan sets out to find what makes
Beninia different and traces it to a genetic muta-
tion which produces a body odour that surpresses in
others the territorial-aggression reaction. Mulli-
gan's hope is that a world-renowned biologist who is
working on modification of human genetic maps can
use this to better mankind. His hope is shattered
when he learns that this biologist has been murdered
for political reasons. The decision is that the ma-
chine will work on finding an external synthetic
spray. Mulligan is led away crying for lost human-
ity
what in God's name is it worth to be hu-
man, if we have to be saved from ourselves by a ma-
chine?" The now conscious machine has the last word
and the last sentence of the book "Christ, what an
imagination I've got". The irony of the book is
that Mulligan, who represents and speaks for those
characteristics which are human, falls into another
part of the prevalent mechanistic trap - aggression
is in our genes; the solution to our problems will
be via a specific scientific breakthrough.
Superstates and Sypersystems
A concern for the use of computers in politics
and government is seen in numerous stories. Opin-
ion polling in a political campaign is involved in
The 480 (Burdick), and the writing of campaign lit-
erature in The Novel Computer (Escarpit). The pre-
diction of elections is carried to an extreme in
"Franchise" (Asimov) where only one vote is needed
to determine the election, and Counterfeit World
(Galouye) describes an entire synthetic'society (an
"electromathematical model") made up for purposes of
opinion surveying. Of greater concern, however, are
the super-states dependent on or replaced by super-
computer systems. Many of these stories describe
the process by which men gradually gave away self-
determination in exchange for material well-being.
or in the belief that a larger something was needed
to protect them from each other (Anderson, "Sam
Hall"; Cole. The Funco File: Dick, Vulcan's Hammer:
Fairman, I, the Machine; Mason, Matrix; Pohl, Star-
child). Often, no one really understands any longer
how the system works (Cameron, Cybernia; Cole. The
Funco File: Delany, The Fall of the Towers; Dick,
Vulcan's Hammer; Fairman, I, the Machine; Mason,
Matrix). In most cases, the vast destructive power
of the system is realized when, for some reason, it
is no longer serving human ends. One computer over-
emphasizes the goal of protecting itself (Dick, Vul-
can's Hammer), one gets carried away by its goal of
avoiding thermo-nuclear war (Cardin, The God Ma-
chine), two become lonely and hence mad (Fairman, I,
the Machine; Pohl, Starchild), another becomes psy-
chotic because of what it learns from men's minds
(Delany, The Fall of the Towers), others are under
the control of selfish people (Cameron, Cybernia;
Sladek, The Reproductive System). Most of these
systems are destroyed by man's more flexible intel-
ligence. However, in one story (Miller, "Dumb
Waiter"), the system goes on even after there are no
more people, and in another (Dick, "Autofac"). with-
out the knowledge of the people.
Loss of Control
Some ten years ago when discussing views of com-
puters in science fiction, I pointed out that few
contemporary stories could be viewed simply as man's
worries about his machines getting beyond his con-
trol. I noted that most of the stories focused on
extensions of specific current uses and emphasized
man's responsibilities as technology advanced (30.
31). While there are some stories in which comput-
ers turn on their makers (Dnieprov, "Siema"), the
stories just cited have two significantly different
characteristics. The stories do not begin with the
construction of a machine motivated by curiosity or
scientific naivetée, but instead. they begin with
the populace agreeing to control by the machine. We
read, for example, that in 1993 after a large world
war, all nations agree to "subordinate themselves in
a realistic manner to a common supranational
authority ..." which is a machine so that it won't
put "interest over reason, emotion over logic"
(Dick, Vulcan's Hammer p. 19); or that another mach-
ine is built to control the world because with stone
axes men could be free as they could do only limited
damage before they were stopped but with advanced
technology men could do damage so much more quickly
they cannot be free to start (Pohl, Starchild). In
A Tale of the Big Computer (Johannesson), a history
of life until the "computer age,
" we learn that man

is a part of the evolution leading up to computers
' and that the basic cause of his failure was the in-
ability to organize a complex society.
complex society. In the very
enjoyable Funco File (Cole), when the question is
raised. "Has it become your ruler, your god ..."?,
the response is, "Well, no. Not exactly. It's more
like where our technology triumphs have finally got
us to. I guess you might say our real ruler was al-
ways an idea of what's normal or not. Conformity. I
guess you'd call it ... I suppose the Machine
plus the F.D.I. working together have sort of
externalized it once and for all." In the stories
where there is a struggle between man and the com-
puter, it is not a struggle to retain control but to
get it back once it has knowingly been given away or
unwillingly allowed to slip away.
-
Consequences of Bigness
-
-
-
The persistent theme in these stories is that of
Digness - big states and big computer systems
and its consequences. This bigness is well described
in an article by Weizenbaum. This article is impor-
tant because it is one of the few expository state-
ments of this serious theme.
These often gigantic systems are put to-
gether by teams of programmers, often working
over a time span of many years. By the time
the systems come into use, most of the origi-
nal programmers have left or turned their at-
tention to other pursuits. It is precisely
when gigantic systems begin to be used that
their inner workings can no longer be under-
stood by any single person or by a small team
of individuals. ... This situation, which is
now upon us, has two consequences: first that
decisions are made on the basis of rules and
criteria no one knows explicitly, and second
that the system of rules and criteria becomes
immune to change. ("On the Impact of the Com-
puter on Society," pp. 612-613).
What is the effect of this situation on individuals
and on society? Two side effects are discussed by
Weizenbaum.
First of course, there is the psychological
impact on individuals living in a society in
which anonymous, hence irresponsible. forces
formulate the large questions of the day and
circumscribe the range of possible answers.
But even worse, since computer-based know-
ledge systems become essentially unmodifiable
except in that they can grow, and since they
induce dependence and cannot, after a certain
threshold is crossed, be abandoned, there is
an enormous risk that they will be passed from
one generation to another. always growing.
(Ibid., p. 613)
Computers Are Not Gadgets
The reader may argue the degree to which these
side effects are already present in our society, but,
if he reads sicence-fiction, he cannot ignore them.
While the first theme of the differences of man and
machines may be the most repeated, this second theme
is probably the most important. The science-fiction
writers maintain their importance as poets of the
"computer revolution" by redirecting our attention
from the computer as "gadget" to the computer as an
integral part of the modern configuration of govern-
ment-academe-industry-management which shares skills,
resources, techniques, personnel, and goals. Just as
our image of the scientist has changed from the man
standing lonely vigil over a bubbling retort to
prove his scorned hypothesis, the isolated computer
with a programmed quirk, asked the wrong question or
fed the wrong data, is no longer hero. Franken-
stein's monster, or the more recent. Karl. Emmy, and
Siema, for example, are very limited creations with
identifiable creators, circumscribed environments.
and restricted effects. We now have instead Shal-
maneser, Project 79, Vulcan 3, Allied Mastercomputer.
or simply. The Machine. The new computer-hero has
remote access, varied input and output devices. pro-
cesses large amounts of data supplied by different
agencies, works in real-time, makes policy decisions
based on quasi-mathematics, commands vast resources,
and affects large numbers of people.

Secretariat for security reasons, were reported in October 1952 to
Frequently return to the UN premises where they were said to oftan
bu seen in its corridors conversing with certain Russians and alleged
Communists. According to a confidential FBI informant, ABELL in
March 1952 made a check payable to KAGAN in the amount of $150, and
KACAN had made checks payable to ABELL on a number of occasions.
Helen KAGAN is Helen KACAN-POZNER, AKA: Elena Aleksandrovna Wilga, etc.,
#348 486, who is suspected of having long engaged in Soviet intelligence
activities. Her brother, Vladimir A. POZNER, is an identified KGB
officer and her cousin, Vladimir Wolf POZNER, is a known member of the
French Communist Party and is suspected of involvement in Soviet
intelligence. Her long-time consort, Peter WILGA, a leading figure
in the CPUSA, was also suspected of Soviet intelligence connections.
Helen KAGAN-POZNER WILGA is of continuing interest to the FBI and
to SRS.

The Fox of Mt. Etna and the Grapes
Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of
Mt. Etna, the great volcano in Sicily. These slopes are ex-
tremely fertile; the grapes that grow there may well be the
most delicious in the world; and of all the farmers there,
Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed
and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes. But they
grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside a
vineyard with high walls, and the Fox had a problem. Of
course, the Fox of Mt Etna had utterly no use for his fam-
ous ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach,
called them sour, and went away.
The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering
Technology. So he went to a retired Engineer who lived on
the slopes of Mt. Etna, because he liked the balmy climate
and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of
watching his instruments that measured the degree of sleep-
ing or waking of Mt. Etna. The Fox put his problem be-
fore the Engineer.

EDITORIAL
(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)
Burying Facts and Rewriting History - II
One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth.
One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let
statements of the utmost importance be buried and for-
gotten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported
and lost because they are no longer well covered in nation-
al news magazines.
Among those statements are two of permanent interest
in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is es-
tablishmentese for "the Watergate Crime").
-
-
The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the con-
victed operatives, which explains his motivation
and background (see November 1972, Computers
and Automation).
- The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent,
an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-
elect the President, telling what he did and saw
while five men burglarized the Watergate offices
of the Democratic National Committee on June
17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972,
C&A).
In addition, we have published seven installments of re-
ports on the Watergate Crime by our contributing editor,
Richard E. Sprague (a computer professional of 25 years
standing) who as an avocation has studied for many years
dirty political operations in the United States, including
the assassinations by conspiracies (not "lone assassins”) of
President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and
Reverend Martin Luther King.
-
-
Three years ago in May 1970, when we began to pub-
lish this type of article, we could not have spoken confi-
dently of "the assassination by conspiracies” of two
Kennedys and one King. But the articles we have pub-
lished which are listed and characterized on the follow-
ing pages
have together a remarkable impact.
Taken together, the information published May 1970 to
October 1973 in Computers and Automation effectively
destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten his-
tory, that the establishment in the United States has
arranged for people in the United States to believe. I do
not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism
or organization; perhaps the best description is this: a
loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspir-
acies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent
orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists
from organized crime and the Mafia.
We challenge any fairminded person to read this col-
may be ordered from us), and after reading them, to still
believe that the assassinations are actually the actions of
"lone psychopaths," instead of fitting together into a plan
to install a certain kind of autocracy in the United States.
This kind of autocracy claims to be democratic, to
stand up for "national security,” “executive privilege,”
"separation of Constitutional powers,” etc. It offers ap-
pearances of democracy, but it seizes the realities of
money and power. It cuts programs of social benefit; but
it allocates $80 billion a year to be paid to the military-
industrial-Pentagon complex.
In the 1940's there was a name for this kind of autoc-
racy. Its name was "fascism," effectively a dictatorship
in the interests of big business. What is now appearing in
the U.S. is "fascism" in the form of a dictatorship by the
military-industrial complex.
Here in a nutshell is an example of the present uneven
contest: it takes the form of two sentences in a report by
E. Drake Lundell, Jr., in Computerworld for April 22,
1973:
● The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department
is "outmanned and outgunned" when it comes to
prosecuting cases like the current action against IBM,
Senate investigators were told last week.
● In addition, witnesses before the Senate Antitrust
and Monopoly Subcommittee stated that often the
division cannot do its job properly because of polit-
ical pressure from the White House.
These two statements contain a world of implications.
Essentially, the Department of the United States Gov-
ernment which is charged with enforcing certain U.S. laws
against monopoly, can no longer properly function because
of (1) the enormous power of just one business, IBM, and
(2) political pressure from the White House (this phrase is
establishmentese for "President Richard M. Nixon").
We must dig up facts, remember them, and write
history the way it is.
We must take action to compel the persons who deceive
us and lie to us to leave the government of the United
States, such as Spiro Agnew, former Vice President.

The Framing of Lee Harvey Oswald
by Richard E. Sprague, Hartsdale, N.Y.
When Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested, Nov. 22,
1963, for the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, he said to his captors in the Dallas jail
cell, “I'm a patsy". A review of the evidence
(including 18 photographs) proves that Oswald
was a patsy, and that he was "framed" for the
murder of President Kennedy - although "estab-
lishmentese" American history denies it.

human failing. Even the most broad-minded practi-
tioner is bound by his or her capacities and philos-
ophy, and it requires a deliberate and concerted ef-
fort to remain open-minded, and to appreciate varied
approaches that are not in accord with one's own
temporary aesthetic parameters. One discerns com-
puter artists who prefer natural or man-made pat-
terns and sounds, vs. those who desire only mathe-
matics, electronic and computer sounds, sans the
human touch. There are those who exploit two or
three-dimensional static images. vs. the creators
who prefer moving permutations in flux, declaiming
that the computer is a perceptual medium, and there-
fore should not be imprisoned in static form, i.e.,
cybernetic art is "pure idea," ad infinitum. Ironi-
cally, even the newest of the arts appears destined
to hardening within specific schools of thought.
with separatist camps warring in "vs." expression
and debate.
Summary
It is obvious that the concept of manipulation
and processing via the computer is merely the first
stage of cybernetic creation. Even now, far beyond
the statements of the artistic problem and aesthetic.
personal variation, is a vast, open territory that
is being explored by questioning, hardy intellec-
tual pioneers, as they seek to perceive the inner
anatomy of art and philosophy:
What is style?
What constitutes the aesthetic?
be accomplished?
How may this
What is art? Music? Sculpture? Dance?
Poetry?
What is science? Mathematics?
Is art purely the man-made: The sound of
the human voice, or playing music upon
man-made instruments? The painting and
sculpting of man with hand-held tools?
Is art a part of life, embracing: The ordin-
ary, the animal and natural sounds? The
patterns carved by the winds, sands, and
the water?
Is art perceptual, a mere fleeting moment or
experience in time, or is it permanent, en-
during?
What is the optimum role of man in a cyber-
netic society?
What is the role of art in a technology-ori-
ented world?
What is the symbiosis of man-and-the-machine?
What is thinking?
What is creativity?
Is man the measure of all things?
When man uses the computer as an aid in creation,
or when he attempts to create heuristic art, his
mind finds new questions to explore and to answer.
It appears highly possible that a renewed perception
of life and the arts awaits present and future gen-
erations of man, and that this may be partially ac-
complished by eliminating the boundaries of compart-
mentalized disciplines, and by walking freely be-
tween art and science, by combining interdisciplin-
ary practices and materials, to hopefully bring
forth the ideal of an open, growing, and dimensional
perception of art/life for the human race.
Editor's Note: This paper is published in accord-
ance with a new editorial policy of allowing writers
freer expression, with no editing by the editors. in
the hope that greater variety of expression and
ideas will result for the benefit of readers.

CORRECTION
In the July 1973 issue of Computers and Automation.
a single article entitled "Communication - Three-
Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer" was published. Part
1 was authored by Larry B. Dendy of the Public Rela-
tions Office of the University of Georgia and Part 2
was authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld et al of the
University of Georgia and the Yerkes Regional Prim-
ate Research Center of Emory University.
In compliance with the authors' wishes, the two
parts of that article have been reprinted as two
separate articles. The first article is authored
solely by Larry B. Dendy and is titled, "Communica-
tion - Three Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer." The
second article is authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld
and his colleagues from the Yerkes Primate Research
Center and Georgia State University and is titled,
"A Computer Mediates Communication with a Chimpanzee."
Also, and in compliance with the authors' wishes, all
figures and tables of the article as published in
the July 1973 issue have been included in the second
of these articles.
In the 1973 annual index Computers and Automation
will enter the two articles in this manner, which
serves to separate a regular article from a formal
scientific and technical report.

Virtue, in Spite of Erroneous Conceptions
J. P. Frankel
Dean of the Faculty
Harvey Mudd College
Claremont, Calif. 91711
"We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it, wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it,
and virtue (if the answer is yes) as doing-it:"
:
In this article, I mean virtue in a much narrower
sense than the theologians, and I mean erroneous con-
ceptions in a much broader sense than planners of
parenthood.
Let me first speak of virtue.
We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it,
wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it, and virtue as
doing it. In this sense, at least in the universi-
ties, we think of scientists as knowing, the human-
ists as wise, and the engineers and other techni-
cians (doctors, nurses, social workers and the like)
as virtuous, that is, the do-ers.
The World is Full of Problems
Now the world is full of problems where we need to
know how to do it, whether to do it, and (if the an-
swer is yes) to do it. Each of us can make his own
list of pressing social problems: pollution, arms
limitation, or population growth. Fortunately we are
reasonably well supplied with scientists, humanists,
and technicians. To understand why we still have
these urgent problems, let us turn to erroneous con-
ceptions.
The erroneous conceptions I wish to deal with
here are:
That it is within the power of scientists and
engineers to choose to work only on projects
"in the public interest," and
That the market place is where one discovers
the public interest.
Choice of Projects to Work on
Critics seem to assume that scientists and engi-
neers are free to choose their projects, and complain
that they fail to consider the real public interest.
Scientists may be free to choose their work, but they
Based on remarks delivered on Joseph C. Wilson Day, November 10,
1972, at the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y.
have no more to say about how their discoveries are
used than Christopher Columbus did.
As for the engineers, they have more to say about
the uses of science, since they are the ones who
choose which of science's ideas will be applied, but
they in turn have almost no way, at present, "of iden-
tifying the public interest, and even less in determ-
ining which products or processes should be produced
to serve it.
A Moratorium on Science?
We will return to this matter of choice, but first
let's eliminate from the list of reasonable alterna-
tives facing society, the silly and dangerous notion
of a moratorium on science.
The key notion in the moratorium idea is that if
you can't control it, you shouldn't do it. There-
fore, we are urged, don't do any more science until
(presumably) the humanists devise suitable controls.
The trouble with this kind of conceptual contracep-
tion is two-fold. In the first place, as Paul Salt-
man has pointed out eloquently, you can't forbid
knowing any more than you can forbid writing poetry.
Science can be slowed down, of course, by driving it
underground, but even if we slowed it way down, there
is no evidence that we have either knowledge or wis-
dom enough to control its application, unless we
change some of our habits.
Ignorance and Fear Lead to Irrationality
- -
-
One habit that needs correction has to do with the
thinking and feeling processes of the humanists
the philosophers, if you will — who presumably are
to show us how to behave. Too often they are igno-
rant or fearful of science and engineering. What one
is ignorant or fearful of, he cannot deal with in a
rational way. There is no possibility that we can
learn to control what we do by some non-rational
process, such as satori, using mystically-fashioned
playing cards, etc. Control over what we do will

l
have to be done rationally. I also believe that it
will have to be done by humanists, and that before
they can do it, we have somehow to lower, or at least
make more permeable, the barrier that separates the
Two Cultures. We will come back to this point later.
Before that, let us return to the notion that engi-
neers choose what they will work on.
The Choices of Engineers
Most engineers do not make cosmic choices. They
do not decide that this product will be built and
that one won't be. Practically all engineers, I sus-
pect, work for other engineers, who work for others,
who work in companies where the products are deter-
mined not by science or philosophy, but by market
analysis. Now market analysis has come a long way
since the days of the Edsel, and it often guesses
accurately, although not always so, what the public
16 interested in buying. But what the public buys is
not necessarily what it needs.
The Market-Place Guessing Game
We buy those things that are offered for sale
that are better (in some vague way) than the alter-
natives available to us. Except for advertising or
other ways of influencing public opinion, the basic
mechanism of the market-place is a guessing game.
Try this product, see if it sells. If it does, fig-
ure out what it was about it that sold, and push a
little harder. If this one does not sell, retrench
a little, or gamble on another change and so on.
Advertising and public opinion do play important
roles how else explain so many different labels
on the same bar of soap, the same automobile? —
but the decision as to how the engineers' skills
will be used has, in the past, been largely deter-
mined by the instantaneous outcome of the market
game.
-
Major Civil Problems
-
-
Now please do not misunderstand me. The market-
place mechanisms are important for determining soap
or automobile styles. I believe that criteria of
risk-and-return of investment are elements of our
decision-making processes that we could discard only
at great peril to our society. What I am saying is
that the major civil problems: pollution, poverty,
and population density, for examples, are not likely
to be defined by market analysis.
These problems, for which acceptable solutions
are needed, share these characteristics:
First, they cross product classification lines,
and involve more than one sector of the economy.
They are not just problems of the auto industry, or
the mining companies, or manufacturing-but-not-
service-industries - they involve all of these.
All the skills that all these sectors employ may
have to be applied to these problems. The cement
plants in the country and the transport companies in
the city have pollution problems that differ only in
detail. To expect them to do the necessary research
and development, separately, each with his eye on his
own segment of the market, is to postpone until
much too late, if not forever, solving even the
smaller parts of our problems. The problems, so to
speak, are too big.
These Problems are Hardly Separable
In the same way, the major civil problems are not
readily separable. One can reduce the amount of air
pollution caused by internal combustion engines by
using electric autos, for example. If so, we may
replace polluted air in the cities with polluted
streams out in the country where the new massive
power plants are. Or we can replace with solar
energy the fissionable materials or fossil fuels we
now use for power; however, at least in the near
future, we would then have either much less energy
or much more costly energy, and fewer jobs and more
poverty. (Some among us tend to paint even blacker
pictures. They point out that our society gave up
slavery only when our technology developed to the
point where machines were cheaper than slaves. Is
it possible that we could deliberately reverse this
process and end up with clean air, but with slaves?)
This characteristic of tight linkage, or insep-
arability of the big problems, also suggests that
we cannot rely upon the ordinary market-place mech-
anisms to determine how we employ our technology to
solve our problems.
Very Difficult Problems
The third characteristic of our problems that
forces us to reconsider the mechanisms of choice,
is that our problems are so very difficult. The
technical solutions do not exist outside of social
considerations. The social costs outweigh such us-
ual factor costs as materials, labor, and capital.
Our cities present much tougher problems than put-
ting man on the moon. As someone smarter than but
unknown to me, has said, "We couldn't have put a
man on the moon if the moon had been inhabited".
World-wide and Nation-wide Problems
-
-
some
All these characteristics, and others that I've
left out, such as geographical diversity
problems are not local, nor even regional or nation-
al, but world-wide suggest that the organizations
needed for these new problem-solving teams differ
considerably from those of even our biggest, most
diversified companies, or else that we need some
super-industrial team of coordinators, who are to be
responsive not to the elements of the market-place,
but rather to the public interest. Whether that
public is regional, or national or world-wide, some-
one who has thought this problem further through
must tell. My own thoughts, tempered by a certain
sourly pragmatic view of the interactions of vari-
ous national governments, suggests that the approach
most likely to succeed in the near future is the na-
tional one.
The National Science Policy and Priorities Act
The essentials of a first step in a national plan
are contained in the National Science Policy and
Priorities Act, which, among other things, sets up
procedures for contracting out to universities, com-
panies and other organizations, the research and de-
velopment necessary for solution of the major civil
problems, including the design of civil science sys-
Whether an agency like NASA should be set up.
as the Act says, or whether an existing agency
should supervise new programs, is a matter of de-
bate. The importance to our discussion is that some
federal funding agency, not the various product
market-places, should establish the priorities and
fund the solutions to our civil problems.
tems.

first approach to nationalizing the solution to na-

collections of scientific, humanistic and engineer-
ing talent, that either already exist in the aero-
space companies, universities and think tanks, or
can be collected there. In essence, this bill
solves one aspect of the problem. It replaces small
or local or single-commodity market-places with a
national market-place based on national needs. I
suspect that the new agency will find that big aero-
space companies usually do not have the necessary
mix of talents, although they probably do have the
necessary organization. The universities, on the
other hand, probably do have the necessary mix of
talents, but probably do not have the proper organ-
ization. It seems, however, to be a logical first
step, and the sooner the bill becomes law, the
sooner we can begin to solve our problems.
International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis
An example of the international approach is the
recently established International Institute of Ap-
plied Systems Analysis in Vienna as a joint venture
of our National Academy of Sciences and the Soviet
Academy, among others. Since they will operate on
about three-and-a-half million dollars a year (the
Civil Science part of the National Science Policy
and Priorities Act allots an average of 270 million
per year for three years) it is unreasonable to ex-
pect anything more than papers for publication to
come out of Vienna. The international effort will
result in more knowledge and wisdom; on the pro-
posed national budget we could become virtuous as
well.

A "numble" is an arithmetical problem in which: digits
have been replaced by capital letters; and there are two
messages, one which can be read right away and a second
one in the digit cipher. The problem is to solve for the
digits.
Each capital letter in the arithmetical problem stands for
just one digit 0 to 9. A digit may be represented by more
than one letter. The second message, which is expressed in.
numerical digits, is to be translated (using the same key)
into letters so that it may be read; but the spelling uses
puns or is otherwise irregular, to discourage cryptanalytic
methods of deciphering.
We invite our readers to send us solutions, together with
human programs or computer programs which will produce
the solutions.
In Order to be Virtuous
One Must be Wise and Knowing
One final caution.
I hope you have not heard
me suggest that only scientists and engineers are
capable of leading us out of the thicket of diffi-
culties we are in. I am not advocating technocracy,
that totalitarian philosophy which says that only
engineers can lead us. I do not believe that for
one moment, nor does anyone who knows enough engi-
neers and scientists. There is no reason to believe
that they, as a class, are any more capable of
leading our people than, say, the lawyers.
I would rather that you heard me say that no
longer is it virtue merely to do it, but rather
that in order to be virtuous one must also be wise
and also knowing.
Our Leaders Must Be Part Scientist,
Part Humanist, and Part Engineer
-
We will need new kinds of agencies and organiza-
tions to define "the public interest" and to find
ways of organizing the talents that may solve some
of our problems. But organizations - universities
and corporations and public agencies are built by
people. led by other people. So our leaders must be
part scientist, part humanist, and part engineer,
and they must use what they have, not in response to
some particular market-place, but in the true public
interest. Not nearly enough people will be born
with these characteristics. They will have to be
educated.
If this sounds like a very tall order to put to
an education system - it is.
But we should be encouraged to redesign our edu-
cation systems to help produce such people, not only
because we have to (God knows we do) if mankind is
too survive but also because we know it is pos-
sible.

Conclusion
"Organized crime will put a man in the White House someday, and he won't
even know it until they hand him the bill."
-
Ralph Salerno
Part 1 of "Nixon and the Mafia" was published in
the September issue of "Computers and Automation":
Part 2, in the October issue. Part 3 begins here
with further information about the relation of
President-to-be Richard M. Nixon with shady trans-
actions in the Bahamas.
Shakeup in the Bahamas
By the middle Sixties there was a storm brewing.
Internal friction had forced out a few people like
Lou Chesler, while a wave of public investigations
were blaring the role of underworld figures like
Meyer Lansky. The 1967 Royal Commission of Inquiry
also dredged up another familiar name Richard
Nixon.
-
Testimony before the Royal Commission by Max
· Courteney, a Lansky lieutenant, detailed a long
bookmaking career and brought out the names of a
large clientele, including the then ex-Vice Presi-
dent Richard Nixon.
Mary Carter Paint
The Royal Commission also bared a deal which im-
plicated Richard Nixon far more deeply than passing
mention by an underground bookie.
In 1967 Lyndon Pindling became the first black
premier ever to serve the almost one hundred percent
black citizenry of the island. Pindling was hardly
a revolutionary, however, for among the people in-
strumental in putting him in office was a gambler
close to Lansky named Mike McLaney. The Royal Com-
mission branded McLaney a "thoroughly dangerous per-
son" and accused him of maneuvering Pindling into at
least one deal involving a questionable gambling
concession.
Part of the post-election controversy was a com-
pany based in Tampa which bore the innocuous name of
"Mary Carter Paint Company”.
In 1965 Lansky's front-man (and former Key Bis-
cayne landowner) Wallace Groves, filed a joint ap-
plication with the Mary Carter Company to open a

casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The ubiq-
uitous Sir Stafford Sands handled the legalities.
Knowledgeable observers looked for the mystery man,
and a Justice Department memo, dated January 18,
1966. predicted that "the atmosphere seems ripe for
a Lansky skim".
After Pindling's election, Groves was forced out
and the Mary Carter Paint Company had itself two new
casinos. At the 1967 opening of one of them the
Nassau Bay Club the honored guest was Richard
Nixon.
-
-
The following year 1968 - the other Mary Car-
ter Club, the Paradise Island Casino, opened for
business. The owners felt close enough to Nixon to
offer him use of their facilities during the 1968
Republican Convention. Nixon felt more comfortable
at Key Biscayne, but some of his staff took up the
offer.
Mary Carter Becomes Resorts International
In 1969 Mary Carter - now called Resorts Inter-
national - reluctantly "released" one Dino Cellini,
claiming that while he "had a relatively unsavory
background, he had no criminal record, no criminal
associates". Cellini hopped across the water to
Miami, where, according to Dade County Sheriff In-
telligence Reports, he continued to work in conjunc-
tion with Paradise Island Casino. The reports al-
lege that Cellini was an almost daily visitor to Re-
sorts International's Miami office, where he checked
credits and worked with a company booking junkets to
the Paradise Island Casino.
-
-
There are those who maintain that Cellini's con-
nections with Resorts International symbolize the
influence of Lansky. In a 1971 editorial, the Las
Vegas Sun concluded an eleven part series on organ-
ized crime some of which centered on Resorts In-
ternational by charging that "however cloaked and
cleverly concealed by the guardians, gambling in the
Bahamas is controlled by Meyer Lansky and it has
been established in police intelligence reports that
the fee is fifteen percent of the gross income". The
now defunct Toronto Telegram reported in 1970 that
"observers believe that the resourceful Lansky is
still managing to get his cut from the Bahamas".
Resorts International, through its ninety-one
percent owned subsidiary. Intertel, has denied all
allegations of involvement with organized crime.
It

was Intertel that ITT hired in 1972 to snoop on col-
'umnist Jack Anderson.
The latest and possibly most damaging charge in
the Resorts International battle came in June 1972
in an IRS inspired indictment of Meyer Lansky and
-Dino Cellini. The indictment reads in part:
On or about May 17, 1968, unindicted co-conspira-
tor Vincent Teresa met with defendants Meyer Lan-
sky and Dino Cellini in Miami and had a discus-
sion wherein defendants Lansky and Cellini gave
Teresa permission to conduct gambling junkets to
the Paradise Island Casino.
Thus government agents allege that in 1968 Lan-
sky maintained at least some control in running jun-
kets to Resorts International's Paradise Island Cas-
ino. The junket racket is an integral part of the
casino operation, and as recently as 1971 Lansky's
bert Eddie Cellini was reportedly still arranging
junkets for the Paradise Island Casino.
Enter Nixon and Rebozo
It was in 1967 - with Lansky still okaying jun-
kets and Cellini still running the Paradise Island
Casino - that Richard Nixon and Bebe Rebozo became
friends with the head of Resorts International.
It should be no surprise that James Golden, the
recently (1969) hired "deputy director of security"
for Resorts International is a good friend of Nix-
on's. As a Secret Service guard for Nixon when he
was Vice President, Golden made a good enough im-
pression to be appointed staff security chief for
Nixon in 1968. Golden was also security director
of Nixon's convention headquarters in Miami that
year, and was security director for his subsequent
inauguration. Later that year he moved to Resorts
International. Golden is just one of a long string
of interesting Nixon security appointees, among
them Watergate indictees James McCord, Gordon Liddy,
and Howard Hunt.
There are rumors, some of which have been aired
in the press, that Richard Nixon owns stock in Re-
sorts International. Former Republican Presidential
candidate Thomas E. Dewey does own stock in the com-
pany, and, according to organized crime investigator
Hank Messick among others, there are reports of Lan-
sky buying stock as well. Nobody has proved any-
thing one way or another about the stock connec-
tions, but that Nixon is connected to Resorts Inter-
national, at least through Golden, is indisputable.
Perhaps more disquieting than rumors of Nixon
stock ownership in an underworld holding company for
Bahamian casinos are the reports of his meddling in
Bahamian affairs. In 1969 a proposed tax increase
on gambling profits to provide money for Bahamian
schools was slashed in half by the Minister of Fi-
nance. The Minister refused to explain the cut,
and told opposition members to "use your imagina-
tion" for an explanation.
The advice was taken literally by some Bahamian
papers who speculated that pressure came from "out-
side sources connected with casinos". One Bahamian
paper asked openly if "a telephone call from the
White House was not responsible?"
Whereas our investigation into Cuban politics
brought evidence to light possible violations of the
Neutrality Act, we now have the possibility of an
American President who has spent a significant
amount of his vacation time in the Bahamas also med-
dling in the affairs of that country.
Richard Nixon, a man with both visible and invis-
ible links to the underworld and politics of pre-
Castro Cuba, turns up in the Bahamas with very simi-
lar links, bringing some big names along with him.
Enter William Rogers
Two men with histories both in Bahamian politics
and in the finances of organized crime have made
frequent use of the legal services of a firm whose
most prominent partner is Richard Nixon's old friend
William P. Rogers, one-time Secretary of State.
The two men are Mike McLaney, charged by the
Royal Commission in 1967, and a business cohort of
his named William Colusardo. McLaney and Colusardo
were investigated in 1967 by the Securities and Ex-
change Commission in connection with a blueberry
plantation that McLaney sold to a company controlled
by Colusardo. The subsequent corporate jugglings
implicated (among others) newly elected Bahamian
Premier Lyndon Pindling. Among Colusardo's "favors"
for Pindling were the use of his airplane during the
election campaign, and a $127,000 contribution in
the form of an "interest payment". The law firm
that defended McLaney and Colusardo against the SEC
was that of William P. Rogers. Rogers had been a
close friend and political associate of Nixon's for
twenty-five years. He accompanied Nixon on many of
his Bahamian jaunts and also made frequent stops
with him at the Key Biscayne Inn and Villas. In ad-
dition to being an "R & R" sidekick, Rogers was the
man Nixon turned to for counsel amidst his personal
crises in the Checkers affair and Eisenhower's seri-
ous heart attack.
Rogers served the Eisenhower/Nixon team for eight
years in the Department of Justice, first as Deputy
Attorney General, and then, by 1957, as Attorney
General. The Justice Department's record against
organized crime in the years following the Kefauver
Commission was lackluster, to say the least. It was
Rogers who personally rejected the recommendations
of the specially constituted Wessell Committee on
organized crime set up in the wake of the infamous
Appalachian raid in upstate New York that revealed
a Mafia summit conference. The Committee's propos-
als for a concentrated and coordinated war on or-
ganized crime were only implemented some years later
by Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
A footnote in the Justice Department files was a
report by IRS Special Agent Josph Delfine, dated Oc-
tober 19, 1953. The IRS recommended to the Justice
Department that "criminal proceedings be instituted
against Meyer Lansky in the Southern Judicial Dis-
trict of New York for the willful attempt to defeat
and evade a large portion of his income taxes for
the years 1945 and 1947 under section 145b of the
Internal Revenue Code". The Justice Department
with William Rogers second in command at the time -
respectfully declined to prosecute.
Lums Hot Dogs
-
Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in
1960, Rogers became a member of the New York firm of
Royal, Koegel and Wells. In 1969, with its leading
partner about to become Secretary of State, Royal,
etc. moved with its clients wholeheartedly into the
world of gambling casinos and organized crime.
A year later Royal took on the account of the
Miami-based hot dog chain, Lums Inc. What did a hot
dog chain have to offer a prestigious New York law
firm? The answer may lie in where the firm took its
client.

brought on the shift of control in the foundations
were handled by a Galveston law firm linked to the
mob. The stockholders also claim that John Connally
played a role in these negotiations, albeit a "back-
stage" role. The ANICO case is part of a long his-
tory of Wilson's involvement with the Galveston un-
derworld.
When he came to the Justice Department in Wash-
ington, Wilson discovered the organized crime divi-
sion looking into the affairs of ANICO. Since then
there have been no indictments in the case and there
are reports that Wilson had the ANICO files locked
safely in his personal office. One source of those
reports is Stewart Hopps, a former Justice Depart-
ment investigator.
Some serious conflict-of-interest charges con-
cerning ANICO remain:
The officers of ANICO who were later represented
by Nixon's law firm, made a loan to a company
whose top officers are long-time friends of Nixon.
• The criminal division of the Justice Department
has been headed by a man with direct links in a
company the division is supposedly investigating.
• The company also has clear ties to Nixon's former
Treasury Secretary, a man mentioned for the Vice-
Presidency, the national chairman of Democrats
for Nixon, and a key figure in the President's
re-election scheme.
Whose Justice Department?
The ANICO case takes us to a fitting endpoint to
the story of Richard Nixon's involvement with the
underworld - the Department of Justice. It is an
old saw that criminal and criminal-chaser eventually
become involved in the same business, but in Richard
Nixon that old saw has become more of a reality than
perhaps ever before in American history. For Rich-
ard Nixon is a man whose name has been synonymous
with "law and order" in America for three decades.
Yet the four-year "war" on organized crime by the
Nixon administration bears more resemblance to the
"peace" in Vietnam than a sincere effort to get at
the mob.
In a recent interview in U.S. News and World Re-
port (September 11, 1972), Attorney General Richard
Kleindienst hailed "about 1600" indictments of un-
derworld figures brought by the Nixon administration
in the past three and half years. The Justice De-
partment claims that many of these indictments in-
volve top mobsters.
Those outside the Nixon administration, however,
have charged that the government's prosecution has
been both partisan and selective, aimed exclusively
at mobsters linked to big-city Democrats such as in
Newark, and at the "little fish" who are always in
abundance and who make little difference in conduct-
ing mob business. Time has reported that quotas
have been established (i.e. one hundred hoodlums a
month for New York City) and that arrests are "being
delayed so that future quotas can be filled". The
New York Times has editorialized about the ease with
which petty gamblers can and have been rounded up.
and wondered aloud if the Justice Department isn't
conducting more a publicity war than one on organ-
ized crime. A Times report this year found the gov-
ernment was building up a backlog of gambling in-
dictments, saving them for a crucial time during the
election campaign.
Indeed, while the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell team has
used the spectre of "CRIME" to keep the fear level
high and to guarantee large budgets and expanded
powers for their Justice Department, the actual "at-
tempts" of the Nixon administration to cope with or-
ganized crime have resembled a somewhat sinister up-
date of the Keystone Cops.
For example, up to 1,000 of Kleindienst's vaunted
1600 indictees in gambling and organized crime may
have their cases thrown out for somewhat dubious
"improper procedures" technicalities. A Miami at-
torney named James Hogan has "discovered" irregular-
ities on signatures required for electronic surveil-
lance authorizations. Court-approved wiretaps re-
quire written authorization by the Attorney General
of a designated representative, in this case Will
Wilson. Instead of being signed by John Mitchell or
by Wilson, the authorizations in question were
signed by aides, thus rendering thousands of wiretap
authorizations and the indictments based on them
-
useless.
-
Hogan himself is a long-time syndicate attorney
and a partner of Ben Cohen, a former political boss
of Miami Beach who figures prominently in the For-
The
ties' takeover of Miami by organized crime.
case in which Hogan made his discovery involved the
busting of the largest heroin/cocaine ring in Miami,
many of whose members were Cuban refugees. Inspec-
tion of various court papers, including wiretap
authorizations, confirmed "irregularities" in the
signature Will Wilson's signature. While resem-
bling his actual handwriting, the signatures ap-
peared as "Wil" instead of "Will".
-
While it may seem strange for an aide to misspell
his boss' name, it seems even stranger that Hogan.
took the case. His normal fees start in five fig-
ures but he has been working on behalf of his court-
declared indigent client for more than two years
with minimal compensation. While Hogan is known as
a "very thorough" attorney, it would be interesting
to find out more about the circumstances in which he
discovered the "irregularities".
Even more interesting. perhaps, are the circum-
stances under which Richard Kleindienst was offered
a bribe of $100,000 to quash several mob indictments
In sworn testimony in November 1971, Kleindienst admit-
ted to being offered the $100,000 bribe (which would
be paid in the form of a contribution to Nixon's
1972 campaign) in exchange for stopping prosecution
against several underworld figures caught in a stock
fraud case. The bribe was offered by an aide of
The
Senator Hiram Fong, a Republican from Hawaii.
aide had worked previously with Kelindienst through
Fong's position on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kleindienst said he refused the offer but he also .
said he did not realize it was a bribe for an entire
week!
In cross examination, the prosecutor asked Klein-
dienst, "If you had regarded the conversation as
something regarding a bribe offer you would have im-
mediately report it, would you not?"
"Yes sir." replied Kleindienst, "I would have."
Kleindienst admitted he reported the bribe a full
week later, upon learning from J. Edgar Hoover that
Federal agents were investigating the case.
One would expect the Attorney General of the
United States to be more alert. But what is more
troubling are reports aired in the Washington Post
"

In 1969 Lums purchased the Ceasar's Palace Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas for $60,000,000. A month
later the Nevada state gambling authorities were
looking into the hotels' "catering to twelve under-
world figures from Kansas City".
A few months after the purchase the SEC filed
suit charging Lums and Ceasar's Palace with "false
and misleading" statements. The SEC wondered how
Ceasar's managed to lose $1,000,000 in five months
when the previous year (before Lums bought in) there
was a $2,200,000 profit for a comparable time period.
The SEC also questioned Lums concerning the
$3,500,000 Lums paid one Jerome Zarowitz, a convicted
professional sports fixer who wasn't even listed as
an owner of the casino. Top officials in both Cea-
sar's and Lums have been under investigation by IRS
intelligence in Miami and by Nevada gaming authori-
dies in cases involving organized crime ever since
Rogers' firm took on the Lums account.
There is also the question of the 1971 Lums ac-
quisition of a North Miami housing resort develop-
ment called Sky Lakes. Both Sky Lakes and Ceasar's
Palace have received large sums of money from the
Teamsters $12,000,000 for the Miami project and
more than $16,000,000 for Ceasar's Palace.
-
With things going slowly, Lums announced plans
for a new $22,000,000 casino next door to Ceasar's
Palace. In December of 1971 the company decided
that the whole restaurant idea was no longer worth
the trouble. In a classic climax to a classic Amer-
ican success they changed their name to Ceasar's
World Inc. and sold their hot dog stands.
Meanwhile the Secretary of State's old law firm
reaped a bundle with their new-found involvement in
the Las Vegas underworld. With such stunning suc-
cesses at home, one wonders what a firm with a link
to the Secretary of State could do abroad, in places
like the Bahamas or Vietnam, for example.
Nor do the underworld implications of big names
surrounding Nixon end with the Secretary of State.
Murray Chotiner, a long-time Nixon aide and archi-
tect of his early smear campaigns, has past links to
the underworld. In 1962 Drew Pearson and Jack An-
derson wrote that "Chotiner ... besides representing
the top gangster of Philadelphia, Marco Reginelli,
represented a long and amazing list of hoods, con-
cession peddlers. income tax violators and others
needing influence in high places .. It was Chot-
iner who brought Frank Vitale, "once involved in
the biggest bootlegging conspiracy on the West
Coast," onto Nixon's special plane to Moscow in 1959.
"
Nixon's recent appointment of Walter Annenberg as
Ambassador to England also echoes the themes of un-
derworld involvement. Annenberg and his father were
indicted in 1939 for "aiding and abetting" in con-
nection with their wire service operation in Chicago,
an operation run with the protection of Al Capone.
for which the Annenbergs paid $1,000,000. The An-
nenberg family was also a major contributor to Nix-
on's 1968 election campaign.
Further back in the Nixon saga, and closer to his
southern California birthplace, lies San Diego fin-
ancier, C. Arnholdt Smith and his bookmaker partner
John Alessio. In 1946 Alessio and Smith introduced
Nixon to another bookmaker named Lew Lipinsky. Lip-
insky, who was convicted for bookmaking in 1938,
served for three decades as a go-between for the
Smith/Alessio interests to their syndicate connec-
tions.
Some of the dealings of the Smith/Alessio combine
were brought to national prominence by a recent LIFE
magazine article which accused Attorney General
Richard Kleindienst of "tampering with justice" in a
case involving Alessio. According to the Wall Street
Journal, Smith raised $1,000,000 for Nixon's 1968
campaign. He and his wife took the first position
on the receiving line behind the President at the
White House inauguration.
More of the Same in California
Nixon's other favorite resting place besides Key
Biscayne is the area near his birthplace in southern
California. Here the underworld pattern of his
Florida involvements repeats itself - in a strik-
ingly similar pattern.
One story there involves Nixon's multi-million-
aire backer, C. Arnholdt Smith, and the Del Charro
Hotel in La Jolla, just north of San Diego.
The Del Charro was a favorite stopover for Nixon
in the Fifties. Owned by the Murchison brothers,
who also owned the nearby Del Mar race track, the
hotel played host to numerous Detroit and Las Vegas
gangsters. Alan Witwer, a former manager of the
hotel, has alleged in statements to this repofter and
others that the hotel served as a secret meeting
place for politicians and assorted business inter-
ests, some of them from the underworld. Witwer spe-
cifically cited a 1954 meeting attended by Nixon and
chaired by a leading member of ITT. He also claimed
that there was a bookmaking operation at the hotel.
but has offered no documented proof.
Mrs. C. Arnholdt Smith is a permanent resident of
the Del Charro, and the hotel's visitors have in-
cluded John Connally, Barry Goldwater, and J. Edgar
Hoover. Hoover's $15,000-a-year bills were picked
up by the stockholders of the Murchison interests.
The fact that certain of Hoover's good friend's
rubbed elbows, rather warmly, with Meyer Lansky, and
the fact that the nation's leading crime fighting
agency - the FBI - has come up almost blank in its
fight against organized crime may not prove anything
about Hoover. On the other hand, these facts don't
make it any easier to dismiss questions which might
arise about the influence of organized crime at the
highest levels of government.
North of the Del Charro and thirty miles south of
the San Clemente White House, lies the mammoth La
Costa land resort development. The development is
tied to both Smith (his daughter is a director) and
to the Teamsters.
LaCosta was originally developed by Cleveland
syndicate reliables Allard Roen and Moe Dalitz. The
development was reorganized in 1968 to bring Team-
ster control more in line with their investments,
which already exceeded $18,000,000. Like Sky Lakes,
its Florida counterpart, La Costa attracts a whole
range of figures from organized crime. La Costa
visitors have included Willie "Ice Pick" Alderman,
a St. Louis mob cohort Morris Shenker, and Wallace
Groves and Lou Chesler of Bahamas fame.
According to eyewitnesses, when Groves' helicop-
ter sets down, the red carpet is rolled out.
It may
be because Groves bought a home in La Costa, but
more likely it's because, as government agent's put
it, "where Groves appears, Meyer Lansky will not be
far behind".
Another mob frequenter of the La Costa develop-
ment is Jake Arvey, an organizer of the Republic

:
National Bank in Miami, the bank through which Ber-
nard Barker channeled funds for the Watergate crime.
The Teamsters Again
A recent visitor to La Costa was Frank Fitzsim-
mons, a key to Nixon's new-found support in organ-
ized labor. Fitzsimmons is president of the Team-
sters Union. This summer he stopped in La Costa on
his way to see Nixon at San Clemente. Fitzsimmons
had just come from dinner in Detroit with a local
Mafia figure and soon after his Detroit-La Costa-San
Clemente excursion, Fitzsimmons announced his sup-
port for Nixon. One wonders whether the Teamster
decision to stay on the Pay Board and to support
Nixon is somehow related to what the Detroit Free
Press has been hinting strongly as of late: that the
administration has stopped prosecution of Frank's
son Richard Fitzsimmons - the business partner of a
Detroit mobster - on charges of missing union funds,
in Exchange for Teamster support of the Republican
President.
Whatever deals Nixon and Fitzsimmons did make,
the Teamsters have a long working relationship with
organized crime. Their marriage goes back over
twenty years, where Jimmy Hoffa was introduced to
the Detroit underworld by Paul Dorfman, in exchange
for some multi-million dollar insurance business.
Dorfman's son, Paul, has residences at both Sky
Lakes and La Costa and was recently convicted of
taking kickbacks on a Teamster loan.
The Teamster tradition of labor racketeering and
corruption made for a ready alliance with the mob.
Early government investigations of the Teamsters,
such as the Bobby Kennedy-led McClellan Permanent
Committee on Investigations, centered on labor rac-
keteering. As Attorney General, Kennedy continued
his pursuit of the Teamsters and their boss, Jimmy
Hoffa. At one point Kennedy had twenty-nine grand
juries simultaneously investigating Hoffa's activity
- one of which led to a conviction for mail fraud
and jury tampering.
.In 1969, two Oakland Tribune reporters concluded
a six-month investigation with the charge that "the
$628,000,000 Teamsters Central States, Southeast and
Southwest Pension Fund headquartered in Chicago, has
become a bankroll for some of America's most sinis-
ter underground figure".
Nowhere does the relationship between this fund
and the mob surface more dramatically than in Las
Vegas, where Teamster trustees have approved loans
between $50 and $70,000,000, some shakily secured by
second mortgages and subordinated notes. A high-
ranking Federal official has commented that "the
Teamster fund is a sort of open bank to people well-
connected in Las Vegas and well-connected to organ-
ized crime".
It was Hoffa's desire "to have [his] own bank in
every city" that brought on the Teamster takeover of
the Miami National Bank. The Bank in turn is just
one of a long list of ventures, such as Ceasar's Pal-
ace, Sky Lakes, La Costa, Worldwide Realty, Interna-
tional Airport Hotel Systems, Truesdale Estates, in
which Teamster money amounting to over $60,000,000
figures prominently alongside the social and busi-
ness partners of Richard M. Nixon - a line of in-
vestments that leads from Nixon's three White Houses
to a Federal clemency for Jimmy Hoffa and back to
organized crime.
The current head of the Justice Department's
Criminal Division saw enough evidence in 1967 to say
that he "knew for a moral certainty [that] in the
upper echelons there is an amalgamation between the
Cosa Nostra and the Teamsters Union". In 1971, when
a Federal Grand Jury probing the activities of Meyer
Lansky questioned Jimmy Hoffa, many wondered whether
the links between the two giants were more direct
than the numerous transactions between mutual
friends.
A few months after his testimony, Hoffa was
granted clemency after serving less than five years
of his thirteen-year sentence. The freeing of Hoffa
and three co-defendents of the 1963 wire fraud pen-
sion case is the latest and most crucial event in
Nixon's longstanding friendship, a friendship with
some clear public benefits for both. Jack Anderson
documents, for example, that as early as 1960. then
Vice-President Nixon and Attorney General Rogers in-
tervened to halt an indictment against Hoffa in ex-
change for Hoffa's support in the 1960 election.
ANICO - More of the Same in Texas
In recent years the Teamster fund has been super-
seded by a giant Texas insurance company as a major
source of finance for Las Vegas .casinos tied to the
mob. The company is the American National Insurance
Company (ANICO) of Galveston, Texas. ANICO is close
to the heart and pocketbook of the two ranking Tex-
ans in the Nixon administration former Treasury
Secretary John Connally and former Assistant Attor-
ney General Will Wilson.
-
As well as floating more than $40,000,000 to Las
Vegas casinos and $13,000,000 to premier mob attor-
ney Morris Shanker, ANICO has made loans to two
Florida companies close to Richard Nixon -
$1,750,000 in 1966 to the Mary Carter Paint Company,
and $3,000,000 in 1970 to a subsidiary of Worldwide
Realty.
That year a group of disenchanted stockholders
filed a multi-million-dollar suit, charging ANICO
officials with having taken control of the company
and using it as a private preserve as well as a
source of funds for the mob.
The defendants in the suit hired Nixon's New York
firm to handle the case. Connally's Houston law.
firm has also been used by ANICO. The First Na-
tional Bank of Houston, of which Connally was a di-
rector and in which some of his law partners were
officers, has provided an interest-free account of
more than $1,000,000 for ANICO. Connally was also
a director of a savings association which was pur-
chased recently by ANICO.
Will Wilson was "general" of the Justice Depart-
ment's "war" on crime from 1969-1971. He was head
of the Criminal Division until October 1971, when
his resignation was forced by disclosures tying him
to the scandal-rocked financial empire of Texas
wheeler-dealer Frank Sharp. Wilson has been charged
by dissident ANICO stockholders of helping to drag
ANICO into the twilight zones of finance with such
deals as the 1963 absorption of a defaulted $450,000
mortgage held by Sharp. Sharp's attorney and "finan-
cial advisor" on the deal was Will Wilson.
While Attorney General of Texas, Wilson sued the
foundation which controlled ANICO to bring three new
trustees onto the foundation's board of directors.
Wilson has no visible ties to the new trustees,
whose votes were instrumental in shaping the com-
pany's new financial course. But dissident stock-
holders have charged that the "negotiations" that

NATIONAL AMERICAN BANK INSTALLS
COMPUTER-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM
Tom Burbank
National American Bank
200 Carondelet
New Orleans, La. 70130
A computer-based system designed to prevent un-
authorized access to high security areas has gone
into operation at National American Bank here -
one of the first U.S. banks to install such a sys-
The IBM Controlled Access System (CAS) at Na-
tional American is based on the use of magnetically
encoded, wallet-sized identification cards similar
to bank credit cards.
Each person authorized to enter a security area
is assigned a card coded with his own security num-
ber. Employees seeking entry to an area covered by
the system simply insert their cards into compact
reading devices on entrance doors, and the informa-
tion is transmitted to an IBM System/7 computer for
identification.
Stored in the computer's memory is a list of em-
ployee numbers and building areas these numbers are
designated for. If the number of the card entitles
the bearer access to that area, the computer signals
the door to unlock. If the person is unauthorized
to enter, the door remains closed and a security
guard is notified. The elapsed time is approximately
one second.
If a card is lost or stolen, a new card (with a
new number) is issued and the system is alerted to
deny entry to the original card. If the old card
is used, the guard is alerted.
As an additional safeguard, the system can auto-
matically log all entrance activity by individual
security code, door number, date and time of day.
This helps track who is where and for how long.
National American can now analyze the number of
or
times an individual enters and at what time of day
night this activity occurs. The system also has
built-in failsafe mechanisms which insure security
in the event of a power failure.
"Unfortunately, we are doing business in a time
when public and private institutions are increas-
ingly vulnerable to lawless elements," said National
American President Louie J. Roussel III. "By adding
the IBM Controlled Access System to our current se-
curity procedures, we are taking a major step to in-
sure that our customers and employees are protected.
And, by controlling access to the collateral instru-
ment storage areas, we can make it very difficult
for unauthorized people to gain access to valuable
assets stored in the bank."

shortly after the indictments in the stock fraud
case in question (and ten months before Klein-
dienst's testimony on the bribe). Those reports
quoted "sources at the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York" and indicated that after the meeting between
Kleindienst and Fong's aide. "Kleindienst immedi-
ately contacted Justice's Criminal Division [then
headed by Will Wilson] and ... an FBI agent was as-
signed to infiltrate the group of alleged conspira-
tors".
Do we now believe Kleindienst's story that he
"didn't realize" he had been offered a bribe, or
do we believe the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York? Did Will Wilson and the Justice Department
hold off a week while Kleindienst "made up his
mind" that he had been offered a bribe, or was the
decision whether or not to take it? And did Hoover
and the FBI somehow interfere? ..
Thaps the answer comes in the final outcome of

and Johnny Dio, a notorious racketeer long associ-

the messengers who offered the bribe were convicted.
One wonders if that $100,000 did not find its way

"
Richard Nixon, April 24, 1969
Someone should tell President Nixon that resist-
ing the power of organized crime demands, above all,
a President with a clean slate.
Nixon's life is like a complex jigsaw puzzle, the
pieces of which have been shuffled so as to defy
complete reconstruction. Some of the crucial pieces
have been removed, so a full picture cannot be
achieved. It is no accident that no other politi-
cian has been so much written about, yet so little
understood.
Indeed, much has been made of the "enigma" of
Richard Nixon, his tight-lipped bearing in relation
to his personal life, his unwillingness to divulge
what's really on his mind.
But maybe the answer to the enigma lies in his
old poker-playing instincts, in the unfailing abil-
ity to keep quiet when he's sitting on cards best
hidden from the table.
-
For there is one indisputable fact about Richard
Nixon's career his ascendancy to the pinnacle of
American power has required twenty-five years of
care and feeding by some very wealthy and very re-
actionary men, and an extraordinary number of them
have maintained connections with the world of or-
ganized crime.
During Nixon's years in office the underworld em-
pire in the United States has prospered almost unre-
stricted by the Federal government. From its base
in the gigantic resources of heroin traffic, gamb-
ling, prostitution, "protection," and a host of
other enterprises of violence against society, or-
ganized crime has moved like a bulldozer into the
world of legal, "respectable" business.
Every link between Richard Nixon and organized
crime, however marginal, is of significance, if for
no other reason because he is President. And there
are people all over America, from government intel-
ligence agents to hotel waiters, who have Nixon
stories to tell. He covers his tracks well, but not
well enough.
The full extent of Nixon's involvement with or-
ganized crime is just beginning to surface. The
evidence in this article is merely the top of a
dirty iceberg that will slowly become visible over
the coming years.
The milieu in which he has traveled for three
decades, and in which so many of his friends, as-
sociates, and appointees have been related to the
mob, throw a long and permanent shadow over every-
thing Richard Nixon the "public servant" has ever
said, and over everything his political life has
ever meant.
For in light of his career, both past and pres-
ent, Richard M. Nixon seems to be the factual em-
bodiment of Ralph Salerno's prediction that organ-
ized crime would someday put its own man in the
White House.

show the area around a roof is weakening, it can be

In seismic exploration, a high energy explosion
is set off, and sensitive instruments determine the
structure and makeup of surrounding land by record-
ing how fast the shock waves travel through the
ground. The waveforms can be interpreted to pin-
point probable deposits of oil, and to describe rock
formations. "Using a large energy souce like an ex-
plosion in a mine is out of the question." Dr. Podio
said, "so a manually controlled impact device was
designed to generate the shock waves.' The impact
device, which works like a BB gun, uses air pressure
to shoot a round projectile at a striker plate
mounted at the end of the barrel.
"
When the striker plate is pressed against the
wall or roof of the mine and the device is triggered.
shock waves are sent through the surrounding rock.
The shock waves are picked up by wideband transduc-
erst digitized by a fast transient recorder, and
processed through the Nova 820 for waveform enhance-
ment. The waveform is then displayed on an oscil-
loscope, with the results of velocity and depth cal-
culations. Permanent records of the waveform can be
made on paper tape, or by transmitting the data to a
large scale remote computer.
"A mine could make daily checks with the system
to detect changes in rock strata as the working face
of the mine advances," Dr. Podio said, "or the sys-
tem could be transported throughout the mine to make
daily checks on the condition of roofs at predeter-
mined key locations.' Dr. Podio noted that similar
systems could be used to predict the quality of rock
in rapid excavation projects or could be used in
nondestructive tests of large concrete structures.

The Bell System is using computer technology to
modernize production of the White Pages telephone
books. A system designed to improve customer serv-
ice, control costs and streamline massive record-
keeping operations is now being implemented. The
system - called DIR/ECT (for DIRectory projECT)
was developed by Bell Laboratories, the research
and development unit of the Bell System. Michigan
Bell Telephone Company recently issued its first
directory containing listings produced by the sys-
tem. Michigan Bell also is using the system to
produce some of its directory assistance records.
DIR/ECT is a more sophisticated outgrowth of its
prototype, PHOTAC, a similar process developed by
the New York Telephone Company under sponsorship of
the nationwide Bell System. The first directory
produced by the PHOTAC system was distributed in
1966. Since then, New York Telephone has converted
some 4.5 million listings to the process. Currently
the 12 major downstate White Pages directories are
produced by PHOTAC.
The DIR/ECT system stores in a computer memory
directory information such as the customer's name,
address, telephone number - even telephone book
delivery instructions. The information in the com-
puter memory then is fed into a device called a
photocomposer, which provides ready-to-print list-
ings for White Pages. Besides the annual White
Pages directories, DIR/ECT produces daily updates of
new listings and monthly reprints for the telephone
companies' directory assistance operators.
Although customers may see no obvious differences
in the computer-produced directory, listings are
easier to read and pages cleaner looking. The di-
rectories also have uniform abbreviations.
The sys-
tem has built-in cross-checks for consistent spell-
ing of street names and for obvious errors in street
and telephone numbers. There also is provision for
massive directory listing changes, caused by renam-
ing of streets and buildings.
Today, listings for phone directories are gener-
ally set line-by-line in metal type. Changes in
listings must be reset and inserted by hand. With
the new system, changes can be made quickly (because
information is stored on magnetic computer tape and
not metal type), the need to store tons of lead type
will end, and the growing cost of publishing direc-
tories will be lessened.

M.I.T. MUSIC PROJECT USES DEC COMPUTER
News Office
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Cambridge, Mass. 02139
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has be-
gun work on a project aimed at making the Institute
a major center for the study and composition of
electronic music. Barry Vercoe, assistant professor
of music, working with a computer given to the De-
partment of Humanities' music section by Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, is in the early stages
of developing a major electronic music production
facility at the Institute.
Professor Vercoe said the computer facility "will
be a tool both in the hands of the teacher and the
composer that will greatly aid the development of
creativity. The facility also will provide an ex-
cellent tool in the teaching of musical composition
for conventional instruments.
"This is definitely not a scientific project. I'm
not interested in merely getting a computer to sound
exactly like a trumpet. The technological applica-
tion, however, will interest some students who might
not approach music otherwise and some of these will
be drawn into its aesthetic considerations, through
the back door as it were," Professor Vercoe said.
Why compose music for a machine at all?
"I suppose someone asked that very question when
man first composed music for what are now traditional
instruments, instead of for the human voice alone."
Professor Vercoe said. "Electronic music merely ex-
pands the forces available to the practicing com-
poser."
-
The PDP-11/45 computer - coupled with music in-
put also will lend itself to other forms of music
research, such as syntactic analysis of music struc-
tures.
Professor Vercoe is the author of the widely used
Music 360 language for digital sound synthesis. He
has taught at M.I.T. for two years and is director
of the Experimental Music Studio. His work, "Meta-
morphoses for Orchestra," was given its Boston pre-
mier early this year by the M.I.T. Symphony and was
performed by the orchestra on its subsequent nation-

project are Richard J. Steiger, a graduate student,

COMPOSING BY COMPUTER AT ISU
Information Service
Iowa State University of Science and Technology
Ames, Iowa 50010
-
Music composers at Iowa State University may turn
from their piano keyboards and hand-written scores
to a more efficient instrument for composing music
a computer. ISU faculty members are building a
computerized electronic music studio - a system
that will technologically simplify composing elec-
tronic music. The studio is being designed and
built by an interdisciplinary group from Iowa
State's music, computer science, and electrical en-
animeering departments, under the direction of Stefan
Silverston, assistant professor of computer science.
Terry Smay, professor of electrical engineering, and
Gary White, associate professor of music.
Electronic music is produced by purely electronic
means and the Iowa State Computerized Music System
(ISMUS) will be doing just that - generating music
with computer equipment. A composer will sit at the
computer and write a musical composition using an
electronic keyboard.
The new system, which was expected to be operable
this fall, should be an easier method of modifying
and editing a musical piece. The normal hand opera-
tions of changing notations on a printed score or
splicing tapes of recorded music are "more time-
consuming and inaccurate" processes for correcting
a composition, according to Gary White.
The computer composing process begins when the
composer inserts introductory instructions into a
teletype machine. On an electronic keyboard he then
begins to compose his piece. The computer records
all musical instructions which are transformed
through a digital-to-analog sound converter and
loudspeaker into sound. This immediate feedback
system enables the composer to hear what he is com-
posing simultaneously. The computer also allows the
composer to automatically play back and edit what he
has written simply by striking another key.
The musician has now completed one "layer" of
music. If he wants to add further musical instruc-
tions to the composition, he repeats the entire pro-
cess again. All layers merge together to obtain the
product - a completed electronic composition.
"
The music instructions which the composer inserts
into the system are a special electronic music nota-
tion - a 'computer language." The English words it
uses can be compared to musical notation found on a
conventional score treble and bass clefs, notes,
rests, and the like.
-
Electronic music has been used in commercial re-
cordings, and as background music for television,
radio and film. The Iowa State system will be so-
phisticated enough for use in serious compositional
study, the production of background music for vari-
ous media, and for the demonstration of sound prop-
erties.
The ISMUS presently being built is a protytype of
a full-scale model. If the "test-system" proves
satisfactory, "we will look for funding to build a
full-scale model," says White. The project is pres-
ently supported by a $1,170 grant from Western Elec-
tric and a National Science Foundation institutional
grant of $8,698. The prototype employs a mini-com-
puter that is owned by Iowa State.
The studio will be used as a teaching tool for
the ISU music program. Computer software, the pro-
grams (sequences of operations to be performed by
the computer) written for the system, will be devel-
oped so a composer can use the studio equipment
without having prior knowledge of computer program-
ming.
Students will be able to learn basic acousti-
cal concepts and principles of electronic music syn-
thesis and to develop sensitivity to timbre with the
ISMUS. Also contributing to introductory computer
science courses, the system will be a novel example
of computer application in a non-scientific field.

"
Using programs developed by a local high school
student, School District 91 in Idaho Falls, has put
its newly-acquired computer to work as a super
tutor" in remedial studies for disadvantaged child-
ren in this southeastern Idaho community. Designed
to improve the arithmetic and language arts skills
of children in grades 2 through 6, the project was
introduced by director of curriculum Dr. Wallace
Manning with federal Title'l aid during the dis-
trict's 1973 summer session for children largely
from rural farm families. According to John A.
Christensen, computer sciences coordinator, the
project proved so successful in its initial appli-
cation that it has been continued in the fall se-
mester.
The student programmer is Robert Huntsman, 18, a
June graduate of Idaho Falls' Skyline High School.
Using the district's PDP-11/20 timesharing computer
system installed last December by Digital Equipment
Corporation, Huntsman developed programs for arith-
metic and language drill to serve between 40 and 50
pupils on each of two teletypewriter terminals situ-
ated in local elementary schools.

or several digits for multiplication. If the stu-

the terminal to ring a bell in congratulation; if
incorrect, the computer supplies a hint on where the

allowing students to do their homework at a terminal
and receive immediate response. The computer keeps
score of right and wrong answers to produce reports
for teacher guidance. Spelling-recognition exer-
cises are also in use and Huntsman has undertaken
development of an arithmetic program involving frac-
tions
"One of the computer's major advantages is its
ability to pay attention to individual children."
Christensen said. "Every child enrolled in the
regular summer session was able to get experience
at a terminal and benefit from these interactive
programs." He said high school laboratory assist-
ants will continue to write instructional programs
for elementary and junior high levels, expanding the
library begun by Huntsman. For future summer ses-

RESEARCH FRONTIER
"TALKING" BALLPOINT PEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Ronald I. Deutsch
Stanford Research Institute
Menlo Park, Calif. 94025
A prototype model of a simple, inexpensive "talk-
ing" ballpoint pen, under development at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), could reduce massive pa-
perwork and delay in routine business transactions.
The pen is similar to an ordinary pen in size and
shape except that it is wired to a computer system.
The computer is programmed to receive signals gener-
ated instantaneously as a person hand-prints charac-
ters with the pen to record information.
"Such instantaneous and remote processing of data
might be invaluable to large businesses engaged in
daily consumer-oriented services, such as banks, in-
surance companies and utilities," says staff scien-
tist Dr. Hewitt D. Crane, the inventor. For exam-
ple, the pen could be used by a bank teller credit-
ing a savings or checking account. In this case,
according to Dr. Crane, the data would not have to
be retranscribed from a piece of paper by another
employee, or the paper itself put through expensive
automatic reading equipment. Thus, costs and de-
lays could be reduced in crediting accounts or es-
tablishing cash requirements.
In another case, a meter reader making his rounds
for a utility could use the pen in combination with
a cassette recorder. When he returned to his of-
fice, the cassette tape would be programmed into the
system, thus eliminating the need for manual re-
transcription of a day's worth of data.
In the present laboratory version, the pen is
hooked to an audio unit as well as a teleprinter.
so that as a person writes, the characters appear on
the teleprinter and are spoken by the audio unit.
SRI holds a patent on the pen and is currently
seeking financial support for further development,
Dr. Crane says. He estimates that the pen itself
might cost about $25 to $50. A central computer
unit would be extra but could serve many pens.

It's the first lie detector that
can be used on a dead
man. It works on tapes and
other voice recordings
by George O'Toole
Assassination Tapes
The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either
at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.
-Plato: The Republic, Book Three
It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with
a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological
Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect, a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs
no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.
It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph
record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on
a dead man.
Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use
it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on
of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-
recorded testimony of twenty-two persons-eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the
pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,
Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.
I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?
Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw-do they support the Commission's
lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?
Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?
Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not
all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.
The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function
it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool
for historical research. To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know some-
thing about the device itself.
I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of
its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both
former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form
a company called Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second
career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one
could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your
key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and
small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices
to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph
experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

The two men developed a device to

asked Bell if he would lend me a PSE
experiment with, in order to write a piece
out the device. He agreed, with two con-
ions. First, I must take Dektor's three-day
urse in operating the instrument; second,
er using the PSE, 1 must review my
erpretation of its output with his staff, in
interest of accuracy. This seemed rea-
hable, so I agreed.
The course was held in the meeting room
a Holiday Inn in Falls Church, Virginia.
e eight other students were employees
customers who had purchased the
vice. These included a private detective
ency in Pennsylvania, a New York chain
store, and the security service of an East
African country. The instructor was Mike
Kradz a criminologist and retired police
officer. Kradz projects the tough-cop
image, but ne is a living souttal to the Po-
on joke. There is nothing about forensic
science. from fingerprints to nelygraphy, on
which the man is not an expert.
The first morning of the course was
devoted to the physical operation of the
PSE. The device is used in conjunction with
a Uhertape recorder, which has four speeds
and can be manually wound back to locate
a particular point on the tape. The testimony
to be evaluated is recorded at a tape speed
of 7½ inches per second, them played back
and stopped at the beginning of the utter-
ance in question. The recorder is slowed
to 15 16 inches per second and played. The
sound, no longer recognizable as a human
sound, no longer recognizable as a human
voice, is a long, low rumble.
The PSE itself is built into an attaché case.
The case opens to reveal a chart arive. sim-
ilar to an electrocardiograph, and a number
of buttons and knobs. A single cable con-
nects the PSE to the tape recorder.
As the tape recorder reels siowly turn,
and a rumble issues from its speaker. the
PSE stylus dances back and forth across
the moving chart paper, leaving behind a
ragged trail. Then the recorder is stopped,
the chart paper is stopped, and that's all
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper
with a squiggly line. The rest is up to the
human eye and brain.
On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz
showed us what to look for. The unstressed
voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with
stalks of different heights sticking up (and
down) at irregular intervals. But add some
stress, and that hedge begins to look
trimmed. The greater the stress, the

smoother the shape. If the subject was
experiencing the hard stress which accom-
panies deception, the over-all outline of the
figure tends to take on a rectangular shape,
a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz
showed slide after slide of charts made dur-
ing actual police interrogations. He told us
the background of each case and pointed
out the tell-tale signs of deception, when-
ever they were present.
That night each student took a PSE back
to his room to practice operating it. Some
coordination must be learned to become

polygraph interrogation, which applies to
the PSE There is, first of all, the matter of
the "outside issue."
Most people. Kradz pointed out, have
some sort of deep secret they don't want
known. When raced with a polygraph exami-
nation, a person may be more concerned
that this outside issue may come to light
than he is about the actual substance of
the interrogation. This can produce irreie-
vant stress in some of his answers, and mis-
lead the examiner. Therefore it is is neces-
sary for the examiner to interview the sub-
ject before the examination, go over all of
the questions he intends to ask. and assure
the subject he will ask only these questions
I had reason to remember this later, when
I ran my first real interrogation tape.
The interrogation always includes the
question. "Are you afraid that I will ask you
about something we have not discussed?"
A negative answer with no sign of stress
eliminates the outside-issue problem. Also,
the examiner always asks some innocuous
questions, such as, "Do you like the color
blue?" in order to observe the subject's
general state of tension. And there is always
one "red-herring" question.
The red herring is used to identify the
"guilt complex responder." Such a person
shows stress when he responds to any
accusatory question. The examiner may
ask, "Did you steal the watch?" when it is
money, not a watch, that is missing. A
stressed denial will alert the examiner, who
carefully compares this response to the
stress produced by questions about the
missing money.
That night the class was given tapes of
real police interrogations. In most cases,
Kradz was the examiner; and in every case,
he knew the background and resolution of
the matter. One case I was assigned con-
cerned a young man accused of stealing
money from his father's store. Kradz started
by asking the "outside-issue" question. No.
the young man replied, he was not afraid
Kradz would ask him a question they hadn't
discussed. Then the following exchange
took place:
"Do you live in Howard County?"
"Yes."
"Do you suspect someone of having taken
the money?"
"No."
"Are you wearing a white shirt?"
"Yes."
"Do you know who took the money?"
"No."
"Are you wearing a ring?"
"Yes."
"Did you take the money?"
"No."
There were a few red-herring questions
to check for the guilt complex response.
The questions about wearing a white shirt
and a ring and living in Howard County had
been included to measure the background
stress elicited by irrelevant issues.
I ran the tape and charted it on the PSE.
All but two of his responses were un-

stion which produced stress was, "Are

that the speaker had told the truth. However,
since interrogation with a PSE seemed to
require such an elaborate and structured
situation. I wondered if it could be used
the way I had hoped, as a tool for historical
research.
During the lunch break I took Kradz aside
and asked him. Could the PSE be used out-
side interrogations, where the speaker was
telling what may or may not have hap-
pened? Yes, he said, the PSE could be used
for that. Where there was no stress, I could
be confident that the speaker was telling
the truth. However, when I did find stress,
I had to be very careful about reaching con-
clusions about its cause; it could result from
something other than deception. But if I
I hoped that Jim Garrison would prove that
he had solved the mystery. He didn't. Time
passed, public interest waned, and the
details of the controversy dimmed in my
mind, leaving only a dull residue of doubt.
I had despaired of ever learning the truth.
Now I know what to do with the PSE.

tracks, with the tiny, inaudible variations in

Encouraged, I reviewed the list of recent
mysteries. Watergate was, of course, the
first to come to mind. The ITT affair was
also of recent interest. The Kent State inci-
dent had never been fully cleared up. But
one subject seemed to loom above all the
rest-the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Like many others, I have found it difficult
to believe the Warren Report. When Mark
Lane's book came out, I read it carefully.
I read much of the other criticism of the
Warren Commission's findings. The more

located in Washington, D.C. I called the
number listed in the telephone directory
and was soon speaking to Bob Smith, the
Committee's Research Director. I told Smith
that I was a writer and wanted to do a piece
on the John F. Kennedy assassination. I
asked him for an interview, and he agreed.
We met in the offices of Bernard Fenster-

problem with this game is that the player
knows that it is just that. He knows that I
know he's lying, it is a socially acceptable
situation and there is nothing at stake. The
stress which accompanies real deception
is not always present.
I obtained a tape recording from CBS
News of a portion of a Sixty Minutes program
in which Mike Wallace interviewed Clifford
Irving. The interview took place during the
height of the controversy, while Irving was
still claiming to have gotten Howard
Hughes' life story through a series of inter-
views with the billionaire. It was a consum-
mate job of lying, embellished with such
convincing details as Irving's disagreement
with his colleague Susskind about whether
Hughes kept his organic prunes in a paper
or a plastic bag. Sixty Minutes re-ran the
segment after Irving's confession because
the man's sheer virtuosity as a prevaricator
was amazing. I was interested in the inter-
view for a different reason: at the height
of the controversy, Irving had been given
a polygraph examination and had passed
it. I wanted to see if the man who had beaten
the conventional lie detector could also
beat the PSE.
I selected a point in the interview at which
Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had not
interviewed Howard Hughes, but had hap-
pened on some transcripts of Hughes' state-
ments. Irving asked how he could have hap-
pened on them. Wallace rejoined. "Where
did you happen on those transcripts?" Irv-
ing replied, "I got the transcripts from
Howard Hughes." I charted this statement
on the PSE.
It was a perfect example of total stress,
horizontally blocked, with the smooth,
"trimmed-hedge" wave form. Clifford Irving
was a master liar, and he had beaten the
polygraph, but he would have been caught
by the PSE.
A few days after our first meeting. I
received a call from Bob Smith. He had
turned up a few things for me. I visited him
at the Committee's office in downtown
Washington. He gave me a tape recording
and a typewritten transcript. The recording
was the Louis Lomax television program of
Sunday, October 16, 1966. Wesley Liebler,
a member of the Warren Commission's staff,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS
News television program entitled The War-
ren Report, which had been broadcast in
four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27
and 28. 1967.
I examined the transcript. The programs
had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and
other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every
major point of controversy that had been
raised by the critics of the Warren Report.
interviewing eyewitnesses. Dallas police-
men, medical examiners, ballistic special-
ists and many others who had some inside
knowledge of the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. For what I had in mind, it was
a gold mine. I telephoned CBS and learned
that I could get a copy of the program's
soundtrack if I would pay for the dubbing.
charges. I told them to go ahead.
Next I played the Lomax-Liebler tape.
Apparently Mark Lane had been on an
earlier Loma program, and now Liebler
was on to rebut him. I didn't need the PSE
to know that Liebler was stressed He
seemed very agitated. and his breathing
audibly indicated his tension. He was angry
about the things Lane had said, the ques-
tions Lomax was asking him, and the reac-
tion of the studio audience. Given his highly
emotional state. he did not seem a very
promising subject for the PSE. Nonetheless.
I decided to give it a try.
Charting a tape with the PSE is a long
and tedious process. and it was impractical
to chart the entire program. I ran some of
Liebler's statements which were not in dis-
pute and discovered, as I had expected.
a great deal of stress. He was pretty
charged up.
Most of the exchange between Liebler.
Lomax and the audience was argumenta-
tive and did not deal with specific factual
points. I found two key statements by Lieb-
ler, though, and I charted them.
The first statement, in response to a ques-
tion by Lomax, was, "I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Report."
Plenty of stress was evident. but not much
more than in other statements.
The second statement related to those
Warren Commission documents which were
not included in the Report-they were
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which would alter Liebler's
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-
ments and, if they would alter his opinion.
they would already have done so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the documents
would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant, he answered quickly.
"Oh, none, none at all." The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of
Liebler's other statements.
it
It was all pretty confused and fuzzy, and
didn't tell me more than I'd already known:
Wesley Liebler was pretty upset when he
appeared on the Louis Lomax program. I
hoped that the CBS tapes would yield more
enlightening results.
I finally received a call from CBS's
Washington office saying the tapes had
arrived. I broke a few traffic laws getting
there to pick up the tapes and returning
to my apartment. I had already selected the
points I wanted to check from the transcript
of the program. I mounted the first tape on
the recorder. ran it down to the first point
of interest. and turned on the PSE.
For the next three days and nights. I ran
charts. When I finished. I had a splitting
headache, my kitchen floor was ankle deep

idea of what did and did not happen that

inding that both Garrison and Shaw

development. Of course, Dom men coura
be lying. Garrison might have found some
vaid evidence linking Snaw to the assassi-
nation and then, in the time-honored tradi-
tion of prosecutors, invented the rest of his
case. But Shaw's stress could easily be the
result of his predicament, and Garrison's
might also be the result of some outside
issue. The situation was ambiguous.
I ran the testimony of Lee Odom. Odom,
a Dallas businessman, was attempting to
explain the mysterious coincidence of the
post office box numbers It seems that the
Dallas post office box number 11906

Shaw's. It was Odom's box number. and
he had given it to Snaw, whom he'd met
by chance on a business trip to New
Orleans. The PSE showed hard stress dur-
ing his statement. No unrelated control
statement was available for me to run for
comparison.
This didn't really clear things up. There
were several obvious alternative explana-
tions for Odom's stress. For example, there

allegations in the press about Clay Shaw.
unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom
may have felt extremely uncomfortable
about linking himself to this man in any way.
The coincidence of the box numbers
seemed very suspicious, but Bob Smith of
the Committee had pointed out to me that
both Shaw's and Oswald's notebooks were
filled with numbers. so the chance of such
a coincidence was not that remote.
At this point I began to wonder if the tele-
vision camera was the "outside issue" in
every case. Perhaps just being on television
will so thoroughly rattle the average person
that, lying or not, he is going to show stress
on the PSE. I checked this out by recording
and charting a number of people on tele-
vision programs-public officials, men in
the street. even witnesses to a particularly
gruesome accident. There was occasional
stress. but it never reached the high level
I was finding in the assassination tapes.
I also recalled something else which put
my mind to rest on this point: the PSE had
been used to analyze the statements of con-
testants on the television program 10 let
The Trum, and identified "the real Mr. So-
and-co" with an accuracy of better than 94
percent. The problem obviously was not the
television camera.
I ran the testimony of William Gurvich on
the PSE Gurvich had been Garrison's chief
aide in the investigation of Clay Shaw until
he resigned, charging Garrison with wrong-
doing. He said. "The truth as I see it is that
Mr. Shaw should never have been arrested."
He was asked if Garrison had known of cer-
tain illegal and unethical methods Gurvich
had alleged were being used by Garrison's
staff He answered, "Yeah, of course he did.
He ordered it." There was no stress in Mr.
Gurvich's statements. The PSE showed that
he boneved what he was saying.
Obviously I did not have enough tes-
timony from a large enough number of wit-
nesses to create a detailed picture of the
Garrison-Shaw affair, but it seems probable
that, at the very least. Garrison did not have
much of a case against Shaw (a view later
held by a New Orleans jury) and likely that
Shaw was completely innocent of complic-
ity in the assassination. The lesson of this
episode is twofold. First. stress in any one
person's testimony does not prove decep-
tion. Second, given enough testimony by
different witnesses, the PSE can arrive at
the truth.
The first person I ran on the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination
was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu-
nately, only one of her statements was on
the CBS tapes-that Oswald had owned a
rifle. The PSE said she was telling the truth.
The rifle had been one of the major points
of controversy raised by critics of the War-
ren Report. The debate centered on two
points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the
Texas School Book Depository, and whether
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon.
On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson, an
employee of Parkland Hospital, testified
that he had found a rifle bullet on a strefcher
which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. There was no stress in his state-
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth.
Dr. Joseph D. Nicol. Superintendent of

fragments found in the presidential limou-
sine, and on the intact bullet found by Tom-
linson. Nicol testified that both the intact
bullet and the bullet fragments had been
fired by the Mannlicher-Carcano. He. too.
was apparently felling the truth.
Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman of
the Dallas police claimed that he found
Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano on the sixth
ficor of the Texas School Book Depository.

he had told the press that the rifle he'd found
was a German Mauser. The following day
he signed an affidavit to that effect. But on
the CBS tapes he testified that he had been

that stress always equals deception. Unfor-
tunately, I do not know that. But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fresh
doubt regarding the Warren Report. This
doubt rises not only from specific points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,
government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every case, of an out-

making statements supporting the Warren
Report: the Dallas policemen Hill, Jacks.
Jackson and Weitzman; the medical exam-
iner, Captain Humes: Commission staffer
Wesley Liebler; Commission member John
McCloy; former Chief Justice Earl Warren.
Assuming that there is a 70 percent
chance that any single instance of stress
is "outside issue," what is the probability
that all eight instances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bility theory tells us that it is seven-tenths
raised to the eighth power, or approximately
6 percent.
In other words, even making some fairly
conservative assumptions, there is a 94 per-
cent chance that at least one of these eight
men is lying.
My own personal opinion? I don't know.
I remember the young man with the ring.
He said he was wearing it, and he was.
but he stressed. He stressed not because
he was lying, but because there was some-
thing about that ring that really bothered
him, something he didn't want the world to
know. Perhaps that is also true of these men
who, in one way or another, learned some
part of the truth about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.
-
I suppose I'm not absolutely sure even
of that. When I first met Bob Smith of the
Committee, I asked him if there was any
one thing the government could do to clear
up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one
thing that would help more than anything
else would be to make available the physi-
cal evidence the detailed FBI lab re-
ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs.

clothing, yes, even the President's brain,
wherever it has been hidden. These things.
he said, would go far toward answering the
questions about what actually happened
that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even
confirm the Warren Report.
So when I say I'm not absolutely certain
these men are concealing something. I
mean I can think of something that could
conceivably change my mind. That is, if the
government would open all its files on this
matter to us and prove that we are wrong
_ we, the people who ten years later still
believe we haven't yet heard the full account
of the events of November 22, 1963.

The Dallas police radio dispatcher,
fficer Murray Jackson, was asked if he
ought Tippitt knew Oswald. "No." he
plied. "I don't think he knew Oswald." Did
ickson know Oswald? "No," answered
ickson, "I didn't either." The PSE showed
eavy stress in both statements.
Perhaps the greatest source of con-
oversy over the Warren Report is it's claim
at all the shots were fired by one gunman.
ome eyewitnesses claim to have heard
ots and seen gunsmoke in the area of

ne of these witnesses was a railroad
orker named S.M. Holland, who observed
the scene from an overpass near the knoll.
The PSE confirmed that he thought he had
seen a pult of smoke on the knoll, but it
could not support his claim that he had
heard a shot from that direction.
Another witness, Charles Brehm, was
quoted by Mark Lane as having said that
he had seen a portion of the President's
skull flying back over the left rear end of
the limousine. Lane offered this as evidence
of a shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS
tapes. Brehm stated heatedly that he had
been quoted out of context, and emphatic-
ally denied that any shots had come from
the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there
was almost no stress in this statement.
Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the limousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.

with a shorter gun. Rowland told the Warren
Commission he had seen two men, one an
elderly Negro, in the window Oswald is
alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS
tapes he claimed he had seen an armed
man at a different window. The Commission
relied heavily on the testimony of Brennan,
who claimed to have seen a gunman in the
"Oswald window" actually firing the last of
the shots. The PSE showed hard stress in
the testimony of all three witnesses.
The PSE analysis of the eyewitnesses'
testimony regarding the source of the snots
is ambiguous. It supports Holland's claim
to have seen a puff of smoke on the knoll,
and Brehm's denial that any shots came
from that direction, and it raises serious
doubts about all other claims and counter-
claims. This contradiction seems to result
from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-
nesses, perhaps compounded by a fair
amount of fabrication. Deception, if it is
present here, may have been motivated
merely by a desire for attention. Or there
may have been darker reasons.
There is, however, other evidence and
testimony that could shed some light on the
existence, number and location of assas-
sins other than Oswald. This brings us to
perhaps the most dubious and controversial
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event-the autopsy.
Within minutes after the shooting. Ken-
nedy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
colm Perry tried to save his life. The physi-
cian saw that the President had suffered
a massive head wound and a smaller wound
in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos-
tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attempt to open a breathing passage.
Afterward, when hope for the President had
been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and declared that the wound in the front
of the neck had been an entry wound.
The President's body was flown to
Washington, D.C. There, approximately
eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy
was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Because of the tracheostomy, the nature of
the neck wound could no longer be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the
Bethesda pathologists concluded that it
was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,
one low in the rear scalp and one at the
right base of the neck; and two exit wounds.
the throat wound and a large irregular
wound on the right side of the head.
The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy
reported that a wound had been found in
the President's back, and that no corre-
sponding exit wound had been located.
Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed
to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders,
not at the base of the neck. What became
of the bullet? The agents reported that
Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempted external heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Governor Connally.
X-rays and color photographs of the au-
topsy were made. The brain was removed
from the body. Brain and skin tissue slides
were prepared for microscopic examina-
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
never asked to see any of this evidence.
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes, one of the
pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance
of the brain, the slides, and some of the
photographs, which were alleged to have
been turned over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he'd seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seemed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, talking in-
stead about the difficulty of making such
a determination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's life. Then the interviewer asked him.
directly whether he had thought at the time
that it was an entry wound. "Actually, I didn't
really give it much thought," he replied. He

Issassination Tapes
NTINUED FROMAGE 11
owed hard stress on the PSE. Unfortu-
tely, he made no other definite statement
out the nature of the wound.
The interview with Captain Humes was
ore informative. Just before the interview,
1967. Humes had re-examined the auton-
photographs and X-rays, and he dis-
ssed them at length on the CBS tapes.
digrams during the autopsy,
said, had not been intended to precisely
present the location of the wounds. Hów-
er, he cuced a sketch which, he
d, did represent these locations accu-
ely. The interviewer asked. "Your re-
amination of the photographs verify that
wounds were as shown here?"
'Yes, sir," he replied. No stress.
Were there any wounds other than one
the base of the neck and one up in the
all? "No, sin there were not." Moderate
ess, not enough to suggest deception.
Was there any doubt that the wound at
back of the President's head was an
ry wound? "There is absolutely no doubt.
Again stress but again moderate.
Altogether, now many wounds were
re? "There were two wounds of entrance
d two of exit. At this point the stress be-
ne hard.
"
And where were the entry wounds lo-
ed? "Posteriorly, one low in the right
sterior scalp. and one in the base of the
ck on the right." Hard stress again.
Could he be absolutely certain that what
said was an entry wound was, in fact,
t. "Yes, indeed we can." Hard stress.
The interview with Humes was one of the
gest and most detailed on the CBS
es, and I charted most of it with the PSE.
was clear to me that he believed much
what he was saying, but the frequent flick-
igs of moderate stress and the occasion-
lashes of hard stress suggested that he
sn't nearly as confident of his testimony
he claimed to be. As Dr. Perry had
nted out, sometimes it's not easy to tell
entry wound from an exit wound.
he interviewer asked him one good "bot-
, line" question:
Do you have any different conclusion,
• different ideas. any different thoughts

in, than you had at that time?"
No." replied Captain Humes, "we think
✓ bear up very well, and very closely.
testimony before the Warren Commis-
1.'
he stress was hard.
rlen Specter, one of the Warren Commis-
is principal investigators. also spoke on
CBS tapes. He said that the case against
wald fitted together very well, and that
forn could one find among actual crim-
inal convictions a case equally persuasive.
He added that there was no foundation for
the charge that the Commission had been
formed to whitewash the facts.
The PSE said he was telling the truth.
John McCloy, a member of the Warren
Commission, said much the same thing.
and added that he had seen no credible
evidence to contradict the findings of the
Commission. The PSE backed him up on
this but it failed to do so when, speaking
of the Warren Report. he said. "There was
nothing fraudulent about it." Here the PSE
showed hard stress.
If Specter and McCloy were as confident
as the PSE shows them to be in the truthful-
ness of the Warren Report. what could be
froudulent about It Perhaps the snipping
off of a few loose ends, the suppression
of a few pieces of inconvenient evidence
which conflicted with a version of events
they believed to be essentially true.
The one man who could be expected to
have the most informed opinion regarding
the work of the Warren Commission is
former Chief Justice Earl Warren himself.
He had declined to be interviewed on the
CBS program in 1967, but he did appear
on television in May, 1972, in an interview
we found no evidence
of any kind that there was
any conspiracy."
There was very hard stress
on "no evidence"
which was part of a series called The Bran-
deis Television Recollections. Bob Smith of
the Committee provided me with the tape.
The interview was an hour long, but the
Kennedy assassination and the Warren
Commission came up only once. The inter-
viewer, Abram Sachar, Chancellor of Bran-
deis University, was friendly and deferen-
tial. I charted some of Warren's remarks
unrelated to the assassination and found
that he was generally unstressed. Sachar
raised the subject of the Commission
obliquely, and Warren volunteered several
rather lengthy statements about it
Warren said that immediately after the as-
sassination there were two theories, one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
killing, the other that a group of right-wing
Texas oilmen were responsible. He said:
"We explored both of those theories for
ten months and found no evidence that
either of them was involved in it."
The PSE showed hard stress.
He continued:
"
press. and I read some of the documents
that have criticized the Commission very
severely, but I have never found that they
have discovered any evidence of any kind
that we didn't discover and use in determin-
ing the case as we did."
Hard stress once again. The word "never"
was a perfectly "trimmed hedge."
I have found nothing since that time."
he continued. "to change my view, nor have
I heard of anything that has changed the
view of any member of the commission
since that time."
The stress was hard. As I had now come
to expect, the word "nothing" seemed a
particularly beautiful example of stress.
Another word seemed to show even more
stress: "member." Could he have been
thinking of someone in particular? On Janu-
ary 19, 1970. Senator Richard B. Russell,
a member of the Warren Commission, re-
vealed that he had never believed that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone.
I had charted the last of the assassination
tapes. Of course, these few thousand feet
of recording tape are only a small fraction
of the relevant testimony recorded and
stored away in the archives of television
news departments. There is, for example.
Lee Harvey Oswald, as he was led through
the Dallas police station, denying that he
had killed the President. There are state-
ments by Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby and
by others.
I have no doubt that with these tapes,
a Psychological Stress Evaluator, and time
to work on them, a very detailed picture
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy
could be reconstructed, a picture that might
even reveal the identities of the assassins
and their co-conspirators. I hope that sooner
or later someone does this. I have gone as
far as the private resources of a free-lance
writer permit.
What. given the sample of testimony I
have processed with the PSE. can I say
about the assassination?
We should first examine the testimony in
which no stress was found, since it is almost
certain that these people were telling the
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the following:
1. Oswald owned a rifle.
2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found
on Governor Connally's stretcher at Park-
land Hospital.
3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine also
came from Oswald's rifle.
4. At least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equally certain no shots came
from that direction.
5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt.
6. At least one member of the Warren
Commission and one member of the Com-
... we found no evidence of any kind mission's staff really believe in the validity
that there was any conspiracy."
Again there was stress, and particulariy
hard stress on the words "no evidence."
"I have read everything." said Justice
Warren, "that has come to my notice in the
of the Warren Report.
7. Jim Garrison had little or no case
against Clay Shaw.
Almost all of this tends to support, in one
way or another, the Warren Report. But now

A subsequent check with the Japanese National
Police Agency confirmed the biographic data supplied
by the National Maritime Union official. A ward check
indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan
from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963.
Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United
States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about
15 April 1968. His wife's address in the United States
is listed as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria,
California, 93013.
C. A photograph of Richards obtained from the
Japanese police was shown to the National Maritime
Union official and identified by him as the individual
in subparagraph 1A above who had applied for a seaman's
berth. The photograph of Richards bears no apparent
resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin
James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
2. The above information has been given to the Legal
Attache of the United States Embassy in Tokyo.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention: Mr. S.J. Papich
Investigation in Japan of Report on Suspicious
Actions of Gerald Lee Richards, Originally
Described as Resembling Suspected Assassin of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
1.
Reference is made to the report concerning the above
subject made by telephone to Mr. S.J. Papich at 0930 on 17 April
1968. Following is a full account of the investigation made in
this case:
A. On 16 April 1968 a United States National
Maritime Union official in Yokohama reported that one
Gerald Lee Richards, who bore a general physical
resemblance to the description given of the suspected
assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had arrived
in Japan about 15 April 1968 and requested a position
aboard any ship going anywhere. Richards became
agitated when asked for a contact address in Japan
and refused to divulge his Japanese residence. The
National Maritime Union official describe. Richards
as 5' 10" tall, 155 pounds, with brown hair, a receding
hairline on both sides, and a not very prominent scar
two and one-half inches long traversing the center
forehead, his most outstanding characteristic being a
disconcerting, idiotic grin resembling a constant
grimace. According to Richards' documents and state-
ments, he was born 8. April 1937, applied for seaman's
papers in San Pedro, California, 16 June 1964 and
registered there as a United States National Maritime
Union member on 21 February 1968 but never shipped out.
His Social Security Number is 562-46-5078; his United
States Coast Guard Number Z 2711–782.

This office maintains a three volume sensitive
(unofficial) file on the Subject. We no longer maintain
201 file (201-760966); Dr. King's files and documents
were closed out on 6 November 1974 and forwarded to IP
files on 25 May 1976. A further check of other records
in this office revealed the following information relevant
to the Subject. While a large number of documents are
available which mention King, the majority are dated after
his death and in some way are related to world reaction to
his assassination which was on 4 April 1968, prior to the
implementation of the MHCHAOS program, 4 July 1968.

Request For Opinion--FOIA (b) (6) &
Privacy Act
FOIA Request 76-382, copy attached
1. Mr. Weisberg has requested under the FOIA
information on:
a. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
b.
Earl Ray
C.
Other individuals involved with the
assassination of Dr. King.
2. To ensure consistency in making determinations
for release under both the FOIA exemptions (b) (6) and
the Privacy Act, of requests such as Mr. Weisberg's,
would you please state the current legal criteria to
apply to these type cases. Specifically, it would be
helpful to the DDO to have a clearly enunciated legal
opinion regarding what, if any, privacy rights the family
of a deceased individual might have vis-a-vis the deceased
individual. Further, what, if any, privacy rights does
a convicted felon have.
3. We are aware that each case must be judged on
its own facts. Hence, we would be grateful for your
opinion regarding the criteria to apply to Mr. Weisberg's
request. However, a general rule applicable to the type
of request also would be very useful, would expedite the
processing of such requests, and would apply some consistency
in the decision-making process.

SUBJECT: Investigation of Death of Martin Luther King, Junior
1. Your Bureau representative in Mexico City provided
our representative with composite photographs of the suspected
killer of Martin Luther King, Jr, and asked for a check against
visitors to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City
during the recent months.
-2. Checks for persons appearing to resemble the composite
photographs were negative at both Embassies. On 30 January
1968 an unidentified white male visited the Soviet Embassy but
the description did not fit either the composite photograph or
the description provided by your Bureau representative.
However, our ‐representative passed copies of the photographs
to your Bureau representative with the notation that he did not
appear to be identical with the Bureau suspect. Our representa-
tive further stipulated that any use of the photographs in an
investigation should not reveal that the photographs were made
in Mexico or by this Office.
