As a matter of historical fact, Prosident Roosevelt in August,
1936, did request formor Director J. Edgar Hoover to conduct investigations
of subversive activities in this country, including communism and fascism.
This request, however, was a confidential oral request and there is doubt
that any record of it was made outside the FBI. This request, or Presidential
mandato, was based, incidentally, on the fact that the law provided that the
FBI could conduct such investigations if the Secretary of State should so
request.
The study revealed that while the 1020 ct seq. directives did not
grant any special intelligence-gathering authority to the FBI, we were respon-
sible under these directives to collect all intelligence information furnished
by local, state, and Fudural law enforcement agencies and patriotic citizens
and to sift and coordinate all such information for indications of subversive
activity covered by Federal statutes,
The study concluded that the FBI has the responsibility to con-
duct whatever investigations tre necessary to determine if statutes relating
to espionage, sabotage, insurrection or rebellion, sedition, seditious con-
spiracy, advocacy of overthrowing the Government, and other such crimes
affecting the national security have been violated. In this connection we
note that in a letter dated September 14, 1987, the Department of Justico
advised that the FBI is continually alert to the problem of recurring riots
and is submitting intelligence reports to the Department of Justice concern-
ing such activity. This letter enumerated several Federal statutes and
stated these could be applicable in using maximum available resources,
investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing on
the question of schemes or conspiracies to plan, promote or eggravate riot
activity.
In other words, the Department was roquesting all possible
intelligence-type invectigalive activity based on the existence of curtain
statutes. We see this as being no different from our intelligence-type
investigations relating to plans of groups or individuals to overthrow,
destroy, interfere with or threaten the survival of effective operation of
national, state, and local governments.

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY
ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant
Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in
locating any communications bearing upon a conversation.
between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former
Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT
allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation
to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime
he would conduct some research in this matter.
On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telephone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.
“SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned
the internal security of the US.
Mr. SCHEWE, at this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a "buck slip" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is
attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR".
Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more.

which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this

The Attorney General
A major thrust of Professor Elliff's paper concerned FBI authority
derived from legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Presidential
directives, beginning with a directive issued by President Roosevelt in
September, 1939. Professor Elliff is of the opinion that the 1939 directive,
which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was megnified by the
FBI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type
investigations.
Senator Sam J. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the
nature and extent of FBI intelligence-type investigations. Senator Ervin had
even announced that he intended to propose legislation to prohibit the BI
from investigating any person without that individual's consent, unless the
Government has reason to believe that person has committed a crime or is
about to commit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar interest
in FBI investigative activities.
4677
Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly over a
long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field
are authorized under logislative enactments, Presidential directives, and
instructions of the Attorney General. The Presidential directives are obviously
the 1) directive dated September 6, 1989, and reiterated January 8, 1943;
July 24, 1980; and December 15, 1933, and 2) Executive Order 10450 dated
April 27, 1953 (and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order
11005 dated July 2, 1971).
In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated
September 6, 1939, and considering that the subsequent directives are all
hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent
of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI by these directives. It
appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FDI to handle
espionage, sabotage, and neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority
or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already have from legislative enactments.
It is difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any
authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations which would or could
not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

The Attorney General
As to the need for an Executive order, we think that two issues
are involved. We have statutory authority, but what we need is a definitive
requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intelligence data
he requirca in the pursuit of his responsibilities based on our statutory
authority. In other words, there is a need, from our standpoint, for both
authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes give us the authority.
The Executive order would define our national security objectives.
-
Members of Congress, including such men as Senator Robert C.
Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legislation to spell out jurisdiction and
authority of the FEI in this field. It would appear that the President would
rather spell out his own requirements in an Executive order instead of having
Congress tell him what the FBI might do to help him fulfill his obligations and
responsibilities as President.
The political climate of suspicion and distrust resulting from
disclosures coming out of the Watergate hearings could present an obstacle
to getting any such Executive order signed in the immediate future. However,
the rationale is nevertheless valid and when scrutinized closely, the language
in the Executive order we hereinafter propose establishes definitive guidelines
which have heretofore been unclear. It is my belief that we should go forward
with this.
We therefore propose and recommend that an Executive order
along the following lines be submitted to the White House with a strong
recommendation for approval. The language which follows is merely to
illustrate the type of Executive order which we think would be appropriate
and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which should
be submitted to the White House.

insure, among other things, domestic tranquility; to provide for the common
defense; and to promote the general welfare for the people of the United States:

The Attorney General
:
Based on this study, we believe that had there never been a
single one of the Presidential directives in question the FBI would have
conducted and will, through necessity, continue to conduct the same intelli-
genco-type investigations as were conducted from 1939 to the present date.
We also believe, however, that in order to counter the criticism and skepti-
cism of such individuals as Professor Elliff and Senator Sam J. Ervin that
an up-to-date Exccutive order should be issued clearly establishing & need
for intelligence-type investigations and delineating a clear authority for the
FBI to conduct such investigations based on guidelines established by the
Attorney General and adhering to constitutional principles.
The study concluded with two basic recommendations.
1) That the Department of Justice be requested to sponsor comprehensive
legislation spelling out the FBI's investigative authority in the collection of
intelligence information reinding to the matthal security and; 2) that the
Department of Justico be requested to seck a comprehensive Executive order
which would cover any posable gap between statutory authority and Executive
necessity in protection of the notional security.
At first glance these recommendations may appear to contradict
our position that we already, have statutory authority to conduct security-type
investigations; that this being the case we do not need additional legislative
enactments, nor do we need an Executive order. But being realistic we think
that the basic statutes upon which we rely for our authority to conduct
domestic intelligence investigations need to be updated to fit 1973 needs.
Title 16 U.S.C. Sections 2308, 2384, and 2335 relate to the national security,
but the legislative history of 2363 and 2384 indicates that they were designed
for the Civil War era, not the I wentieth Century, and Section 2385 has been
reduced to a fragile shell by the Supreme Court. These statutes are unques-
tionably still valid, but updating is certainly indicated. The bills introduced
as II.R. 6046 and S. 1400 in the 93rd Congress appear to contain language which
should fill our statutory necds, except perhaps for those groups, such as the
Ku Klux Klan, which do not seek to overthrow the Government, but never-
theless are totalitarian in nature and seek to deprive constitutionally guaranteed
rights.

O
For your information, our own investigative guidelines as con-
tained in our Manual of Instructions relating to domestic subversive investiga-
tions have been completely rewritten to conform with the concept that our
domestic intelligence-type investigations are based on Federal statutes. These
guidelines provide that in each instance, the domestic intelligence investigation
must be predicated on information indicating that the organization or individual
is engaged in activity which could involve a violation of specific statutes relating
to the national sccurity. A copy of the new guidelines was previously provided
to the Department of Justice in connection with the request of Senator Edward I.
Kenohdy to obtain a copy of the FBI's Section 87 of the Manual of Instructions.
The effective date of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.

killing of police officers who, by their uniform, are a symbol of the democratic
establishment; hijacking of aircraft in furtherance of revolutionary movements;
terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic personnel and establishments; and open
declaration of war on our form of government are only a few of the violent acts
which have been perpetrated by domestic subversives who seek to destroy or
seriously cripple our Government. Tcrrorist guerrilla attacks which were
once confined to far away places and related to problems of no immediate con-
cern of ours are now possible in this country. Foreign terrorist groups in
collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for an airport massacre of
the type which recently cecurred in Israel. Other foreign torrorist elements
have laid plans for terrorist attacks on American soil. Already one foreign
official has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.
It would be folly to adopt an investigative policy based on
the concept of investigation only when there is reason to believe a crime
involving the national security has been committed. The FBI must
obviously anticipate the crimes described above. We believe that in
order for the Government to be in position to defend itself against revolu-
tionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient
investigative authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not
normally associated with enforcement of the statutes. In other words we
think the President has the inherent Executive power to expand by further
defining the FBI's investigative authority to enable it to develop advance
information concerning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-
tionaries who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we
also believe that such expanded authority must be formally set forth in an
Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney
General's expressed interest in lying more formal guidelines to our work
in areas where definition is not now clear.
We consider the issuance of a new Executive order delineating
our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intelligence
information relating to the national security to be a very important and high
priority matter. We believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney General
under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.

the "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to
identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.
that this was the only document he was able to locate
which may have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the
referred to memorandum may be located among the collection
of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel
the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
book contained the following pertinent information:
Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM
FDR departed the White House for a visit
to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-
vania.
Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned
to White House at 8:45 AM.
9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from
9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.
(Note *
There is no entry in this book
for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
it is interesting to note that. FDR met
Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
his office in the White House. SCHEWE
also pointed out that this meeting was
significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/24/36, immediately after returning
from an extended trip. This, according
to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice.

There was no record in the White House
Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that

In connection with our investigations of staff members for
captioned Committee, we have developed derogatory information on two
individuals which has been brought specifically to the attention of William Miller,
Staff Director of the Committee. One of these involved Mrs. Diane Eloise
LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not
love America." The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the
U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society.
Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information
was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were
delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the same
data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters.
On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation concerning
M
2014
Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a prie
supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care stated
he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination. He termed her a troubl
maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described
her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability. It
also was pointed out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as
unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow employees.
Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.
FORDED CO
On 4-2-75 Miller advised Inspector Bowers he had considered the
matter involving Mrs. LaVoy and had discussed it with the Committee Chairman,
and they had decided to proceed with her as a staff member since they did not feel
the derogatory remarks by her sister-in-law were sufficiently strong enough to
disqualify her since the remainder of the investigation was favorable.

4-14-75
Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division
concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to
counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the
Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:
(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this
Division has had with Fred B. Criffith of the Inspection Division, it .
appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be
classified confidential under Executive order 11652.
(2) Before making any determination as to whether wo
make such information available to the Senate Celect Committee, it
would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to
such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be
consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted
Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested
he dctermine from CIA what their position in this regard is.
(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast
position that this information not be made available to the Committee or
that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for
this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such
as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the
Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
Miller also advised on 4-2-75 that their review of the Ellison
investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and
he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only
real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff.
Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.
This request was conveyed to CIA by Section Chief William Cregar of the
Intelligence Division who subsequently advised that Charles Kane, Director of
Security, CIA, had reviewed the file on Ellison and agreed there was sufficient
cause to question her suitability for assignment to the Select Committee staff.
Kane stated CIA Director Colby concurred in this observation.
These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated
at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to
purely administrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive
or classified information in connection with her responsibilities.
RECOMMENDATION:
For information.

Reference Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams memorandum
dated 3/20/75 captioned as above and letter of Senator Frank Church
dated 3/19/75.
Relet requested, among other things, the titles and number
of FBI field office agents assigned to internal security, intelligence
collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities,
together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters,
operations and activities (page 3, item IIIC of relet).
The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal
Counsel Division, through the Intelligence Division, the response, attached
herewith, to the above request.
It is noted the request specifically mentions internal security,
intelligence collection and counterintelligence matters. Our response has
been constructed in the traditional two categories of internal security and
counterintelligence. Intelligence collection (informants) is included in the
data for both of the other categories as appropriate.
RECOMMENDATION:
That this memorandum with enclosure be forwarded to the
Intelligence Division for review, classification and approval and, thereafter,
forwarded to the Legal Counsel Division which is coordinating replies to
the Senate Select Committee.

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis
Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler
and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request
of the Deputy Attorney General.
Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested
by Burke Marshall and F.A. O. Schwarz, III, who are consultant and General
Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with
him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating
to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he
has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also
is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having
a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be
best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine
whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities
and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to send a
representative to the meeting. REC 44

The Deputy Attorney General said that he would, of course,
advise us orally or in writing of the results of his conference with Mr. Marshall
and Mr. Schwarz.

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to the procedure
currently being employed in responding to the Committee's requests
and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the
Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Committee of
Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate
a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the
policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community
in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James

On 3-19-75 Inspectors John B. Hotis, David W. Bowers,
and Special Agent Paul V. Daly met with William Miller, Staff Director;
Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr., Chief Counsel; and Michael T. Epstein of
the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff. During the meeting Mr. Schwarz
requested a briefing be arranged for staff members of SSC concerning the
operations of the Intelligence Division, that they be furnished copies of training
documents pertaining to matters handled by the Intelligence Division, and that
they be furnished a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field. He pointed
out the aforementioned material would greatly assist in the SSC staff developing
an understanding of the Intelligence Division operations and hopefully prevent
misunderstandings or needless requests of the FBI.
Mr. Miller advised that Senators Frank Church and John Tower
intended to contact the Director in the immediate future to discuss arrangements
relating to the SSC's review of the FBI activities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) Intelligence Division review and where possible make available
training documents relating to training concerning Intelligence Division matters
and a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field, or recommend a counter offer,

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been
reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that
Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last
meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The
Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia
the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's
representative.
I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking
the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the
Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring
into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney
General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that
the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was
his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be
willing to undertake that responsibility.
It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was
interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed
a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as
possible with the Deputy Attorney General.

for the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with respect to intelligence activities. On 10/5/73,
representatives of our Washington Field Office, (WHO)
interviewed Mr. Miller, with Bureau approval, [relative to
contacts he had had with members of the Soviet Embassy,
Washington, D. C✓ ✓ At that time, Mr. Miller was the
Director of the Special Senate Committee to Terminate the
National Emergency. On that occasion he was most coopera-
tive, and upon being advised that the FBI's interest in
[Soviet Embassy personnel focused more on their personalities
rather than Soviet policies per se, Mr. Miller agreed to
be interviewed whenever the FBI felt such was necessary.
WFO has recently conducted an interview with
Mr. Albert Ashton Lakeland, Jr., Executive Assistant to
Senator Jacob Javits of New York, relative to his pasi con-
tacts with Grigoriy A. Rapota, a former Third Secretary
assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C. Rapota
was a known officer of the Committee for State Security
(KGB), Political Branch (PB), who was extremely active on
Capitol Hill. (s) In the course of the interview with
Mr. Lakeland, he advised that among others Mr. William G.

Rapota and possibly other Soviets. WFO has noted that
Mr. Miller is also known to have been in contact with
Aleksandr A. Kokorev, a First Secretary of the Soviet
Embassy, Washington, D. C., and a known officer of the
Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). (S).
•
While Mr. Miller was most cooperative on the last
occasion he was interviewed by the FBI, it is noted he did
not provide any particularly significant information con-
cerning the Soviets with whom he had contact (s) While it is
not known at this time whether he could presently provide
meaningful information, an interview with him at this time,
when he is now the Staff Director of the Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations, could well be untimely and
indiscreet.
ACTION:
(1) In view of impending contacts which will be
had by FBIHQ with Mr. Miller, the purpose of this memorandum
is to draw attention to the fact that Mr. Miller has had
_ past contact with representatives of Soviet intelligence
services and may be continuing to have same.

(2) If you agree, there is attached a communication

at this time and instructs that office to promptly advise
FBIHQ of any additional contacts between Mr. Miller and
representatives of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.,
which may come to its attention. (5)

ambiguities requiring recontact with Committee staffs; the
assignment of research responsibilities to substantive Divisions;
following such responsibilities to insure timely responses;
as well as representing the FBI on the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Review of
the Intelligence Community. Assistant Director John A. Mintz is
also a member of the Executive Committee. This latter responsi-
bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not
only with senior officials of the intelligence community but
also with the President's counsel.
Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3
Section, Intelligence Division will act as Cregar's Number One
Man; will administer the work of the Project; and act in the
absence of Cregar.
Seymor F. Phillips, Unit Chief, Civil Disorders
Reporting Unit, IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division will serve
as the Review Coordinator for the Project. His responsibilities
will be to review all research; coordinate all responses; be
available to consult with substantive Divisions as to proper
form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions
where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;
as well as to insure the quality, completeness and adequacy
of responses to Select Committees requests. Additionally,
Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts
to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA
Headquarters. This Registry established by the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence
of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism
for the entire intelligence community.
Mr. Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Officer with CIA, CI-4

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Senstudy 75
Re:
Because of the White House insistence that all requests
and responses be completely coordinated and available for review
by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project
have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access
to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select
Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI
documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized
(excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain
copies of the sanitized documents but also copies of the original
text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been
requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.
In addition to the above, there will be stenographic
and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the
work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more
personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the
present time. Should the requests of the Select Committees
require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be
submitted with a complete justification for additional personnel
assigned to the Project.
Although the physical space for the Project is
limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75
will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This
space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.
As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,
Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should
any member of the intelligence community get requests from other
Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence
community; could be of interest to the White House; or are of such
sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the
requests and an abstract of the responses should be made
available to the Interagency Registry.

My memorandum to you 4/10/75, tickler copies as
above, advised of the formal establishment of a task force
called Project Senstudy 75 for the purpose of implementing responses
to requests for information from Senate and House Select Committees 1
on Intelligence Activities.
From time to time, requests will be made of various
Divisions at FBIHQ for assistance in preparing responses. The
Office of Legal Counsel has already contributed considerably in
support of Senstudy 75 and is an integral part of the Project.
UNRECORDED COPY FILED IN 116464.
In order that we may keep an up-to-date record of the
cost to the Bureau in handling this Project, each Assistant Director =
is requested to effect the necessary procedures to maintain such
records and by the third of each month furnish by routing slip to
W. O. Cregar, Room 4063, JEH Building, the following information:
(1) Name of Division reporting; (2) Month for which reporting,
which will be month just ended; (3) Man days devoted to Project
assistance, broken down by (a) Agent and (b) clerical, including
GS level for both Agent and clerical. An example submitted by
5/3/75 would be as follows: (1) GID%3B (2) Report for 4/75%; (3) (a)
one-half day @ GS-16%;B one day @ GS-15%3B three days @ GS-14%;B (3) (b)
two days @ GS-7%3B two days @ GS-5.
This is effective commencing 4/1/75 and first routing
slip report due 5/3/75 will be for the month of April, 1975.
If a Division has not participated during the preceding
month, merely submit a routing slip to this effect.
The cooperation of all is urged so that the necessary
cost data may be compiled each month. It is recognized that exact
figures will not be feasible and that estimates will be most
practical and will C-4302-116395
suffice

The concept behind the establishment of this Project
is to develop a capability of implementing requests received
from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and
timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct
its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.
We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to
meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the
exception of the research that will have to be done in the
substantive Divisions.
UNRECORDED COPY FILED IN 1146-
s
While the Project will direct internal work and
related liaison with the intelligence community and the
White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Office
of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary
point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the
Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all
responses to these Committees. In addition, they will meet
with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness
of requests. If necessary, they will call upon the expertise
of the substantive Division for determination as to whether
a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to
within a reasonable period of time and within the capabilities
of the FBI's information retrieval syster-100 62-11--375
At the present time four Supervisors have been
delegated to work exlusively on the Project. They are as

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
From a review of the table of contents of this Manual it can
be seen that the material contained in this Manual pertains
to administrative rather than investigativo operations of
the FEI, and for that reason it has not been possible to
select portions of this Manual which portain directly to
internal security, intolligonco collection, und/or counter-
intelligence matters, operations, or activities rosponsive
to the Committee's request. The various other requests
contained in the Committee letter of March 10, 1075, are
receiving attention and further responso will be forthcoming
at the carliest possible timo.

NOTE:
Table of contents for Manual of Instructions and
Manual of Rules and Regulations, as well as the several Sections
of the Manual of Instructions which are being transmitted to
the Select Committee, have already been made available to the
General Accounting Office in the past, with the exception of
Section 36, Section 105, and Section 107, Part II, Sections
105, 107, Part I and Part II, and Section 130 are not being
furnished to the Committee, but the Committee will be allowed
to examine these Sections at FBIHQ, Section 36, dealing with
espionage, although classified, does not contain sensitive
material involving sources and we feel in the spirit of the
requirement we should furnish this Section to the Committee.
As a matter of interest, all of the material with
respect to the Manual of Instructions which has been made
available to GAO is actually maintained in FBI space.

As you were previously advised, William Miller, Staff Director
of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, requested that we
provide a briefing for certain staff members of the Committee on the functions
of the Intelligence Division. He asked that the briefing cover both internal
security and foreign counterintelligence operations and that it provide a broad
overview of our investigative responsibilities.
N24/175
The Intelligence Division is prepared to offer a two-hour briefing
beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 4-11-75. It will include a slide show to
be followed by a general discussion and an opportunity to afford questions. and
answers. After a luncheon break, the staff members will be given a brief tour
of the Files and Communications Division.
Since the briefing will cover classified materials, no staff
members will be invited unless they have appropriate security clearances. As
a consequence Professor John Elliff, who has been tentatively named Director
of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence, will not attend. It
is hoped that we may provide him with a private meeting at some later date.

on page A31 contains an article reporting an interview of Senator Frank
Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is
reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is
accepting nothing with "strings attached.

M
Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the
FBI is furnishing information to, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's
statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate
Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as
classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.
Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted
Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee
concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA
Director William E. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that
this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of
4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O.
Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position
that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House
should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared
to send a letter over his signature to Senator Church to obtain such clarification.
EX-110
REC-462-116393

Inasmuch as the request by this Committee was forwarded through
the Department, Senator Church's statement was brought to the attention of
Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling
all FBI responses to Senate Select Committee requests. Marvin indicated he
was concerned at Church's statement and stated it was the Attorney General's
desire that he be advised of any Bureau response to the Committee concerning 1975
this matter.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as
the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were
Mr. Roderick Hills, Assistant Counsel to the President; Associate
Deputy AG Wilderotter; Mr. John Clarke; as well as senior officials
from Defense, Treasury, National Security Council, Office of
Management and Budget, and the Energy Research and Development
Administration.
The following items of interest were discussed:
Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting
with the Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Select Com-
mittee (SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members
of a particular agency were being interviewed by SSC staff person-
nel.
The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being
receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon
each agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific
arrangements for such representation with the SSC. Hills also
discussed the problem of the unknown employee or former employee
who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent
agency. It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by
Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff
member, that the staff member attempt to determine the scope of
this individual's testimony and then REGs such testimony with
the parent agency to insure the agency could provide advice
to the sensitivity of the unknown employee's testimony. No firm
decisions were made but it would appear the Counsel, and S124675

Director will agree to allow Counsel to be present during the

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony
the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of
the SSC in an Executive Session. It is anticipated more
definitive information on the final decisions regarding this
aspect will be forthcoming from the White House.
The question was raised by the Bureau representative
as to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry
should be notified as to requests members of the Intelligence
Community receive from other Congressional committees. Mr.
Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question;
however, if a request from a Congressional committee other than
the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community,
involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White
House, such requests should be provided to the interagency
registry along with an abstract of the response.
Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff
who have been certified for access to compartmented information.
Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow
out of Select Committee deliberations. The pencil notation in
the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelli-
gence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses
these issues. It is noted that issue identified as number eight
is entitled, "Intelligence Files and Privacy." Mr. Colby asked
that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised
that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and
agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline
for completion of the study is 4/25/75.
Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility,
Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and
technical security. None of the participants of the EXCOM had any
objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by
the procedures outlined in the attached survey report.
✓
Attached also for information is a draft of an employee
notice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material
being considered by the SSC. It is to be noted that to date neither
the Committee nor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

˚ B.. Access Controls
Access to the Dirksen Building is gained by either the
main entrance on 1st and C Streets, ground level, or the
Basement Tunnel Entrance at the rear of the building. Both
entrances have a 24-hour guard post where persons entering
are checked for identification.. Brief cases and packages
are processed through x-ray machines. Vendors entering the
main entrance are checked for ID, however, all boxes are not
checked.
·
Entry into the auditorium is controlled by a guard at the
door. His instructions are that all persons entering must
show an ID card. Visitors are permitted only by appointment.
They are logged in. and escorted at all times while in the
auditorium. From 1800 hours Friday through 0800 hours Saturday.
and from 1300 hours Saturday to 07.00 hours Monday everyone "must"
sign the log in and out and show an ID. In the event an access
problem arises at the guard post, regardless of the hour, Mr.
Marshall is alerted.

Guards
"
The Dirksen Building and the auditorium are protected by
members of the U. S. Capitol Police Department. The Building
has two 24-hour/7day-a-week guard posts at the entrances while
the Senate Select Committee has one 24-hour/7 day-a-week guard
post at the entrance and an after-hours roving patrol inside.
the auditorium. All police officers are well trained, wear
the Capitol Police uniform and carry Smith and Wesson 38 caliber
revolvers. After-hour patrols check all doors, the entire
auditorium for classified material that may not have been
secured, and the second floor hourly during the night. The
guards on duty at the time of the survey were alert and
responsive to their duties. During off-duty hours, guard
supervisors make at least two unscheduled visits to the guard
posts during each shift. In addition the guard at the
stationary post has four telephones, two of which have a pickup
and automatic ring feature with Capitol Police Headquarters.
There will be no rotation of police officers during the
occupancy of the Committee. The same officers will be assigned
to these posts.

be stored in the Remington Rand safes. The documents in the
Remington Rand safes can be drawn by anyone on the staff, but
must be receipted for with the Registry Officer. The documents
are to be read on the tables placed there for that purpose in
the Research Section.
Further control of classified documents is directed through
the assigning of a staff employee given responsibility for the
reproduction of documents on the xerox machine.
He will con-
trol the number of copies made on typewriters.
All classified material is secured in safes at the end of
the working day.
H.
Classified Waste
•
It is estimated that one 50-pound bag of classified waste
will be generated each week while the Committee is in session.
Once the bag is filled with classified waste, it will be
placed in the locked trunk of Mr. Marshall's automobile and
taken to the Federal Reserve Building incinerator where he
will witness destruction by burning. In the event this incin-
erator is booked to capacity, he will take the classified waste
and burn it at the D. C. incinerator. Should either incin-
erator become unavailable to the Committee, Mr. Marshall was
assured that CIA would consider assisting him in the secure
disposition of Committee classified waste.
˚ I. Compartmented/TS Storage
11
A room dedicated as the codeword/TS storage room is in
the northeast corner of the auditorium. Its five walls are
solid masonry ranging from 6" to 8" thick. A 1/8" stainless
steel door frame is bolted to the masonry walls. A pre-
fabricated 9 gage wire cross-patch metal frame door is attached
to the steel frame serving as access control to the dedicated
room. The door will be secured by lock and key once classified
material arrives for storage. This room will be alarmed.
J. Telephone
The Facility has six standard telephones in the auditorium.
Five of the telephones will be equipped with conversation

Washington, D. C..
I
•
1. In response to a request from Mr. Ben Marshall, Security
Director, Senate Select Committee, (tele. 224-1700) Messrs.
Nicholas R. Zubon and Robert E. Burgener conducted a comprehensive
security survey of the Senate. Select Committee's Facility on
24 March 1975.
2. Mr. Marshall provided both a comprehensive tour of the
facility and a detailed explanation of the operation.
. 3.
The following are pertinent facts concerning the security
procedures as related to the Senate Select Committee Facility:
A. Type of Facility
-
The Committee is in the auditorium (Room G. 308) of the Dirksen
. Building at 1st and C Streets, N. E., Washington, D. C. Access to
the auditorium is gained easiest by entering the building from the
1st and C Streets entrance. A 24-hour guard post is located just
inside this entrance. The Select Committee facility is 40' east:
of the building guard post. It is nearly in direct line of sight,
however, a foyer surrounded by a 6' high temporary partition pre-
cludes the auditorium entrance door from being visible. The
entrance to the auditorium is protected by a 24-hour guard post.
The auditorium (Room G. 308) is approximately 100' long x 45'
wide. The floor, ceiling and walls are made of 6" to 8" solid
masonry. The ceiling has a false ceiling approximately 18" deep
in which the air handling equipment and sundry other service
components are housed. All major air handling equipment is on
the roof above the auditorium. Access to the roof which is strictly
controlled by the Director of Security, is gained by a stairway
in the southeast corner of the auditorium. The sidewalls each have
a 2' x 3' register approximately 12' above the floor through which

ir
D. . Alarms :
"
All exterior doors to the auditorium will have contact
(microswitch) alarms. The Remington Rand safes, being
obsolete, will be protected by a proximity alarm. The
compartmented storage room and an adjacent reading area
will be protected by a volumetric alarm. For fire pro-
tection a smoke detector/rate of rise alarm will be
installed in the compartmented area. All alarms will
enunciate at the guard desk at the entrance to the
auditorium. The ADT Company will install and maintain
the alarms.
E. Safes
The facility has 22 safes. Sixteen 4-drawer Remington
Rand Safes located below the movie screen. Three class six.
Mosler 5-drawer, two class 1 Diebold 2-drawer, and one class
2 Diebold four-drawer are located in the compartmented storage
room. With the exception of the Remington Rand safes, all
other safes are in good working order.
•
The safe combination and repairs are under contract with
the Safemaster Company. The safe combinations were recently
changed by that company. All safe combinations are under the
control of Mr. Marshall. However, an assist on day-to-day
operations is provided by Mr. Pat Shea, Assistant Staff
Director, who acts as backup for safeguarding the combinations
to the safes in the compartmented storage room. Messrs. Larry
Kieves, John Petersen and Ms. Jan Orloff are backup for the
combinations to the sixteen Remington Rand Safes. Mr. Marshall
was given two change keys in the event he decides to change the
combination himself should staff personnel rotate.
.

III
F. Document Control
Incoming CIA documents will be delivered by Agency courier
to the guard at the entrance door to the auditorium. The
registry officer will receipt for them and take them to the
Registry Section where all documents will be logged. Com-
partmented and Top Secret material will be taken to the Com-
partmented Storage Room and placed in a safe after it has
been logged in Registry. Individuals, on an access list
promulgated by Mr. Marshall draw the compartmented documents
from the safes but must read them in the adjacent area dedicated
for this purpose. Documents classified below TS/Codeword will

masking devices. A central switch installed ahead of the
telephone instruments will disconnect all telephones
simultaneously, should the need arise. The telephone system
is maintained by the local telephone company.
K. Security Briefings
All new members of the committee receive a thorough
briefing from Mr. Marshall on security procedures and
security responsibilities. Briefings are periodically
reinforced when conditions warrant..
L. Security Duty Check Procedures
Custodians secure the safe cabinets assigned to them,
i.e. Mr. Shea, codeword room, Messrs. Kieves, Petersen,
and Ms. Orloff, Research area. Mr. Marshall double checks
behind them. The custodian, Security Director and the
roving guard patrol check the entire auditorium to ensure
all classified material has been secured at the end of the
day.
M.
Counteraudio Inspection
Mr. Marshall has taken action on this requirement and
continues to monitor this area to provide the Committee.
with as much security protection against the Audio threat
as possible..
N.
Shredder
The facility has one Destroyit Model 51 Shredder used
only for shredding the most sensitive documents. Other
documents are not shredded in this machine because of its
limited shredding capability.
10. General Observations
The security procedures implemented within the Senate.
Select Committee facility are sufficient to provide a proper
environment for the protection of classified materials. The
survey officers were pleased with the security director's
dedication to the objective of providing the best security
possible for the Committee.

air is passed from the auditorium to the air handling equip-
ment on the roof. These registers are solidly bolted into
the walls.
The front of the auditorium (south wall) is covered by
a large movie screen. To the right and left of the movie
screen are two rooms 6' wide and approximately 15' long used.
by the research section clerical personnel. These rooms
have countertop openings approximately 3' above the floor
for access from within the auditorium. Countertop openings
exist along both sidewalls for approximately three quarters.
of the length of the wall. The sidewalls have intercorridors
on the opposite side of the countertops which have been con-
verted into unpartitioned office space. The only reproduction
machine, a xerox model 3100, is located in the west corridor.
The east corridor has been converted into a compartmented
information storage room and a compartmented document reading
room. The Security Director indicated that he may move his
office to the head of the compartmented reading room to provide
a larger measure of access control to this sensitive area.
The auditorium has six wooden exterior doors, 7' high and
3" thick. The entrance door into the auditorium (west and
north wall) will have an electrical push-button lock installed.
A similar door in the east end of the north wall will be barred
and bracketed on the inside to prevent unauthorized entry. The.
west wall has 2 exterior doors leading into the Capitol Police
offices. The east wall has two exterior doors with one leading
to the roof while the second door exits into the Capitol Police
Garage. All exterior doors will be alarmed. The doors now
have Yale 197 1/4 locks with the keys controlled by Mr. Marshall.
The fire safety factor concerning these locked doors was dis-
cussed with him.
The auditorium has a small second floor area at the north
end. Access is gained by two stairways on the east and west
side of the auditorium. The second floor space consists of a
large projection room, currently filled with projection equip-
ment, and five small private film viewing rooms.
The five small rooms will be converted into witness inter-
view rooms. The windows in each of these rooms will be covered
during the stay of the Select Committee in the auditorium.

HISPAIN IS UNCLACE
DATEL 178-0157 SP-ZALM/316
In previous sessions we discussed the importance of
highlighting issues likely to grow out of Commission or
Committee deliberations. We observed that we should identify
some of those on which a legal brief or annex would be helpful
to Executive Branch initiatives. The idea was to select, a
. few where a solid research paper with options, pros and cons,
etc., could help us develop a firm grip on the questions in
the issue and identify options. For example, the question of
Executive privacy presents itself, and I gather is being
worked on.
There are others we feel it would be useful for the group
to address and assign responsibility for further work.
For
example:

The study prepared for the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel-
ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC). The major contributors to this report were
the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and
for that reason any requests from any committees of the
Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the
White House. At the present time, the consensus of those
persons in the White House dealing with the subject of release
of information to the committees of Congress is that this
report will not be provided Congressional committees at this
time.

"
The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with
the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating
department. CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled
"The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested
be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the
Intelligence Community. A copy of CIA's paper referred to above
has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has
indicated he will be in direct contact with Mr. Warner, CIA's
General Counsel.

of the originating Department and an assessment by the
senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department
as to the potential risk to the national security and to the
intelligence sources and methods involved.
F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The
establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-
bution and protection of classified information and material
under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior
approval of the head of a Department or his designee.
5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:
(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community and
then disseminated to members of the community under the
authority of the DCI;
(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
Department may not be sent by the State Department to
the Department of Commerce without the permission of the
CIA;
(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's
Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or
to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,
a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA
information should be referred to CIA for action so that
the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

The Third Agency Rule
1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was
included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense
information originating in another Department or agency" to an
agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep-
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authorizes
the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-
gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where
appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".
2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate
intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is
the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-
nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is an homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the
receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.
3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the
following controls: Sec. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The
originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
and material, including those which presently relate to communications
intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.
4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order
11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security
Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-
fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This
directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have
four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:
A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a
security clearance, a person must have a need for access
to the particular classified information or material sought
in connection with the performance of his official duties or

(d) If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations
with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation
in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has
received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-
tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would
not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence.

If I am requested to provide certain materials and
investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document
which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence
Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor
will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin.
6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation
being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-
relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence
community. Clearing each and every such reféience with overy
agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time
and manpower...
7. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure.
Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the
material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will
be made with the appropriate Third Agency organizations before
release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly
or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the
agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select
Committee without an item-by-item, mention-by-mention clearance
with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such
material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

MEMORANDUM FOR: USİB Ad Hoc Group
SUBJECT:
Sanitization Guidelines for Documents
Provided Congressional Select
Committees
1. Attached is a copy of a statement, "Guidelines for
Sanitizing Certain Documents Provided Select Committees"
prepared by the Chairman, USIB Security Committee, for
consideration by the Ad Hoc Group. This step is a follow on to
the understanding the DCI has with Senator Church that sanitization
of selective documents will be undertaken before the documents
are released to the Committee. Similar understandings have been
discussed with House Staff as well.
2. It is important that, to the extent possible, all intelligence
‘organizations follow generally the same sanitization guidelines.
Accordingly, the USIB Ad Hoc Group should consider utilizing these
or similar guidelines within their respective organizations.
3. If requested by the Chairman, the DCI will discuss
orally with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate and House
Select Committees the content of the sensitive USIB or CIA material
excised from documents. Where appropriate, the DCI may discuss
this sensitive material with the entire Select Committee. He
considers it essential that the written record provided to the
Committee staff not include such sensitive information for the
protection of intelligence sources and methods..

GUIDELINES FOR SANITIZING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS
· PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES
.1. The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed
with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment
by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence
activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need.
Included in such matters are the identities of sensitive sources, the
material provided to the United States by cooperating foreign
intelligence services, the details of technical devices and systems
and of operational methods, the identities of certain employees whose
safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the identities of American
citizens and organizations who have cooperated with US intelligence
and some additional materials the public disclosure of which would
create serious foreign policy or national security problems. Such
material should be protected not only from exposure but indeed the
risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given to the need
to protect certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,
might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

2. One form of this special consideration may include use
of sanitization procedures to avoid the risk of exposing such matters
and at the same time satisfy the Select Committee's need for a full
understanding of the community's activities.
3. What May Be Sanitized
While it is not possible to anticipate all requirements which
may be levied by the Committees for documenting material and not
possible to determine specifically what material should be excised
from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in
certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases should meet
the test mentioned above..
4. Collection of Intelligence
(a) The Committee will probably address the matter of how
intelligence activities or methods have or may impinge upon individual
rights. Documents supporting responses may be sanitized by removal
of identities of sensitive agents and informants, covert personnel,
and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive phrase may be
substituted, i. e., a foreign journalist, a political official in the
opposition party. No sanitization should be used in connection with

names of individuals whose employment or former employment by,
or association with a department or agency, does not remain secret
or for individuals whose present or future activities on behalf of the
department or agency do not require that previous cover arrangements
remain secret.
H
444 95
(b) Some information may be required with respect to
technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communications
activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of such material
is currently handled in compartmentation control channels under
various codewords or nicknames. No security threat is perceived
by release of these codenames or nicknames in documents. Details
of the technical systems involved, contractual arrangements, funding
and/or names of companies or consultants whose participation was
obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from
documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be
referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the
Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in
the community's sanitization procedure. While documentary samples
of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used in support of
verbal testimony, no raw product should be provided the Committees

· for retention. If absolutely required by the Committees, sanitization
of such raw product should be conducted to mask the degree of
technical capabilities.
5. Intelligence Estimates
Finished intelligence reports of departments and agencies and
estimates do not usually contain source identifications and will not
normally require sanitization. However, departments and agencies
should review such publications to ensure deletion of source identities.

This proposed use of sanitization as a special arrangement.
to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select
Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not
practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.
It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt
to employ the same criteria for sanitization and coordinate as
required. This paper can serve only as general guidelines on
sanitization.

content. Use of a substitution device, either pseudonym or ident
is an example of sanitization which permits intelligent continuity
of the material without revealing the true identity. Sanitization
does not extend to the use of false or misleading substitute material
in this context.
The integrity of official records must be maintained. The
following sanitization techniques apply only to copies of records.
(a) Physical Sanitization
-
Names may be cut out and
the residual material xeroxed and submitted to Committees. Names
may be masked with correction tape and then xeroxed. The xerox
copy may be submitted to the Committees.

(b) Names may be deleted and replaced with "IDEN.
The defted material is provided on a separate IDEN list which
contains names or descriptive phrases substituted for deletions.
(c) The material can be retyped or reprinted with
substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which do not reveal
the sensitive material.
(d) Entire pages can be removed from some documents

and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference information

E
as to the location of the sensitive material within the contributing
department or agency. This technique may be employed when
physical sanitization or excision of material results in unintelligible
gibberish as residue.
(e) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable to
extract a complete document from requested material when the
request is broad and all inclusive within its field. The existence
of such a document should be made known to the Committees but
(retained by the agency or department for review under escort
of a representative of the department or agency.
10. Management of Sanitization
The original record and a copy of the sanitized version provided
should be readily available in all cases. Materials developed within an
agency or department in response to requests should be reviewed at an
appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness and accuracy. In
the case of documents or materials of a community nature, the release
should be done in coordination with the departments or agencies and/or
the Program Manager concerned and any sanitization should be agreed
upon during coordination.

(n) Names of firms collaborating with US intelligence
agencies in collection and assessment programs (especially
those having large foreign clienteles).
(o) Proprietary information relating to contractors
or furnished in confidence..
8. What Should Not Be Sanitized
"I
There are general categories of intelligence activities which
have already been placed in the public domain by the mass news media
or authors with background experience in intelligence departments
for agencies of the community. Names, places, dates and events.
which have been so revealed should not be excised if contained in
requested documents.
There is an increasing body of information which has been
released under the Freedom of Information Act. No further sanitization
of this material should be conducted unless it relates to an individual's
rights to privacy.
9. Techniques of Sanitization
Sanitization of intelligence material is usually considered the
act of physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing
from written communication with or without regard for the residual

DAB11-18-01 BY SP. 7 ALM
On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental
Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities, Senator Tower ond
I want to thank you for the opportunity we had on March 5 to discuss
the work of the Committee. I want to express my personal appreciation
for the direct and forthright manner in which you addressed some of
the initial questions that lay before the Select Committee, and your
willingness to assist the Committee to meet its responsibilities under .
the mandate of S. Rec. 21.
We are in agreement that the work of the Committee should proceed
as expeditiously as possible and the Committee is gratified at the full
and complete cooperation that we have received from the Executive
agencies up to this point. In every respect thus far, the agencies
have been fully cooperative with the Committee and the staff and I .
believe this augers well for a constructive and expeditious conclusion
to our inquiry.
•
At our meeting on March 5th with you, we discussed the general
areas in which the Committee would need initial documentation.
As we
discussed, our first requirements are to determine the legal basis
for the activities for the intelligence agencies of the United States
Government. In this regard, it will be helpful to the Committee to
receive from whomever you may designate, the documents, files, and
other papers that might be required to fully determine the legal basis
for the activities of United States intelligence agencies. With the
unanimous approval of the Committee, I respectfully request that the
documents on the attached list directly relevant to the inquiry
authorized by S. Res. 21, be supplied to the Committee at the earliest
opportunity.
With kind regards,

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75
With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated
they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they
have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their
request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted
until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review
they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their
request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents
listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee,
a copy of which is attached.
Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their
response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that
Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, 4-9-75, and he felt strongly that they
must have material that showed progress in their study of the FBI prior to that
time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in
a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to
be made at one time.
It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon
as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting
Office (GAO) which also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select
Committee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with
GAO auditors concerning the FBI.
By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of
the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point
they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response
to their various requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification
of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for
investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence
Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary response
to the Senate Select Committee.

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a
request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions
of the Committee's request.
I
-
Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division
pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable
file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of
the FBI to "(1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence
information, and (3) engage in counter-intelligence activities; together with
copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential
directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials
asserted as sources of such authority." With regard to Part III concerning the
FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel
in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the
Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of
Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest
to foreign intelligence sources.
M
On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed
these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee;
John T. Elliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee
looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select
Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request
in Part III to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division need not be.
identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart
to be furnished them pursuant to their request of 3-19-75. They asked as an
alternative the Bureau prepare a list of personnel in the Intelligence Division down
to the level of Unit Chief with names included which they would have access to
review in Bureau space.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all
responses for the production of records, etc., received from Congressional
committees be forwarded by letterhead memorandum through the Deputy
Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected instance
a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting access
g
With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into
FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding of
documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requests
such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
have been forwarded to this Bureau through the Department, it would appear &
logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional
committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau,
be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will make
all our responses consistent but will also give the Department an opportunity
review and approve documents being made available to Congress.
*
The
ORDED COPY FL
In connection with our preparation of responses to requests of
Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by
letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe
the specific request which is being responded to in the letterhead memorandum.

Subject: Delimitation of Investigative Duties of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
Office of Naval Intelligence, the
Intelligence Division of the Army, and
the office of Special Investigations,
•Inspector General, U. S. Air Force.
The Agreement for Coordination of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office
of Naval Intelligence, Intelligence
Division of the Army, and the Office of
Special Investigations, Inspector General,
U. S. Air Force.
VI
I. The undersigned have reviewed the directive contained in the
President's Memorandum of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his
Directive of September 6, 1939, the Delimitations Agreement of
February 9, 1942, and the Presidential Directive of October 30,
1947. In addition. cognizance has been taken of the provisions
or the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, and the specific application
of that Act is set forth in Section II hereof. All other pro-
visions of this Agreement are apart from and have no relation to
the stated requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. In view of the
above, it is now agreed that responsibility for the investigation
of all activities coming under the categories of espionage,
counterespionage, subversion and sabotage (hereinafter referred
to as "these categories") will be delimited as indicated herein-
after. The responsibility assumed by one organization in a given
field carries with it the obligation to exchange freely and
directly with the other subscribing organizations all information
of mutual interest. When the organization with primary operating
responsibility is unable for any reason to produce material in
that field desired by the subscribing agencies, such special
arrangements as may be legal or desirable will be worked out
through negotiation at the national level prior to activity by
one agency in another agency's field. It is recognized by the
subscribers hereto that the Headquarters Department of the Army
has decentralized such functions to its major subordinate commanders.
When the major subordinate commanders of the Department of the
Army cannot effect satisfactory special arrangements, the matter
will be referred to the Director of Intelligence of the Army for
further negotiations at the national level. Close cooperation
and coordination between the four subscribing organizations is
a mutually recognized necessity.

2. While investigative jurisdiction over the civilian
populace in former enemy territories occupied by the armed forces

provisions are subject to direct adjustment with the Department

direction in such areas of occupation.

Agreement. Subject to the exceptions already provided for
above, general amendments or modifications involving all of the
four subscribing organizations shall be issued in the form of a

APPENDIX B
PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY
INTERESTS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW
I. In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as
potential theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander
of such a potential theater is designated, he definitely has
interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the
area. In order that the armed forces commander may prepare him-
self for the discharge of the possible responsibility which may
affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:
•
1. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OSI, IG,
U.S. Air Force will continue to function in accordance with the
provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V.
2. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take
steps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the
_ manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law
is declared. Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies
will insure that the armed forces commander will have the benefit
of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives
of the other agencies.
3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and
receive such information from the other three agencies as he may
desire and they may be able to furnish.
When
II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the
coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any
additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake.
the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it
is recognized that he is authorized to augment the coverage with
such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his
jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally
coming under the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies,
the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority
from the Secretary of Defense.
III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations
have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces
commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such
a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken.
it should be so recommended.

APPENDIX A
PERIOD OF MARTIAL LAW
I. It is further agreed that when a state of martial law has
been declared by the President, the armed forces commander will
assume responsibilities for coverage in these categories. His
authority to direct and control the subscribing agencies of the
armed forces will be limited only by such instructions as he
may receive from the Secretary of Defense. He will have authority
to coordinate the intelligence activities of the subscribing
agencies in his area of responsibility, within the limits of
their available personnel and facilities, by the assignment of
missions, the designation of objectives, and the exercise of
such coordinating control as he deems necessary. He is not
authorized to control the administration or discipline of the
subscribing agencies in the area of his responsibility, nor to
issue instructions to them beyond those necessary for the purposes
stated above.¨
II. Personnel of the subscribing agencies in the area of responsi-
bility of the armed forces commander will still send reports to
and be under the continued supervision of their respective head-
quarters. They will render such aid and assistance to the armed
forces commander and his designated representatives as are
possible and practicable. They will furnish all pertinent informa-
tion, data, and other material that are or may be necessary or
desirable to the armed forces commander by the most expeditious
means and methods possible consistent with requisite security.
Each headquarters of the subscribing agencies will promptly be
advised by its agencies of all information and data appropriately
identified as having been furnished to the armed forces commander.

(e) Consideration should be given to the fact that certain
classes of information are of general interest to the Military,
Naval, and Air Force Intelligence Services in connection with
background and knowledge of espionage and sabotage organizations,
even though the Military, Naval, and Air Force Intelligence
Services may have no apparent direct investigative interest.
(f) Should differences of opinion of a minor nature
occur, the directors of the four intelligence agencies feel that
with proper personal liaison, such differences can be satisfactorily
adjusted locally by the officials in charge of the various divisional
organizations.

Supplemental Agreement No. III
to the Delimitations Agreement
(As Amended June 8, 1950)
Investigative Jurisdiction on
Vessels of Military Sea Transportation Service
10
1. The investigative jurisdiction of all activities
under the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion
and sabotage on vessels of the Military Sea Transportation Service
is as follows:
a. Investigative jurisdiction on vessels purchased
by the Navy will be the responsibility of the Office of Naval
Intelligence.
b. Vessels obtained by the Navy through a "bare boat
charter" will be under the investigative jurisdiction of the Office
of Naval Intelligence.
c.
Vessels allocated to the Military Sea Transportation
Service which are manned and supervised by their private owners
are under the investigative jurisdiction of the FBI.
FL
3.. When civilian personnel who are subjects of an
investigation under a or b above reach a U.S. port or a port
where the FBI has a field agency, or prior to reaching such port,
if practicable, the Department of the Navy will promptly furnish
the FBI all pertinent information concerning the investigation.
If personnel who are subjects of an investigation as above remove
themselves from the vessel upon arrival of the vessel in port and
further surveillance is considered necessary, the Navy will
continue surveillance until notified by the FBI at local level
that the FBI will make every effort to transfer responsibility
upon arrival of the vessel at the port.
3. When the FBI opens an investigation under c above
or when an FBI investigation in progress develops or is believed
about to develop ramifications under a, b or c above, the FBI
will promptly furnish all pertinent information to the Navy and
will thereafter coordinate its actions with the Navy whenever and
wherever deemed necessary to insure proper pursuit of the case.

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee.
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in
a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence
in the intelligence agencies.
Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic
activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies
have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary
to prevent such abuses in the future.
Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central
Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies
involved in domestic intelligence.
The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately
40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary
background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller
indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in
this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the
FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being
furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally
satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.
Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that
he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary
Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard
was pointed out wherein the Judiciary Committee in connection with the 17
wiretaps had written us a letter indicating that if we made classified

to the Delimitations. Agreement
Cooperation and Coordination Between
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
The Intelligence Division of the Army
The Office of Naval Intelligence and
The Office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force
.
1
The Director of Intelligence, U.S. Army, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of Naval
Intelligence and the Director of the Office of Special Investi-
gations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, with a view to
promoting the closest possible cooperation and coordination
between the Field Services of these agencies agree that the
following recommendations will be transmitted to their field
installations:
(a) Special Agents in Charge of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Divisional Offices, Military Intelligence Officers
of the pertinent Armies, District Officers of the Office of
Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, and
Naval District Intelligence Officers will maintain close personal
liaison between those offices and their representatives, including
a meeting of representatives of the four agencies, preferably the
officers in charge, at least twice per month, for the purpose of
discussing pending and contemplated investigative activities, and
any other subject necessary to insure that there is proper co-
ordination of their investigative work.
(b) The close personal liaison to be maintained
between representatives of the four agencies at all times should
insure that there is not duplication of effort in any field, and
that a proper coverage of the whole investigative field is main-
tained. Particular attention should be paid to avoiding any
duplication in connection with the use of informers.
(c) A distinction should be recognized between the
investigative interest of individual agencies and the coverage
interest. It is believed that all four agencies should study,
from time to time, the coverage of the investigative field in
order to insure that all channels of interest and avenues of
information are adequately covered by at least one of the partici-
pating agencies.
(d) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the
other agencies is interested in information collected, it should
be transmitted to the other agency.

to the Delimitations Agreement
Investigation of Private Contractors
of the Armed Forces
It is agreed by the subscribers of the Delimitations
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) that with
reference investigations of civilian employees, applicants for
employment, directors and key personnel of privately owned plants
and facilities, working or bidding en contracts important to the
Army, Navy or Air Force (hereinafter referred to as the Armed
Forces) procurement, the following will be followed insofar as
practicable. Exceptions thereto will be adjusted by mutual
agreement between the subscribers concerned.
a. The Armed Forces will conduct background
investigations of such persons unless there is a particular reason
for requesting that an investigation be conducted by the FBI or
the FBI has a special interest in a particular case and has
notified the Armed Forces of such interest.
b. The FBI will conduct complaint investigations
of such personnel upon specific request in each case by one or
more of the Armed Forces. If one of the Armed Forces has no
further need for an investigation requested, but not completed,
prompt notification will be made to the FBI.
c. Investigations conducted by the Armed Forces
under a above will be terminated and all information passed to
the FBI when credible derogatory information of a loyalty nature
is uncovered. Upon receipt of such a case, the FBI will proceed
as under b above if one of the Armed Forces so requests.
d. When one of the subscribers is aware that
another is conducting an investigation on a person or firm
identical or closely connected with a person or firm it
contemplates investigating, no investigation will be under-
taken without the consent of the subscriber which has an investi-
gation in progress. The investigating agency will make available
to the other interested agency copies of the reports of the
investigation made.
e.
Normally, identity of confidential informants
will not be communicated from one subscriber to another; however,
when such communication occurs, the receiving subscriber will
employ the highest possible safeguards to insure that such informants
are not compromised. No transmittal of information concerning
confidential informants to a third subscriber or to another agency
is authorized except by specific consent of the originator.

INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES
TITLE XI, ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1970
REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES
1. General
to
Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United
States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841
through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution
and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal
offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. Administration
of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury
as is investigative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed
in section 842. Under authority contained in section 846 the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) have concurrent investigative jurisdic-
tion as to the remainder of chapter 40, i.e., the unlawful acts
proscribed in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of section
844. Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal Inspection
Service shall have jurisdiction to investigate all incidents
involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails
or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.
Title XI greatly broadens Federal authority pertaining to
explosives-connected offenses. At the same time, Congress has
expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field to the exclusion
of state law on the same subject matter. To effect both Congressional
purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is
essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully
allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI
have jurisdiction.
2. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Jurisdiction in General
(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies
only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative
jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned law and to
incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter
65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative
procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging
aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENSTUDY 1975
information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted
to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information
public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report
which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret
classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised
by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I
advised him that not by us and it was our information.
Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation
of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of
committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion
that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with
other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have
repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of
committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off
until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated
that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he
intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some
coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large
number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information
from the intelligence agencies.
A question arose as to the extent. of cooperation with the Committee
and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive
subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the
President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator
Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in
order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling
that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might
ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.
He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were
necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their
right to have access to whatever information they need.

--
(4) All other alleged violations of subsection
offenses involving use of explosives against United
States property or federally financed organizations, and (9)
offenses involving possession of explosives in buildings owned,
leased, used, etc., by the United States - The FBI will immediately
initiate a full investigation of all violations of subsection 844(g)
over which it has primary jurisdiction hereunder, and those violations
of 844(f) which are directed at federal property (e.g., å military
facility) or a federal function (e.g., a Selective Service or ROTC
facility). In other violations of 844(f) the FBI will develop and
disseminate background information as indicated in paragraph 6 below.
3.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division (ATF) Jurisdic-
tion in General
(a) Violations ancillary to firearms laws violations or
violation of section 842 - The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division
(ATF) of the Department of the Treasury will exercise investigative
jurisdiction over violations of section 844 which are ancillary to its
primary jurisdiction over the Federal firearms laws or over section
842 of Title XI.
(b) Violations of subsection 844(d) - interstate transporta-
tion of explosives with unlawful intent and subsection 844(1) -
offenses against property used in or affecting commerce - Subject to
paragraph 2b, above, the ATF will exercise primary investigative
jurisdiction over violations of subsection 844(d) and (i) and will
conduct a full investigation thereof unless notified by the Criminal
Division that pursuant to paragraph 2(c)(1), above, the Department of
Justice has requested FBI investigation in a particular matter.
(c) Violations directed at Treasury Department property or
functions - The ATF shall have primary jurisdiction to investigate all
violations of section 844 which are directed at Treasury Department
property or functions and will conduct a full investigation of such
violations.
NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 221
T

--- Image 124-10274-10001_page_220.jpeg ---
- 2 -
(b) Primary jurisdiction - Subject to the provisions
hereof, the FBI will exercise primary jurisdiction over all alleged
violations of section 844 which are directed at foreign diplomatic
facilities or at activities, such as transportation and tourist
offices, operating under the aegis of a foreign government although
not in a diplomatic status, over all alleged violations of subsections
844(d) through (i) which are perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals and all other violations of subsections 844(e)
through (g) which are not directed at Treasury Department or Postal
Service buildings or functions.
(c) Type of Investigation to be Conducted
(1) Offenses perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals - The FBI will immediately initiate a full
investigation of all alleged violations of section 844 which appear
at the outset to have been perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals as defined in advance by the Internal Security
Division of the Department of Justice. If ATF or the Postal
Inspection Service has properly initiated investigations and infor-
mation is subsequently developed indicating apparent involvement of
terrorist/revolutionary groups or individuals, responsibility shall
be relinquished to the FBI unless a determination is made by the
Department of Justice that a transfer of responsibilities will
unduly impair further investigative efforts.
(2) Alleged offenses against Colleges and Universities
The FBI will immediately initiate a full investigation of any alleged
violation of section 844 which involves the use or attempted use of
explosive (as distinguished from incendiary) materials against the
facilities of a college or university. Investigation of alleged viola-
tions involving use or attempted use of incendiary materials will be
limited initially to the development of background information as
prescribed in paragraph 6 below.
(3) Alleged offenses directed against foreign
diplomatic facilities and related activities - The FBI will immediately
initiate a full investigation of all alleged violations of section 844
which are directed at foreign diplomatic facilities and related
activities as described in paragraph 2(b) above.

4. Postal Inspection Service Jurisdiction
The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary juris-
diction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are
directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions.
5. Special Considerations
-
(a) Bomb Threats, false information (section 844(e))
The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction
over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or
Postal Service property or functions, respectively. The FBI shall
have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844(e). Upon
receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subsection
844(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available
information to determine whether the identity of the offender is
known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence
suggests a pattern or pian of such offenses by a particular offender
or against a particular victim. If such a pattern appears or if the
offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated
as indicated in paragraph 6 below.
(b) Use/carrying explosive in commission of a felony
(section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handled as an
adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed
with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the
Department handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense.
The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying felony will have
investigative jurisdiction over the 844(h) violation (e.g., bank
robbery is under FBI jurisdiction).
-
(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices)
In incidents involving alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 844 (which
may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not
exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. 5861 involving
destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance.
with the provisions of these guidelines. This is in no way a
relinquishment by ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under Title
II of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

shall submit initial reports as soon as practicable to the Department
of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or
as soon thereafter as possible. The Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each
instance wherein an investigative agency initiates an investigation
under section 844. Such notification is of critical importance to
the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also each
agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting inves-
tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately
notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein.
Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall
be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.
Additionally, each such agency will exchange information
on a timely basis and in a manner which will not interfere with
ongoing investigations relative to types, sources, movement, and
storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations.
Information regarding significant developments in investigations
being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli-
cence nature developed incidental to investigations which is of logical
interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to
the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible
for any necessary further dissemination within that Department.
9. Review of Guidelines
These guidelines shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by
the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin-
istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of
the terms of the agreement are needed in the interests of better law
enforcement.

6. Development of Background Information
Some incidents such as those directed against Federal
property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full
federal investigation. Others require a more circumspect approach
and will result in full Federal investigation only after considera-
tion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.
Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe
Immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having juris-
diction will develop background information which includes (a) facts
bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpetrators
in terrorist/revolutionary activities, organized crime, labor-management
disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability
of state and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative
and prosecutive actions%3B and (c) any other available facts indicating
whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecu-
tion. Such background information will be submitted telephonically
(202-739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-0008) to the General Crimes
Section of the Criminal Division and to the appropriate United States
Attorney. The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency
concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other
Division or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted
the Criminal Division will transmit the information to such other
Division or Section.
7. Full Investigation
A full investigation will be initiated immediately in
those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein. In
other instances full investigation will be initiated only upon direc-
tion of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division
having cognizance over the matter of the background information
developed under paragraph 6 above.
8. Reports

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under
these guidelines will be furnished directly to the Department of Justice
and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
· SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
["I. Purpose of Agreement
"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from
other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations.
One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information
on file with, or received or originated by, the FBI, which the United States
Secret Service (USSS) desires to receive in connection with its protective
responsibilities.
"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain
activities to protect, the President and certain other persons. (Certain
other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those persons protected
by the Secret Service under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056.) The
authority of the USSS to protect the President or certain other persons is
construed to authorize it to investigate organizations or individuals and to
interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or cer-
tain other persons. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate assault,
killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap the
President and other designated individuals.
"The FBI will make available to the USSS information it may request of infor-
on
mation which by its nature reveals a definite or possible threat to the
safety of the President and certain other persons.
"A second purpose of this agreement is to insure the most effective pro-
tection for the President and certain other persons by establishing a clear
• division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS. Such division
will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplica-
tion of effort.
"II: General Responsibilities
"The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056, with the
responsibility of protecting the person of the President of the United
States, the members of his immediate family, the President-elect, the Vice
President or other officer in the order of succession to the office of
President, and the Vice President-elect; protecting the person of a former
President and his wife during his lifetime and the person of a widow of a
· former President until her death or remarriage, and minor children of a former
1 President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined;
protecting persons who are determined from time to time by the Secretary
of the Treasury, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, as being
major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive such
protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection)%;B protecting
the person of a visiting head of a foreign state or foreign government
and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors
to the United States and official representatives of the United States
*
› performing special missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection).

exists, the USSS may take such action as is necessary with respect to carry-
ing out its protective responsibilities. Any information obtained by the
USSS during such action will be furnished to the FBI as expeditiously as
possible.
"The FBI will not conduct investigation of individuals or groups solely
for the purpose of establishing whether they constitute a threat to the
safety of the President and certain other persons unless there is an indica-
tion of a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751, or other
statute over which the FBI has jurisdiction.
"It will be the responsibility of the FBI to advise the USSS when investiga-
tion is being initiated under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1751 and there-
after to furnish the USSS with copies of the FBI investigative reports as
they are prepared. It will be the responsibility of the USSS to furnish
the FBI any information in its possession or which may come to its attention
which reasonably indicates that a violation of Title 18, U. S. Code,
Section 1751, has been or is being committed.
"The USSS also agrees to furnish the FBI any information in its possession
or which may come to its attention indicating a violation of any other
statutes over which the FBI has investigative jurisdiction.
or
"The FBI, under its responsibility for investigation of violations of
Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 112, 970, 1116-1117, 1201 and 1751 will take
cognizance of the protective responsibilities of the Treasury Department
under Title 3, U. S. Code, Section 202 and Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056 K
and thus does not limit of interfere with the authority of the Secretary of
the Treasury in the discharge of his statutory protective responsibilities.
This is not to be construed as vesting concurrent investigative jurisdiction
with the Treasury Department with respect to investigations of individuals
or organizations engaged in activities affecting the national security includ-
ing terrorism, treason, sabotage, espionage, counter-espionage, rebellion or
insurrection, sedition, seditious conspiracy, neutrality matters, Foreign
Agents Registration Act, or any other Statute or Executive Order relating to
national security. Any investigations of such groups or individuals for
any reasons other than in connection with protective responsibilities
must be closely coordinated with and have the concurrence of the FBI in
order to minimize interference with national security responsibilities of
the FBI.

Goga
As an observation paragraph number 7 of the
document titled "Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response to
Congressional Select Committee," dated March 28, 1975, (attached)
appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and
in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the
agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where
a Third Agency is indirectly involved and the material is sensitive with- T-
out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third
Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the
Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined.
Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's
request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved
and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency
involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should
be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined.

The Third Agency Rule
#MORIE
ALL FEI INFORMATION CONTAINED
HBRAIN IS WINCLASSIFIED
DATE 1/18/01 BSP-2 ALM/376
1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was
included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked. :
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense
information originating in another Department or agency" to an
agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the :
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep-
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authorizes
the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-
gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where
appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".
2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate
intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is
the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-
nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is an homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the
receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.
3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the .
following controls: Sec. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The
originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
and material, including those which presently relate to communications
intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.
4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order
11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security
Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-
fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This .
- directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have
four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:
A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to à
security clearance, a person must have a need for access
to the particular classified information or material sought
in connection with the performance of his official duties or.

tractual obligations. The dete: nation of that need
shall be made by officials having responsibility for the
classified information or material.
D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section
102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50
U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating
in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any
other Department to which it has been made available
without the consent of the originating Department.
E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.
Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING
NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND ·
METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any
manner outside authorized channels without the permission
of the originating Department and an assessment by the
senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department
as to the potential risk to the national security and to the..
intelligence sources and methods involved.
F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The
establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-
bution and protection of classified information and material
under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior
approval of the head of a Department or hic
or his designes,
5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:
(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community and
then disseminated to members of the community under the
authority of the DCI;
(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
Department may not be sent by the State Department to
the Department of Commerce without the permission of the
CIA;
(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's
Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or
to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,
a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA
information should be referred to CIA for action so that
the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations
with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation
in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has
received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-
tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would
not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence.

The
By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field
investigations regarding SSC staff personnel. These have extremely
short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded
Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential
treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress.
Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Special Inquiry
Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling
these requests. Senator Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimated
that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investi
gation. As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 such
investigations from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in
sight. They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which
is not the even flow expected and presents an additional burden.
In addition it is expected that similar requests will be
forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a similar
agreement with it. Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the HSC, has
estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be
hired." It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short of
actual receipts.
Since there is no charge for these full field investigati
they will have to be considered in the budget. It is not ed the
current charge for a full field investigation, where applicable, is
LEX
$2028.

the remaining investigations concerning future stars and
their replacements.

Director Sec'y
This memorandum recommends that the attached
draft of a paper prepared by CIA entitled, "Ambiguities and
the Law, be reviewed by the Legal Counsel Division for comment
and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI
in future meetings with legal representatives from other U. S.
Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments. The purpose
of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes in
existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby
as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate
Select Committee for their consideration.
At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a
draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed
to all members. This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of
CIA. It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence
Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be
changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary
to clarify for the Congress and the American people the authori-
ties, the limitations and missions of various member agencies
or departments of the Intelligence Community.
In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the
paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered
a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives
of each agency or department of USIB review the document and
submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency
code 143, extension 4055. Following the receipt of such comments
from the legal offices of member agencies and departments,
was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to
begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community
which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or
proposals for new legislation.

AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW
DRAFT
"
CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and, to some extent, several other **
Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but
of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in
practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some
lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits
placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse
of power easily thrive. In reality, however, in the implementation
of mission and charters and in direction and control, there are not
as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose:
The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is
such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of
the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that
should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any
disadvantages. A number of possible amendments or additions to
current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation
9
has already been submitted for some. These ideas and others are
suggested, below.

This memorandum for record purposes reports
discussion 4/25/75 between Bureau's Liaison Agent, L. F. Schwartz,

Attached are (1) memorandum 4/11/75 re CCI and its
attachments, memorandum 4/10/75 and Abstract format%; and (2) letter
4/21/75 from Thomas to Schwartz and its attachment, Abstract format.
On 4/25/75 Schwartz and Thomas discussed applicability of
instructions in attachments and arrived at the following under-
standings.
The FBI will provide Abstracts only, not documents,
to have on record in the CCI a summary of what we have furnished
to the Select Committees. Abstracts should be dated when typed
without regard to delivery date of Abstract or date of communi-
cations to which they pertain. Under item number nine of format,
enter date of communication involved, not date it is delivered
to a Select Committee. We may use an abbreviated version for
the Select Committees' names, such as "Senate Select Committee."
We will title Abstracts as near as possible in a manner keyed to
the language of the request from the Select Committee. Inasmuch
as we will honor only written requests from the Select Committees,
the "Requester" will always be shown as the name of the requesting
Committee and not the name of any Committee personnel.

in the collection and production of foreign intelligence to
carry on certain specified activities within the United
States, such as:
--protection of classified information and
their own installations against penetration
and compromise;

--investigation of employees, applicants,

information from foreign nationals and.

--cooperation with the FBI in investigations
relating to the unauthorized disclosure of
foreign intelligence.
3) Remove uncertainty regarding responsibility for
internal security matters by modifying appropriate laws to
establish clearly:
--that the collection of counterintelligence
information in the United States and the
collection of information related to internal
security are functions of the FBI;

and providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized
disclosures;
--establishing effective injunctive recourse,
through the Attorney General, for protection
of all intelligence sources and methods;
--providing for in camera judicial review
of material revealing intelligence sources
and methods when relevant and necessary
to criminal and civil proceedings;
--delineating authorities and responsibilities
for investigating suspected for discovered
unauthorized disclosures by (a) U.S. citizens
overseas and (b) all persons within the
United States.
:
6) Delineate areas of interagency assistance that
facilitate performance of authorized missions, promote
economy of resources, and as a matter of policy are
desirable, for example:
NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 255

-cooperation in research and development
of technical collection and information pro-
cessing equipment, methods and techniques;
--loan or supply of equipment, methods and
techniques;
--provision of training in special skills and
techniques; *
--passage of information derived as a by-
product of foreign intelligence activities to
those agencies responsible for the matters
involved.
. A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence
activities might add considerable understanding and confidence. Of
paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits
the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,
efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of
Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-
stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying
degrees. Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be
NW 88296 Docld:32989628 Page 256
J
+

--- Image 124-10274-10001_page_257.jpeg ---
-9-
"need-to-know." To apply this test and to control and protect
sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within...
Congress would be extremely helpful. Whether a joint committee
or not, such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating
changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might
!
find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review
would provide better insight and understanding.
The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive. They
do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence
community deserve careful attention.

Project Senstudy 75, established within the
Intelligence Division, for the purpose of developing a
capability of implementing requests received from the
Select Committees of the Congress. Bureau file 62-116395
has been opened for this Project,
W06
Because of the unusual factors relating to this
entire Project, such as the sensitive nature of much of the
material involved, urgency for handling, necessity for having
the file very readily available to the working staff at all
times, and similar other reasons, it is essential that the
file be maintained in the work area of the Project which,
effective 4/14/75, will be in room 4063, JEH. The purpose of
this memorandum, therefore, is to have Files and Communications
Division take necessary steps to arrange for the maintenance
of the file in the designated room rather than in the usual
manner.

There has already been much publicity about the
Select Committees and we anticipate much more. This involves
many newspaper stories. It is, therefore, believed very
desirable that a Sub A file to the main file be opened as
the standardized repository for newspaper articles,
As a
first step, it will be necessary that a few articles already
in the main file be extracted and Maced in the new Sub A
file in the usual chronological order. REC-Fi (2-116395-60
The foregoing matters have been already discussed
with Mr. J. W. Awe, Unit Chief, of the Files and Communications

This memorandum recommends that the Legal Counsel

Divisions for the collection and preparation of certain materials
we anticipate the Senate Select Committee (SSC) will soon request
from the FBI.
Memorandum W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall, dated
3/5/75, reported the results of a meeting between Senator Church
and Mr. Colby wherein Senator Church advised he anticipated
asking all agencies and departments of the Intelligence Community
for (1) Organizational charts broken down to a branch level going
back to 1947, (2) Copies of all budgets since 1947 and (3) Docu-
ments reflecting all cash flows since 1947.
Attached is a copy of a short letter from Mr. John
Clarke, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congres-
sional Review of the Intelligence Community to Mr. William G.
Miller, Staff Director, SSC. Also attached is a copy of a
memorandum from Mr. Clarke to all members of the Ad Hoc Coordina-
ting Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.
This memorandum sets out in more detail what information the
SSC will be seeking from all agencies making up the Intelligence
Community. It should be noted that on page two of Mr. Clarke's
memorandum he notes a formal request from Senator Church to all
agencies can be expected.
The Intelligence Division believes considerable time
and effort will be required from several Divisions to pull this
information together. It is believed we should begin now to
assemble the data in anticipation of a request. ENCLOSURE

The identified data to be collected outlined in Clarke's memorandum
was proposed-type data that the Senate Select Committee has
- indicated an interest in.
In view of 3/19/75 letter subsequently received from
Senator Frank Church (Democrat, Idano), Chairman of the Senate
Select Committee, to the Attorney General outlining a request for
specific FBI documents they are interested in receiving, the
Intelligence Division has begun accumulating this specific data.
In view of this request for specific data, the Intelligence Division
will not accumulate the data outlined in the Clarke memorandum
since it was only in the nature of proposed data and differs from
the specific data to be collected which is extensive in nature.

Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional
Committees Investigating Intelligence
1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,
Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will
keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to
progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House
Select Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular,
it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are
formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements
of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this
matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-
cations.
20
In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community
Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the
investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all
responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and
available to your designated representatives.
In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is
essential that it include:
a. File copies of documents or other materials which
each Intelligence Community element provides to one of the
Select Committees where the originating agency considers
the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,
and/or which may result in follow-on queries concerning
the functioning of the Community. The availability of this
documentation will be of particular importance if it is
expected there will be subsequent inquiries relating to the
materials provided and involving elements of the Community
other than the originating element.

Information Requested by Senate Select
Committee Staff Director
1. Senator Church has asked the Director to provide to the
Senate Select Committee copies of CIA legal authorities and organi-
zation charts to branch levels, 1947-1975. He also indicated he
wants similar authorities and charts for all USID entities from
their inceptions. In the case of CIA this will be from 1947; NSA
from 1952; DIA from 1961; etc.
A
2. The Committee is seeking a comprehensive historical
base line for each U.S. intelligence organization--its structure and
the people involved over time. Therefore, Senator Church has asked
that the names of all incumbents who have held supervisory responsi-
bilities over the period, down through the branch level, also be pro-
vided. The Staff Director has been made aware of the difficulties
involved în tracing personnel assignments too far back but asks that
every effort be made to meet the request. CIA is proceeding
accordingly.
1:
3. Senator Church has also asked for budget and cash flow
data on all U.S. intelligence organizations from their inceptions.
The CIA finds that the source and uses tables, employed in annual
financial reports, provides the historical profile desired. Supple-
mental data on specific programs can follow if requested. Senator
Church wants data which will show specific patterns of expenditures

INFORMATIVE NOTE
Date
4/25/75
You were previously advised that
Douglas Durham, former MP 4115-E, who has
furnished high-level information regarding
activities of the American Indian Movement
(AIM), after being confronted by AIM lead-
ers, admitted being a confidential infor-
mant for the FBI. This information has
been made public.
Attached teletype from Omaha advises
that Assistant U. S. Attorney Keith E. Uhl
Office of Special Prosecutor, stated he
received a telephone call 4/24/75 from
Durham and that Durham told him he had been
contacted by representatives of the Office
of Senator Frank Church, Washington, D. C.,
requesting Durham's presence in Washington
during the week of April 28, 1975, for
purpose of attending staff meetings to
determine his potential as a witness before
committee investigating operations of the
FBI. Durham indicated he intended to com-
ply and would have no further contact with
the FBI. We are following this matter
closely and you will be kept advised,

ALL FEINFORMATION CONTAINED
HERE IS UNCLASCOTTED
Reference is your request for comments on the sample
abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being
provided to the Senate Select Committee.
As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as
complete a record as possible of what is provided to the
Committee, and for this reason hope that the actual copy of
special reports and particularly important documents will be
provided to the Registry. Where this is not done, an abstract
or summary of each document or homogenous set of documents.
We have amended the abstract format slightly to include
an entry for "Document Classification."
A copy of the
amended format is enclosed.
Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make
them more "indexable."
a. Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject
matter of the material which is being provided. The
abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have
an entry here something like "Instructions covering FBI
Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the
title of the Senate Committee.
b. The date at the head of the page should be
the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of
submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9.
C. The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified
the organization with authority to release the document.

d. The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should
be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is
being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for
instance, whether your sample on the letterhead
memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.
The summary as written gives no indication as to
the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the
single sentence now used to describe all of them covers
the waterfront.
e. If the request for information comes officially
from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered
under "REQUESTOR," but if the requestor is an individual
member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.
f.
The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,
has particular significance since it is important to
know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods,
or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is
the place to identify them. We are beginning to use
the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to
obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with
the document for which another agency must concur in
the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such

PROGRAM ORIGINATED WITH OUR WEATHFUG ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER,
THE FRAUDULENT USE OF DECEASED INFANT IDENTITY PAPERS HAS
EXPANDED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SECURITY WORK. SEVEN OF THE 56
AGENTS ON SECURITY ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN FUGITIVE
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ORIGINATE WITH SOME DEMONSTRATION OR
ACT OF TERROR, ETC, BUT AT THE PRESENT THEY ARE CLEAR CUT
CRIMINAL FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE OF THE 56 IS INVOLVED
FULL TIME IN THE HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION
MATTERS WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AN APPLICANT-TYPE INVESTIGATION,
BUT THE 163 CLASSIFICATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY
CLASSIFICATIONS. SUMMARIZING THESE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A TOTAL
OF 23 AGENTS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO SECURITY WORK BUT ARE, IN
FACT, NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS,
LEAVING ONLY 33 AGENTS DEVOTING THEIR FULL TIME EFFORTS TO
INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS PLUS, THE ABOVE MENTIONED 35
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENTS.

SSC SIIFF HATER
Whitson old that when he arrived at the North
Terminal at National Airport, following Sullivan's telephonic
instructions, a young man who was unknown to Whitson but tho
addroused hin es ir. Whitson," turned over to him a package
which was trapped in brom paper and scaled with coaling tape.
It is hitconta recollection the package measured approximately
oight inchos by eight inches by one inch.
as
It is hitson's further recollection that at the time
the foregoing occurred, King was either just about to go abroad
to receive the Lobel Peace Prize or probably had already gone
abroad. It was whitson's recollection that cometima shortly
after the mailing of the package, Sullivan commented to hitson
that the package had not yet been received by Bing. Because of
this remark, Whitson is of the belief that the package was
mailed to King at the beadquarters of the Southern Christion
Leadership Conference and cot to King'a residence. Further,
It was Whitson's recollection that it was not long after ho
had mailed the package that King had a porconal meeting with
Ir. Hoover in the latter's office.
Whit on observed that in his opinion, the information
which was in the possession of putein prior to interviewing
Whitson must have originated with Sullivan. Whitson noted that
Hr. Hoover and Hr. Tolcon are both deceased and that he has
heard nothing to indicate that Mr. Delmont has been contacted
by members of the Staff of the C50. One other factor chot
causes Thitcon to feel that Sullivan was the source of the
information vad a question Eputoin zalced as to thother Whitson
Ind put a return address on the package when he addressed it to
King. hitson said he recalls that when he was in Iliant and
received the telephonic instructions from Sullivan, Sullivan
told him that he should put a return address on the package
and Whitson then pointed out to Eullivan that if he did so,
and the name of the addressee became meared, the package
could end up at someone's return address rather than in the

dated March 19, 1975, requesting certain documents and other information
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and specifically Part IV,
Policies and Procedures.
Since the enclosed memorandum captioned "Microphone
Surveillance," dated May 20, 1954, originated with the Office of the Attorney
General and is covered under this request, we are deferring to your
judgment in this matter. The FBI interposes no objection to furnishing
this document to the Committee, it being noted that the document appeared in
toto in the United States Government Printing Office publication captioned
"Warrantless Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillances, 1974."
Also enclosed for your approval is the original of a memorandum
to the Senate Select Committee apprising the Committee of our referral of
this matter to you. A copy of this memorandum is enclosed for your records.

As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel
Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr. James Wilderotter,
who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating
intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries
underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was
given a briefing similar to that which had been afforded to
Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters f
of a sensitive nature relating to the TTD RACHID and similar programs,
electronic surveillances, specialized handling of informants,
and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records). Many of
these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr. Wilderotter
had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an
Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.
Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House
that while raw FBI files should not be made available to the
Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review
a few such files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be
established with the Committee. It was pointed out to him that
we did not agree to this that we could furnish summaries of
material from the files Wilderotter said he did not feel that

RE:
Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES;
RODERICK HI LISASSOCIATE
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT
furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been
prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's
needs. He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was
our feeling that we should not furnish the raw material but
summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and
if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath
and attest to the correctness of the summaries. Wilderotter
said that this was a matter which he would afford further
consideration.
As during the conference with Buchen and Hills,
it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter
that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught
by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way
might be considered questionable. The White House is making
every effort possible to become cognizant of any such situation
prior to the Committee hearings.
Classified "Top Secret" to protect highly sensitive
investigative techniques and matters relating to foreign
relations.
ACTION:
For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter
or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.

April 8, 1975
UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMITTEL
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITHI
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
Reference is made to letter dated March 19, 1975,
to the Attorney General from the Chairman of captioned
Committee, which enclosed certain requests for documents
and other information from the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI).
One of the requests contained in referenced letter
was for a list of names and titles of all Intelligence
Division personnel at FBI Headquarters down to and including
unit chiefs, together with a number of personnel below the
level of unit chief categorized by unit. At a meeting on
April 1, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis and Special Agent
Paul V. Daly discussed this request with Mr. William Miller,
Staff Director of the Senate Select Committed. It was
agreed that the request as stated would be modified and that
the FBI would prepare a list of personnel in the Intelligenco
Division down to the level of unit chief, with names included,
which would be made available for roview by appropriately
cleared personnel of the committee staff at FBI Headquarters.
This is to advise that the list has been prepared
and is available for review under the above conditions.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: JOHN T. ELLIFF
< >
It should be noted that the Select Committee considered
offering the position to Larry Baskir, Counsel to the President's Clemency
Board. Mr. Baskir formerly served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts
with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement
on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd
Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the
same subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved
unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions.
In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out any reasonable
Textimite
compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the legislation concerns of law
enforcement.
It is clear that this is a matter for Professor Elliff to
determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although
we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we
have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar.
Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is
our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an
adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.
Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to
the Senate Committee until he hears from us.
RECOMMENDATION:
That Professor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate
for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment
offered by the Senate Select Committee.

FROM The Attorney General
SUBJECT MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE
☑
:
155-26
declassifed
fed 4/28:9.
TEBL
3
The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine v.
California, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances
by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of
the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters
relating to the internal security of the country.
It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone
Surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities
of ospionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons, In
such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires
that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of
evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in
connection with internal security matters equally as important as
the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and
the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone
surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.
The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance
by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.
I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court
in Irvine v. California, supra, requires a different course. That
case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the
Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-
tions. It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justices of the
Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of
installing à microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization
of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The
Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and
intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all
cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installa-
tion of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate
location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however,
that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters, connected
with the national security can only be obtained by the installation of
a microphone in such a location. It is my opinion, that under such
circumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the
Supreme Court's decision in the Irvine case.

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency
Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's
interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent
with the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating
department.
The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-
gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and
standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to
the Select Committees.
The question of Intelligence Community personnel being
represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White
House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from
the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills
Associate Counsel to the President."
It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the
President's Counsel would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to
insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel
would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or
department employing the persons to be interviewed.
Attached also for the record are the following:
A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.
Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has been
designated as the Security Officer of the SSC;
A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke
listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the
Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified
information up to and including "Top Secret";
A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75
advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to
classified information up to and including "Top Secret";

On 3-18-75 Professor John T. Elliff advised Inspector John B.
Hotis that he had been contacted by William Miller, Staff Director for the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, and was asked to serve
as Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This
is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it
will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces
are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and
Command and Control.

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer
and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He
said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent
working arrangements he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his
initial obligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police
Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of primary
benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congress
He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to
break any commitments that he might have made with the Bureau.
If he accepts the appointment Elliff said he would, of course,
suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment
with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified
material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elliff
has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police
Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever for
his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would
be free to resume his project after the Committee work was done.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role
as the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President%3B the then Deputy
AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter;
Mr. John Clarke, as well as officials from Defense, Treasury
National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget,
and the Energy Research and Development Administration.
The following items of interest were discussed:
M
Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate
Select Committee (SSC), and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.O.
Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business.
Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is
the identification of several key issues that the Committee
could look into in-depth. For example, the SSC might propose
to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and
examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every
covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this
appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each
agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide
a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could
select one or two for an in-depth study.
EX 104 REC-102-116395-
51
The question of the SSC staff signing a Secrecy
Agreement is still not settled. The Staff Director raised
some constitutional questions regarding the Secrecy Agreement.
Mr. Schwarz admitted, however, that some type of arrangement
would have to be made to insure that the Intelligence Community
had some protection against unauthorized disclosures by $ff
members of the SSC.

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,
suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection
with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances
of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise
in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most
conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI
to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of
internal security and the national safety are paramount and, there-
fore, may compel the imrestricted use of this technique in the notional.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Ad Hoc Group of USIB on
SUBJECT
:
Congressional Review
Security - Arrangements for Receipt of Classified
Material by Senate Select Committee
1. On 19 March 1975 I telephonically inquired of Mr. Benjamin C.
Marshall, Security Officer of the Senate Select Committee, whether he
was in a position to begin receiving classified documents. He advised
that arrangements had been perfected and that effective 20 March 1975
such documents could be delivered as follows:
The courier should enter the 1st and C Street entrance
of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, inquire of the guard as
to the location of Room G308, go to the front door of G308,
advise the guard there that material is being delivered and
have him call Mr. Marshall or Charity Benz, both of whom
are authorized to receive classified documents up to and
including TOP SECRET*.
2. Mr. Marshall requested that prior to delivery he or someone
in his office be telephonically advised (224-1700) of the impending
delivery and the estimated time of arrival so that he or someone from
his office can be available. He also stated that if delivery was desired
to a specific staff member, Mr. Marshall would try and have such
person available, but stated he was authorized to accept documents
for members of the Committee and staff.
3. The Committee has not yet advised as to compartmented
clearances but Mr. Marshall has been designated Compartmentation
*Mr. Patrick Shea is expected to be added as a person to receive
documents but the certification for this access to classified material
has not as yet been received by your office.

Relet requested, among other things, the titles and number
of FBI field office agents assigned to internal security, intelligence
collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities,
together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters,
operations and activities (page 3, item IIIC of relet).
The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal
Counsel Division, through the Intelligence Division, the response, attached
herewith, to the above request.
It is noted the request specifically mentions internal security,
intelligence collection and counterintelligence matters. Our response has
been constructed in the traditional two categories of internal security and
counterintelligence. Intelligence collection (informants) is included in the
data for both of the other categories as appropriate.

Memorandum to Mr. Walsh
Re: Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities
ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75
wob
The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate
Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment
in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as III C.

PVD:dkg
Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division
concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to
counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the
Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:
(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this
Division has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it
appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be
classified confidential under Executive order 11652.
Confadente appears
(2) Before making any determination as to whether we
make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it
would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to
such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be
consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted
Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested
he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.
(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast
position that this information not be made available to the Committee or
that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for
this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such
as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the
Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Committee (SSC). It was explained the stamp contained a caveat that
the particular document may not be made available to unauthorized
individuals without the Bureau's consent. He advised he felt this procedure
was excellent.

If approved, the Legal Counsel Division should advise
the SCC that because of security considerations, the H and
numbers of Special Agents of the FBI assigned to internal
security and counterintelligence matters cannot be furnished
to the SCC in documented form for the Committee files. However,
the FBI would be willing to show the titles and figures to
Mr. Miller or a senior staff member at FBIHQ in an effort to

Activities" forwarded to the Intelligence Division for review
the titles and numbers of FBI field office Agents assigned to
internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counter-
intelligence matters, operations or activities. This was in response
to requirement IIIC of Senator Church's' letter dated 3/19/75.
By addendum dated 4/4/75 the Intelligence Division
recommended that the Legal Counsel Division discuss with the
staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) our reluctance to
provide these type figures to the SSC.
On 4/11/75 I discussed with Mr. John Clark, Associate
Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the intelligence
community, the request of Senator Church. Specifically, Mr. Clark
was asked if Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had received such a
request and how they responded. Mr. Clark advised that CIA had
not received a specific request for the titles and numbers of
CIA officers assigned to intelligence collection or counter-
intelligence matters. However, CIA had received a request to
identify the names and numbers of CIA covert officers assigned
overseas.
REC-IDS 62-116395--86
106
Mr. Clark advised that CIA intended to advise the Staff
Director of the SSC that CIA was unwilling to provide such names
and numbers to the SSC for retention in its files. However, CIA
would be willing to allow a senior staff member or the Staff
Director to review the names and numbers of CIA covert officerss
overseas at the CIA headquarters building.

Re:

Briefing for Staff Members
by Intelligence Division
April 11, 1975
that this was inevitable. He stressed, however, the investi-
gative policies of the FBI which protected the constitutional
rights and right of privacy of such individuals,
On the domestic internal security side the thrust
of the questioning appeared to indicate an interest in the
predication, duration and administrative controls of investi-
gations of domestic organizations and individuals. Again,
Mr. Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy
and instructions to the field in these matters, pointing out,
in effect, that these investigations are founded on statutory
authority and are closely supervised by experienced personnel
at Headquarters level. The Committee staff appeared to accept
these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their
part were evident.
The briefing was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to
commitments on the part of the staff. Mr. Miller and
Mr. Schwarz both expressed their appreciation for the briefing
and indicated it had been most instructive, They indicated
a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and
Mr. Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue
the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time,
Perhaps most significant of all questions posed was
the final question by Mr. Schwarz in which he inquired as to
what advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated
as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate, Mr. Wannall
replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the
FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly
be a positive achievement, He also stated that any result of
the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the
investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of
the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor.

In response to a question by Mr. Whitson, he was advised
that to the writer's knowledge this was the first former Bureau
employee who had been requested to appear for an interview by any
member of the staff of the Select Committee. Whitson stated that
he was proceeding on the basis that he would respond to questions
propounded to him but he had some reservation in his mind concerning
answering questions which would involve material which he knew to be
classified at the time he retired. He commented he had noted in the
news media that staff members of the Committee were reportedly to be
granted clearances through TOP SECRET - Q (Atomic Energy Matters).
Whitson was advised by the writer that while it was true
staff members were being granted clearances, the Bureau was endeavoring
to establish procedures through the Attorney General whereby highly
sensitive and classified material could be revealed on a restricted
basis in response to Committee inquiries; for example, in some
instances we would request that only the Majority and Minority leaders
on the Committee be furnished certain types of material and in other
instances only the Senators themselves as opposed to all staff members.

Mr. Whitson said in view of this, it was his intention to be
as responsive and candid during the interview by Mr. Epstein as he
could be but if any questions arose in his mind with respect to
revelation as to what he, Whitson, considered to be sensitive material,
he anticipated he would express his concern to Mr. Epstein and advise
him he felt it would be appropriate to check with the Binan
is aware of regulations by the Attorney General which preclude
revealing FBI information without the Attorney General's sp75

On 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, staff
members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and
members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD. Briefed
from the Committee were Mr. William Miller, Staff Director;
Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and
Messrs. Mark Gitenstein, Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt
Snider and Loch Johnson, all staff members,
The first hour of the briefing was occupied with
the showing of the INTD slide presentation and commentary
which provided highlights of the work of the INTD, both in
the counterintelligence and internal security field. Following
this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the
rest of the briefing. Mr. Miller and Mr. Schwarz posed most
of the questions.
In the counterintelligence field the thrust of the
questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the
hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its
short-term and long-term effect on the FBI's operations.
Mr. Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions
had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence
effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents,
and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to
assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent
personnel, thereby freeing additional Special Agents to function
as case officers. In response to a question as to whether the
additional investigative effort necessary to counter the
mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investi-
gation of more and more American citizens, Mr, Wannall conceded

The Senate Select Committee's 3/19/75, letter was transmitted with
an attachment, prepared by the Committee's staff, which set forth examples of
the type of information concerning domestic intelligence jurisdiction of interest
to it. Among those items cited in the attachment to the Committee's 3/19/75,
letter was a study on jurisdiction prepared for former Acting FBI Director
Louis Patrick Gray III by the Office of Legal Counsel, dated 5/18/72. Representatives
of the Legal Counsel Division do not believe the 5/18/72 study is, in itself,
• appropriate to furnish in response to the question of the Senate Select Committee
on legal authority. However, Legal Counsel Division believes that two internal
FBI memoranda, prepared in connection with the drafting of the 5/18/72, study,
would be pertinent to the Senate Select Committee's inquiry. Accordingly, these 1975
two documents, items one and two of attached memorandum for the Committee,

FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
#MDR16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED.
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1/18/01 BY SR-2 ALTI
You requested analysis of the legal authority for FBI
criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to our statutory
jurisdiction in criminal matters.
"The gathering of criminal intelligence information"
describes activity not subject to precise definition. However, its
general objective is well understood by those engaged in law enforcement.
There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed
toward profit without regard to the restraints of the law. Yel, by the
very nature of their associations. little actual participation in criminal
acts may be observed by the most astute law enforcement observer.
Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior. has been
detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerning
their personal life-styles, property holdings, associates, influence, and
access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal
intelligence."
For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify
these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this
need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressional
findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly
sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains
billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by
the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and
labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes
are subverted. The problem was declared to be of of national concern
both as to our economy and the domestic security.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI JURISDICTION; CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making
criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting
racketeering activity characteristic of organized crime including the
use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises.
The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers
were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments
did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains
the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national
menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt. "Criminal
intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may
be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity
of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those
who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in
United States v. Addonizio, 451 F2d 49 (3rd Cir. 1972) where a prospective
witnong in a commuption o found on a
an anonminous note on the seat of his
car which read "This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut."
Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical
necessity, the issue remains as to its propriety in the face of Constitutional
protections. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a
Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only
through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue
will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only drawn upon the concept
of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances
such as marital affairs (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)) and
interception of communications (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1907) )
More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal
intelligence function may be found in the First Amendment protections of
speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonable
searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amendment privilege against
compulsory self-incrimination.
The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on th
relationship between these rights and the collection of criminal intelliga ce
is that, when in direct conflict, the collection efforts must yield. Such is

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATË 1-18-01 BY SPJ ALM 186
You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct
domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional
basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic
Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.
•
. It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one
of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities. For one thing,
an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that are
directed toward the proof of a specific offense. A large amount of raw data
is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potential offenses
or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become important
in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are
also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one's
political beliefs, habits or associations; or that information collected for
proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government.
Each is a legitimate concern. The notion of Government prying into the
personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a
strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence
information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the
national security.
One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence
activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside
agency. The claim is made that the Executive Branch has been left wide
discretion to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, methods,
and focus of its investigations. For one thing, the law has never made.
clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an
intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawfully
proceed without being directed toward proof of a specific offense.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances
"where such information will be used to charge persons with specifically
defined criminal conduct." 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be
interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence
information where political or social factors are involved and First
Amendment freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection
of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishment
of criminal conduct and the identities of the offenders. While the Fourth
and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the guilty and innocent alike, it
is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to
protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly
constitute elements of a criminal offense. On appeal, the Supreme Court
of New Jersey returned the case for further development of the record
and observed ". . . the executive branch may gather whatever information
it reasonably believes to be necessary to enable it to perform the police
roles, detectional and preventive. A court should not interfere in the
avbonet of proof of bad faith on
vi vai falli vi arbiliai iness. 200 Azu al 000.
"I
A
A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further develop-
ment of the case law. The gathering of criminal intelligence information
for the purpose of developing evidence of specific offenses characteristic
of organized crime is legally justified as well as practically necessary.
Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection
efforts are manipulated to cause harassment or where such activity conflicts
with Constitutional rights, to that extent the criminal intelligence program
must be reformed.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice.
but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being
safeguarded. Other incidents of government regulatory authority have
been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of
Constitutional protection, e.g. the administrative search cases, Camara v.
Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).
Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized
.as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an
: obvious 24-hour-a-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home,
relatives, friends, and associates (Giancana v. Johnson, 335 F2d 366
(7th Cir. 1964) cert. den. 379 U.S. 1001. Similar results might be
expected where an identified officer loiters in the subject's place of
business (Bee See Books, Inc. v. Leary, 291 F. Supp. 622 (SD N. Y. 1968)
or openly attends organizational meetings where his presence inhibits
communication and the francortinn of the business of the assembly (Local
309, United Furniture Workers v. Gates. 75 F. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. 1948) ).
However, open photographic surveillance of public gatherings (Donahoe v.
Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of
criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (Lewis v. United
States, 385 U.S. 206-(1966)) and informants (Hoffa v. United States, 385
U.S. 295 (1966) ) have met with judicial approval.
Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-
reasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is
tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having
the requisite standing.
Perhaps, the decision coming nearest to discussing the
legality of criminal intelligence collection was Anderson v. Sills, 106 N. J.
Super. 545, 256 A2d 298 (1969), (reversed on the ground more complete
record was needed to support the decision) 56 N.J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970).
New Jersey had responded to the threat of continuing civil disorders by
collecting intelligence information on persons and events alleged to have
some relationship to such activities. The trial court held the collection
effort to be unconstitutional because, it conflicted with the First Amendment.

leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant
since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from
an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry
on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.
On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,
reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of
Secretary' Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon
with the President between 1:00 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.":

'Memorandum J. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
I.
And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our electronic surveillances in
security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For another,
the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control
over investigative procedures, is not often available in security cases.
Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the
courts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very
little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.
and what we do with the information acquired.
In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have
pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a
watchdog committee to oversee our operations. Senator Ervin, who chairs
the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular
concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to
gather information. In an exchange of correspondence with the Department
of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the
Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic
intelligence information. He has also suggested that legislation migii be
enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can
be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would
pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.
A parallel trend may be developing in the courts. In several
recent cases, plaintiffs have made the claim that Government information.
gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects,
may have a "chilling effect" on the exercise of First Amendment rights.
These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. Sills,
56 N.J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308
(E.D. Va. 1971); American Civil Liberties Union v. Westmoreland, 323
F. Supp. 1153 (N.D. III. 1971).
The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal
functions of the Bureau is to gather information law violators, agitators of
violence and possible subversives.. Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957
(D.C. Cir. 1971) cert. granted, 404 U.S. 955 (1971); The Fifth Avenue
Peace Parade Committee, et al. v. J. Edgar Hoover, et. al., 70 Cv. 2646
HRT, decided February 16, 1972. The Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, has observed that the identity of the agency gathering
such information is determinative of the significance of any alleged chill to

to First Amendment rights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D.C.
Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional
Committee's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was
insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or
controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of
investigation by the present Committee home to themselves," ' their fears
were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings confronting
them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis found
that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the
investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,
the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a
judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional
rights.
This latter aspect of the Davis decision was given perspective by
the Court of Appeals in Tatum. In contrasting the potential impact on First
Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military
with investigations conducted by a civilian investigative agency, such as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:
The compilation of data by a civilian investigative
agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the
deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right
of free speech that such action by the military is, because
a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always
being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and
the approval of the courts. ***
There, the Court paintedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in
Davis, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBI
as a source which does not generate a reasonable basis for inhibitions or
apprehensions. In this connection the Court stated,

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S. 745
(1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate
any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth
Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit
his conversations with defendants to other agents.
If the use of undercover government informants without a
warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's
constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra,
and such informants may write down their conversations with defendants
and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transmit such
conversations to others, who may testify against them, On Lee v. U.S.,
343 U.S. 747 (1952); U.S. v. White, supra, then clearly more visual
"eurveillance" of plaintiffs in plain view by informants at public meetings
would not violate their constitutional rights.
It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively
in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See
Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1967). Any recording of their
activities by the defendants does not invade their privacy any more than
does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indeed, much less since
any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action.
Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971).
.
More difficult questions are presented where the investigation
delves into the private affairs of the individuals or organizations. But
even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as
they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
The Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee, et. al. v. J. Edgar Hoover.
et. al., 70 Civ. 2646 HRT, decided February 16, 1972. (examination of

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey
Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment
line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial
impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for
optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We
should be prepared, therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need
for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy
governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal
controls and carefully developed guidelines.

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. .Dalbey
RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS
"
n
Referring to our holding in Davis that the
"source of the chill" is important in determining whether
there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First
Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant
difference between investigative actions taken by a
military agency in reference to civilians and similar
investigative actions taken by a regular investigative
agency of a civilian branch of the Government.
One of the functions of a civilian investigative
agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is
to compile information on law violators, agitators of
violence, and possible subversives. It has always been
recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is
exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.
Investigation is performed by men a majority of whom are
under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department,.
and the information compiled is only usable and effective
through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison
or to affect his liberty in any way except through the
action of the courts.
As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of
informants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.
See Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E. D. Va. 1971) (police
surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment
rights).
The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (1966), held.
that the use of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional", and does
not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, nor
the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,
admission at trial of evidence obtained by an undercover informant to whom
a defendant spoke without knowledge that he was in the employ of the police.
385 U.S. at 300-303. See also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 206 (1966) and
Lopez v. U.S., 373 U.S. 427 (1963).

1. MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TAMM
FROM JOHN EDGAR HOOVER
DATED SEPTEMBER 10, 1936;
CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM BY
JOHN EDGAR HOOVER DATED AUGUST 25, 1936.
On this date, SA Alonzo L. Lacey of the Intelligence
Division delivered the above-captioned memoranda to the Laboratory
with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in
the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction
of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation
was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters
used to write the memoranda word in use on the dates appearing
on the memoranda.
It was determined that the "Memorandum For Mr. Tamm
from John Edgar Hoover dated September 10, 1936" was prepared
on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which
has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the
"Confidential Memorandum by John Edgar Hoover dated August 25,
1936" was determined to have been prepared on a Remington
typewriter equipped with an elite style of type that has been in
use since October, 1935.
The memoranda were returned to SA Lacey.:

press with charges being made the FBI is conducting without

investigations and could not be viewed in their real significance,
except as they fit into the overall perspective of the case..
This is indicative of the danger of using piecemeal intelligence
taken out of context%; properly used, however, intelligence
is a legitimate and necessary part of all security investigations.
Intelligence is information and the collection of it is
inseparable 'from efficient investigative operations. In fact the
two--investigation and intelligence--are mutually dependent.
In the security field, it is vital that the Federal
Government detect factors which have a direct bearing on
possible miniations of law related to the mouthway an doatruation
of the Government. Intelligence developed to identify individuals
who have a propensity for revolutionary or racial violence or
have affiliations with subversive or revolutionary groups is
essential in the enforcement of the laws designed to protect the
integrity of the Government. Intelligence is also essential to
the detection of attempts or conspiracies to move against the
Government, actions which may themselves be crimes.
No constitutional provisions, statutory enactments
i
or judicial rulings have attempted to deprive law enforcement
of its intelligence function, although various attempts have

been made to define or limit the areas encompassed by
Entelligence and particularly the techniques of collection.
It is also recognized that some intelligence gathering
activities may have an incidental "chilling" offect on individual
citizens. The spectre of the Government's investigatory
presence may cause a reaction in citizens, inhibiting the
oxorcise of their full constitutional rights. Therefore,
a balance between the requirements of the Government and the
constitutional rights of citizens must be maintained.

"It is mandatory that a Government protect its
integrity and this has been recognized by judicial
authorities. Ordinary crimes victimize an individual or
groups; crimes against the existence of the government
victimize society. Carrying these crimes to their ultimate
produces the ultimate crime against society--the destruction
of that society.
It is clear that the aspirations of most revolutionary
groups far exceed their capability to achieve their ultimate
objectives. They are, however, quite capable of eroding
the integrity of the democratic system by lesser acts and, if
not discouraged or thwarted, might well accumulate the will
and power for more decisive action. The dramatic success of
the Castro revolution is a sufficient example. Consequently,
continuing intelligence collection relating to all revolutionary
: individuals and organizations, commensurate with the immediate
threat posed, is imperative to proper vigilance.
The FBI serves as a prime producer of intelligence
for the Executive Branch. Over the years it has provided
information concerning hostile actions directed against the U. S.

1969 during their "Days of Rage."
As the tide of crime and disruption swelled, it
brought with it now and pressing problems on the domestic
security scone. FII domestic security investigations increased
accordingly. Thoro was also an immediate increase in FBI
intelligence collection concerning the lawlessness and violent
tactics of these emerging revolutionary elements.
Intelligence collection was essential in contending
with these new domestic security problems. This fact was
recognized by the reports of two Presidential Commissions.
The report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders
(Herner Commission, 1968)' stressed that the absence of accurate
information before and during disorders created special control
problems. It emphasized that law enforcement organizations
must develop the moans to obtain adequate intelligence for
planning purposes and that law enforcement should "gather,
evaluate, analyze and disseminato information on potential as
well as actual civil disorders."

Similarly, the President's Commission on Campus
Unrest (1970) took special note of the need for intelligence
in effective law enforcement. The Commission stated in its
report, "It is an undoubted fact that on some campuses there
are men and women who plot, all too often successfully, to
burn and bomb, and sometimer to main and kill.“ The report
concluded that the best,:AND sometimes the only, means
law enforcement has to thwart or prevent such plots is
through "clandestine intelligence work."
Provention is the very essence of the proper uso
To be forewarned is to be placed in a
position to carry out countermeasures to meet a threat. During
the mass actions and violent confrontations of the 1960's,
FBI intelligence collection was crystallized in dissemination
of Information to other government agencies. This intelligence
provided them with an essential working tool to contend with
public disorders and activities of a revolutionary nature.
In a memorandum to the Director of the FBI, 9/14/67,
Attorney, General Clark stressed the importance of intelligence.
The Attorney General asserted. "It is most important thať

intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing upon

these circumstances we must be certain that every attempt is
being made to got all information bearing upon these problems;
to take every step possible to determine whether the rioting
is pro-planned or organized; and, if so, to determine the
identity of the people and interests involved; and to deter
this activity by prompt and vigorous legal action."
Attorney General's evaluation of the importance of
intelligence in this instance applies with equal force to
other areas of the FBI's security work.
The
In December, 1967, the Department of Justice, aware
of the high priority of intelligence in dealing with civil
disorders, created the Inter-Division Information Unit. This
is a repository for "reports which relate to individual or
organizational activities which may play a part in instigating
or spreading civil disorders" and includes intelligence
"relating to black power and black nationalist organizations,

on May 17, 1971, concerning the Intelligence Evaluation
Committee, created to analyze and evaluate intelligence for
the guidance of the White House and other departments of

stated, "Intensified activities on the part of militant
t-groups here in Washington, D. C., and elsewhere in the country
clearly point up the need not only for the gathering of
the highest quality intelligence available but also for an
expert analysis and evaluation of the intelligence product

Foderal laws. To assist in cataloguing the level of
dangerousness of those individuals and to retrieve quickly
information concerning them, the Domestic Intelligence
Division maintains a card file known as the Administrative
Index.
•Administrative Index
Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950
(Emergency Detention Act) before it was repealed on
September 25, 1971, provided for emergency detention of
subversive individuals in the event of a national emergency.
To implement that provision of the act, the FBI and the
Department of Justice maintained the Security Index. This
Index was, of course, discontinued with the repeal of the
Emergency Detention Act. By memorandum of October 22, 1971,
however, the Attorney General noted that the repeal of
Title II "does not alter or limit the FBI's authority and
responsibility to record, file and index information secured"
In this field and concurred in the establishment of an
adinistrative index to assist in "making readily retrievable
and available the results of its (the FBI's) investigations
into subversive activities.' $

IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTHORITY
The criteria and guidelines for FBI investigations
"
are furnished to the field in a "Manual of Instructions,
the "F. B. I. Handbook," and in Letters to all Special Agents
in Charge. In addition, instuctions and guidance are given
to the field in HeadquartERS Commuxications on specific cases.
☑
AND
Compliance with criteria no quidelines is obtained by super-
vision in both the field and at Bureau Headquarters.
In
addition, regular inspections of field and Headquarters
Divisions assure that Bureau policies concerning investiga-
tions are being followed.
In the security field, the basic responsibility of
the FBI is to investigate revolutionary organizations dedicated
to the violent overthrow or destruction of the United States
Government. These include old-line Marxist groups, for example,
the Communist Party, USA, and the Trotskyist Socialist Workers
Party; and such new revolutionary groups as the Students for
a Democratic Society, the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman.
In the investigation of subve individuals a determination
is made of the dangerousness of the individual and efforts are
made to obtain evidence of violations of any applicable

determine after hearings if any organization is
totalitarian, fascist, communist, subversive, or
whether it has adopted a policy of advocating the
commission of acts of force or violence to deny
others their Constitutional or statutory rights.

To this end, such an index (called Adex) was
instituted for making quickly retrievable information on
four categories of individuals in order of dangerousness:
I) National leaders of revolutionary or extremist
groups, members who have exhibited a propensity for violence,
members with training in sabotage, espionage, or guerrilla
warfare,. unaffiliated revolutionaries with a propensity
for violence, and revolutionaries with access to key facilities.
II) Secondary leadership of revolutionary and
extremist groups, active members of these groups, and
uncffiliated revolutionaries or extremists with a propensity
for violence against property rather than persons.
III) Rank-and-file members of revolutionary groups.
within the previous five years, leaders of fronts for revolu-
tionary groups, and individuals with revolutionary ideologies
likely in a national emergency to commit acts of espionage,
sabotage, or terrorism.
IV) Persons likely to assist, financially or
otherwise, revolutionary groups, or persons in a position to
influence others to commit acts inimical to the national defense.
Investigation of an individual is conducted to
determine whether or not he should, consistent with the
criteria of these categories, be listed on the Adex. If, as

Board in accordance with provisions of the Internal Security
Act of 1950 and Executive Order 11605.
The criteria, guidelines and restrictions on the
investigations of revolutionary groups are outlined below:
Investigation is initiated upon receipt of

In regard to their front groups and organizations
which they have infiltrated:
Investigation is initiated upon receipt of
information that organization is dominated,
controlled or influenced to substantial
degree by revolutionary organization.

activities and level of dangerousness fluctuate.
Revolutionary Groups
:
Investigations of individuals for a determination
of whether or not they meet the criteria for Adex generally
involve their degree of affiliation with revolutionary and
extremist groups.
The purpose of investigations of basic
revolutionary and new-left type groups is to: (1) provide
intelligence to the Executive Branch which will enable the
President to fulfill his Constitutional responsibilities%3B

Extremist Groups
The purpose of investigations of white hate
and black extremist organizations is to: (1) provide
intelligence to the Executive Branch which will enable
the President to fulfill his Constitutional responsibilities;
and (2) detect developing conspiracies to violate substantive
laws and initiate prosecutive action whenever possible to
.prevent such conspiracies from being carried out. Investiga-
tions of white hate groups are confined to those which have
actually or allegedly committed or have conspired to commit
acts of violence or have adopied a policy of advocating or
inciting the use of violence to deny others their rights
under the Constitution. Investigations of black extremist.
organizations concern those groups which take extremist,
anti-U. S. Government, anti-white positions and whose
activities have involved them or may involve them in civil
unrest and/or subversive activity.
Subversive, Revolutionary and Extremist Individuals
Individuals referred to as subversives are
generally affiliated with old-line basic revolutionary
organizations; those termed revolutionaries are usually new
left types; and those called extremists are fundamentally

Unaffiliated Individuals
In the areas of revolutionary (new left) and
extremist activities, some investigations are conducted
of individuals who are not affiliated with organizations.
Investigation of an individual is undertaken when informa-
tion is received that the person:

Information Storage and Retrieval
The storage and retrieval of information is a
basic operational necessity of any investigative or
intelligence-gathering agency. Procedures within the FBI
for these functions provide for written records of informa-
tion received from a variety re-confidential
informants; confidential INVESTIGATIVE? techniques, and open
sources--and the storage or tab¨¨ information in different
16
types of files. These include active investigative files
on organizations and individuals and some general files.
These "raw" files are maintained both at the Seat of Govern-
ment and in the various field offices. Information in the
files is thoroughly indexed so that data can be retrieved.
In the intelligence field, when an allegation
within the jurisdiction of the FBI is received, a case on
an individual or on an organization may be opened, depending
on the quality of the allegation. Nonspecific information
that is received on an individual or organization is placed
.
in the pertinent file, if one exists, or is placed in a
general file if the organization or individual is not the
subject of a specific file.

identification of intelligence operations and agents;
(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose
of control and the development of intelligence information;
(3) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through
disruption and disinformation; and, (4) prosecution. Whatever
the assigned priority, the overall objective is to deny access
to information sought by whatever practical means are available.
Foreign intelligence investigations are grounded in
the Espionage statute and related laws including the Registra-
tion and Atomic Energy Acts. Individual investigations are
initiated usually on the basis of a known or suspected connec-
tion with a foreign intelligence service, foreign country or
subversive organization with such connections. Since these
investigations emanate from various sensitive sources and.
involve special considerations, extensive criteria and
limitations are defined and enumerated in current instructions.
In general terms, the governing criteria are designed
to preclude initiation and continuance of investigations which
are not justified. The limitations are designed to control
the scope of investigation in order to insure security of our
interests through close supervisory scrutiny.

Restrictions on Investigations
FBI guidelines go beyond the rules for opening,
investigating and closing cases; they also impose restrictions.
to make certain that we do not violate the constitutional
rights of any individual and to preclude investigations from
becoming "fishing expeditions." In the security field these
are some of the restrictions. WHICH are applied:
Security cases are evaluated continually
to determine if we are fulfilling our
responsibilities.
Those cases not
warranting further investigation are
closed promptly.
There are no investigations of members
of an organization which does not advocate
use of force to bring about existing changes
in the Government. Examples are the Socialist
Party, the Independent Workers of the World
and Independence Party of Puerto Rico.
Persons arrested during disruptive demonstra-
tions are identified since circumstances of
an arrest, in some cases, may indicate a
propensity for violence. However, a mere
arrest in connection with a demonstration is
an insufficient basis in itself for security
investigation. The arrest must be coupled
with a demonstrated propensity for violence
or with subversive or revolutionary activity
on the part of the individual arrested.
When it is determined that a security subject
is a member of the armed services, the
investigation is discontinued immediately and
the military advised.
Civil rights organizations are not investigated.

These files are an integral part of the intelligence-
gathering function. By the very nature of the FBI's assignment
to coordinate internal security information, the maintenance
of data over a period of time is required and it is necessary
that a system for retrieving this information be used.
Because these files contain derogatory
ed
information that may not SUBSTANTIATED by further investi-
gation (the derogatory information received may not be germane
to a matter within the FBI's jurisdiction), the Attorneys
General have long taken the position that these files should
not be available for public scrutiny. Incalculable damage
to individual reputations could result from the disclosure
of single items of information without knowing the full
background concerning the receipt of a particular item and
the context within which it was recorded.
The late Justice Robert Jackson, in his capacity
as Attorney General, wrote in 1941:
Disclosure of information contained in the
reports (FBI files) might also be the
grossest kind of injustice to innocent
individuals. Investi live reports include
leads and suspicions sometimes even
the statements of malicious or misinformed
people. Even though later and more complete
reports exonerate the individuals, the use
of particular or selected reports might
constitute the grossest injustice, and we all
know a correction never catches up with an
accusation.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
[TREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED,
DATE 1-18-01 BX SPJALIN/116
During our meeting on July 20, 1973, you referred to a discussion
you had with Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Jr., of Maryland during your con-
firmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Department of
Justice in the field of domestic intelligence investigations. You then asked
Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons
with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that research was
being performed on this subject at the present line and thaj we would be in
touch with Air. Ruckelshaus with regard to this matter when we have completed
the results of our consideration and findings within the FBI.
Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two
years as to the scope of FBI jurisdiction and authority, in domestic intelligence-
investigations. When Mr. L. Patrick Gray, III, was designated as Acting
Director of the FBI, he instructed that a position paper be prepared concern-
ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence
investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence stated that
authority of the FBI in this field is based on legislative enactments, even
though we may have publicly relied heavily on Fresidential directives as the
basis for such authority. Mr. Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the
position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The
following is a summary of that report.
Over a period of several months there were a number of public
· statements questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct domestic
intelligence-type investigations, particularly where there is no clear-cut
legislative authority apparent. One of the most searching inquiries was con-
tained in a paper presented by Professor John T. Cliff at a two-day conference
at Princeton University in October, 1971, sponsored by the Coinmittee for Public
Justice.

Dissemination
:
The Bureau's general policy on dissemination is
that information developed by or coming to the attention
of the FBI is promptly referred to all agencies of the
Executive Branch of the Federal Government having a
potential interest in it or
ngibility for taking
action concerning it, WHENEVER THAT Interest or responsi-
bility is apparent or known. This policy is in accordance
with numerous formal agreements entered into between the
Bureau and other Government agencies. It is also in
*dcordance with Presidential directives obligating the
Bureau to act as clearing house for information affecting
The internal security of the U. S.
Despite this general liberal policy of dissemina-
tion, we have recognized that with regard to highly sensitive
information a determination must be made on an individual
basis as to what information should be disseminated and how
it should be transmitted. The degree of sensitivity and/or
the security classification will determine level of dissemina-
tion to any interested agency a the method of transmittal.
In certain instances, sensitive information may be furnished
to a high-level official with a request that dissemination
in his agency be restricted to his personnel on a need-to-know
basis. Such information might be disseminated by secure teletype,
courier, liaison, and where necessary, by secure telephone.
.
Information furnished orally is confirmed in writing.
