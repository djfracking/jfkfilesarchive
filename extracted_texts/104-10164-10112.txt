CONFIDENTIAL.
Dear HiBB Matlack:
May I recall the kind reception you
gave me in May 1961, when I was in Washington, also
your courtesy in recommending me the Alban Towers
Hotel, 3700 Massachusetts Avenue, whore I lodged in
Room 522. You will remember the conversation I had
with you regarding the future of my country, and the
hope I expressed that the assistance of the U. s.
would not fail us.
I have earnestly worked since in
order that Haiti may be relieved from the tyranny
and misery in which has been inconsiderately thrown,
and have succeeded in securing the sympathy and sup-
port of a great majority of the populo sions all over
the Republic, including religious poople, businessman,
professionals, intellectuals, eto. A plan has been
prepared and will be executed by a Nilitary man who
has with him most of the officers in the Army. These
people are ready and eager to begin operations and
are only awaiting word from me.
$
k-
I would have already given them
order to strike, through the Chief who is the only
one in contact with me, were it not for my approhono-
ion that the turmoil that will necessarily follow
might serve Castro's plan to introduce communist ag=
itators in the country. I also have rouson to wonder
about Balaguer's position on account of his friendly
feelings for Duvalier. Therefore, before going any
further, I foel that it would be wise for me to have
the U.S. assurance that these two forces will be
properly neutralized, and I am requesting your kind
cooperation so that this assurance may be given to me.

radically leftist oriented Government. If allowed time, Divalier may
well succeed to turn the country into a new communist satellite and work
out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, we should not
fail to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between
Haiti and some communist countries. The most significant one is the new.
appointment in Haiti of an Ambassador from Poland with when, I was told,
Duvalier is closely working with.
Taking everything into consideration:
1. The non existence of any organized opposition in Naici;
2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled
political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from
outside Haiti;
3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to come
in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they
should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent
it at all cost;
4. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated
upon mere suspicion, just or unjust denonciations;
5. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S. is not working
as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvalier and that the U.S. is.
even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally by not en-
couraging or allowing the opposition to organize itself;
6. The interpretation of the above classes which are at a loss to under-
stand the silence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the
usual indignation about the recent mass killings, therefore making room
for the belief of a possible collusion by means of money or otherwise of
Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to refrain from
bringing these facts to the attention of international public opinion;
7. The strong belief that compromises have been worked out with President
Balaguer in the Dominican Republic to return to Haiti all opponents of
Duvalier who had fled there,
all this leads to believe that Duvalier will hold in power for quite a while
more.

In connection with the possibility of finding a political leader,
as indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man
whom, I feel, could very well the position. His name is Clérard
Joseph Charles, President of Br. te Commerciale d'Haiti, President of
Haiti's Chamber of Commerce, a Cllector of several other business and
industrial organizations in Haiti.
I have known Mr. Charles since 1951. We have been friends and
business associates eversince. To me, Mr. Charles is a true and sincere
patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotism
on the basis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have
myself, sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have also told him so,
many times. His answers on such occasions have, most of the time, satisfy
my own judgement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier,
as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he
were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve if he
had taken a position of non-compromise? He feels that in order to be
able to control the situation and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be
"in" than "out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead.
I can
say that on several occasions, was it not for Mr. Charles' influence on
Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor pelple of
Haiti, in general, than he has done so far.
1+
I have always maintained a dialogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to
ñim as much as possible the judgements of Haitians and others with whom
he had no direct contact. I must say that I have always find him re-
ceptive to their opinions.
Eversince I have known Mr. Charles, he has always told me of his
ambitions and determination to be a great Haitian. He asked me to never
let him down and to stay with him to help him carry out his dream. Though
it has cost me some of my friends, I have extended to him everything that
I could possibly offer to help him reach his goala.
Unlike the majority of Haitian politicians, Mr. Charles has an un-
surmontable faith in the future of his country. He feels that if Haiti,
under Duvalier, has considerably regressed in every way, the time will come

differentiated with the rural peasants, live in abject poverty with no
established means of subsistance, and represent the most volatile and
dangerous political force to be watched closely in the event of any
significant development of the political and social situation. These
people which formed, in 1956 and 1957, the core of former president
Dzniel Fignole's followers, can be swung to any movement and play a
-decisive tole in the confusion that may arise in the event of a coup.
He are convinced that these people will welcome a change should any
demagogue lead them to believe that they will benefit by such a change.
I an informed that in Port-au-Prince there are some political per-
sonalities, in and out of the Government, that are waiting for an op-
portunity to swing that sector in their favor, whenever a serious at-
tempt to overthrow Duvalier is made, whether by them or anyone else.
Under those circumstances, Duvalier loosing his old grip on key.
elements committed to his support, a large portion of which he has
recently liquidated, is trying to instore a new political philosophy
reaching out for elements of the middle class a. well as those of the
slum areas mentioned above. I have a feeling that the new philosophy is
aimed at antagonizing the U.S. Government for its hands-off policies and
the economic squeeze applied by the U.S. against his government. This
antagonism will go as far as necessary even to an almost impossible al-
liance with communist countries such as Cuba or other communist nations
of Europe, Africa or Asia. As evidence of that direction in Duvalier's
Government, he has allowed the so-called "Little Red Book" of Chairman
Mao-Tse-Tung of Communist China to circulate freely in Haiti, whereas
previously the same took was banned and seized in local librairies and
newsstands in Haiti. Several articles appearing in local Haitian news-
papers have lately referred with much emphasis to the "Cultural Revolution"
of Duvalier Which has yet to take place. The appointment in his newly
formed cabinet of three Blanchet brothers, all well-known commúnist
sympathizera, is alse an indication of his subtle shift towards a

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear
logical enough to confirm these conclusions.
I am convenced in my own mind, that when some politicians close to
Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real danger, some of them
will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though they may not be,
themselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will ne-
cessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un-
planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself
with a real "hot potato", requiring such drastic action similar to those
takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such
actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the
American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti-
American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help
bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and
decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the
OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are afraid.
that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces
based in Cuba and other countries, will make it much more difficult to
cope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore,
imperative, in our opinion, that the U.S. take some steps towards working
with local politicians to take the initiative of a coup which, when per-
formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present
regime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate
solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of
this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait-and-see
considerations. In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the political
scene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or
the other, we feel that the U.S. should not have any problem in finding
someone that they can build politically and work with in a sincere and
loyal effort to help that small nation solve some of its perennial problems.

The following is sy humble appraisal of the political situation
now prevailing in Haiti.
:
As 1 repeatedly stated to anyone who may have asked me, my mothe
vations ore purely patriotic while I am also moved by a sincere desire
to see Haiti emerge as a democratic independent nation friendly to the
United States.
Since I left Haiti with my family ten years ago to later become on
Ameen citizen, I have made several trips to Haiti and have maintained
close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with
those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other-
wise.
latest visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year und I
stayed two days in Port-au-Prince. Although the purpose of my trips
were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian
political situation with politicians, as well as with average Kaitian
citizens concerned with the situation. My personal conclusions are as
follows:
The fact is that the Duvalier regime is, at present, in a state of
internal political confusion in which no one directly or indirectly.con-
nected with it can predict the outcome. There is strong evidence showing
that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow
Duvalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political
affairs. How Duvalier became aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is
question everybody is trying to find the answer to. Nevertheless,
Duvalier rounded up the alledged associates of Colonel Dominique and,
after a mock coul: martial accusing and convincing 19 young any efficers
of treason they were all killed by a firing squad on June 8, 1967 at
Fort Dimanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Duvalier himself yas
present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to be a member of
the firing squad. Non-confirmed information from usually reliable sourous

indicates that several other persons, low railing military personnel,
militia men and civilians were also executed or similar charges, without
fanfare. It is also the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"
will continue at a rate that no one can yet determine.
-
:
No one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings
between two groups within the President's family and close associates.
One is headed by Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,
and another is led by Mrs. Yvon St. Victor, the President's private se-
cretary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his
son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Simone, are being mentioned as
being part of the first group. In the second group, Mrs. St.Victor's
brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr. Luc-Albert
Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, is among
other names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert
Jn.Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with Mrs. St. Victor. So far, the
President has shown signs that he favors the latter group. The ramifica-
tions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic
supporters of Duvalier himself. The fact is that none of the remaining
so-called strong men of Duvalier in the militia, the Tonton Macoutes or
the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very
much concerned about their own future and survival. In other words,
confusion and insecurity are wide spread amongst Duvalier's followers.
I believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity
prevailing in government circles, there is no real organized opposition
as such against Duvalier at this moment, except for what I will point out
later in this paper.
There is, however, strong anti-fuvalier feelings in the middle and
upper classes of Haiti, representings only a small percentage of the whole
population. A segment of the population to be taken into very serious
consideration is the one made up of the people living in the slum áreas,

where, like a miracle, the country will again take its course forward
to join the other progressive nations of this hemisphere. Unlike those
politicians who have seen their prominent positions as a temporaty state
of affairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr. Charles has
practically invested in Haiti almost all the wealth that he has accumula-
ted before and during Duvalier's reign through genuine efforts and self-
discipline. Of course, I will admit that his wealth would not have
increased in its present proportion if it was not for Duvalier's favors
Lut who else under the previous regimes who were in the same
position have genuinely directed their efforts in using their gains for
the betterment of the people? I have always find that Mr. Charles took
very much satisfaction in giving employment and assistance to as many
people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one of his
biggest assets in his present struggle.
to num.
1
Mr. Charles is not a demagogue. He believes in the realities of the
modern world. He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S.,
progress is impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit
of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled extensively, he is fully.
aware of the tragic state of stagnation in which his country is in. He
deeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the fields of human
dignity, education, technology and above all, Freedom.
All that I have said so far are my own personal opinion and also the
opinion of a large number of people in and out of Haiti. If some defer
in their evaluation of Mr. Charles, it is their privilege and undeniable
rights.
3
Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles
have to offer to the U.S. to prevent the chaos that will necessarily
Follow Duvalier's downfall? First of all, Mr. Charles is at present
ready and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime.
This, he assured' me, he can do without any outside assistance. I am
personally aware of certain confidential dispositions taken by him to
ascure the success of a coup if and when he decides to make it. Why does

:
4. Prevent the return to the Haitian political scene of such "rabble-
rouser“ so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Henri Vixamar;
5. Start the ground work for free elections as soon as possible.
Nr. Charles feels that although it will probably be impossible to pre-
vent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the military take
over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.
Kr. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few individuals around whom
a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdivisions of the
Haitian family can be achieved. I will mention some of the basic reasons
behind this opinion:
1. He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is what is called in
Haiti a "son of the masses"; .
2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the.
Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haitián as
a threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;
3. He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto
minority will find in him a certain feeling of security and can be as
sired that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color of
their skins;
4. He is wealthy, therefore credited for not ambitioning power for
mere personal gains;
5. He is known to be a hard, intelligent industrialist and adminis–
trator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of new
business and industries in Haiti;
7
6. He has shown respect for certain moral values such as the undeniable
right of the individual to live without fear within the framework of the
laws of the land;
13
7. He is a Roman Catholic who professes to have nothing to do with
"Voodoo" as a religion or a cult and who has given all the other religious-
denominations functioning in Haiti all the evidence of his encouragement
and support for their pastoral activities;

Plot of Clemard Charles to Overthrow Duvalier
At the suggestion of Mr. Bowdler, Howard L. Burris,
1725 X St., N.W., a Washington businessman who served in
the past as an assistant military aide to the President,
telephoned this morning and asked me to meet Mr. Louis A.
Brun at Mr. Burris' office. This I did this afternoon.

Mr. Brun, a nationalized American, owns and operates
the B & B International Corporation, 1182 Broadway, New
York. A native-born Haitian, he has lived in the States
since 1957. He is a close friend and confidant of Clemard
Joseph Charles, a Haitian banker who has been deeply involved
with the Duvalier government. Charles has fallen in disfavor
with Duvalier and several of his government concessions have
been cancelled. Charles is actively plotting the overthrow
of Duvalier and, according to Brun who saw Charles in
Port au Prince June 5-7, has 167 military and civilians ready
to move with him. None of this group was represented by the
19 officers who were recently executed or the 80 some Haitians
are errently in diplomatic asylum...

In the past, Charles has made afforts himself and
through Brum to get the U.S. Government to commit itself
favor of the overthrow of Duvalier but until recently: all
of these approaches were rebuffed, U.S. officiels having
stated U.S. policy was such that no plot of this nature could
be supported. Brun showed me; a. letter ha had just received
from Charles written on June 23 stating in a commercial langu-
age code which Brun and Charles use in their correspondence
that an American official last week had met with Charles in
Fort-zu-Prince and that Charles was most pleased with the
seating. The implication was that this 'American" had ·
indicated to Charles that the U.S. Government favored the
plotting. I flatly told Brun that the U.S. was not interested

always have a dialogue with him and therefore will find him receptive:
to their suggestions and endeavours;
9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regiše who imvo his
confidence, he will be able to control them in a way which will avoid
unnecessary hardships should someone else - a complete stranger to then -
be in a position of Government leadership;
10. He is known to be strongly anti-communist and pro-American, there-
fore opening the door to close cooperation with the United Statës, under
the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding
and opportunities for the Haitian people with the help of the United
States;
r
11. He will welcome the return of all Haitian exiles to take their
place anew within the Haitian community and to work with him to the task
of making the country a safer and better place to live;
-
12. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions against
anybody for their past political affiliations, his efforts to be mainly
directed not to solve the errors of the past, but to provide a better
present and future for those who want to live in Haiti.
The task, if and when he succeeds to gain power, will not be an easy
07.5. I am sure, however, that Mr. Charles will be able to find the sup-
port of enough honest and patriotic Haitians to help him carry out his
dream of building up a better Haiti.
'Mr. Charles' past affiliation with the Duvalier regime should not,
therefore, be held against him. As a matter of fact, this affiliation may
give him the foresight that he should do his utmost not to repeat the same
mistakes.
In conclusion, I feel that the U.S. Government, through its qualified
Agencies, should give Mr. Charles' offer to toppie the Duvalier regime, all
the required careful consideration and make a decision as fast as possible.

not he go ahead and make it, you may ask? His reply is that should
the make it, what assurances does he have that his action will satisfy
the U.S. As I stated before, Mr. Charles feels that without United
States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except under
the very same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no
reason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to remain under a tyranical
dictatorship like Duvalier's.
that Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to be
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established
authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will support the
provisional government that will necessarily have to assure power after
Duvalier.
The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that a military coup by a
Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are held. The
members of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,
who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles believe that in
free elections are held he should not have any great difficulty in selling
his plans and programs to the people and therefore be elected the next
president of Haiti. In my opinion, Mr. Charles is not asking too much.
Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned
above, I feel that the Haitian situation, long a sore note in the U.S.
hemispheric relations, could be changed without risk for all parties.
concerned.
Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk,
While I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles'
plans? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles will be made up by high
ranking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side
of the U.S. With U.S. assistance it is almost impossible otherwise
-
the
steps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over are as follows:
1. Disarm the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately;
2. Reorganize the Army and the Covernment services;
3. Prevent the interference of communist forces made of exiles Haitians
based in Cuba or elsewhere;

in supporting plotting of this nature, that our policy had
not changed, and that he should know this categorically. Brun
smilingly accepted this statement, but obviously considered
the "approach" in Port-au-Prince was more important than wy
exposition of U.S. policy..
Brun said he was in regular contact with Major James
Balog who, he described, as an intelligence officer from the
Pentagon. He said that he, Brun, had written a report on his
opinion re things Haitian and had given one copy to
Major Balog and one to Mr. Burris. He then handed me a copy
which is attached. This report is basically a plea for U.S.
prior indication to Charles that the U.S. would support any
Charles-formed provisional government created following the
overthrow of Duvalier.
I closed the half hour meeting with Brun insisting again
that he should clearly understand the U.S. Government was not
interested in becoming involved in this sort of an operation.

PRESIDENT ESTIME
AND PRESIDENT PAUL MAGLOIRE WERE OVETHROWN BY THEIR
CLOSE ASSOCIATES. DUVALIER HIMSELF WAS IN THE
FOREFRONT OF THOSE CONSPIRACIES AND KNOWS FROM
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE MOTIVATION OF THE PLOTTERS.
WHEN HE GETS RID OF MILITARY MEN OR CIVILIANS FROM
TIME TO TIME EVEN THOUGH THEY HELPED HIM GAIN POWER,
IT IS BECAUSE AS CHIEF OF STATE. HE IS FULLY AWARE OF
THE REALITIES OF HAITIAN POLITICS. CLEMARD JOSEPH
CHARLES, WHO GAINED MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS UNDER MAGLOIRE,
WAS AMONG THOSE WHO FINANCED DUVALIER'S CAMPAIGN.
IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT DUVALIER WOULD RESENT THAT
FACT. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHARLES IS ACTUALLY A
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND MANEUVERING
AGAINST DUVALIER, DUVALIER WILL DISCOVER SOME "EVIDENCE"
-LINKING CHARLES WITH THE NINETEEN EXECUTED OFFICERS.
2. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT CHARLES WAS NOT REALLY
AN ASSOCIATE OF DUVALIER'S. HE WAS REALLY NOTHING.

DUVALIER
ARRANGED THIS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES. HE NEEDED TO HAVE
A BANK TO RECEIVE NON-FISCAL DEPOSITS FROM WHICH HE
COULD MAKE WITHDRAWALS AS HE WISHED. OUT OF THIS ALSO
GREW ANOTHER REASON WHY DUVALIER IS ANGRY AT CHARLES.
WHEN THE NON-FISCAL ACCOUNTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANK RAN
DRY, THE BANK ADVANCED THE GOVERNMENT MONEY AGAINST BONDS.
CHARLES USED THESE BONDS IN HIS FINANCIAL MANIPULATIONS
AND THEY FELL' INTO THE HANDS OF FOREIGN SPECULATORS WHO
ARE NOW DEMANDING PAYMENT.
3. PLOTS SUCH AS CHARLES WAS ENGAGED IN WILL
NOT SUCCEED. DUVALIER HAS SO ORGANIZED THE GOVERNMENT
THAT THE OLD WAYS OF OVERTHROWING A REGIME ARE DENIED
TO CONSPIRATORS. HE IS NOT INVULNERABLE BUT ONLY BY
ASSASSINATION WILL HE BE REMOVED. HIS GOVERNMENT IS
BASED ON TERROR AND INTIMIDATION. THE BOLD STROKE IS
HIS STRENGTH. HE EXECUTED THE NINETEEN OFFICERS IN ORDER
TO STRIKE THE POPULAR IMAGINATION AND CREATE A PSYCHOSIS

Director, Domestic Contact Service
Operational Support Stall
Mr. George 8. Musulin
DCS Case 47540 - Contact
with Louis A. Brun
1. Reference is made to our memorandum of 12 April
1966 and subsequent communications on the subject of WH/7
Interest in the contact which had been established by DCS repro-
sentatives in New York with Louis A. Brun. This contact served
to monitor the activities of Chamard Joseph Charles, the Haitian
banker, who was plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime in
Haiti.
.
2. In June 1967, Charles was arrested in Port-au-Prince
and has spent the majority of the time since them in jail. He is
released at various intervals by Duvalier apparently to give him
the opportunity to lecate more money for the regime. Since
Charles foll from grace, it has become apparent that any hopes ·
er plans ho may have had to overthrow Duvalier have long since
past. Accordingly, we wish to advise that WH/7 has no special
interest in DCS maintaining contact with Brun to cover Charles'
activities. Likswiss, we do not feel that there are any special
requirements at this time which Brun could service regarding
Haitian matters.

Louis A. Bru
President
34 B. Internet al (2.7.
NYC
The following is my humble appraisal of the political situation
now prevailing in Haiti.
:
As 1 repeatedly stated to anyone who may have asked me, my moti-
vations are purely patriotic while I am also moved by a sincere desire
to bee liniti emerge as a democratic independent nation friendly to the
United States.
Since I left Haiti with my family ten years ago to later become an
American citizen, I have made several trips to Haiti and have maintained.
close contacts with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with
those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other-.
'vise.
.
My latest visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year and I
stayed two days in Port-au-Prince. Although the purpose of my trips
were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian
political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitian
citizens concerned with the situation. My personal conclusions are as
follows:
The fact is that the Duvalier regime is, at present, in a state of
internal political confusion in which no one directly or indirectly.con-
nected with it can predict the outcome. There is strong evidence showing
that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow
Duvalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political
affairs. Now Duvalier became aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is
the question everybody is trying to find the answer to. Nevertheless,
Duvalier rounded up the alledged associates of Colonel Dominique and,
after a mock court martial accusing and convincing 19 young army officers
of treason they were all killed by a firing squad on June 8, 1967 at
Fort Dimanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Duvalier himself was
present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to be a member of
the firing squad. Non-confirmed information from usually rollable sources

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear
logical enough to confirm these conclusions.
:
I am convenced in my own mind, that when some politicians close to
Duvalier will feel that their lives are in real danger, some of them
will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though they may not be,
themselves, in a position to control the chaotic situation that will ne-
cessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un-
planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself
with a real "hot potato", requiring such drastic action similar to those
takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominican Republic. Such
actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the
American taxpayers, but because they inevitably provoke strong anti-
American feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help
bring about the collapse, but is merely there to impose its choice and
decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S. is to wait for the
QAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are afraid
that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces
based in Cuba and other countries, will make it much more difficult to
cope with within the context of our national security. It is, therefore,
imperative, in our opinion, that the U.S. take some steps towards working
with local politicians to take the initiative of a coup which, when per- .
formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and otherwise, to secure an orderly succession of the present
regime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate
solution for the proposed action. I feel that whenever the security of
this nation or any nation is concerned, there is no time for wait-and-sės
considerations. In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the political
scene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions, one way or
the other, we feel that the U.S. should not have any problem in finding
someone that they can build politically and work with in a sincere and
loyal effort to help that small nation solve some of its perennial problems..

radically leftist oriented Government. If allowed time, Duvalier may
1. well succeed to turn the country into a now communist satellite and work
out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, we should not
fail to mention the new exchange of diplomatic representations between
Haiti and some communist countries. The most significant one is the new
appointment in Haiti of an Ambassador from Poland with whom, I was told,
Duvalier is closely working with.
Taking everything into consideration:
•
1. The non existence of any organized opposition in Haiti;
2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled
political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from
outside Haiti;
3. The fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to come
in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they
should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent
it at all cost;
4. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated
upon mere suspicion, just or unjust denonciations;
✓
5. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.3. is not working
as it should to bring about the downfall of Duvalier and that the U.S. is
even supporting the regime intentionally or unintentionally by not en-
couraging or allowing the opposition to organize'itself;
6. The interpretation of the above classes which are at a loss to under-
stand the silence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the
usual indignation about the recent mass killings, therefore making room-
for the belief of a possible collusion by means of money or otherwise of
Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Times, to refrain from
bringing these facts to the attention of international public opinion;
7. The strong belief that compromises have been worked out with President
Balaguer in the Dominican Republic to return to Haiti all opponents of
Duvalier who had fled there,
all this leads to believe that Duvalier will hold in power for quite a while
more.

indicates that several other persons, low ranking military personnel,
militia men and civilians were also executed on similar charges, without
fanfare. It is also the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"
will continue at a rate that no one can yet determine.
No one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings
between two groups within the President's family and close associates.
One is headed by Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,
and another is led by Mrs. Yvon St. Victor, the President's private se-
cretary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his
son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Simone, are being mentioned as
being part of the first group. In the second group, Mrs. St. Victor's
brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr. Luc-Albert
Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, is among
other names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert
Jn.Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with Mrs. St. Victor. So far, the
President has shown signs that he favors the latter group. The ramifica-
tions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic
supporters of Duvalier himself. The fact is that none of the remaining
so-called strong men of Duvalier in the militia, the Tonton Macoutes or
the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very,
much concerned about their own future and survival. In other words,
confusion and insecurity are wide spread amongst Duvalier's followers.
I believe that in spite of the actual confusion and sense of insecurity
prevailing in government circles, there is no real organized opposition
âs such against Duvalier at this moment, except for what I will point out
later in this paper.

ProThere is, however, strong anti-Duvalier feelings in the middle and
upper classes of Haiti, representing only a small percentage of the whole
population. A segment of the population to be taken into very serious

In connection with the possibility of finding a political leader,
as indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man
whom, I feel, could very well
Joseph Charles, President of Ba
Haiti's Chamber of Commerce, a

the position. His name is Clémard
te Commerciale d'Haiti, President of a
cctor of several other business and
I have known Mr. Charles since 1951. We have been friends and
business associates eversince. To me, Mr. Charles is a true and sincere
patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotism
on the basis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have.
myself, sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have also told him so,
many times. His answers on such occasions have, most of the time, satisfy
my own judgement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier,
as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he
were to behave in a different manner. What would his death serve if he
had taken a position of non-compromise? He feels that in order to be
able to control the situation and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be
"in" than "out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead. I can
say that on several occasions, was it not for Mr. Charles' influence on
Duvalier, this latter would have done more harm to the poor pelple of
Haiti in general, than he has done so far.
-
I have always maintained a dialogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to
him as much as possible the judgements of Haitians and others with whom
he had no direct contact. I must say that I have always find him re-
ceptive to their opinions.
Eversince I have known Mr. Charles, he has always told me of his
ambitions and determination to be a great Haitian. He asked me to never
let him down and to stay with him to help him carry out his dream. Though
it has cost me some of my friends, I have extended to him everything that
I could possibly offer to help him reach his goals.
Unlike the majority of limitian politicians, Mr. Charles has an un-
surmontable faith in the future of his country. He feels that if Haiti,
under Duvalier, has considerably regressed in every way, the time will come

not he go ahead and make it, you may ask? His reply is that should
ho make it, what assurances does he have that his action will satisfy
the U.S. As I stated before, Mr. Charles feels that without United
States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except under
the very same conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no
reason to precipitate a change if Haiti were to remain under a tyranical
dictatorship like Duvalier's. N
What Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any action to be
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established
authority in the U.S. Government that the United States will support the
provisional government that will necessarily have to assure power after
Duvalier.
The dispositions taken by Mr. Charles are that a military coup by a
Junta will take over and stay in power until free elections are held. The
members of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,
who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles believe that if
free elections are haid he should not have any great difficulty in selling
held
his plans and programs to the people and therefore be ſelected the next¨
president of Haiti. In my opinion, Mr. Charles is not asking too much.
Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned
above, I feel that the Haitian situation, long a sore note in the U.S.
hemispheric relations, could be changed without risk for all parties
concerned.
Y
Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk,
While I feel, it can wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charles'
plans? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles will be made up by high
ranking officers of the Haitian army loyal to him, therefore on the side
of the U.G. With U.S. assistance – it is almost impossible otherwise
steps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over are as follows:
1. Disarm the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately;
2. Reorganise the Army, and the Government services;
the
3. Prevent the interference of communist forces made of exiles Haitians

where, like a miracle, the country will again take its course forward
to join the other progressive nations of this hemisphere. Unlike those
politicians who have seen their prominent positions as a temporaty state
of affairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr. Charles has
practically invested in Haiti almost all the wealth that he has accumula-
ted before and during Duvalier's reign through genuine efforts and self-
discipline. Of course, I will admit, that his wealth would not have .
increased in its present proportion if it was not for Duvalier's favors
to him. But who alse under the previous regimes who were in the same
position have genuinely directed their efforts in using their gains for
the betterment of the people? I have always find that Mr. Charles took
very much satisfaction in giving employment and assistance to as many
people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one of his
biggest assets in his present struggle.
Mr. Charles is not a demagogue. He believes in the realities of the
modern world. He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S.,
progress is impossible for Haiti. He sincerely believes in the spirit.
of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled extensively, he is fully
aware of the tragic state of stagnation in which his country is in. He
deeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the fields of human
dignity, education, technology and above all, Freedom.
All that I have said so far are my own personal opinion and also the
opinion of a large number of people in and out of Haiti. If some defer
in their evaluation of Mr. Charles, it is their privilege and undeniable.
rights.
"
Now, if we are to take for granted my opinions, what does Mr. Charles
have to offer to the U.S. to prevent the chaos that will necessarily
follow Duvalier's downfall? First of all, Mr. Charles is at present
ready and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's regime.
This, he assured me, he can do without any outside assistance. I am
personally aware of certain confidential dispositions taken by him to
assure the success of a coup if and when he decides to make it. Why does

4. Provent the return to the Haitian political scone of such "rabble-
rouser" so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Henri Vixamar;
5. Star. the ground work for free elections as soon as possible.
Mr. Charles feels that although it will probably be impossible to pre-
vent acts of reprisals during the first 72 hours of the military take.
over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.
Mr. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few individuals around whom
a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdivisions of the
Haitian family can be achieved. I will mention some of the basic reasons
behind this opinion:
1. He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is what is called in
Haiti a "son of the masses";
2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the
Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haitian as
a threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;
3. He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto
minority will find in him a certain feeling of security and can be as-
sured that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color of
their skins;
4. He is wealthy, therefore credited for not ambitioning power for
mere personal gains;
5. He is known to be a hard, intelligent industrialist and adminis=
trator capable of promoting and encouraging the establishment of new
business and industries in Haiti;
6. He has shown respect for certain moral values such as the undeniable
right of the individual to live without fear within the framework of the
laws of the land;
7. He is a Roman Catholic who professes to have nothing to do with
"Voodoo" an a religion or a cult and who has given all the other religious
denominations functioning in Haiti all the evidence of his encouragement
and support for their pastoral activities;

8. Being a businessman in his own right, the business community with
which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will
always have a dialogue with him and therefore will find him receptive
to their suggestions and endeavours;
9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regime who have his
confidence, he will be able to control them in a way which will avoid
unnecessary hardships should someone else - a complete stranger to them
be in a position of Government leadership;
10. He is known to be strongly anti-communist and pro-American, there-
fore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under
the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to promote better understanding
and opportunities for the Haitian people with the help of the United.
States;
11. He will welcome the return of all Haitian exiles to take their

of making the country a safer and better place to live;

anybody for their past political affiliations, his efforts to be mainly.
directed not to solve the errors of the past, but to provide a better
present and future for those who want to live in Haiti.
The task, if and when he succeeds to gain power, will not be an easy
one. I am sure, however, that Mr. Charles will be able to find the sup-
port of enough honest and patriotic Haitians to help him carry out his
dream of building up a better Haiti.
Hr. Charles' past affiliation with the Duvalier regime should not,
therefore, be held against him. As a matter of fact,
As a matter of fact, this affiliation may
give him the foresight that he should do his utmost not to repeat the same
mistakes.
In conclusion, I feel that the U.8. Government, through its qualified
Agencies,`should give Mr. Charles' offer to topple the Duvalier regime, all
the required careful consideration and make a decision as fast as possible.

Attached two teletypes from DCS/New York City
-
1. At 1115 hours, 15 June, Dorothy MATLACK, "Department of the
Army, called the DCS Washington representative, George MUSULIN,
to inform that she had just received a phone call from Louis BRUN,
President, B & B International, NYC, requesting an "audience"
MATLACK contacted DCS for advice. Allegedly, BRUN wants to pass
the two letters from Haitian Banker CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES to
MATLACK. DCS called the Haitian Desk for advice to formulate a
reply to MATLACK.
2. WH/7/Haiti has identified the two American contacts mentioned
in references as follows:
DOROTHY MATLACK: Employed in the Office of the
Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, U.S. Army. Has been a
participant on the Interagency Defector Committee and has
been issued an Agency badge. Both TSD and OCR have shown
interest in her.
b. COLONEL HOWARD LAY BURRIS; Born Texas, 1918,
graduate of U. S. Military Academy. Believed to be retired
from the USAF. His name, along with Pierre SALINGER, etc.
was included on a list from the Office of the Vice President.
requesting an SI clearance, 10 February 1961. Considered to
be a Texas millionaire.
3. DCS suggested that MATLACK inform BRUN to contact
Major BALOG (DCS representative, New York City) with whom BRUN has
been in contact, and pass the letters to him. Final decision
rests with WHD.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Clamard Joseph CHARLES (201-357029)
1. Background: Clemard Joseph CHARLES, born Conaives, Haiti,
21 April 1923, is a Negro of peasant origin. CHARLES is a shrewd,
opportunistic, basically dishonest individual whose natural talents
have been channelled to President DUVALIER's advantage over a period
of ten years. Having made considerable money in the banana business,
CHARLES was able, in 1960, to create the Commercial Bank of Haiti, of
which he is still the sole owner. Since its beginning, the Bank has been
an instrument for DUVALIER's financial manipulations, and CHARLES
is a subservient agents for the President in many of the latter's
clandestine operations conceived to evade U. S. Government surveillance.
CHARLES, for example, was DUVALIER's agent in the operation designed
to smuggle surplus U. S. military aircraft to Haiti and, in fact,
made a trip to a USAF base in Arizona to effect purchase, which was
later blocked. After long, close association with DUVALIER, during
which CHARLES had become extremely wealthy, he managed to incur
DUVALIER's displeasure. Gradually CHARLES' influence diminished in"
favor of Henri SICLAIT, Director of the Regie de Tabac.
began to realize that he no longer enjoyed DUVALIER's favor, he
began, for the second or third time, to seek channels to the
U. S. Government and to solicit support for himself as a successor to
the President.

AB CHARLES
2. Agency Contact: CIA contact with CHARLES in the U.S. dates
back to May 1963 when he was visited in his suite in the Hotel Willard
in Washington by a representative of WH Division. Since that time,
he has made his every visit to the U.S. an occasion to talk to some
official of the U. S. Government. The most persistent of his
approaches has been made to DCS/New York, which he believes leads him
to the Department of Defense. Never has this unscrupulous, overly-
ambitious charlatan offered any evidence that he has anything going
for him inside Haiti. The names he has furnished as his alleged
collaborators have meant little or nothing. His approach to a Station
representative in Port-au-Prince in January 1967 produced nothing in
the way of hard information. His reports, passed to DCS/NY through
his business representative in New York, have been evasive and, in some
instances, utterly false. Fabrication has in some cases been obvious.
3. In brief, CHARLES is trying to coarce the U. S. Government
into some sort of support for his presidential aspirations. Should
anyone listen to him, it would simply mean that the U. S. would have
to take over the entire operation and move him in behind a regiment
of Marines. State Department, Haiti Desk, has long considered him
highly undesirable. Let higher-placed buyers beware!

AND CHARLES WERE AWARE THAT THE INFORMATION WOULD REACH
U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
1. (SUMMARY: CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL

HIS PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO CHARLES,
HE NOW HAS 290 SOLDIERS (OFFICERS AND MEN). WHO ARE READY TO STRIKE

BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH WITHOUT FOREIGN HELP TO STAY IN
POWER. HE WARNED THAT IF U.S. GOVERNMENT HELP IS NOT FORTHCOMING,
THE CASTROITE HAITIANS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF SEIZING POWER.)
2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF
CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES HAS BEEN DRAWN FROM INFORMATION FROM
VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES: SINCE ABOUT 1963, CHARLES HAS TRIED
TO GAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AS THE SUCCESSOR
TO PRESIDENT DUVALIER; HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN
OPPORTUNIST, SHREWD, CAPABLE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS, AND HAS DUVALIER'S
CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAS USED TO FURTHER HIS OWN EFFORTS AGAINST
DUVALIER. THE INFORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING
MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CHARLES' ATTEMPTS TO PANIC THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AND THEREBY GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
WHICH MAY CONSIDER CHARLES AS THE LESSER OF A NUMBER OF EVILS.
HIS ALLEGED SUPPORTERS, LISTED BELOW, ARE BELIEVED TO BE
INSIGNIFICANT AND HIS ALLEGED ARITY SUPPORTERS ARE SUSPECT.
CHARLES' REFERENCE TO FIDEL CASTRO AND DOMINICAN PRESIDENT
JOAQUIN BALAGUER AS HIS COMPETITORS IN A RACE TO OVERTHROW
DUVALIER IS CONSIDERED TO BE WITHOUT BASIS - A CALCULATION BY
CHARLES TO FORCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S HAND IN HIS FAVOR.

3. CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK
OF HAITI, WHO IS PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT,
IS TO UNDERGO A MINOR THROAT OPERATION ON 14 JUNE 1967 IN
PORT-AU-PRINCE, CHARLES. WANTED TO HAVE THE OPERATION IN THE
U.S., BUT DUVALIER "STRONGLY SUGGESTED" THAT IT BE DONE LOCALLY.
4. CHARLES, WHO IS INCREASINGLY FEARFUL THAT DUVALIER WILL
BECOME AWARE OF HIS PLOT AND WILL "ELIMINATE" HIM, AGAIN PLANS
TO SEEK U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. HE DESCRIBED THE CONDITIONS IN
HAITI AS NEAR CHAOTIC AND REITERATED THE NEED TO GET RID OF
DUVALIER. HE SAID THAT HE NOW HAS 290 SOLDIERS (OFFICERS AND MEN)
WHO ARE READY TO STRIKE AT ANY TIME AND KILL DUVALIER.
BAID THAT HE AND HIS "HIGH-RANKING ARMY OFFICER FRIEND" FEEL THEY
HAVE ENOUGH AMMUNITION AT THEIR COMMAND TO HOLD OUT FOR 24 HOURS.

His referral in this, and in a previous report, to
Castro and Balaguer as his competitors in a race to
overthrow Duvalier is considered to be nonsense. All
this is calculated to force the U.S. hand in his favor
His attempt to find a channel to the Pentagon are in
the pattern of his action for several years. Should he
succeed he might be convincing enough to cause trouble.

when he sent an chissary to New York City to talk to Louis Onnaarica, a
prominent anti-Duvalier exile, whose entire family was killed by Dulalier's
henchmen. Sansaricq agreed to support Charles in a final showdown with
Duvalier and promised to line up some of his fellow exiles to super's
Charles. A close friend of Charles was planning to go to New York în
mid-tiny 1967 ostensibly to discuss port development projects in Port-au-
Prince with a U.S. construction firm; however, the real purpose of the
trip is to contact Haitian exiles to gain their support for Charles.

Ma chère Sophie,
Cette lettre est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 mai
écoulés et du 4 juin en cours.
Si tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis mon départ d'Haiti le 7 mai dernier,
c'est que premièrement, je me proposais de retourner voir Clémard la semaine.
suivante. Le voyage a dû être différé lorsque j'ai suique Clémard avait, à
nouveau, été arrêté le 11 mai. J'ai même eu à faire un câble à un ami pour /
lui annoncer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en informer.
r
Dueièmement, l'arrestation de Clémard ainsi que les nouvelles der derniers
événements en Haiti on eu des effets négatifs sur les négociations en cours
que j'avais entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir.. Je n'ai
pas besoin de te dire combien j'en ai été bouleversé. Alors que nos amis
d'ici et moi pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous estimons comme un frère,
sa nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous
nous remettons à peine.
Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu no dois point douter de notre
dévouement pour Clémard. Il sait, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne
sarions jamais marchander notre concours à un ami pour qui nous avons ŉ plus
grande affection et pour qui nous sommes prêts à consentir tous les sacrifices
personnels que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir to dire que
si, en dehors d'Haiti, je n'arrive à le tirer de l'impasse dans laquelle il se
trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre puisse
réussir à le faire.
-7
Nos puissants amis communs tant à New York, Washington, Miami et ailleurs ont
tous manifesté un désir sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs
possibilités respectives.
2
Depuis mon retour d'Haiti je me suis mis en action à cette fin et al personelle-
ment vu plusieurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à
consacrer une grande partie de leur temps précieux à la concrétisation des plans
que j'ai eu à envisager avec Clémard en vue de lo tirer d'embarras le plus
rapidement possible.

4. Charles has stated that should he becere President of Haiti, he would
pursue a pr.-U.S. policy, eliminating the Duvalierists and the Communists
and establishing a "liberal democratic" regime.
5. Charles still is pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalior; however,
his position has become shaky and he believes that his life is in danger.
Ho feels that ho may fall victim to Duvalier unless he (Charles) strikes
first. For the time being, Charles will continue to support Duvalier in
an effort to allay the President's suspicions. As president of the
Haitian Chamber of Commerce, Charles soon will deliver a speech praising
the achievements of Duvalier. He is anxious for the U.S. to know that
his overtures toward Duvalier are pretense and that he is determined to
go into action against the present regime.
Headquarters Comments
CS-311/05457-67, from another reliable source, reported that Charles and
Herve Boyer, former Minister of Finance under Duvalier, were contending
for power in the Haitia Government.
1. In the past several months, Charles has made numerous attempts to
elicit support from several U.S. Government agencies for his plot
against the Duvalier Government.
2. No reason was given for Charles' belief that it would be in the best
interest of the U.S. to support his scheme to overthrow Duvalier.
However, he may be referring to his claim that should he became
President of Haiti following the overthrow of Duvalier, he intends
to pursue a pro-U.S. policy and establish a "liberal democratic"
regime.
3. Source Comment: Cayard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, is
& secret ally of Charles.

Xes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont
heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres-
tation de Clémard que des derniers événements survenus en Haiti depuis le
20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces
grands amis, Mr. Howard Burris de Washington, D.C. Jo to demande de garder
cette lettre strictement confidentielle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom
de Mr. Barris soit, mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous
pourrions perdre un très bon ami.
Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Burris est un colonel retraité du
Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, and personnel et conseiller du, Président
Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washington tant dans le monde politique que
financier. J'ai eu à faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mai au ·
coura desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clemard selon le "modus"
envisagé. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui
précède.
J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintes fois au téléphone,
Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a
da renvoyer son voyage, après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.
Je lui ai encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a eu à me faire part des
résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances.
Le lettres adressées aux autres amis de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example,
sont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longue-.
ment à Dabinovick pour lui transmettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir
d'avoir un mot encourageant de lui.
Comme tu dois le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre
bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en
question qu'il nous faut trouver no sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signalerai en
passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir
qua mônu ni nos mumis seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clemned les valeurs nécessaires,
ila ont des doutes sérieux non pas sur la sincérité de Clémard à faire face aux,
obligationò qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de ra-

Concernant maintenant le grand banquier noi dont j'ai eu moi-même à dire à
Clémard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a ou à me faire comprendre
qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de co
genre qui comporte trop de risques. De ce côtô là il n'y a donc pas grand espoir.

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient incurmontables, je n'ai
pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clúmard, sain et
scuf, ĉe la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le sais. L'essentiel
est que le Chef lui-même soit persuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à
satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon imputables à Clémard
mais plùtôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.
+'
Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en
bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme
plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence pro-
ductive.
Je me proposals d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie
d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher.
Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un geste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu.
de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.
Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de féaliser au moins partiellement, la
valour exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une
procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que
nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.
!
Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à
remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins .
le tiers dé la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure
de venir ici à New York, ce qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im
possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu devrás donc agréer aux conditions
stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller au
plus vite.
Ma chère Sophie, je termineral cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou-
velant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clémard et en te
priant une nouvelle fois de ne jamais douter de mes sentiments propres et ceux
de ma famille pour Clémard, toi et les tiens.
Affections à Gros-Miche, Marie-Claudine, Toto, Eddie et sa femme.

Secretary of State for Justice Rameau Estimé, who is a good friend of
Captain Tassy, is in serious trouble. Estime, a brother of a former
president of Haiti, may lose his position. Bince he himself has
presidential ambitions, he may become a candidate for this office 18
he survives the present crisis.
Another potential rival for the presidency is Secretary of State for
Labor and Social Welfare Max A. Antoine, who claims the support of
the labor unions.
10. According to Vilaire, the wildest rumors are rampant in Haiti. For
example, even intelligent persons give credence to the allegation that
the US Government is not really anxious to see the downfall of
Duvalier end that a portion of the US$40 million hitherto allocated
to President Balaguer of the Dominican Republic as development loans
vas passed on, with the tacit consent of the US, to "Balaguer's
good friend," Duvalier. Another rumor states that the CIA is now in
the process of training Haitian exiles in the US for a possible
invasion of Eniti. The name of Luse Fouche, a former senator in Ha
and a former Ambassador to the US now in exile in New York City. has
been mentioned as one of those receiving training in guerrill
varfare.
11. One of Vilaire's ains during his prement visit to the US is to
convince influential Haitian exiles that Charles is not a Duvalier
supporter and that he would make a good president. – Vilaire has
already contacted, through Bin, Louis Sansarioq, a prominent as
Arvalier exile in New York City, and hopes to meet other exile.

friends and Haitian exiles in an effort to gain support for Charles.
Coaxton and Brun talked on the phone 12 May 67.
banker stated
that he is "hied down" in Port-au-Prince until the end of May, at
which time he may make another business trip to the UB.
Brun is firmly convinced that Charles has already made the decision
to overthrow the Bwvalier government with his friends and the he
must act fast to prevent chaos and a possible Commmist teks-over.
Vilaire and Brun agree that the political and economic situation in
Haiti is such that "the population wants a chauge, any change, and
would even welcome & Commmist coup." They added that Charles and
his military friends wish to prevent Castro-supported Commist
seizure of power.

5. Veriquin, who was in charge of the TTM in the Petionville section of
Port-au-Prince, was dismissed by Duvalier because the President
suspected him of siding with the Dominique clique. Dominique, an
Asmy officer and son-in-law of Duvalier, was offered a military
attache position either in Spain or Italy, which he refused to accept
as his wife is reluctant to leave Halt at this time. This
situation is complicated by the decision of Duvalier's wife to side
with her daughter. The rift in his own family as well as the attempt
of his enemies to disrupt the celebration of his 60th birthday and the
10th anniversary of his taking office prompted Duvalier to remark that
the only man he trusts is Gracia Jacques, commander of the Presidential
Quard. This statement antagonized even those who have hitherto been”
loyal to Duvalier. Moreover, even the most faithful Duvalier
supporters now fear for their lives. Colonel Caillard, who is in
charge of the Coast Guard, bitterly complained to Charles about
Duvalier's remark and reassured the banker that he and his friends
· vere ready to set up a military junta.
'
6. In addition to the Coast Guard ships, Charles would have the use of
Vilaire's converted Le, which normally plies the waters between
Jamaica and Port-au-Prince carrying flour, fual oil, etc. Vilaire
is convinced that Charles has no choice but to carry out the coup withi
or without foreign help and that his chances of success are good since
zuveral of the nw Duvalier expointees to kay military and civilian
positions are Charles' friends. Vilaire fools that Charles mist act
now since the moule of many of the military and civilian supporte
of Duvalier has reached an all-time low and the Haitian Treasury is
almost capty. Since Duvalier has been unable to obtain foreign
capital, he has again resorted, through his Senretary of State for
Commerce and Industry Lebert Jean-Pierre, to a shake-down of commercial
må industrial enterprises. In a circular letter, dated 2 y 67,
May
the Secretary supealed for "volunter contributions as a fitting
bonge to the Venerable President for Life, Chief of the Duvalierist
Evolution. acry of the letter is attached.)
-Pierre and Esuri Sialait, confidants of Duvalier in charge of
the Rugia de Tabne and dos Allumettes, are among the staunchest
suporters of the president. Both men have stolen considerable
quants of publia Amds and succeeded in aminzling some of their
samy out of Maiti.

Dear Mr. Brun
I apologize for the delay in responding to your
suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti.
My activities here have been such that I have been..
unable until the past day or so to give your pro-
posal adequate thought and consideration.
First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion
attempt caused certain reflection and it is this
kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful, that
could cre a serious dislocations for those established.
in business. However I must assure you that this was
only a refletion and the reason that I will be unable
to accep. your offer is the extent and nature of my
activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded
s some of them during your visit. The occasions when
I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to
dove u any significant amount of time to the bank's
dctivities here would be rare indeed. 1. shall coniess
to you that I declined a similar position on a bank
Ward here in the states for the same reason.

I regret that this decision is necessary but I hope
that in future relationships we may be able to do
something useful and successful in Haiti.

10 May 1967
SUBJECT: 'Plans of Haitian Banker Clemard Joseph Charles to Overthro
the Duvalier Government - Case 47,540 (Re-opened)
1. En 9 May 1967 Louis A. Brun, B&B International Corp., New York
City, furnished the following information.
2. He and Clemard Joseph Charles, President of the Banque Commerciale
D'Haiti and President of the Chamber of Commerce of Haiti, have discussed
in detail the possible overthrow of the Duvalier Government in the near
future. During his visit to New York City in the first week of May, 1967,
Charles stated that he is now ready to execute his lòng-planned scheme
to seize power with his military and civilian friends in Port-au-Prince,
with or without the help of the United States Government. Charles
further stated that he had rifles and hand grenades hidden "somewhere
in Haiti." In addition he will have, through his good friend Colonel
Caillard, Chief of the Haitian Const Guard, three Haitian boats under
his control. Caillard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, is a
secret ally of Charles and is now ready to place this three boats, which
carry commons, at the disposal of Charles. The trouble is that Caillard
does not have enough ammunition for the cannons. Charles hopes to obtain.
the necessary summutition from the US Government. He would like to receive
the mmunition from the US Carrier, BOXER, which has for some time
been on duty in the Caribbean ares. Charles believes that it is in the
best interest of the US Government to give him all necessary help in his
effort to get rid of Duvalier who has brought Haiti to the brink of total
economic collapse.
'
unnamed high
3. Besides Caillard, Charles has the support of
ranking Haitian Army officer, Charles and his military, as well
civilian, friends plan to set up a provisional Junta and get rid of the
"ponics of Haiti," that is, Duvalier and his supporters. After
consolidation of power in the hands of the Junta, Charles will run for
President. He is convinced that he can win since he has many supporters
fa Fort-au-Prince as well as in rural areas. Charles claims that he
"controls" Armen Catholic and Episcopalian clergy, teachers and students,
several businesmen, and key militia figures in the rural areas who now
wait for his signal to overthrow the present regis
$
b. Charles is still pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalier
However, he feels that his life is now in danger and unless he strikes
first, he may fall victim to the President. His position has become
shakey. In early 1967, at Duvalier's request, he submitted a memorandum
to the President describing the wrong doing of Henri Biolait, who is in:
charge of the Regio de Tabeo and Des Allumettes (tobacco and match industry),

but it appears that Duvalier took. Bialait's side. According to Charles,
Siulait has been successful in raising money for Duvalier and also had
beautiful homes built for some of the President's key supporters.
Charles stated that he had given a copy of his memorandum on Biclait
to the US Ambassador in Port-au-Prince.
5. Although he has relationships with the US diplomatic service in
Purt-au-Prince, Charles expressed his desire to "cooperate with a Liaison
Officer from the UB". When asked to elaborate, he stated that it would
be too dangerous to contact a US diplomat in Port-au-Prince; instead
he would prefer to cooperate with"Ṁ Liaison man from the Pentagon.
6. Charles stated that as President he would pursue a pro-US policy,
eliminating the Duvalier elements and the Communists and establishing
"115eral democratic" regime. If he fails to receive US help in his
effort to overthrow the present Haitian Government, he will still
chead with the planning, but the execution of his scheme will take
more time.
-
7. For the time being, Charles will continue to support the Duvalier
vernment, in an effort to allay the suspicions of the President.
wrles, in his cepacity as the President of the Haitian Chesber
Commerce, will soon deliver a speech praising the achievements of
Duvalier, Charles is cnxious for the US Government to know that
is just a pero'ance, that he now is determined to go into action against

Headquarters Comments
1. Charles is president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, and Boyer
is a former Minister of Finance under Duvalier. Another source,
whose reporting has been infrequent, but considered reliable, has
reported that Boyer has signed a contract to work with an interna-
tional organization in Europe. If Boyer leaves Haiti, it is possible
that he will forego his ambitions for power in the Haitian Govern-
ment, or that his endeavors will be hampered seriously by his
absence from the country.
2. Laroche is Deputy Chief of Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces, His
ambitious and corrupt character, and his overtures toward Duvalier,
have gained him his power within the Army over the placid, easy-
going General Gerard Constant, Chief of Staff of the Haitian Army.

A foreign businessman who has lived in Haiti for a number of years and
who is acquainted with high officials of the Haitian Government. He is
an untested source. Source obtained this information from a high-level
Haitian Government official.
1. Haitians Clemard Joseph Charles and Herve Boyer are contending for power.
in the Haitian Government, and each has hopes of succeeding President
Francois Duvalier. Although they are working together and will join
forces in order to get rid of Duvalier, they probably will start fighting
between themselves once this objective is obtained.
Colonel Jacques Laroche is the military's primary contender for power,
and undoubtedly he will be the one to consolidate a military movement
against Duvalier. Since the dismissal of high-ranking military officers
by Duvalier in November and December 1966, Laroche has enjoyed the greatest
power within the Army.
3. If Duvalier is assassinated, it is likely that there will be bloodshed in
the streets. In this event, it would be the Army who would step in
immediately and control the situation. Despite the fact that the Army
is small and weakened from its loss of high-ranking offficers, it still
would be powerful enough to neutralize any effort by the Haitian militia
(VEN) because the VSN is disorganized and would be unable to cope with
the confusion, which would be caused by an unnatural death of Duvalier.:
However, if Duvalier dies a natural death there would be less chance of
hostilities because the people around Duvalier would have a better
chance of taking power.
.
+
There is little chance that Evalier will step down from power volun-
tarily because of his pride. However, in this respect his family,
particularly Mrs. Duvalier, has constantly encouraged him to give
the presidency and appoint a successor.

FIELD REPORT - NO.
THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
A foreign businessman with wide contacts in Port-au-Prince. Source
reports infrequently, but his information is believed to be reliable.
He received the information from a person close to Charles.
1. In discussing the possibility of overthrowing the Duvalier Government in
the near future, Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank
of Haiti, said he now is ready to execute his long-planned scheme to
seize power with his military and civilian friends in Port-au-Prince, with
or without the help of the U.S. Government. If he fails in his efforts
to obtain U.§. support for his plan, Charles still intends to go ahead
with the plot, but he said the execution of his scheme will take more
time. However, Charles believes that it is in the best interest of the
U.3. to give him all necessary help in his effort to get rid of President
Duvalier who has brought Haiti to the brink of total economic collapse.
i
2. Charles said that he has rifles and hand grenades hidden "sĉmeyt
eyhere in
Haiti" and that through his good friend. Colonel Octave Cayard,³ commander
of the Haitian Coast Guard, three Haitian bords, which carry cannons,
will be under his control. Cayard cannot furnish enough ammunition for
the cannons, but Charles hopes to obtain the necessary amount from the
U.S. Government. He would like to get the ammunition from the U.S.
aircraft carrier, BOXER, which has been on duty in the Caribbean area
for some time.
-
3. Besides Cayard, Charles has the support of an unnamed high-ranking Haitian
Army officer. Charles and his military and civilian friends plan to
set up a provisional junta and get rid of the "enemies of Haiti," that is,
Duvalier and his supporters. After the consolidation of power in the x
hands of the Junta, Charles plans to run for President and is convinced
that he can win since he has many supporters in Port-au-Prince as well
as in the rural areas of Haiti. Charles claims that he "controls" the
Catholic and Episcopal clergy, teachers and students, several businessmen,
and key militiamen in the rural areas who are waiting for his signal to
overthrow the present regime.

A foreign businessman with wide contacts in Port-au-Prince who is believed to
report accurately what he learns. This information was obtained from a alose
friend of Charles who probably was aware that it would reach U.S. officials.
1. Clemard Joseph Charles, president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, claims
that since Maj. Coicou (fmu), a close friend, has replaced Capt. Harry
Tassy in the Presidential Guard, he (Charles) now has an access to arms
and ammunition in the basement of the Palace and is in a position to carry
out a coup against President Francois Duvalier "in the near future."
Although no definite date has been set yet for the coup, Charles is convinced
that it must be carried out "within the next few months" to save Haiti from
economic and political chaos. Charles, and especially his military Friends,
feel that 1967 is the year of decision.

3.
Although Col. Fiarn-Louis (fm),² commander of the Dessalines Barracks,
vas not camed as a fellow-conspirator, Charles believes that Pierre-Louis
knows of and approves his plans to overthrow Duvalier, and that he (Charles)
"controls" the Dessalines Barracks through Pierre-Louis. Col. Octave Caillard
is one of the key military figures on whom Charles pins his topes. Caillard
is thoroughly disillusioned with Duvalier and is willing to cooperate.
Caillard fears that if Duvalier remains in power, Haiti's economy will be
cœplataly ruined and Haitian exiles receiving guerrilla training in Cuba'
may attempt to seize power in Haiti.
Charles has the support of Capt. Preval (fnu), 3 of the Presidential Guard,
and realizes that high-ranking officers loyal to Duvalier could cause bloodshed;
Charles and his associates expect violence during the initial stages of the
coup
addition to ships of the Haitian Coast Guard, Charles now has the use of
352-ton converted landing craft (LC) which normally sails between Juznica

5. Charles had no contact with Haitian exile groups until early May 1967,
when he sent an emissary to New York City to talk to Louis Bansaricq, a
prominent anti-Duvalier exile, whose entire family was killed by Duvalier's
henchmen. Sansarieg agrzeú to suport Charles in a final showdown with
Duvalier and promised to line up some of his fellow exiles to support
Charles. A close friend of Charles was planning to go to New York in
mid-May 1967 ostensibly to discuss port development projects in Port-au-
Prince with a U.S. construction firm; however, the real purpose of the
trip is to contact Haitian exiles to gain their support for Charles.
6. On 19 May 1967, a group of prominent Haitian exiles held a meeting in
New York City to celebrite Haitian Flag Day. One of the organizers of
the meeting was Dr. Jumelle (fmu)," a medical doctor whose brother was
a former Haitian Minister of Finance and who was killed by Duvalier.
Another exile who attended the meeting was Vixamar (fru) who claims to
be a legal advisor to the Republic of Chad and who said that he was going
to be the next president of Haiti. The group of Haitian exiles, believed to
call itself the "National Organization of Haitian Exiles", has some members
who back Charles.
7. Following are prominent Haitians who Charles believes must be eliminated
after the coup:
Col. Gracia Jacques of the Presidential Guard Jacques, who is no longer
blindly loyal to Duvalier, will be needel in the execution of the coup,
and can be bought; however, once power is in the hands of a military
Junta and Charles, Jacques will be eliminated.

If the coup is successful, Charles hopes to give Andre Theard, former
Haitian Ambassador to the United States, a diplìmatio:post; Theard is
strongly pro-U.S. Charles regards Gerard Philippsaux, Minister of Health,
as a very sick man with no further political aspirations.
9. Close friends of Charles are convinced that Charles has no choice but to
carry out a coup with or without foreign help, and that his chances of suZOGSO
are good because several of Duvalier's, new appointees to key positions are
friends of Charles; also, that Charles must ach soon because the morale

4. Charles has stated that should he become President of Haiti, he would
pursue a pro-U.S. policy, eliminating the Duvalierists and the Communists
and establishing a "liberal democratic" regime.
5. Charles still is pretending to be a loyal supporter of Duvalier; however,
his position has become shaky and he believes that his life is in danger.
He feels that he may fall victim to Duvalier unless he (Charles) strikes
first. For the time being, Charles will continue to support Duvalier in
ar. effort to allay the President's suspicions. As president of the
Haitian Chamber of Commerce, Charles soon will deliver a speech praising
the achievements of Duvalier. He is anxious for the U.S. to know that
his overtures toward Divalier are preténse and that he is determined to
go into action against the present regime.
Headquarters Comments
C8-311/05457-67, from another reliable source, reported that Charles and
Herve Boyer, former Minister of Finance under Duvalier, were contending
for power in the Haitian Government.
1. In the past several months, Charles has made mumerous attempts to
alicit support from several U.S. Government agencies for his plot
against the Duvalier Government.
No reason was given for Charles' belief that it would be in the best
interest of the U.S. to support his scheme to overthrow Duvalier.
However, he may be referring to his claim that should he become
President of Hatti following the overthrow of Duvalier, he intends
to pursue a pro-U.S. policy and establish a "liberal democratic"
regime.
Source Commere: Cayard, who enjoys the confidence of Duvalier, is
secret ally of Charles.

Requirements for BALOG Contact With Clemard Joseph Charles
A. Basic Points To Be Stressed;
1. The U.S. Government cannot make any commitment of
support to Clenard Joseph Charles.
2. Clemard Charles should not infer, imply or boast
of U.S. support in his attempts to gain support for hi
project. The U.S.G. does not wish to be accused of »
overthrowing other governments.
3. Charles should be told, however, that any information
concerning his plans, intentions and movements will not
under any circumstances be divulged to the GOH nor to
other countrymen of his.
• Balog and his friends are definitely interested in
Charles' activities and information he can provide
relative to the situation in the latter's country.
Specific Requirements. Relative to His Plans Since he
Claims to Have Certain Capabilities:
1. What elements or groups within the GOH, the military
and police do you have actually committed to your plan
of overthrowing Papa Doc (Duvalier)?.
Give the strength of each group? Names of leaders?
When do you plan to execute your project?
4. How do you intend to handle the situation with regard
to the Presidential Guard, the Dessalines, troops and the
police in Port au Prince?
In the execution of your scheme what is the extent

to New York City. If he does, BRUN and Capt. BALOG will
discuss the latest developments with him.
4. During the past few days, CHARLES and BRUN have been
in almost daily telecommunications, ostensibly discussing
business matters. Using certain code words previously agreed
upon in person, CHARLES is able to tell BRUN about the recent
situation in Haiti without arousing the suspicions of Haitian
phone censorship. Parts of the information contained in

"As Department and CIA Washington are well

has several times in past taken similar line.
In my judgment he is again fishing to see if

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Genevieve ALYEA,
Domestic Contact Service re CLemard Joseph CHARLES
(201-357029).
1. At 1500 hours, 21 April 1967, Miss Genevieve ALYEA
Domestic Contact Service, X3026 (Green. Phone 3024) called the
undersigned to inform the Haiti Desk of comments made on a
teletype message from their DCS representative in New York
City, Mr. BALOG. According to Miss ALYEA, Mr. BALOG had
interviewed a U.S. businessman who travels frequently in
Latin American (later identified as Luis BRUN), on conditions
in Haiti. Mr. BALOG had teletyped the report to DCS Headquarters
and had added the following comment at the end of the report.
.
"On 20 April, Mr. BALOG in New York City, inter-
viewed the source (BRUN). The source visited Port au Prince
during the latter part of February 1967 and spent one week
as the guest of CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES (President of the
Commercial Bank of Haiti). Source, who maintains telephone
and cable contact with CHARLES, is convinced the latter
(CHARLES) has decided with his unnamed Army friends, to
overthrow President DUVALIER now. Source says CHARLES had
asked his U.S. business partner, Joseph DRYER, Palm Beach,
Florida (Home phone: 655–2610; Business phone: 832-6331) and
another person identified as "EARL" (probably Earl 0. FINNEY,
AID official) to get in touch with the U.S.State Department
before the end of this week. "EARL", who is supposed to have
influential friends at the State Department, will try to
persuade the U.S. Government that CHARLES, who has presidential
aspirations, now has the power and determination to get rid
of DUVALIER. CHARLES, who now fears for his life, sent his

1. A dark negro about 5'7" tall, Clemard Joseph L. Charles?
was born at Gonaives, Haiti, on 21 April 1923. According to him-
self, his father was a professor and his mother & "simple peasant"
According to others he is sensitive about his origins and is re-”
ported to have changed his name from Canerien because of the con-
notation of nothing less implied in the name. His father is ver-
iously reported to have been a carpenter and & peasant.
He re-
ceived his primary education at the parochial school and graduated
from the Lycee Geffrard in Porte Prince in 1939. According to
eu
his own account he taught in rural schools, worked as a patholo-
gist, upholsterer, time-keer, plantation supervisor, and free-
lance journalist. In 1947 he was appointed Controller General of
Haitian Southern Banana Industry and in 1948 became General Agent..
The following year he established himself as Manufacturer's
Representative and created his own export and import business.
In 1959 he went to London as a member of the Economic Mission of
the maition Government, una in 1954 negotiated on the Haitian
Government's behalf' & contruct with the General Electric Co.,
Ltd. of Coventry, England for the modernizing and extending of the
telecommunications system of Haiti. He later said that both his
ventures into the banane and telecommunications businesses were
unsuccessful due to political interference. Hip success story,
according to a U.S. official "apparently hinges on the fact that
he feels that he has achieved stature in the community both socially
and politically". Charles States that he created the Banque
Commerciale d'Haiti (CH) in 1960 and is now the sole owner.

portedly received the key to the City of New York. he has visited

9. Personality. Charles is enerally considered us shrewd
but not intelligunt. This is borne out by his willingness to
cooperate with the international swindler, Mohammed Fayed in a
number of money-muking schemes which came to a rinding helt when
Fayed absconded with an undetermined but large amount of money.
He has little sence of economic realities and is apperently
sensitive about his knowledge or lack thereof. The Emoassy re-
ported in December 1965 that át a meeting Duvaller was holding with
Antonio Andre (President of the National Bank of Huiti BAKH
that andre shouldve made to divert some of the "coffee money”
from the national Bank to Duvalier's own needs. (Apparently
Charles was referring to certain taxes on coffee exports which go
to the Bank for deut amortization.) Andre roundly criticized
Charles and other self-styled financial and fiscal experts in the
Government, and unded by telling Duvalier that if the latter
followed the advice of such persons ne would wreck Huiti. Charles.

to the story which was current at the time that he had had a

in early 1963 that Charles was a "slippery character" but that
some doubt existed concerning his importance or political signi-
ficance within the regime. A few months after this estimate was
mede, Charles conversed with a US Embassy official. Throughout
their talk he showed an obvious desire to atmonstrate his total
political disinterest in the post while simultaneously hinting
that he could become a political Figuro in the near future. He
made guardou statements about the Düveller regime, unhesitatingly.

1. Reference "A" forwarded to you à letter from Loula
A. Brun, B&B International Corporation, 134 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York, to Clemard Joseph Charles, Port-au-Prince,
Haiti. This letter was to be sent by State Department diplomtic
pouch to Mr. Robert C. Felder, United States Embassy, Port-au-
Prince, Haiti, and given by him to Charles. Brun had told us
that Felder had agreed to act as intermediary for correspondence
between himself and Charles and added that he and Charles, had
already used the system. The letter in Reference "A" was the
first time we had been approached in the matter.
2. Reference. "B" stated that the letter had been dispatched
via Message Center Courier to the State Department on 24 June-
1968.
3. On or about 26 June 1968 Brun telephoned us and stated
that Charles had not received the letter. We telephoned Mr.
Musulin, who double-checked and assured us that the letter had
gone to the State Department and that it should go out in the
next pouch.

On 10 July 1968, Brun telephoned us and stated that
on 9 July 1968 he had received a telephone call from a Ray
Alvares. Alvares identified himself as a State Department
employee in Washington and told Brun that he had the letter
destined for Charles. Alvares then told Brun that he would
return the latter if Brun would tell him how it had reached the
State Department. Brun refused to give Alvares any information.
We then telephoned Mr. Musulin and relayed the foregoing in-
formation. Mr. Musulin inquired into the matter and learned
that the letter had gone to Haiti in the State Departumunt pouch,
had not been delivered to Felder and had been returned to
Washington. He and we surmised that the State Department did

not wish to lay itself open to the charge of becoming embroiled
in local Haitian politics and so had refused to deliver the
letter to Felder. We reported this information to Brun.
5. On 11 July 1968 Brun telephoned us and told us that
he had received a letter from Charles via the Folder channel.
This letter bore a New York City postmark. We gave this infor-
mation to Mr. Musulin. We told Brun that it is quite probaule
that Felder has a personal arrangement with unknown parties
which permits him to use the diplomatic pouch facilities. Since
we do not, letters can go only from Charles to Brun and not
from Brun to Charles. Brun and we agreed that he will not
henceforth attempt to use Felder to send letters to Charles.
6. Mr. Musulin agreed to retrieve the letter from the
State Department and to send it to us. We shall return it
forthwith to Brun.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Letter from Louis A. Brun to FSO Felder
1. I talked with George Musulin (DCS/Ops Support
Staff) at 0840 hours this morning about the letter mailed
to FSO Felder at the American Embassy in Port au Prince,
Musulin said that he had spoken with Brun about the letter
and Brun had assured him that Felder said to mail letters
to him through Foreign Service mail channels. Brun is in
contact with Felder during his visits to Haiti and this
system was laid on between them during one of his trips.
2. Brun also said that he was a little upset about
☐ the problems which had arisen in sending his letter Brun
said that he had received a letter from Felder (mailed in
New York City) saying that he had never received the letter
from Brun. Brun was concerned that the letter may have
fallen into the wrong hands in Haiti. Musulin said that
he would try to recover the letter and send it back to
Brun.
3.
.
I told Musulin that Ambassador Ross was very much
disturbed about this matter and that any further involve-
ment by the Agency with correspondence between Brun and
Felder should be avoided. Brun is a business agent of
Clemard Joseph-Charles and thus any correspondence between
Brun and an official of the American Embassy is of parti-
cular concern to the Ambassador because of the obvious
political implications. Musulin said he understood this
and would tell Brun that the dispatch of any correspondence
in the future would be his own responsibility.

Clémard Joseph CHARLES
President and General Manager
of the Commercial Bank of Haiti
Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has
insisted on numerous occasions that he will
be the next President of Haiti, has been
chronically involved, directly or indirect-
ly, in rumored plots against President

· Duvalier which have never materialized.
In May 1963 Charles is reported to have
passed word to US officials through an
American journalist that he was in a
position to head a provisional govern-
ment after President Duvalier had been
removed from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966
and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York
and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting
US support for a group of conspirators he claimed to lead.
which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None
of these plots materialized, however, and there was never
any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made.
1
In January 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with
an official of the US Embassy in which the former candidly
discussed his grievances against Duvalier and the plot he
claimed to be instigating to overthrow Duvalier and replace
him as President of Haiti. Charles stated that the group
supporting his efforts consisted primarily of soldiers, a
few militiamen, some professional men, priests, students,
and assorted other well-placed individuals. He claimed
that representatives of these groups had already agreed on
the essential elements of a constitution which would in-
clude a bicameral legislature and an operative political
party structure. The reporting official cautioned, how-
ever, that Charles' remarks should be viewed in light of
his previous history of relating such conspiracies..
When President Duvalier was reported to be seriously
ill in mid-May 1969, Charles' neme was again mentioned in
connection with myriad rumors of imminent government take-
avers. According to a reliable source, a military junta
was formed to take power in the event of the death of
Duvalier. The junta purportedly included Gen. Gérard
Constant, Col. Octave Cayard, Col. Kusner Blain, Col.
Roger St. Albin, and Col. René Prosper. Charles was said

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient insurmontables, je n'ai
pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clémard, sain et
sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le snia. L'essentiel
est que le Chef lui-même soit persuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à
satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon imputables à Clémard
mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.
F
Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en
bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comme
plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence pro-
ductive.
}
Je me proposals d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie
d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher.
Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un geste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu
de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.
Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de réaliser au moins partiellement, la
valeur exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une
procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que
nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.
Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à
remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins
le tiers de la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise- en mesure
de venir ici à New York, co qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im-
possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu devras donc agréer aux conditions
stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller au
plus vite.

Ma chère Sophie, je termineral cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou-
velant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clémard et en te:

Dear Mr. Brun
I apologize for the delay in responding to your
suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti.
My activities here have been such that I have been
unable until the past day or so to give your pro-
posal adequate thought and consideration.
First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion
attempt caused certain reflection and it is this
kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful; that
could cre d serious dislocations for those established
in business. However I must assure you that this was
only a reflection and the reason that I will be unable
to accept your offer is the extent and nature of my
activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded
to some of them during your visit. The occasions when
I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to
deveto any significant amount of time to the bank's
activities here would be rare indeed. 1 shall coniess
to you that I declined a similar position on a bank
board here in the states for the same reason.
•
I regret that this decision is necessary but I hope
that in future relationships we may be able to do.
something useful and successful in Haiti.
sincerely,

Nes espoirs de réussite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis. contactés se sont
heurtés aux effets négatifs inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres-
tation de Clémard que des derniers événements survenus en Halti depuis le
20 mai écoulé. Je t'envoie, pour preuve, copie d'une lettre d'un de ces
grands amis, Mr. Howard Burris do Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder
cette lettre strictement confidentielle car je n'aurais pas aimé que le nom
de Mr. Burris soit mentionné à quiconque en Haiti. Si cela arrivait, nous
pourrions perdre un très bon ami.
Pour ton information, je te dirai que Mr. Durris est un colonel retraité du
Corps de Génie de l'armée américaine, ami personnel et conseiller dụ Président
Johnson et extrêmement influent à Washington tant dans le monde politique que
financier. J'ai eu à faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mal au
cours desquels lui et moi envisagions les moyens d'aider Clémard selon le "modus'
envisagé. La copie de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te confirmer ce qui
précède.
J'ai aussi vu personnellement et lui ai causé maintes fois au téléphone,
Joseph Dryer, qui devait se rendre en Haiti le 24 mai pour te vois mais qui a
dû renvoyer son voyage après les nouvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.
Je lui ai encore causé récemment au téléphone et il a eu à me faire part des
résultats négatifs de ses efforts, toujours en fonction des mêmes circonstances.
Le lettres adressées aux autres amis de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example,
sont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses. Je vais une nouvelle fois écrire longue-
ment à Dabinovick pour lui transmettre ta dernière communication avec l'espoir
d'avoir un mot encourageant de lui.
Comme tu dois le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre
bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en
question qu'il nous faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signalerai en
passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir
que même si nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécessaires,
ils ont des doutes sérieux non pas sur la sincérité de Clémard à faire face aux
obligations qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de ra-·
patrier, en dollars américains, les valeurs avancées. J'ai personnellement assisté
à des contacts avec des banquiers d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtemps, Haiti
n'aura presque, plus de dovisos-dollars pour solder ses comptes à l'étranger. Autant
d'obstacles que je suis malheureusement obligé de te signaler pour que tu saches
▲.quoi t'en tenir.
"
Concernant maintenant le grand banguter noir dont j'ai eu moi-même à dire à.
Clémard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a ou à me faire comprendre
qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de ce
genre qui comporte trop de risques. De ce côtô là il n'y a donc pas grand espoir.

Clémard Joseph CHARLES (cont.)
to be aware of the identities of these men.
Furthermore,
according to an official of the US Embassy, at one time
it appeared that Charles had originated the idea of the
junta, hoping to utilize it eventually to launch his own
candidacy for the Presidency. Subsequently, however,
Charles changed his statements about being "the next
President" to being "a future President," and he seemed
to be placing some distance between himself and the pro-
posed junta.
During Charles' aforementioned conversation with an
Embassy official in January 1969, he revealed other facets
of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting.
He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost
messianic terms. He said that he had invested $2 million
in Haiti and had done more for the development of the
country than any other indigenous Haitian. He claimed,
for example, that the workers in the Artibonite were ..
passionate admirers of his because his tannery in Port:
Sondé (now closed) provided needed jobs. He also, claimed
the special allegiance of the chauffeur guides, the only
truly organized workers in the country, because when he
directed the compulsory Government Motor Vehicle Insurance
program, legitimate chauffeur claims were paid. He im-
plied that such claims were no longer honored.
↑
:
Discussing the internal problems of his country,
Charles stressed the need for immediate steps to prevent
the total destruction of Haiti's land and resources, to
control the spiraling population growth, and to rejuvenate
the country's secondary cities. To achieve these goala
before current trends become irreversible, Charles believes
that it is essential to pursue relations with the United
States that would be conducive to massive assistance: and .
investment. In this respect he insists that Duvalier
has been grossly unrealistic and has done Haiti great
damage by his refusal to recognize the role the United
States must play in Haitian affairs.

bonne volonté, ne sauraient se concrétiser à brève échéance, car les valeurs en
question qu'il nous faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te signaleral en
passant un point qui a été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui fait ressortir
que même si nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécessaires,
ils ont des doutes séricux non pas sur la sincérité de Clémárd à faire face aux
obligations qui devront être contractées, mais à la possibilité matérielle de ra-
patrier, en dollars américains, les valeurs avancées. J'ai personnellement assisté
à des contacts avec des banquiers d'ici qui affirment qu'avant longtemps, Haiti
n'aura presque plus de devises-dollars pour solder ses comptes à l'étranger. Autant
d'obstacles que je suis malheureusement obligé de te signaler pour que tu saches
& quoi t'en tenir.

Concernant maintenant le grand banquier noir dont j'ai eu moi-même à dire à
Clémard que je croyais pouvoir nous aider, celui-ci a eu à me faire comprendre
qu'il ne pouvait an l'occurrence intéresser son institution à une affaire de ce
genre qui comporte trop de risques. De od oôtô là 11.nly a donó pas grand espoir

not wish to lay itself open to the charge of becoming embroiled
in local Haitian politics and so had refused to deliver the
letter to Felder. We reported this information to Brun.
5. On 11 July 1968 Brun telephoned us and told us that
he had received a letter from Charles via the Földer channel.:
This letter bore a New York City postmark. We gave this infor-
mation to Mr. Musulin. We told Brun that it is quite probsule
that Felder has a personal arrangement with unknown parties
which permits him to use the diplomatic pouch facilities. Since
we do not, letters can go only from Charles to Brun, and not ·
from Brun to Charles. Brun and ve agreed that he will not
henceforth attempt to use Felder to send letters to Charles.
6. Mr. Musulin agreed to retrieve the letter from the
State Department and to send it to us. We shall return it
forthwith to Brun.

that Felder had agreed to act as intermediary for correspondence
between himself and Charles and added that he and Charles had

destined for Charles. Alvarez then told Brun that he would
return the letter if Brun would tell him how it had reached the
State Department. Brun refused to give Alvarez any information.
We then telephoned Mr. Musulin and relayed the foregoing in-

Ceci dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui sembleraient, insurmontables, je n'ai
pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clémard, sain et
sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, je le snis. L'essentiel
est que le Chef lui-même soit persuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons à
satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon imputables à Clémard
mais plutôt à des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.
Je prie Dieu Tout-puissant pour que l'on finisse par réaliser que Clémard, en
bon patriote haïtien, a eu foi en son pays et n'a pas eru bon d'expatrier, comme
plus d'un l'a fait, le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son intelligence pro-
ductive.
Je me proposais d'écrire personnellement à Son Excellence le Président à Vie
d'Haiti, pour implorer sa clémence et sa générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher.
Je me suis alors demandé si c'était là un geste sage qui pourrait avoir la vertu
de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'ai préférer m'abstenir.
Pour revenir maintenant aux possibilités de réaliser au moins partiellement, la
valeur exigée, je dois te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une
procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant à ratifier tout ce que
nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.
Séparément, par cette même voie, je te communiquerai toutes les formalités à
remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délai raisonable au moins
le tiers de la somme réclamée. Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure
de venir ici à New York, co qui faciliterait beaucoup les choses, mais dans l'im-
possibilité d'une pareille alternative, tu. devras donc agréer aux conditions
stipulées. Il faudra donc agir avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller
plus vite.
Ma chère Sophie, je terminerai cette lettre déjà longue et ardue en te renou-s
velant mon dévouement le plus entier à la cause de notre ami Clénard et en te
priant une nouvelle fois de ne jamais douter de mes sentiments propres et ceux
de ma famille pour Clémard, toi et les tiens.

Dear Mr. Brun
rn.
'I apologize for the delay in responding to your
suggestion concerning the commercial bank in Haiti.
My activities here have been such that I have been
unable, until the past day or so to give your pro-
posal adequate thought and consideration.
First I must admit that the recent abortive invasion
attempt caused certain reflection and it is this.
kind of activity, successful or unsuccessful; that
could cre c serious dislocations for those established
in business. However I must assure you that this was
only a reflection and the reason that I will be unable
to accept your offer is the extent and nature of my
activities here in Washington. I believe I alluded
to some of them during your visit. The occasions when
I would find it possible to visit Port-au-Prince or to
deve any significant amount of time to the bank's
activities here would be rare indeed. I shall coniess
to you that I declined a similar position on a bank
board here in the states for the same reason.
"
I regret that this decision is necessary but I hope
that in future relationships we may be able to do
something useful and successful in Haiti.
Sincerely,,,

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
US citizen; independent businessman who has visited in Haiti for extended
periods during the past four years. He is currently attempting to promote
private financial backing for installation of generating equipment at the
Barrage de Peligre dam and for educational television in Haiti.
(This report was developed and prepared by a US Army representative
assigned to the office of preparation.]
1. I recently spent approximately three days in Haiti (9-12 Dec 68) and
while there had extended visits with Clemard Joseph Charles, President,
Banque Commerciale d'Haiti, and also owner of a sisal plantation and mill.
Present during my visits with Charles was his personal assistant and con-
fidant, Ludovich Celestines. Charles, a devout Catholic, personally told
me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier. He has made specific
plans for this overthrow in late February or early March 1969. He claims
that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with him, and
that the overthrow will be without bloodshed.
2. I had not intended to contact other officials or individuals in Haiti.
However, on the last day of my stay I was invited to visit with Clovis
M. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr.
Duvalier's Minister of Finance. He is said to be the No. 2 man in Haiti
next to Duvalier. Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant,
Dr. Herve Boyer and reportedly the No. 3 man.
BACKGROUND
3. I first met the individuals mentioned above in 1965-66 while on an
extended stay in Haiti for business purposes. I was introduced to Charles
by Max Howe, a driver assigned to me by the Haitian Government and whose
wife, Raymonde, was the personal secretary for Charles. Rowe continued 2
to drive for me on that first and subsequent visits to Haiti except on
this latest visit when he was absent in the US.
ist
When I first met Charles he was President of the Banqué Commerciale
d'Haiti, owned the Sisal plantation and mill, also owned a tannery
financed by West German interests, and was the President of the initi
Chamber of Commerce and Haitian correspondent for the First National
City Bank of New York. During the period upproximately one year prior
to June 1967, Charles put into effect a system of Social Security (Office
of National Assurance) which was working well and liked by the Haitian

1. Recently-released Cleard Joseph Charleg has received
postponement of the deadline by which he just juoduce the
1739605 thousand required as "ransas" for his persuous release,
The new deadline is late September 1960,
2. Shortly before Charles' rearrest in Maý 196Ồ Rene
Adrien visited him at his residence and raxnstrated with him.
Milton, one of the directors of the innque Nationale de la
Mepublique d'Haiti (IŔH), told Charles that his (Charles), had
not done enough since his release to procure the Ub4005 thousand
and added that Charles was receiving too many visitors. Charles
Insponded with such a tirade of abuse that Adrien left the
house. Charles was rearrested that same alternoon. At about the
same time, Yvon Baint-Victor visited Charles and talked to him
in much the same vein as had Adrien. Charles' response to
Saint-Victor was about the same as his answer to Adrien. Baint-
Victor's wife is President Duvalier's secretary.

3. Since his release in June 1968, Charles has agreed
to intensify his efforts to raise the US$605 thousand and to
cease receiving so many visitors at his house.
4. Charles will undoubtedly revive the schame to raise
US$605 thousand through subscription by foreign investors.
and to place it in a reorganized Banque Commerciale d'Haiti

to get the required sus into Haiti and at the same time to ensure
that it would not simply be confiscated by the 00ff. The idea
was born because Charles and his friends felt (and still feel)
that if he simply handed over US$605 thousand be would then
be liquidated. Thus, the BCH schame would serve as a sort of
insurance policy on Charles' life. On the other hand, it
possible that the 00 would refuse to accept the bCH scheme
as a substitute for a direct payment and would continue to
insist on the direct payment of the US$005 thousand as ransom.
It is possible, however, for the following reasons that hes.
ident Duvalier would consent to the BCH achomeFirst, he is
desperate for money and does not much care in just what form
it my enter Haiti. Second, he approaches his problems on
day-to-day basis and does not plan far into the future. Third,
he is obsessed with the idea of retaining power for life. Now,
Duvalier is perfectly well aware, I am sure, that the BCH scheme
will not net him 028605 thousand. On the wwwi land, however,
he is quite anxious for foreign investors to place their money
in Haiti, both for the economic benefits which such investments
will bring to niti and also for the propaganda value which a
new foreign business will bring to him. If he liquidates
Charles, either before or after receiving the US$605 thousand,
he vill suffer much unfavorable publicity. It is possible, too,
that he may think that he may be able to get his hands on the
US$605 thousand even though it may be tied up in the BCH ·
scheme. In any event, Charles is, I believe, going to make
the effort to induce the President to allow the BCH: scheme
and thereby to bring an end to the "ransom" demands

price for his velenco. Charles now socus to feel that if he
does not produce thú money, he will be exocuted. During May 1960,

people. He also devised an automobile insurance system and was financing
this through the Banque Commerciale d'Haiti.
5. In a period just prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and
Boyer that Charles was, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' over-
throw. Together with a large group Charles was imprisoned in Port-au-Frinde
from June 1967 to June 1968. -
6. Just prior to the arrest of Charles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took
US$200,000 out of the bank and hid it near Cap Haitien in the north and
advised Charles' wife of the location. In addition, Max Rowe claims
I that in June 1967 he and his wife (Raymonde Rowe is in process of getting
US citizenship. Max is in the US on a visitor's permit) brought papers
incriminating Charles to the US and destroyed them.
BANK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION
:
7. Although Charles has the bank, his position at present is difficult. I
saw the bank balance sheet which shows assets of US$2.9 million but only
US$29,000 (as of 10 Dec 68) cash on hand. With this small amount of cash
he can no longer make loans. He says that he has found it necessary to
make sizeable loans to Haitians who have in turn made highly speculative
loans to others at exorbitant rates of interest. Very minor amounts of
these loans have been repaid to the bank and thus his current financial
position.
8. Charles is hopeful that when Duvalier's, overthrow has been completed he
will be able to get private financial assistance from the US. According
to Charles, US financial organizations have almost completely stopped
their assistance because of the oppressive Duvalier Government.
9. Charles says that Max Rowe is aware of his plans to overthrow Duvalier:
which were communicated to Rowe by a La Bonte Jean, who is also in the
US. Charles says that the Army is unhappy with Duvalier because of the
execution of fourteen officers after the abortive May 1968 invasion,
which included Major Toma, who was popular and powerful in his position as
a censor and in control of all foreigners coming into Haiti. Charles
maintains that the Ton Ton Macoutes are no longer a potent force - not
operational. They have no food and are receiving no pay.
☐
10. John Pierre La Grand, UK Consul General in Haiti and Shell Oil General
Manager, agrees with Charles that Desinor and Boyer are Duvaliers closest
confidants. Fito Metales (alias Fritz Belmont) is said by Rowe and
La Grand to be Duvalier's hatchet man. He is manager of the Croupiers
at the Royal Cabaret. La Grand says that the "old man", (Duvalier) is
stronger than ever, both in health and power.

citisen of Haitian origin when he has known for several years. Brun
brought a letter from Cleard Joseph Charles dated 6 May 1968 in Part

illegally imprisoned for ten months but now is released. As President
of the Commrcial Bank of Haiti in Port au Prince, Charles professes
great interest in the patristic duty of developing his country econom
ically. He states that the busrer, Mr. Brun, in charged with presenting
mally a proposition from him, Charles. He also asked Burris to deliver
a letter addressed to Vice President Humphrey. (Burris declined´and
suggested it be sent through the mails.)

investment funds from Burris' contacts. Moreover, he is not
senguine about the prospects in Haiti at present, to use understatenant
However, Oakley has reason to believe that Burris might be cooperative
should it suit official purposes to have him become involved. This
aspect was not discussed in the least.
Burris says that Brun and Charles are somehow involved with
Bank of Nova Scotia which syparently operates in Haiti. Moreover
two banks are offering participation in seme kind of concession
thich they have, or hope to obtain, involving mineral rights through
out Haiti. Buria (and Oakley) are not overly impressed that this
consists of more than the usual promotional effort.

1. Clemard Joseph Charles was rearrested at 1600 hours 11 May 68.
His present whereabouts are not known to mo.
It became clear, during the period between 3 May 68 and 16 May 68
that Charles would not be able to raise the ransom sum of US$605
thousand. His release from prison, which took place on 25 Apr 68,
was apparently contingent on his ability to produce that sun.
Collector's Note: See 00-B-321/14068-68.7. Immediately fol-
Towing his release, Charles attempted to interest foreign
investors in subscribing to a fund of US$605 thousand. This
is sum
was to be placed in a reorganised Banque, Commerciale d'Eniti,
formerly Charles' private preserve, and used to pay off depositors
and to stimulate investment in Haitian enterprises. Charles
soon learned, however, that the present political and particular-
lý the present economic ocnditions in Haiti were such as to
discourage foreign investore from risking their money there.
Hobody would invest US dollars. Nobody wants gourds. Hobody
is interested in investing in a bankrupt country. Even Charles
reported willingness to plodge as collateral his extensive hold-
ings in Haiti (essential oils and various other business enter-
grises, land, buildings and mitian government bonds) failed to
change the negative opinions of those approached as possible
investors.
.
Charles holds a receipt from the Banque Nationale de la Repub-
lique d'Eniti (HERH) in the amount of US$300 thousand dated
1956, and claims from the another personal credit of
US$100 thousand, dated 1965. He does not, however, hold a copy
of any receipt for the latter sun. Charles apparently cannot
utilize these sums, or his credit for them, to pay off the
US$605 thousand ransom.
Charles' current visible each assets consist of US$100 thousand,
deposited in the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and the
First National City Bank, both of New York City. He originally
had US$110 thousand in these two banks. When he was first

imprisoned in 1967, the Enitian authorities (no additional
available) compelled him to sign a mmber of blank checks of
these two banks. The authorities then cashed a check for
US$10 thousand, which the bank honored. When the Haitian
authorities next presented filled-in checks, however, the be
refused payment, because it knew of his arrest and refused to
believe that he had signed a check after his arrest. The
Enitian authorities then abandoned their attempts to lay their
hands on the rest of the money.
5. It is possible that President Duvalier might settle with Charles
for the US$100 thousand on deposit in New York, when, as and
if he finally realizes that Charles is not able to raise the orig-
inal 18/605 thousand endod. On the other hand, it is entirely
possible that Charles has other funds secretly deposited outside
of Haiti. It must be recalled that he acted for some time as
courier for President Duvalier, periodically took money for the
President to Switzerland and deposited it there for him. Charles
may therefore have utilized the opportunity to deposit some
wn money outside of Maiti.

1. Effective 10 Jul 68, Clemard Joseph Charles was reinstated
as the president of the Commercial Bank of Buiti (ECH), as
announced in the Haitian public press. A stockholders' meet
ing is scheduled for mid-Aug 68.
I have heard from previously reliable sources that Charles was
compelled to pay to the Government of Haiti (GOH) the sum of
US$200 thousand (not Haitian gourds) as the price of reinstate-
ment as head of the RCH. Charles has also promised, as part
of the price of reinstatement, to pay an additional US$400
thousand. This total of US$600 thousand closely approximatas
the US$605 thousand cited earlier as the "ranson" for Charles'
release from prison. I understand that the US$200 thousand
has already been paid. “Where Charles got this sum. I do not
know. He could have withiram the US$100 thousand which he
has on deposit at the First National City Bank in New York
City; I do not know whether or not he has done so. It seems
clear that President Duvalier has decided that the possible
long-term benefits of allowing the bank to function (and thus
enabling Charles to raise the required US$400 thousand and also
possibly attracting foreign investment capital to Haiti) out-
weigh the benefits of refusing him permission to operate until
the total "ransom" should have been paid.

President Duvalier is reportelly most interested in the new nture and is
anxious to see it succeed. He has finally realised that the economic situation
in Haiti han deteriorated so badly during the past 18 months that he must do
something before total bankruptcy occurs. Accordingly, President Duvalier vante

Son-in-Law of Haitian President Duvalier
1. On 6 October 1967, Louis A. Brun, President, B&B
International Corporation, 1182 Broadway, New York City, stated
that Haitian banker Clemard Joseph Charles has, in fact, con-
trary to previous information, been in contact with Colonel
Max Dominique, son-in-law of Haitian President Duvalier. While
Brun vas not able to supply any details concerning this rals-
tionship, he believes that it is political in nature and
possibly not unrelated to the various storias now circulating
concerning plots to unseat the President.

Brun also stated that Dominique is scheduled to arrive
in New York City for a visit in the near future (no additional
details available).
