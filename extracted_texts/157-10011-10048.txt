Mr. Madigan. Did there come a time when you were asked
by the Central Intelligence Agency to be involved in a
project which would involve sending a woman by the name of
lorence Horn over to a foreign country?
Mr. Maheu. Yes, sir.
Mr. Madigan. And what were you asked to do with regard
to that?
Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I was asked to find
woman, preferably from. Los Angeles, who would agree
á foreign country and under some pretext try to meet the
Leader of the country and hopefully change his basic philosophies
which at the time were thought to be detrimental to the United
States, and that they were very, as a result, very seriously
Sjeopardizing the national security of the government of the
United States.
Mr. Madigan. Did you find such a woman?

if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced
by Onassis tankers.
Our statistics, after having studied the contract and
making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated
that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,
Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the
United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control
on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of
14 gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during

in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence out of the Swiss bank
accounts, in other words, contrary, to what a lot of people

as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of
mines. It was in fact to Carl Twitchell that the old king gave
the power of attorney to come to the United States government
or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium
for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCO.
Carl was the type of man who was only reimbursed for his
expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess
of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage
for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was
highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king
was then gone and King Saud, the son, was in power, Mr
Twitchell had the same respect and reverence from the present
leaders as he did from the father and I convinced Mr. Twitchell
