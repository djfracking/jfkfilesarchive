For the period 1 December 1964 31 March 1965,
BENADUM was paid quarters at the rate of $4, 024. 92 although
the maximum allowance was $3,700 per annum. For the four
months, BENADUM was overpaid $108. 28 ($27.07 x 4).
Presuming the project has sufficient funds and the
COS decides the maximum rate is applicable, the overpayment
is to be offset against the increase.

Jeremy K. BENADUM, Quak
Reference: HMMT-10052
1. Reference asked Headquarters guidance in determining
possible adjustment in the Quarters Allowance for Jeremy K.
BENADUM, Career Agent. Reference stated:
--BENADUM purchased his local residence 1 December
1964 for $50, 200 and cost of utilities average $98 monthly.
--Although the current maximum Quarters Allowance
for BENADUM is $4, 700 per annum, the Station has been paying
at the rate of $4, 128. 96 per annum.
--Reference forwarded a list of BENADUM's estimates
of utilities costs and a LNPURE memo on personally owned quarters.
2. The formula described in Para 3 of the LNPURE memo
has been used in prior cases and is that which is also used by the
Allowance Committee. Based on this formula, 10% of $50, 200
(original purchase price) plus $1, 176 (yearly utilities), total $6, 196.
The amount granted BENADUM would presumably be the maximum
unless the Station had determined a lesser rate was applicable due
to cover or operational reasons.
3. Using the effective date (5 October 1969) of the current
Quarters Allowance rate $4, 700 ($4, 100 plus $600 for dependents)
minus the rate being paid, $41, 128.96, Express an increase of
$571.04 per year or $47.58 per month.ibatis.

SUBJECT
: Retirement Planning
6 FEB 1970

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their eventual retire-
ment, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each employee at a point in
service five years prior to the date of scheduled retirement.
taking this opportunity to advise you that you are scheduled to retire in
I am, therefore,
August
1975.
2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of
life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency
will make available to you various resources which are attuned to the needs
of prospective retirees. In October 1970, the Agency will conduct a Retire-
ment Information Seminar to which you will be invited. Your spouse, if you
are married, may accompany you to this seminar. Following the seminar, you
will be invited by the Retirement Counselor for your Directorate to an
individual pre-retirement counseling session (or more than one, if
this phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own par-
you wish);
ticular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the
retirement system under which you will retire. The Individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of Information on such matters
as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits, life and health insurance,
Social Security, taxes, relocation and movement of household effects and
assistance in obtaining other employment, if appropriate. In addition to the
sessions with your Retirement Counselor, you will be invited to avail yourself
of selected literature on all aspects of retirement.
3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the scheduled
date, or who wish to commence their planning as early as possible, prefer to
work with their Retirement Counselor well before the time he would normally
contact then. If you believe you would benefit from such an earlier start
on your personal planning, you are invited to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate, He is assigned from your Directorate to
the Retirement Affairs Division; 212 Magazine Building in Rosslyn, on telephone
extension 3328.
!
Experience has amply demonstrated that caretul planning facilitates
the transition to retirement. I recommend, strongly, that you avail yourselt
at the services the Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

PERSONALLY-OWNED QUARTERS
Because of the number of inquires received regarding personally-
owned quarters, the following memorandum which has been sent to
a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy on the
subject:
When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190
should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as
shown by the deed. Section 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show
annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of
the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign
Areas). These are the only items of cost to be considered.
When the quarters allowance system provided for reimbursement
for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the regulations
provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should
not exceed 10 percent of the purchase price, converted to dollars
at the exchange rate available at the time of purchase, plus allow-
able utilities. The 10 percent of purchase price was ample to
take care of taxes, depreciation; repairs, interest on investment,
and amortization of the costs within a reasonable period of time
by U. S. standards. Only light, fuel, and water could be added
in arriving at the allowance.
4
Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that
the flat rate will be paid unless the authorizing officer believes
it necessary to reduce the payment under Section 134.2 of the
Standardized Regulations. The employee in personally owned
quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that
he cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances under
Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes
unnecessary a special rate for personally owned quarters. The
requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-
vide the authorizing officer additional information to be considered,
together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding
whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, if so, how
* much. Only the utilities costs are to be considered in addition
to the purchase price except in those rare instances where land
rent is involved. Because of varying conditions between posts
and individuals, it was not considered advisable to specify any
certain percentage of the purchase price that should be considered.
In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employee
in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance.

for the CITEMPO Project in a professional and efficient manner.
The relationships he has developed with persons of all-levels within
the Mexican Government and especially the Nexican Security Service
allow him to obtain information of great interest to WOFIRM which
might otherwise be unavailable. For example, via LITEMPO-12, Chief
of a special investigative unit, the Station receives carbon copies
of the reports prepared by the group. BENADUM also is able to ask
this group to conduct investigations or provide file checks on per-
sons of interest to the Station.

3. BENADUM was able to establish a system whereby persons
of interest to FOFIRM residing in PURUMEN may obtain Mexican entry
visas without the long delay usually required.
4. BENADUM writes well and has improved considerably in
providing information bo obtains from his contacts in written form.
Usually, the reports he submits need little editing in order to be
processed for dissemination.
5.
This Officer speaks fluent Spanish which enables him to
communicate with the persons with whom he meets in a free and easy
manner. This ability certainly has assisted BENADUM in establishing
the rapport and confidence so necessary in working with Latins,
especially those working for the host government.
6.
BENADUM presents no overriding handling problems for his
Station Case Officer. He is willing to work long hours, reports
promptly and does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.
Based upon the Regular Fitness Report system, this Officer could be
rated as STRONG. in judging his performance.
7. BENADUM is the only other Station Officer besides the COB
who has good and ready access to various personages within tho
Mexican Government. With the departure of Willard C. CURTIS, the
value of BENADUM to the Station should not be underestimated.
8. BENADUM was shown this evaluation in draft form.

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT : Jeremy K. BENADUM
-
Request for Retirement
1. I herewith request that the effective date of my
retirement be set as of 31 October 1970 instead of 30 June
1969.
2. This request is based primarily upon my desire to complete
ten years of service in the Agency as is required by law
in order to be eligible for Agency Retirement instead of
being retired under Civil Services Statutes.
3. Secondly, however, I believe that by remaining
in my present position until 31 October 1970 I can assure
a better turn-over of contacts I have with a great deal
less loss to the Agency.
4.
I should appreciate a reply as soon as possible,
since if my proposal is not accepted, I shall plan to accept
other employment on 1 July 1969.

·SUBJECT:
Retirement
7 April 1969
i
1. Reference is made to our conversations concerning
the possibility of your retirement from our service.
2.
I discussed this matter, along with all other per-
sonnel matters, while in Washington in March 1969; and the
authorities indicated that they would like your retirement
✓ to become effective on 30 June 1969.
3. For your information, a drive is on to have officers
over fifty years of age take advantage of the early retire-
ment program, in order to:
and
a. Allow younger officers to move into active
operational assignments;
b.
Reduce expenses, by getting rid of the higher
ranking (older) officers;
C. Put the early retirement program into effective
use and make it customary for fifty year old officers to
retiro.
4.
In order to carry out your retirement, I would appre-
ciate it if you would submit your letter confirming that you
are in accord with this plan to place you on retired status.
5. You should plan to dispose of the Government owned
vehicle on or near your retirement date.
is accomplished by obtaining at least three bids, which you
As you know, this
should report in writing, and then by selling to the highest
bidder. Also, any contract on rental of the office-apartment
you use which involves this offico should he ended.
6. I
I regret that you will be unable to take home leave at
Government expense; but regulations prohibit the payment of
home leave expenses for persons within two years of effective
retirement date.

future. The following points were discussed:
(a) The fact that the project was considered to be an
important and successful one.
(b) Writer was specifically asked if he had any plans
for an early retirement. Writer replied in the negative. The
visiting officer indicated complete satisfaction with writer's
desire to continue in the service, and noted that it would be
particularly important in view of the upcoming change of Mexican
administrations in December, 1970, and the necessity of keeping
the project functioning at its current level of effectiveness,
(c) When the visiting officer asked whether the writer
had ever visited Headquarters during his career with the service,
and found that he had not done so, the officer asked whether
writer could arrange to visit Headquarters for a week or ten days
during his next home leave, which would take place in August, 1969.
Writer indfooted that he would be most pleased to do 80.
2. Based on the foregoing, writer made plans to proceed to
the United States on home leave in early August, 1969, to return
in mid-September, 1969. Since such matters cannot be handled on
short notice, writer has already rented a house in San Francisco,
California for the period in question.
3. This is where matters stood, when, on 7 April, last,
writer was advised that he would be retired, effective 30 Juno;
1969, in accordance with various changes of polloy. He was also
asked to confirm in writing that he is in accord with the plan.
to place him on retired status as of 30 June, next.

!
4. While the reasoning behind what appears to be a complete
reversal of polloy, via-a-vis the writer, may be crystal clear to
the responsible officials at Headquarters, writer is at a complete
loss to understand.

For the writer to indicate his agreement with a plan which
appears to him to be arbitrary, short-sighted and irrational, would
bo completely out of character for a person who has spent almost
A thirty years in the intelligence field, and has a justifiable pride
in his status as a professional intelligence officer. As a
professional, writer also realizes when the handwriting, however
illegible, it might be, is on the wall, and, that if the decision
has already been made to retire him involuntarily, then retired he
will be --- involuntarily. Little as it may matter, writer desires
to emphasize that nothing in this memorandum should be construed
to indicate writer's personal accord or approval,
5. According to writer's records, as of 30 June, next,
he will have completed the following government service:

Writer desires to completo thirty years' service, and requests
that the effective date for his involuntary retirement be set
aooordingly.
6. Home Imave: While writer readily understands the
rationale of a ruling preventing the taking of home louve at
government expense within two years of voluntary retirement,
he does not see that the internets of fairness, justice cr
deoanay are being served in attempting to apply the same ruling
to sriter's involuntary retirement. As a matter of possiblo
historiaal interest, writer desires to point out that, when he

taken home leave in 1962, 1964 and 1966, in accordance with
regulations. In line with what appeared to be Agency policy as
of November, 1968, writer has made plans for home leave from
5 August to 15 September, 1969. Writer feels most strongly that
he and his family should be allowed to take this leave at
government expense.
7. Future of Project: Writer would be less than candid
if he did not point out that the present success of the project
is owing in large measure to contacts which writer has developed
over an eighteen year period. The precipitous forced retirement
of writer will preclude an orderly and intelligent period of
transition, with a concomitant loss of effectiveness. Even though
he is being retired, writer is still interested in preserving
the results of his work in México, which writer regards as being
of continuing importance to our country,
8. In conclusion, writer wishes to state that he has
thoroughly enjoyed his association with the Agency during the
past nine years, and is proud of his part in the accomplishments
of the México City Station. Owing to the nature of writer's
position, his personal contacts have been largely limited to
the personnel of the Station here. The writer has the highest
professional and personal regard for the Chief of Station, with
whom he has been privileged to serve, as well as the highly
competent case officers who have worked with writer on the project.
It is a source of great satisfaction and pride to tho
writer to have known and worked with a truly great American,
Mr. Allon W. Dulles, whom the "San Francisco Chronicle" (generally
a hostile critic of the Agency) described posthumously as
"... The most creative, powerful and eminent U.S. intelligence
officer of modern times". And, as one's career comes to a close,
the words of President Nixon, in describing Mr. Dulles' great
contribution to his country, have a very particular significance:
... In the nature of his task, his achievements were known to
only a fow. But, because of him, the world is a safer place today".

Clarification of Cover Income Status
of Carger Agent Jeremy K. BEMADUM
1. During the recent audit of Division, we noted
that, cince October 1961, Career Agent Jeremy K. BENADUM
has not submitted cover incone reports. These reports are
required every six months by BENADUM's contract.
Office
of Pinance personnel informed us that, since his payroll
file does not indicate that he is under a cover activity,
they do not expect these reports to be submitted and
therefore have not requested them. However, operational
files in W Division Mexico Branch indicate that BENADUM
Owls his cwn business in Mexico City, is a member of the
Board of Directors of another business, and spends a
portion of his duty hours on these businesses.
Therefore,
it appears that DEAN may be receiving cover income
which should be refund in accordance with his contract.

Clarification of Cover Income Status

1. During the recent audit of hit Division, we noted
that, since October 1961, Career Agent Jeremy K. MENADUM
has not submitted cover income reports. These reports are
required every six months by HENADUM's contract. Office
of Finance personnel informed us that, since his payroll
file does not indicate that he is under a cover activity,
they do not expect these reports to be submitted and there-
fore have not requested them. However, operational files
in WH Division Mexico Branch indicate that HENADUM owns
his own business in Mexico City, is a member of the Board
of Directors of another business, and spends a portion of
his duty hours on these businesses. Therefore, it appears
that BENAPUN may be receiving cover income which should be
refunded in accordance with hia contract. In addition, the
question arises as to whether BUNADUM's contract should
contain the provision (similar to Douglas J. FRAPANE's
contract) that he can retain only the first $2,000 a year
company profits as provided in FN 20-32.
2. It is requested that a review be made to determine
whether BENADUM should be refunding cover income and whether

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Jeremy K. REMADUM (p)
19 September 1966
Federal Tax obligation
-
Letter of Instruction
1. Haned on the tax briefing held on 16 February 1966 by a repre-
sentative of the Organization's Tax Committee, the Committee approved a
flat rate assessment of your covert Federal tax obligation. This assess-
ment has been developed in two stages: The first stage applies to tax
year 1965 and is based on your taxable compensation of $18,303.20. The
second stage relates to your future year tax position and is based on
an average of your armual Organizational income of $19,305.60 developed
from a two-year projection of your carnings, beginning with tax year 1966.
Under this procedure you will not be required to file a covert tax return,
beginning with tax year 1965.
2. Effective 20 December 1964, the beginning of tax year 1965, the
Organization has applied a tax percentage of thirty (30.0) per cent to
the gross taxable compensation paid by the Organization in 1965. Effec-
tive 19 December 1965, the beginning of tax year 1965, this perecntago
will be decreased to twenty-three and four-tenths (23.4) per cent.
3. The application of the percentage assesment to tax year 1955
results in a tax liability of 65,490.96 (30% or $18,303.20). After apply
ing the tax withheld of 82,562.49, an additional payment of $2,920.47
is required. However, future changes in your income or tax status may
Justify a future revision of the assessment rate. In this event, this
ngreument would be amended recordingly.
4. The Tax Committee has granted you a basic $250.00 tnx crodit
in computing the percentage rate. This credit is granted to give reason-
able assurance that you will not pay higher tax than you would under ordi-
nery reporting procedures. The computations of these purgentage rates
are attached.
5. The retroactive satisfaction of this assessment from 19 December
1965 will be made by atteching the Federal tax withholdings available
in your pay account. You will be advised as to the effect of this payroll
account adjustment. You must file a tax return directly with Internal
Hovému consistent with your overt tax status and provide the Tax Committee
with a certified true copy. It is extremely important for you to exercise
care and accuracy in preparing this return. Provided baloy are specific
criteria to assist yo!]:

You will contimas to file a tax return directly with Internal.

ROUGH DRAFT
DRAFT
Emp. J. Seidel
10 March 1971
1. Please advise Jeremy K. BENADUM that the appropriate
military authority has verified the following dates of active duty:
1 July 1937 through 14 July 1937
1 December 1939 through 30 June 1940
This service totals one and one-half months less than that claimed by
BENADUI.
2. Records verifying BENADUM's civilian service show that during
period 1 June 1942 through 28 February 1943 retirement deductions were
not withheld from salary. The amount of $307.00 will be required to
purchase credit for this period. If not paid, Subject's annuity will be
reduced by 10 per cent of the amount owed or $31.00 per year. If Subject
elects to make payment, his check should be made payable to the Treasurer
of the United States and forwarded to Headquarters sconest.
3. Annuity estimates recomputed to reflect change in creditable
military service and effect of payment or non-payment for uncovered
period of civilian service. If paid; annuity will be $1,196 per month.
If not paid, annuity reduced to $1, 194.
4. Advise Headquarters BENADUM's election on payment vs
non-payment option.

1.
The Station was surprised to receive the reference, which
stated that BEHADUM's life insurance application had not been received
in Finance Division as of 15 June 1962. Recently we received HBM-5-2450,
dated 14 June 1962, which requested that the Station collect from NENADUM
the premiums for his life Insurance, and no mention was muide of payroll
deductions we had requented in M-T-2800. Therefore, the Station col-
lected the sum of $72.00 from BENADUM in payment of 6 months premiums.
This payment was forwarded to Headquarters under HM-T-2892.

field allotment until notification is received from Headquarters.
would appear that the eacient means of now adjusting his pay account
would be to refund the pre-paid premiums and begin payroll deductions
for the life insurance.

some BKK Sargeant to sargeant or colonel to colonel whether the matter
could be expedited. He assured me he would give this an all-out try and
agreed to let me know during the forthcoming week.

1. BLN.
Since Jereny K. BEN has expressed a desire to retire in
U21
17
December 1970, he should complete and return to Headquarters the attached
application for Retirement form. He may have his annuity checks sent
directly to his bank for deposit the wishes. This should be arranged with
whatever bank is designated under Rem: 4 on the application, ille checking
account number should be recorded following the nane of the bank. items
B-1 through E-4 may be left blank to be filled in at Headquarters. Since
Subject's annuity will begin on the first day of the month following retire-
ment, it is considered advantageous to make his retirement effective as of
the last day of the month. In this way his annuity would commence the day
following his last day as an employee.
2. When ZENADUM retires, his regular Federal Employees Group
Life Insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment benefits) will
be continued at the same amount without further cost. The cost of the
optional à EGLI, which he is eligible to continus, will be deducted from bis
annuity until he reaches age 65. These insurances will retain face valuc
until BENADUM reaches age 65 at which time they will reduce at the rate
of 2 per cent per month until they reach 25 per cent of their face value. if
he wishes, Subject may elect at the time of retirement to convert to an
individual life insurance policy in order to retain lifetime coverage in an
amount equal to his present insurance, Me must pay the premium applica-
ble to the type of policy selected. A medical examination will not be
required under the conversion privilege.

1. After careful review at the Station and discussions with
Jeremy K. BENADUM, we have concluded that the most amicable and
efficient separation date for BENADUM would be 31 December 1970.
In our review of costs, we find the additional benefits to BENADUM
result primarily from his additional two months of service increasing
his retirement benefits.
2.
Based on this decision we plan on having him begin leave
on 14 August 1970 and are therefore submitting the following papers
as requested in reference.
a) Attached is the signed original copy of an amendment
contract which provides for his participation in the
Organization Retirement Program.
b) A memo prepared by BENADUM requesting approval for him
to retire 31 December 1970, and which is concurred in
by the Chief of Station.
-
c) A statement in lieu of a copy of his discharge papers.
As outlined in this statement, BENADUM indicates he never
received an official discharge.
d) A report of cover earnings for the period 1 May 1969
through 30 June 1970. BENADUM's statement indicates he
has received no income, either in dividends or salary,
from his cover company since 30 April 1969.
He plans
3. BENADUM has indicated his present plans call for him
residing in the U.S. for a period of six months each year.
to return to the States after 31 December 1970 and has queried the
Station regarding reimbursement for return travel to the U.S. for
himself and family. In future correspondence please indicate whether
return travel is authorized.

present plans call for his residing in the U.S. for a period
of six months each year; he plans to return to the U.S. after
31 December 1970 and bea asked the Station about reimbursement
for the travel for himself and his family.
Kef asked whether return travel is authorized.

abroad,
travel and trans;riation expenses from the last
post of assignment to the place where the employee will reside
in the U.S.,
FR 22-21 specifies the time limit within

The above does parait BENADUM to be relabursed for
travel of self and authorized dependents after his retirement
(31 Dec. 70) to the place in the U.S. where he will reside.

place in the U.h. where he will reside, the names of the
dependents who will travel withhim, mode of travel and, if
known, the itinerary.
Upon receipt of the above, lieadquarters will process

ALUATION OF STUR
E
On comparison to official Station cover, and for the type of work that Subject
has been engaged in, the cover is good. His cover is that of a retired former FBI
employee ("rentista" in Mexico). He is an investor in a Mexican business firm and
has properties in the United States which he manages from Mexico. Subject is also
Independently wealthy. Subject is known to be a CIA asset in high Mexican
Government circles.
EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE
The Station has consistently rated Subject's performance as "strong",
1
ADAPTABILITY (SUBJECT AND FAMILY) TOWARDS DUAL LIFE
Subject and his family have adapted completely to a dual life. Subject works
full-time for CIA and there is no conflict of interest with regard to his work for us.
(Subject has been employed in this same position for approximately ten years.)
Subject's wife has a full schedule of activities surrounding her family and community.
She is discreet and is not the type of woman who feels that she has to know and
approve of her husband's every move.
B. PREVIOUS COVER WAS:

N/A. Subject has had the same cover and position since originally hired
by the Agency. Prior to Agency employment, he was employed by the FBI in

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeremy K. BENADUM
During the past three months I have had the opportunity
to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUM.
Within a few months he will be retired from further service
and it is appropriate now to review his past performanco
and presont status in order that this remain a permanent
part of his record.
He was
BENADUM, during the past ten years, has performed as
the outside case officer for the LITEMPO Project,
pressed into service after resigning his position with
LNERGO, for whom he worked for a period of taenly years.
His primary value to the Station, at that time, was his
access to persons of all-levels within the Mszigan Covernment
and especially the Mexican Security Service. On further
investigation it became clear it was his close personal and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this
access across the board. Gradually over the years he
developed a similar relationship with LITE PO-12, LITEMPO-4
and others,
His past evaluations are still valid, however, during
the past three months he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacts and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liaison transition. He is currently
in touch with two liaison types officially but occasionally
sees others on a purely social basis.
Although his retirement is not voluntary, he has good-
naturedly assisted the Station in this very sensitive and
delicate changeover. He will remain in Mexico after his
retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. He
presents no overriding handling problem, reports promptly and
does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.

1. In accordance with the request made in Reference B, the
following is an up-dated Agent Evaluation on Jeremy K. BENADUM,
Career Agent and outside Case Officer for the LITEMPO Project.
evaluation should be considered in conjunction with Reference A,
which is still valid and more extensive.
This
2. BENADUM continues to perform as the Outside Case Officer
for the LITEMPO Project in a professional and efficient manner.
The relationships he has developed with persions of all-levels within
the Mexican Government and especially the Mexican Security Service
allow him to obtain information of great interest to WOFIRM which
might otherwise be unavailable. For example, via LITEMPO-12, Chief
of a special investigative unit, the Station receives carbon copies
of the reports prepared by the group. BENADUM also is able to ask
this group to conduct investigations or provido file checks on per-
sons of interest to the Station.

20 August 1962
Assessment of Career Agent, Jeremy K. BENADUM
Pseudonym and salary: Jeremy K. BENADUM, CS-15, $14,055.
Division or Staff and city: WH Division, Mexico City.
Operational duties: Subject maintains unofficial liaison
between the Station and a Mexican Ministry. He also develops
independent agents.
4. Cover: Subject has Inmigrante-Rentista status which allows
him to remain in Mexico indefinitely and the only restriction on
his activity is that he cannot be gainfully employed. In view of
the fact he is a wealthy man in his own right and will soon be of
age to collect retirement from his long service with the FBI, this
cover presents no problems, After five years in this status he will
obtain inmigrado status which will give him complete freedom of
operation, with all the rights as a Mexican citizen, except that
of voting. The cover is excellent because it is secure, allows him
complete mobility, and require no administrative support. There are
no existing or anticipated problems related thereto.
-
5.
Division's assessment: Subject is an experienced, well-
trained, serious intelligence officer, capable of spotting, assess-
ing, recruiting and handling agents. Most of his experience and
capability is in the field of collection of FI intelligence and
operational support, the latter being his most outstanding area of
contribution to Station objectives, He would also be capable of
running CI operations. His knowledge of CA type work, however,
cannot be assessed at Headquarters.
Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties.
Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,
he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence
operations and is well qualified to operate without strong Station
support.
Headquarters is not in a position to comment on the timeli-
ness or quality of his operational reporting, but no defects in this
regard have been noted nor have any been brought to the attention
of Headquarters by the Station.
Subject needs no training.

Reference: Mexico City 3340
1. Reference indicated Jeremy K.-BENADUM had proposed an
extension of his retirement from 31 October to an appropriate date in
December 1970 in order for him to use his annual leave in lieu of lump
sum payment.
2. Shortly before the COS left Headquarters for Mexico, a meeting
was held during which the Branch Chief discussed contract personnel of
the Station.
Ref was discussed and it was the COS's desire for there to
be an amicable separation at the time of BENADUM's retirement. If,
therefore, the extra two months would accomplish this, then the added
costs would be worthwhile.
3. The following annuity figures have been provided by the Retire-
ment Office and are predicated on a retirement date of 31 December 1970.
Please keep in mind, the figures must be considered as estimates and
subject to verification of service and final computations. Retirement
would be under the Organization Program.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeromy K. BENADUM
During the past three months I have had the opportunity
to work with and direct the activitios of Jeremy K. BENADUM.
Within a few months he will be retired from further service
and it is appropriate now to review his past performance
and present status in order that this remain a permanent
part of his record.
BENADUM, during the past ten years, has performed as
the outside cass officer for the LITEMPO Project. He was
pressed into service after rosigning his position with
LNERGO, for whom he worked for a period of twenty years.
His primary value to the Station, at that time, was his
access to persons of all-levels within the Mexican Government
and especially the Mexican Security Service. On further
investigation it became clear it was his close personal and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this
access across the board. Gradually over the years ho
developed a similar relationship with LITEMPO-12, LITEMPO-4
and others.
His past evaluations are still valid, however, during
the past three mon the he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacta and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liaison transition. He is currently
in touch with two liaison types officially but occasionally
sees others on a purely social basis.
Although his retirement is not voluntary, he has good-
naturedly assisted the Station in this very sensitive and
delicate changeoveT. He will remain in Mexico after his
retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. Ho
presente no overriding handling problem, reports promptly and
does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings.
