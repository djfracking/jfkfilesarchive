contacted a Pvt Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police Ident-
ification section, and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt.
Alford spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members
prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of
Pvt Alford, and with the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert
Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print
cards from the FBI were turned over
turned over to Pvt Alford which he
receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee spaces
to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week
of July 2, 1978. Pvt Alford was able to obtain the fingerprints
of Regis Blahut, an employee of the CentralIntelligence Agency.
On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford
phoned William H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made
a tentative identification of Blahuts prints on the inside of
the safe door, and on one of the photos in Book Five, Part One

lifted prints. These were returned to safe #345471 in Room 3381.
Pvt Alford stated he had identified a certain number of points
in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis
Blahut. These prints were matched with those on the inside of
the safe door, and on the back of photo 39E2 which had been
ripped from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos,
and the photo which had been removed from the cellophane cover.
After returning all materials Pvt Alford departed Committee Spaces

Summary of Contact:
On two occasions on this date Gary Cornwell and I spoke
with Regis Blahut of the CIA. We first spoke to him at
approximately 11AM in Gary Cornwell's office. We spoke
with him a second time at approximately 2PM at which
time we recorded his statement pertaining to a breach
of security at the HSCA. The recorded statement fully
covers the substance of the first conversation with
two exceptions:
1) In the first conversation Regis originally told us that
he looked through an autopsy photo book after receiving
permission to do so. Later, during that same conversation,
when asked from whom he received permission to look
through the autopsy photo book he denied having said he
received permission to look through the book and stated
that he at no time received permission to look through
the autopsy photo book. Both Gary and I distinctly recall
him telling us at the outset of the conversation that he
looked through the book only after receving permission
do so.
2) In the first conversation Regis told us that he was
alone in the security room when he saw the book on the
window sill and decided to look through it. However,
when asked during the taped recorded conversation whether
he was alone when he looked through the autopsy book he
then stated that there were people present in the room
when he looked through the autopsy book but that he cannot recall

both Gary and I clearly recall him telling us when we first
spoke with him that no one was present when he looked through
the photo book.

About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the
books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was
and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39E1 and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing

Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978

both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,
but shut.

Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the
Metropolitan Police Identification section responded to Room
3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Pvt.
Pat McGinnis, Sgt Blake and Detective
Pvt McGinnis was
able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior
of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross
or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times
during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned
over
to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession
The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.
On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by
Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #345471
in Room 3381 of Committee Office.
On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to

time he did not observe any of the photos to be out of
the plastic sheeting which ordinarily held them in the
black binder. Mr. Blahut denied however that he opened the
safe at any time other than when he put the book inside.
2) He stated to us that the first time he had looked
through the book --the time when Jim Conzelman took it
out of the safe-- he slid one of the photos partly out
of the plastic to look at it. To the best of his
recollection this photo was either a photo of the breain
or a photo of the bust of Kennedy. He stated this was the
only time that he had observed any of the photos to be
out of their plastic sheeting.

Summary of Contact:
•
On this date Gary Cornwell and myself, spoke with Regis
Blahut in Gary's office. Mr. Blahut stated the following:
1) He lied to us in our conversation of July 13 when he
stated that on the second occasion he looked through the
black looselead binder, he put it back on the window sill
after reading it. He told us that the truth was that while
he was looking through the book it dropped on the floor. He.
stated that when it dropped on the floor some of the pages
came out of the book. He became frightened that someone
would enter the room at this time so he opened the black
safe which contained the autopsy books and placed the black
looseleaf binder and the pages which had fallen out, into the
top part of the safe. Prior to him opening it to put in the
book, the safe door had been completely closed (i.e. not
ajar),
Radommen though it was not locked. He said he opened it by
pressing down on the handle and pulling the door open. He
stated that he did not recall whether the top part of the safe

by the fact that Blahut had opened the Committee's
safe in which the photos were stored, and on the
first two interviews with the Committee, he lied
about having done so;
3. There is only one possible innocent motive for
Blahut's handling and viewing of the autopsy photos,
that being personal curiosity, and the evidence
unequivocally shows that personal curiosity was not
the motive (a page was ripped out, a photo was re-
moved from the plastic sheeting, the log shows that
the photo book in question had not been removed from
the safe by the Committee staff since September, 1977,
and Blahut's story about his handling of, and access
to that photo book on June 23, 1978 is patently un-
believable); and most significantly,

Prior to at least two of the three occasions
on which Blahut was interviewed by the Committee
staff, he spoke to his superiors at the Agency, and
after each of those conversations he told lies to
the Committee about his involvement.
Turner said that he had already looked into the matter,
and handed us a report which had been written. Turner sug-
gested that Blakey and Cornwell go read the report (not take
a copy with them from the building), and also look at Blahut's

Bob Blakey and I met with DCI Turner, DDCI Carlucci and
Fred Hitz of the Office of Legislative Counsel at 8:00 A.M.
in Turner's office. Blakey initially noted that he had come
at Chairman Stokes' request to discuss with Turner a recent
security violation which had been discovered by the Committee.

has acquired and possessed them, the security precautions
(separate safe, limited access, and log record) utilized to
safeguard them, and the possible motives that might exist for
someone unlawfully removing them from the Committee.

photos had been tampered with, and the investigation which
the staff thereafter conducted, including the identification
of all of those persons who had access to the security space
where they were located, the fingerprinting process and
results and ultimately the questioning of Regis Blahut,
the CIA employee who was in the security space on that date.
Finally, Blakey recalled to Turner his (Turner's)
statement made to Blakey and Cornwell on February 4, 1978
to the effect that if the Committee found any impropriety
or wrongdoing on the part of any CIA employee, he would
personally look into and get to the bottom of it. Blakey
stated that the Chairman had been told of Turner's comment
on February 4, 1978, and now requested that Turner conduct
a further investigation of the Blahut matter. Blakey stated
that the Committee felt such an investigation was necessary
for the following reasons:
1.
The Committee had spoken to Blahut on three
occasions (July 11, 13 and 14) about his knowledge
of the tampering with the autopsy photos, on two
of which, by Blahut's own subsequent admissions,
he had lied about significant details, and on
the last of which, by independent evidence, Blahut
had also lied;
2.
Blahut's actions were deliberate, as evidenced

personnel file, and then let the Agency know what else he
(Blakey) suggested they should do.
Upon inspection, the report reflected the following:
(a.) The Agency interviewed Blahut on Friday evening,
July 14, and polygraphed him three times for roughly
two hours each time on Saturday, July 15;
(b.) Blahut's supervisors had been spoken to, and
denied any involvement;
(c.) Blahut admitted lying to the Committee;
(d.) Blahut basically told the same story to the
polygraph expert (Felippo) he had finally told the
Committee on the morning of July 14, except that
on July 15 he admitted that he was never given
permission by any Committee staff member to view
the Kennedy autopsy pictures;
(e.) Blahut persisted in his story (but lied in
doing so, according to the polygraph) that he had
opened the Committee safe only once, and that was
to put a photo book into the safe, and also (again,
untruthfully) stated that he had only viewed the
autopsy books on two occasions.
(f.) Blahut has been assigned to a CIA operation
code named MHCHILD since April, 1977.

before it was even conducted.
Both Blakey and I
stated that what we could now state was that we had come
to the Agency with the suggestion that they investigate it,
because we felt that from among the alternatives now available
to the Committee, that alternative was the one with the
best chance of success.
Finally Blakey also noted that
his hope was that after the Agency's investigation was
complete, copies of the reports could be placed in the
Agency's and the Committee's files, and that would be the
end of it.
The meeting was terminated with the general understanding
that Blakey's suggestions would be followed, and the Agency
would let us know when they had their reports complete.

About 4:05 P.M. June 23, 1978 Mark Flanagan upon returning
some autopsy material to the Security room along with Lance Svendson
of Security staff upon opening safe #102095 noted that several autopsy

One photo 39E2 was out of the cellophane enclosure and laying loose.
A quick check showed that these photos were from Book Five, Part One.
An immediate check of all books was begun by Flanagan and Svendsen
to ascertain if any other photos might be missing. No other photos
were found to be missing or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had
not been signed out recently according to the check out log.
Both Mark Flanagan and Lance Svendsen stated they would have noticed

On June 27, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to the FBI for

Moriarty had contacted a Pvt. Colon Alford of the Metropolitan Police
Department ID section and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978 Pvt Alford
spent one hour in Committee office, checking staff members prints

had reviewed the investigative report provided by Turner.
Blakey requested that he be permitted to see Blahut's security
file. Gambino refused, but offered the personnel file instead.
The personnel file reflected that Blahut had consistently
(he was thought bright & nature
received excellent ratings from his superiors, that he showed
leadership qualities in his work, and that he had been com-
mended for consistently reporting to his superiors what he
had observed and done during his assignments, and alerting
them to any problems he encountered.*
Finally, Smith and Gambino asked Blakey what he felt the
Agency should do now. Blakey said that full interviews of all
of Blahut's supervisors should be conducted, and written
reports made. In addition, Blakey stated that new polygraphs
should be taken, focusing primarily on the area that was es-
·sentially omitted on July 15, namely, the question of motive.
Hav Smith asked whether the Committee was going to accept
the Agency's investigation after it was completed; he said
he wanted to know now, that he wanted a commitment. Smith
said that he was 99 percent sure that the final report would
show no involvement in the tampering on the part of the Agency.
Gambino said, "We know we're clean." In reply, I asked how
the Agency could be so sure at this early point that none of
their employees except Blahut were involved, and I also com-
mented that Smith was asking the Committee to "buy a pig in
a poke" in suggesting that we should tell him now whether or
not we would be satisfied with the Agency's investigation

staff members print cards from the FBI were turned over to Pvt.
Alford which he receipted for so he could take them away from
Committee spaces so he could spent more time studying them. During
the week of July 2, 1978 Pvt. Alford was able to obtain the
fingerprint card of Regis Blahut (a Former D.C. Fireman) On Friday
July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M. Pvt Alford contacted William
Cross of Security staff and stated he had made a tentative identifi-
cation of Blahuts prints on the safe door and one of the photos in
Book Five; Part One of the Kennedy Autposy photos. On Monday July
10, 1978 at 2:30 PM Pvt Alford responded to the Committee offices
and in the presence of G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison and
William H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, The 13 cards
of lifted prints, and stated he had identified a certain number of

RE:
Chief Counsel and Director
House Select Committee on Assassinations
Robert Morrison, Director of Security
William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security
The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.
.
About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #102095
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the
books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39E1 and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophan
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was ..
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out
since September of 1977 according to the check out log.
Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978
if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They
both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,
but shut.
✓✓ Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the
section responded to Room
5301 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints.

☐☐ was
able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior
of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross
or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times
during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned
over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession
The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.
On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by
1 Pvt McGinnis were turned over to Director of Security Robert
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #45471
in Room 3381 of Committee Office.
On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to
the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.
NW 88326 Docld:32269709 Page 134

--- Image 180-10125-10172_page_135.jpeg ---
The first request for cards was filled, and received the latter
part of the week of June 25, 1978. The second request was filled
and received on July 5, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty had
contacted a
of the ☐
section, and requested he try to make comparisons of
known and latent prints. During the week of June 26, 1978
.
spent one hour in Committee spaces checking staff members
prints against those lifted. On July 5, 1978 at the request of
(and with the consent of Chief Counsel G. Robert
Blakey the 13 cards of lifted prints and all staff member print
cards from the FBI were turned over to
which he
receipted for, so he could take them away from Committee spaces
to enable him to spend more time studying them. During the week
of July 2, 1978.
was able to obtain the fingerprints
of Regis Blahut, an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency.
On Friday July 7, 1978 at approximately 2:30 P.M.
phoned: William H. Cross of Security Staff and stated he had made
a tentative identification of Blahuts prints on the inside of
the safe door, and on one of the photos in Book Five, Part One
of the Kennedy Autopsy photos. On Monday July 10, 1978 at 2;30 P.M
responded to the Committee offices and in the presence
of Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey, Robert Morrison, and William
H. Cross returned all fingerprint cards, and the 13 cards of
lifted prints. These were returned to safe #45471 in Room 3381.
| stated he had identified a certain number of points
in several prints, and in his opinion they were those of Regis
Blahut. These prints were matched with those on the inside of
the safe door, and on the back of photo 39E2 which had been
ripped from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy Autopsy photos,
and the photo which had been removed from the cellophane cover.
After returning all materials

Mr. G. Robert Blakey
July 14, 1978
The two latent fingerprints, which are
present on one lift on the card bearing the notation
"B - from inside outer edge of safe door," and the
inked fingerprints appearing in the two photographs
designated B and C in the Latent Fingerprint
Section were made by one and the same individual.
The remaining latent fingerprint is not
identical with the inked fingerprints appearing in
the five submitted photographs.
The specimens are being retained in the
Latent Fingerprint Section until called for by a
representative of your office.

PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION
To obtain classifiable fingerprints:
1. Use printer's ink.
2. Distribute ink evenly on inking slab.
3. Wash and dry fingers thoroughly.
4. Roll fingers from nail to nail, and avoid allowing fingers to slip.
5. Be sure impressions are recorded in correct order.
6. If an amputation or deformity makes it impossible to print a finger, make a notation to that effect in the individual finger
block.
7. If some physical condition makes it impossible to obtain perfect impressions, submit the best that can be obtained with a
memo stapled to the card explaining the circumstances.
8. Examine the completed prints to see if they can be classified, bearing in mind the following:
Most fingerprints fall into the patterns shown below (other patterns occur infrequently and are not shown here):

. G. Robert Blakey
July 10, 1978
FROM:
RE:
Chief Counsel and Director
House Select Committee on Assassinations
Robert Morrison, Director of Security
William H. Cross, Assistant Director of Security
The tampering with Kennedy Autopsy photos located
in Safe #23102095 in the Reading Room of Room 3381
of the Committee Offices.
About 4:05 P.M. Friday June 23, 1978, Mark Flanagan upon
returning some autopsy material to the Security Room along with
Lance Svendsen of the Security Staff upon opening safe #23102095
noted that several Kennedy autopsy photos were loose on top of
the Kennedy Autopsy photo books. The photos removed from the
books were numbered 39E1, 39E2, 40E and 41E. This was two pages
consisting of 4 photos. 39E1 and 39E2 along with the cellophane
cover had been ripped from the book, and the cellophane enclosure
was torn at binder holes. One photo, 39E2 was out of the cellophane
enclosure and lying loose. A quick check by Flanagan and Svendsen
revealed the photos were from Book Five, Part One of the Kennedy
Autopsy photos. An immediate check of all the photo books was
begun to ascertain if any other photos were missing. This check
by Flanagan and Svendsen showed no other photos to be missing
or tampered with. Book Five, Part One had not been signed out
since September of 1977 according to the check out log..
Both Flanagan and Svendsen stated they would have noticed the
photos when the safe was opened at 10 A.M. Friday June 23, 1978
if they had been lying where they were when discovered. They
both feel there was no way this could have been done accidently.
Someone had to enter the safe, and do this. The safe was unlocked,
but shut.
:
Approximately 5 P.M. Friday, June 23, 1978 at the request
of Committee Investigator John Moriarty, three members of the
Metropolitan Police Identification section responded to Room
3381 for the purpose of attempting to get latent prints. Pvt.
Pat McGinnis, Sgt Blake and Detective
Pvt McGinnis was
able to lift 13 separate cards of latent prints from the interior
of the safe, and from the Kennedy Autopsy photo book that was
tampered with. These men left at approximately 8:35 PM Friday
June 23, 1978. Investigator John Moriarty, William H. Cross
or Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey were present at all times
during the lifting of the prints. The lifted prints were turned
over to Investigator John Moriarty, and remained in his possession.
The persons who were in this office alone on Friday June
23, 1978 were Edwin Lopez, Dan Hardway and Mitch Mars of the
Committee Staff, and Regis Blahut of the CIA.
On Monday June 26, 1978 the 13 cards of prints lifted by
Pvt McGinnis were turned over
turned over to Director of Security Robert
Morrison by Investigator John Moriarty and locked in safe #2345471
in Room 3381 of Committee Office.
On June 27, 1978, and June 29, 1978 requests were made to
the FBI for certain Committee Staff member fingerprint cards.
