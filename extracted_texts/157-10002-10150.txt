Mr. Wallach.
I have just given Mr. Osborn a copy of
a memorandum dated December 24, 1974, which is in fact after
the time he left on sick leave; and there is no reason to
believe that he was seen it. I would just like him to re-
view it and possibly refresh his recollection.

I think I misspoke when I gave Mr. Osborn a memo. It
is a three-page undated memo captioned "Project West Pointer."
I believe it was recently prepared.

to the last paragraph on the third page which states:
"The main difference between SRPOINTER and West Pointer
is that the file shows specific reference to a statement by
the Postal authorities that mail not to go out of Post Office
control. While mail was opened and photographed by Agency
personnel in New York City under SRPOINTER and not specific
post office approval was given, neither is there written order
not to do so. In West Pointer the opening of mail was
contrary to specific orders that mail was not to out of post
office control."

operations that terminated in the mid-sixties that involved
interceptions of propaganda from other countries to the US?
Mr. Osborn. I seem to have heard of this, but I can't
recall it specifically.
It sounds familiar to me.
Mr. Dick. Do you recall whether in any of those Customs
programs the CIA might have received mail from Customs, access
to the mail? +
Mr. Osborn. Not specifically. And I can clarify one
thing for you now. On this Dulles thing, I am sorry. It was
not diplomatic pouches; It was film to and from the Soviet
Union that we used to take and bring back and reproduce and
þút back, and specifically Duties. And I seem to recall also
in the same context of my discussion with you if you ask
me specifically if I knew, I would say no, but I seem to
recall that they did cooperate with us in the matter of
diplomatic pouches. I can't remember a specific instance,
but I recall this.
Mr. Dick. Is that the extent of your recollection?
Mr. Osborn. Yes, really. But this propaganda thing
rings a loud bell in my mind.
Mr. Wallach. Aside from the mail opening projects which
have publically come to light in recent months

and I will
go through them very briefly now there were the San

opened in New York in 1971?
Mr. Osborn. Of course he did.
Mr. Wallach. Did you know why Mr. Helms would have asked
the President for authority to open mail in 1971, then?
Mr. Osborn. I have no idea.
Mr. Wallach. Calling your attention to a memorandum dated
February 16, 1973, captioned "Visit to Headquarters re SR-
POINTER I will ask you to quickly read that over.

Mr. Wallach. The first question would be, do you recall
a meeting in your office at which you notified Mr. Issaeff
that the project would be terminated?
Mr. Osborn. I don't think I dealt with Issaeff. I think
I would have dealt with one of my people. But it could have
been Issaeff. I don't know. I remember suspending it.
Mr. Wallach. And do you remember telling Mr. Issaeff in
words or substance that he should not tell anyone on the CI
Staff that you wanted to tell the Director of the CIA Staff
yourself?
Mr. Osborn. I very probably would have. I had very close
relationships with Jim Angleton professionally.

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Osborn, if you would, just very briefly,
on the subject matter that I am going to be directing your
attention to, the mail programs, the various mail programs that
you may have had knowledge of while you were with the CIA, I
would like to have you very briefly trace your career for us
in briefest terms with the Agency.
Mr. Osborn. All right.
I jointed the Agency on 10 October 1974.
I worked in what was then known as the Office of Collection
and Dissemination, which concerned itself largely with the
collection of any information that had any foreign intelligence
import from other Government departments and agencies such as
the Department of Commerce, the Department of Interior, the
Department of the Treasury, and so forth. It was essentially
a liaison job.
I served there about a year and a half, and I then jointed
the Contact Division of the Office of Operations, which was
concerned with the selection of foreign intelligence information
from American businessmen and private organizations who had
business abroad.
I served there until roughly 1950, when I jointed the
Office of Special Operations, and was an fomed to create a hon-

Mr. Wallach. Calling your attention to the first page,

Mr. Osborn. Yes.
Mr. Wallach. I realize that most of it is illegible but
I ask if you can read the line that begins with Osborn.
Mr. Osborn. "Osborn said he was under instructions from
Colby to the effect that no pressure should be put on Cotter."
Mr. Wallach. Do you recall discussing that with Mr.

could put on Cotter.
Mr. Wallach. I believe you briefly touched on this before.
How was the operation actually terminated?
Mr. Osborn. I called in Stan Ense, I believe, who was
then Deputy Director of Security for Investigations and
Operational Support, and I said SR POINTER is terminated as
of now. I think it was in the early afternoon. And that was
the end of it.
Mr. Wallach. In other words, it was then Mr. Colby under
Schlesinger who terminated it?

things, of course, that we reported to Director Schlesinger,
I don't believe we reported this in any detail as to how it
started, because I am not really sure that any of us knew.
I don't recall exactly how it did start. But it was alsways

Mr. Wallach. Going back just a step, I take it that you n
had no knowledge of any mail opening projects while you were
with the Inspector General's Office in 1954?
Mr. Osborn. To the best of my recollection, I don't
believe I was briefed on what was then HT LINGUAL, and which!
subsequently became SR POINTER.
Mr. Wallach. I think those just may have been different
names for the same operation, different divisions.
Mr. Osborn. I think they were, yes, different code names.
They changed them frequently.
Mr. Wallach.
While you were in Berlin -- you said you

which time I was briefed on this particular operation.
Mr. Wallach. Did you know whether or not the Postmaster
General, the then Postmaster General, I am not sure who it
was in 1964, July, whoever it was in that position, had
knowledge of the fact that mail was opened in New York City?
Mr. Osborn. To the best of my recollection, I never heard
that he was.
Mr. Wallach. Had you ever heard either way about the
Attorney General, be it Robert Kennedy or any of his
predecessors?
Mr. Osborn. Not to the best of my recollection.
Mr. Wallach. When you visited New York on this inspection
trip that you described being possibly with Mr. White, do you
Favorini
recall whether or not Mr. Fabrini accompanied you out to the
facility?
Mr. Osborn. I can't recall specifically, but I am sure
that he did.
Mr. Wallach. Did you actually go out to Idlewild, or #
to Kennedy if it was changed?
Mr. Osborn. They had changed it. It was then an adjunct
of the physical installation of the New York Field office
the office of Security, it was only changed to Idlewild ör
Kemmedy during the last three or four years of my tenure as
Director of Security. Prior to that it was right in the

And it may have been diplomatic?
I am not sure that it was, but we did have some

Mr. Osborn. The one I specifically remember was at Dulles
And I am pretty sure it was diplomatic pouches. But I can't
recall the details, I really can't. But I have a recollection
of this. Ang again, we were doing it just as a mechanism
again. It was the Clendestine Services that had to be calling
the shot of that.
Mr. Wallach. I am just asking for the extent of your
knowledge.
Mr. Osborn. And if we did it at Dulles we must have done
it some other places.
Mr. Wallach. What cooperative arrangement with Customs. n
areyou aware of?

Mr. Wallach.
Could you go into that?
Mr. Osborn. I can't recall the details, but I can recall
that we used to bring in highly sinsitive people through
Customs without Customs services.
Mr. Wallach. I am really just asking, not for techniques
or narcotics or training or things like that we are aware of,
but really with respect to Customs providing certain mail
Customs providing mail that the Postal Service could not
provide in certain situations.
Mr. Osborn. I have a recollection that they did cooperate
with us in this respect. And I am sorry that I can't be more
clear on the details.
Mr. Wallach. Was there a particular point of contact in
"Customs?

Mr. Osborn. Yes.
