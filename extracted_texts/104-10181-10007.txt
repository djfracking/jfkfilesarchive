Today we interviewed Aida Rosa CORREA and her
son, who at all times has maintained a positive
attitude toward this Embassy concerning her
return. We have let her know that given the
circumstances of her presence in Spain
not as
-
a 'gusano but as the wife of a foreign doctor
who has worked in our country - we saw no
difficulty to prevent her from returning, especially
taking into account the fact that she expressed
herself as a revolutionary, but that first we
had to receive official permission.
"In our opinion, because the situation in
which she finds herself in Spain because of
marriage to a foremmer, her return can be
authorized, based on what has expired."

in contact with subject of 301-
1 QUTIMID periodically has reported contact between
Subject and Guillermo RUIZ Perez, the Cuban Minister
in Madrid, mostly over the telephone but also indicating
that he has seen her personally. It would appear that he
has taken unusually strong interest in her consibring the
· number of other more demanding tasks he claims to have.
Until now, we have not been able to identify either Subject
or her relationship with RUIZ.
2.
On 28 May QUDOZE (a sensitive joint audio penetration
with liaison) reported the following memorandum (presumably
to Havana) on Subject as dictated by RUIZ:
"Sr. RUIZ Ojeda, Some months ago we received
a ciphered cable dealing with Aida Rosa CORREA Felipe
asking that we contact her to determine her situation.
At that time we informed you that said Aida Rosa CORREA,
married to Pedro E CHE VARRIA Portuguese
citizen who was in Cuba during 1959-1968, intended
to return to our country, abandoning her husband
because of his alcoholism.
"Approximately one week ago the brother of
Aida Rosa CORREA Luis CORREA

passed through Madrid en route to France on a
special mission. He spoke with her at the Airport
about definitely returning in order to see that
her 12-year-old son might be educated In Cuba.,

in the U.S., he reported his address as 4000 NW Fourth.
Street, Miami, Florida, telephone number 445-7193, home
of a lady named Mercedes BORGES Dobarros. Manuel also
stated that he would later leave for 433 West 49th
Street, New York, N.Y., home of Antonio GOMEZ Lemus.
Manuel told I-122 that he and his friend, Jorga BORGES
Dobarros, were homosexuals and had been living together
since approximately 1963. (Jorge BORGES Dobarros ar-
rived in Miami aboard the same Refugee Airlift flight
as Manual. He is a brother of Mercedes BORGES Dobarros,
and he and Manuel went to live in Mercedes' house when
they arrived in Miami)..
.
We believe that Manuel cannot be used in an approach
to Subject because they have not maintained relations
for a long period of years. In addition, Subject might
know Manuel! taakness (homosexualism) and might take
advantage of this knowledge to blackmail Manuel.
nuel also told I-122 that he had received psychiatric
treatment in Havana.
Ma-
Subject's present position; the positions, all of them
important, which he has held before; and the fact that
he has been reported as a DGI officer, lead us to be-
lieve that we do not have many possibilities of success
in an attempt to recruit or defect Subject. The fact
that Subject's father has been a militant Communist
since prior to 1959 and that Subject's wife has been
reported as a supporter of the regime should not be
forgotten.
Subject's revolutionary background during the struggle
against BATISTA seems to indicate that he is in favor
of acts of terrorism. This gave him knowledge and ex-
perience in matters related to subversive activities
and/or intelligence activities which he could use later.
Therefore, we believe that Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pe-
rez must be a very useful person for the Cuban regime,
in Spain. He has experience in negotiating trade agree-
ments and in handling administrative affairs (he has
been working in this field for more than ten years).
All this knowledge and experience added to his know-
ledge and experience in subversive and intelligence
affairs make him a man who is not often found in the
Castro regime.

Political affiliations and attitude,
It has been reported that sub-
ject is a member of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) and
a staunch sympathizer of the Cuban regime. There is in-
formation to the effect that in 1958, Subject was in exile
in Mexico and was a member of the Triple A Organization
led by Dr. Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango. It has also been re-
ported that during the struggle against BATISTA (1957-
1958), Subject belonged to action and sabotage groups in
Havana and was charged with placing bombs and other devi-
ces. Source does not know exactly what activities Subject
carried out as a member of action and sabotage groups, but
believes that he had to leave for Mexico in 1958 on ac-
count of his activities.
Intelligence connections: RUIZ has been reported as a member of the
General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI). It has been
reported that in 1961 and 1962 he was a G-2 (DSE) member
at the Ministry of Treasury, where he worked.
Travelst He traveled to Mexico (from mid-1963 until mid-1964, he
was Cuban Commercial Counsellor in Mexico). Spain, where
he has been since late 1967 as Cuban Charge d' affaires.
(It was reported that on 27 July 1968, he arrived in Paris,
from Madrid. We do not know the reasons for that trip).
Access:
a.
b.
Rolando CARDOSO Perez (A18. 239 674). Arrived in the
U.S. on 10 October 1968 from Madrid, Spain. He knows
Subject because he and Subject are cousins (Subject's
mother and Rolando's mother are sisters). When Rolan-
do arrived in the U.S., he said he was going to re-
side at 940 SW 11th Avenue, Miami, Florida, telephone
number 377-3877. We have not been able to locate him
because we were told at this address that Rolando had
left for another state and that his present address
was unknown to them). Rolando saw Subject for the last
time at the Barajas Airport, Madrid, Spain, on 10 Oc-
tober 1968, when Rolando was going to take the plane
which brought him to the U.S. According to Rolando,
they greeted each other on that occasion. Rolando
said he had seen Subject at this same airport in early.
or mid-1968 and that they had talked for approximately
five minutes. On this opportunity, Subject was at the
airport waiting for the arrival of a group of Cuban
diplomats.
Manuel Domingo German VIGOS Perez (A18 780 716). Ax-
rived in the U.S. on 20 February 1970 by way of the
Refugee Airlift. He knows Subject because he and Sub-
ject are cousins (Subject's mother and Manuel's mother
are sisters). Manuel saw Subject for the last time
in 1963, at the home of Subject's mother, where they
happened to meet. According to Manuel, he and Subject
only said hello to each other.

EXROFILM
1. Forwarded herewith is a contact report from PACHANKIS on his follow-up
interview of Alexander SAMKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO's contact with
AMAUTO/1 (201-735296) in Madrid. As can be seen from the report, Madrid Station's
defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently took effect and he has been cautious in
avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to
Madrid.
2. The question of his writing to MMAUD/I was mentioned by SAMKO.
He was
told that AMAUTO/1 was back in Cuba and we did not know when he would return to
Madrid, if ever. 13/Miami believes we should wait until AMAUTO/1 returns to
Madrid, or some other post in the Free World, and then have SAMO write to him.
3.
Despite SAMKO's newly self-discovered James Bond talents PACHANKIS
enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our prizary objective, contact with
AMAUTU/1 for a face to face assessment, has been met.

On the morning of 28 July, I called Sam to check in with him.
after being away on TOY for almost 6 weeks. He sounded a bit
upset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed
out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set
him at ease.
It was plain to see that the trip had changed him. He is now
a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Bond. He told
me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in Madrid "by
7 or 8 Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long
"8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid." Castro agents were also
"watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short
layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home.
At no
time, however, was he molested by these "agents."
The Castro surveillance continued -so Sam says- in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," c. 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house
"after it got dark. " When Sam got into his car and went to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volkswagen,
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in
the neighborhood and back to his home. He could not make out
the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has never
seen this car again.
The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall,
thin man,"
(described as about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs; black
hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacks and
white shirt, another time wearing a suit). This individual showed
up across the street from his home "just as the sun had gone down,
several evenings during the first week that I got home." (c. 14-18
June)
The man just walked past the front back and forth a few times
and appeared to have his car around the corner of Sam's house. He
could not identify the car or anything else about the man.
'
Again, during the first week after his return Sam received several
telephone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked
up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." Sam
has not experienced any other suspicious incidents after the first
week home from Spain. I should note that Sam does not, talk of
these incidents with fear, but rather in the vein of a paperback
detective story..
Yet,
Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somewhat in Madrid as
a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel,
ate as well as drank. well, saw the sites and even went to a night
club, all on the house. He went so far as to say that if he had
"known it was going to be like this, I never would have gone."
in the same breath, he told "William" that he would be back in
Spain in September. Of course Sam would go again if we asked him,

On the evening of 30 May SAMKO and SACODER dined
at an out-door restaurant. We spent another three hours
rehearsing his cover story, reviewing the objectives and
trying to anticipate questions AMAUTO-1 might ask during
their meeting together. SAMKO was given the following objectives:
a. The foremost objective was for SAMкO
o renew and improve upon his relationship with
AMAUTO-1, to the extent that they would be able
to reminisce, over a prolonged period, about the
relationship that existed before AMAUTO-1's departure
from the United States.
b. To exchange addresses and telephone
numbers for the purpose of sending occasional
greetings to one another.
C.. To invite AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, if
necessary) to dinner, at his expense.
d.
To ascertain AMAUTO-1's future plans.
e. To assess AMAUTO-1's feelings toward
the United States and toward his own government.
f. For SAMKO to talk favorably about the
United States using himself as an example, (the
son of immigrant parents who made good in business);
to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone
with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness.
g. If the opportunity presented itself,
to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the
Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton
sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment
of this goal would adversely affect the economic
development of Cuba. It was our hope that some-
time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would
volunteer to discuss his country's economic
situation which might have opened the conversation
to further exploitation by SAMKO.
We

demonstrations in the United States and abroad.
were trying to draw out AMAUTO-1's personal analysis
of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam
and to compare his statements with the Cuban Government
position.
3.
Although, SAMKO was determined to see AMAUTO-1 even
if he had to camp outside AMAUTO-1's home, we reminded him
that because of AMAUTO-1's position, he might refuse to see
SAMKO in his home, but that SAMKO should not hesitate to

1. Alexander SAM KO
SA MKO arrived in Madrid on 30 May
and was met by the undersigned at 1700 hours in his hotel room.
SAMKO does not know the true name of the undersigned.. He
quickly complained of his flight and said never before has he
flown on a "cattle plane" and avowed never again to fly
Aeronaves de Mexico. PACHANKIS correctly assessed him as a
querulous person. The undersigned was mentally prepared for
his comments regarding the flight, the bad food served on the
plane, and, much later in the week, the hotel room, Madrid in
general and, because of the language barrier, his one-plate.
diet of steak and potatoes. He said his return trip would be
'
through London where he expected to fly the Boeing 747 to
New York. SACODER interrupted him and said that we had-other
plans for him and his only reply was "oh!". Beneath his rough
exterior and use of the vernacular, which is indeed spicy,
SAMKO is a loveable person who has an infinite number of anec-
dotes. Although he had no children, he gives the impression
of being a good, grandfatherly type who could easily put any--
one in a nostalgic mood. After leaving the room we continued
the conversation in the hotel bar. SACODER reviewed the cover
stories and went through a series of do's and don'ts; i.e.,
do try to establish a channel between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1; don't
hesitate to accept an invitation to visit AMAUTO-1's office,
failing all other means to meet with him; do try to invite him
out alone to a restaurant for dinner or to a bar for a drink;
do accept an invitation to have dinner at his home; don't hint
to your sponsorship for this trip. He had no objections to
the cover stories, but embellished them to his liking with

SAMKO approached AMAUTO-1's home we had a stroke of luck.
First, one-of AMAUTO-1's children was- in the front yard
playing, and two, the door to the driveway was open, tnus
SAMKO was able to enter the front yard. Under separate
cover for C/WHD and COS, Niami we are forwarding photographs
taken during the initial meeting between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1.
The pictures were taken from the home of one of our staffers.
We believe they highlight the events leading to the reunion
of these two old friends. The following is a description
of each photo:

SANKO arrives at AMAUTO-1's home at 1150 hours,
31 May 1970. (Although not shown, KENTLAND

and SACODER were monitoring AMAUTO-1's home
from 0900 hours on 31 May so that, in the
event AMAUTO-1 decided to leave before SAMKO's
arrival, we could instruct: SAMKO by phone to
delay his departure.)
After trying to enter via the front gate,
SAMKO called to one of the children who was
playing in the front yard. The child told
him to go to the garage entrance. SAMKO
walks toward that entrance.
The boy apparently called for someone in the
house. A maid, not shown in this photo, but
who can be seen in photo L, came out and
approached SAMKO. In his halting Spanish,
SAMKO said he wanted to see "el Senor".
The maid said he wasn't in. He explained to
the maid that it was "very importante" to
see the Senor. By this time another maid
appeared, shown in this photo, and she gets
into the act. She repeats that el Senor is
not in. SAMKO, sensing he wasn't getting
anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to
see "la senora". The maids went into indivi-
dual monologues, but SAMKO could not understand
what they were saying. Finally, SAMKO produced
a note, which he was asked to prepare, and
handed it to the maid in this photo. SAMKO
repeated that it was "very importante to see
el Senor."
The maid accepts the note and returns to the
house. Three of AMAUTO-1's children observe
the activities from the front entrance.
AMAUTO-1 exits, with note in hand and looks
toward the driveway. SAMKO spots him and
calls out, "Bill, don't you remember me,
it's SAMKO." Bill replies, "SAMKO, muy bien,
come here, come here." Actually, AMAUTO-I
goes toward SAMKO and they embrace. (The
driveway slants toward the house and from our
observation post we could not see the embrace.).
AMAUTO-1 accompanies SAMKO into the house,
arm in arm. As they go SAMKO tells AMAUTO-1 that
he put on weight and asked where his boy was.
AMAUTO-1 replies that he's rich because all
these kids are his (pointing to the three boys).

During the conversation in AMAUTO-1's home, SAMKO

as "you know Bill, Julio was jealous of you because I treated
you like a brother. I didn't want you to return to Cuba,

illegally, SAMKO could have arranged for him to remain in the
States by getting assistance from some police and detective
friends in Florida. SAMKO repeated his delight to again see
AMAUTO-1 and how happy he was to know he is alive.

him to have breakfast. SAMKO refused, but settled for a beer.
AMAUTO-1 excused himself, went to the phone and called an
unidentified party, SAMKO could not understand the conver-

of SAMKO's presence. (It is also possible that AMAUTO-1

We were confident that AMAUTO-1 would be the first

address? SANKO repeated the cover story and at the end of
the second how did you get our address

(AMAUTO-1's wife remained cool and sus-
picious throughout the initial confrontation, but later reacted
warmly toward SAMKO.) As we noted above, SAMKO embellished the
story to his satisfaction. He also shed a few tears when he

recommendation that he take a vacation. He continued his
softening approach of AMAUTO-1 by adding:

were moved by this comment and were literally drooling with
the thought of being millionaires. The wife asked a number
of questions regarding SAMKO's wealth, his real estate activity,
collection of silver and his success in general. The wife
was astounded with the simple explanation of how SAMKO went
about building and financing apartment houses.

for employment, he learned that it was the National Buscuit
Company. He was a master mechanic. He's an ingenious person
and has invented several items on which he has patents. - Although
the years before, during and after the war were difficult, he
had the foresight to put his meager savings in real estate.
He moved to Florida in the early 50's, reportedly purchased
two apartment buildings, but sold them after a year for a
$15,000 loss and made some investments in land near the Cape
Kennedy area. He was about to begin a multi-million dollar
building project on the land, but the NASA complex was moved
to Houston and he therefore cancelled his plans and sold the
property. While he is not considered wealthy SAMKO lives quite
comfortably in retirement. He has a Lincoln continental in the
garage and a home valued at about $50,000. Another of his com-
plaints was the way we controlled his purse strings while in
Madrid. We put him in a hotel used by many travel agencies
which SACODER thought was comfortable, but SAMKO would have
preferred the Hilton. He complained of the fact that he was
dipping into his own money and was not happy with the idea of
keeping receipts (aside from the hotel bills and the airline
ticket, SANKO probably did not keep any receipts). He was
advanced $280 in Madrid which will be T/A'd to Miami. Miami
should pick up his full tab and might consider buying him a.
case of scotch as a token of our appreciation for his accomplish-
ments on the assignment, but PACHANKIS probably has learned
that a couple of pats on SAMKO's back is sufficient to reward him.

10. Contact was again made with SAMKO on the eve of his
possible luncheon engagement with AMAUTO-1. We again reviewed
the objectives and he was given a defensive briefing as suggested
by WH/Miami. He was told that PACHANKIS probably would not
visit with him for about two weeks after his return and that he
should not attempt to get in touch with PACHANKIS. He under-
stood why this was necessary and agreed with the briefing.
"
If a luncheon could be arranged, SAMKO was asked to concentrate
on the following: (in addition to the requirements he was given
before his first meet with AMAUTO-1)

A.
B.
C.
D.
Try to ascertain AMAUTO-1's future, his
ambitions, his next possible assignment.
If possible engage him in a conversation
regarding the United States to get his
reaction toward our problems.
Build up your successes and reflect on how
AMAUTO-1 might have achieved similar goals
had he remained in the United States.
Be alert for any opening to inject questions
relating to the Cuban economy vis-a-vis the
failure of the "ten million", but to avoid
criticism for this failure, and show sympathy.
SAMKO had no difficulty convincing the hotel manage-
ment that he had to remain in the hotel until Saturday, 6 June.
He spoke directly with the manager and told the manager that
he was planning to leave on 7 June for Barcelona and would stay
at a sister hotel and asked the manager to make reservations
for him. The crisis had passed.

probably realizes that while he retains a prodigious role
in the Cuban Government, he will continue to give his loyalty
and devotion to the regime. At the same time, we feel,
AMAUTO-1 is an opportunist and might take advantage of the
SAMKO channel should the current regime come to an end or
his-own-position-jeopardized by the vengeful attitude of his
colleagues.
15. We would appreciate PACHANKIS doing the following:
A¨.
•
Purchase a dozen or so slides of Cape
Kennedy and rocket launchings which will
be sent to AMAUTO-1's son, Alexander.
SAMKO should prepare a letter to AMAUTO-1
as soon as the purchase is made extending
his appreciation to AMAUTO-1 for spending his
valuable time with SAMKO and repeating his
desire to help in any way possible and not
to hesitate doing so.

for his support and full cooperation. Also, our thanks to Miami
and PACHANKIS for their fine support.

AMAUTO-1 was recalled on 30 June 1970 and his future

7. While still at the park SAMKO said he hoped AMA UTO– 1
would get an assignment to the United Nations so that AMAUTO-1-
would have an opportunity to visit SAMKO in Florida. AMAUTO-1
was thrilled with this idea and SAMKO's offer. SAMKO said
his eyes glowed while AMAUTO-1 pondered this possibility.
SAMKO talked about his home and the beach nearby, the climate,
his new car, etc. SAMKO's comment on AMAUTO-1's reaction was
interesting. He said that beneath. AMAUTO-1's communist cxterior
lies the capitalist. Before leaving the park (AMAUTO-1 had to
leave for the airport where he had an appointment to see. AMECRU-1)
SAMKO said, "Bill, if you ever need me, I'll never let you down.
You have a good friend who loves you a lot." SAMKO said he
noted some emotional change on Bill's face after this comment.
-
.
.8. SAMKO was met 48 hours after the contact with AMAUTO-1
in the event AMAUTO-1 decided to put a surveillance on SAMKO.
No surveillance was noted when SAMKO was picked up, but on
entering the car SAMKO suggested that SACODER keep an eye out
for a tail. . We drove around town for fifteen minutes. Certain
that no one was tailing us we drove to a Station safehouse
which has an underground garage. SAMKO was visibly excited and
was enjoying the "cloak and dagger" role, but he was nervous.
He was highly impressed with the garage entrance to the safe-
house and commended us for being so shrewd and security conscious.
He wanted to know whose apartment it was and SACODER said that
it was his private "pad". His comment was: "you sure live it up
well."
As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports,
SAMKO's temper does rise. He was highly excited during the
meeting because he was asked to leave the hotel room. Since
the reservation was made for four days, he was asked to leave.
He pleaded with SACODER to do something to keep him in the hotel
room or risk losing the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1
because AMAUTO-1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday,
6 June. SACODER admitted the error but added that there was
a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage-
ment to allow him to stay a few more days. SACODER suggested
that he should explain to the manager that 1) his laundry had
not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone
call on Saturday and that there was no way of getting in touch
with the caller. Failing this, SACODER offered another simple
solution. Since SANKO and AMAUTO-1 had not yet exchanged
addresses, SAMKO could return to the AMAUTO-1 home and give
the maid a note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels.
(SAMKO admitted that he told AMAUTO-1 about the possibility of
having to leave the hotel because his reservation ended soon.)
SAMKO did not at first accept this logic, but SACODER explained
that he (SACODER) could not plead with the hotel management
on SAMKO's behalf. This was poor security. SAMKO accepted
this and after a glass of scotch and water admitted that the
solution was indeed simple, but he was terribly excited at first.
Throughout the debriefing SAMKO revealed the following:
He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey on 2 November 1907 to
Polish parents. At the age of 14-15 he worked as a construction
hand on a bridge being built in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.
Later, he worked on the construction of the Anhauser Yeast
Factory in Oldbridge, New Jersey. He married in 1930. During
the hard years, his wife worked in a factory while he roamed
the streets looking for employment. In the early 40's he
worked for Dupont reportedly on the atomic bomb project, but
specifically with U-235. After the war he applied for work
with NBC which he thought would be the National Broadcasting
Company, but after he filled out his application and was accepted

12. On the morning of 6 June AMAUTO-1's wife called
SAMKO and, in English, said that her husband would pick him
up at 1400 hours in front of the hotel. At the appointed
hour, AMAUTO-1's official vehicle pulled up in front of the
hotel driven by a chauffeur. AMAUTO-1 greeted SAMKO in front
of the hotel and after exchanging a few words, they departed
for a nearby restaurant. (SAMKO was too preoccupied to make
note of the name of the restaurant. We decided against any
surveillance during the AMAUTO-1/SAMKO meeting to avoid alerting
AMAUTO-1 and/or his staff that the SAMKO visit to Madrid
was pre-planned.).
13. At lunch. SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 again reminisced.
They discussed the following:
A. In one of his references, AMAUTO-1 said
that men like him are needed in Cuba and
noted that he would probably die fighting
for Cuba which is young and aggressive,
but that some day it will be a great
country; that he has been fighting all
his life to relieve the oppressed and
repeated that he will die fighting.
(It is interesting to note SAMKO's reaction
here to AMAUTO-1's statement. When SAMKO
first visited AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was
certain that under the facade of being a
devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a
capitalist at heart, but at this meeting
SAMKO modified his comment by adding that
it appears AMAUTO-1 is truly a communist
who maintains strong convictions of the
righteousness of the revolution. The above
.comments by AMAUTO-1 produced the peg on
which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity
of AMAUTO-1's statement on freeing the
oppressed, but he was not specifically
instructed to maintain a polemic argument
on the rights and wrongs of the revolution
because we felt this objective was secondary
to the re-establishment of a relationship
between these two old friends, A future
meeting might include the exchange of an
objective appraisal of the revolution as
seen by SAMKO.)
B.
.
AMAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an
intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food
in the United States. He explained that
the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in
the Canary Islands. The fish caught is
processed in the Canary Islands and can be
shipped to the United States as a product
of Spain, not of Cuba. AMAUTO-1 added,
"SAMKO, you're like a father to me, please
think about it (the agency)? AMAUTO-1
explained that SAMKO could earn about $200,000
a year in commission based on sales of
$2,000,000. SAMKO said he would think about
it, but privately to SACODER he said that
he had no intention to disturb his retirement
with a fishy business.

Stol AALTO-1_that_he_cxpected-
AMAUTO=1 to be bigger than just an
ambassador to Spain. He said, "I want
you to get to the United Nations."
SAMKO repeated his desire to show
AMAUTO-1 his Florida home and spend a
few days at the beach with him. AMAUTO-1
again was visibly moved with this idea.
SAMKO restated that "Bill, you have a
good friend, don't forget it. You are
like a son.".
.
They exchanged addresses. SAMKO had
printed his address, but AMAUTO-1 asked
him to write it on another piece of
paper. AMAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted
it written to understand it better, but we
believe he will use the sample to compare
it with letters SAMKO might send in the
future.. They promised to write to each
other. SAMKO was given AMAUTO-1's private
address, not that of the embassy.
AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to
leave so soon because he would have
enjoyed showing SAMKO the Spanish
interior. SAMKO said he might consider
returning near the end of 1970, but
AMAUTO-1 did not say whether he would
be in Spain in late 1970.
AMAUTO-1 said he was suspicious when
he first saw SAMKO noting that the nature
and importance of his position make him
act suspicious, but the suspicion soon
dissipated

On saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both

15. Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed
and rehearsed were successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater
than our own expectations. Unless we are misjudging the shrewd-
ness of AMAUTO-1 through our own naivete, we believe the
relationship was sincerely re-established and a channel opened
for future use by AMAUTO-1 should he desire to use this channel
other than to maintain a friendly correspondence. It was un-
fortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the
point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1
nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SAMKO admirably
fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the
fiction of his visit to Spain. We believe too, that although
AMAUTO-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime,
he did not criticize the United States which we feel he might
have done had he suspected that SAMKO's visit to Madrid was
sponsored by the U.S. Government. AMAUTO-1 has come

royalties from the song throughout the world, which have boon
calculated at between $750,000 and $1,000,000, and although
this arount will have to be divided among many things, something
would fall to them.
Ruiz says to work abroad they have to or should send people of
the greatest trust, otherwise it is better that they remain in
Cuba. If thoro isn't complete confidence it is a constant
struggle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy
life. They mention De la Nuoz, and Ruiz says if he's gono he's
gone, but the interesting thing would be to know what motivated
him; his wife, his son, or money. He says that it has caused
a great impression here, and that no one oven imagined such a
thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle
with all of them.
A girl that is in this moeting with Ruiz says that De la Nuez'
daughter is married to Juan Antonio GARCIA, who is Head
of Government..., that he has been proposed for ambassador (Ruiz
says that they will now have to reconsider this), and what they
all three agree on is that De la Nuoz was not to blame,
Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Nuoz' son in which he says that
his father has betrayed then. They also mention an ambassador
who has left (for Cuba-?) and took watches as gifts to everyone
in the Ministry. Ruiz thinks that some of thom will remain here
in Spain as they have a great deal going for them there.
Report No.352
-
26 June 1970
Ruiz' is very displeased. He speaks to Horacio about how badly
some of the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana.
He asks him if he rerembers the name of one of these comrades
that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca-
tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left.
After what COLON said they wrote him a letter calling his atten-
tion to the criticism. Ruiz is very worried about his re-call
to Havana. Ho tells Horacio that he doesn't think it is about
his work, and Horacio says they are doing things there that are
super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are
resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions
contacts that he has had in Spain with different people, and he
never has committed an error, and has always handled everything
with great tact and in favor of his government, even when he has
had to deal with Falangists.
Ruiz says that he is very sensitive and that things have got to
the point that he can't just let them go by, things they are
accusing him of in Havana. But, there is no one that has the
courage to tell him directly to his face so that he could
justify himself, and if they are things that he cannot handle then.
for them to call him back, and relieve him of the post because
"Cort andante Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them, but the thing is.

Ruiz dictatos to Nilda: "The Cuban Imbassy groots the Minister
of Foreign Affairs and has the pleasure to request the corres-
ponding pormission to carry a pistol,-"Star" 9 mom.short, No.50.
234, which at the present time is being held in the offices
of the "Star" factory, in the Plaza do España, for
whose photograph is attached."
Ruíz is talking with a Cuban who is in Madrid on a scholarship.
-
They are talking of bringing a teacher from Cuba and Ruiz.
says that this would be very difficult. He says that instruction
is given by professors, but education is given by the parents,
and what the children will bo depends on this education..
Ruiz says that his father rade him a communist. Of all the.
children, he was the only one that studiod, but it was his
father that formed them all. From the time he was a small
child his father gave him books of Lenin to read. These books.
arrived clandestinely to Cuba. He remarks about problems his
own children have given him. He refers to an incident where
one of the children was invited to a First Communion, and
speaks of the freedom he gave the child to make his First
Communion also, if he wanted to.
Then Ruiz says that his other son "ALEJANDRO, is inclined to
remain in Spain, and he is willing to let him if this is what
the boy wants. He says that these things have to core from
one's own self, and if they are opposed in these actions it
can loave marks on them for the rest of their lives. Ruiz.
says he gives them the liberty to choose.
Ruiz tell this student with whom he is conversing that Alejan-
dro DE LA NUEZ has gone to the United States, and adds that
De La Nuez' wife never came to meetings or reunions that
were held at the embassy. Sho always gave as an excuse that
her nerves were bad. Ruiz says that De La Nuez took the money
with him.
This comrade (F) left at 12:15. Ho said goodbye to her very
cordially. Apparently around the 29th of the month she is
going to Paris.
Later Ruiz entered the office again and out the radio on very
loud. He didn't leave the office all morning, but the radio
continued to play very loud; so much so that you can hardly
tell when anyone goes in or out of the office.
Report 345
18 June 1970
Apparently they have received a document in which all the Chiefs
of Mission have been called to Cuba for the third week of July,
He tells
as some of them can make it coincide with their leave.
Curbelo that he intends to send Nilda either before or after he
leaves.

Imagine that Havana would question him on that
score. However, if there were problems that
Havana felt he lacked the ability to resolve,
he should simply be removed "because Comandanto
Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them." Subject
said he had been a revolutionary since the age
of 20 when he began to think for himself. He
had never bolonged to any political party other
than the Cuban Communist. The current state of
affairs, however, was becoming too disturbing and
distasteful to him because conscientiously he
knew that he was putting forth his full mental
and physical capacity toward the fulfillment of
his function.
Subject told Fuentes that since he didn't
know what was brewing in Havana it was possible
that he might not return to Madrid. In any event
he would designate Fuentes to substitute for him
as charge d'affaires. During the entire conver-
sation no mention was made of Orestes BARREDA
Perez and why he was asked to return with RUIZ.
The latter seemed to be thoroughly absorbed in his
own concern over whatever fate lay in store for him
on his return to Cuba.

that the inister doesn't want to recoïve him or listen to
him when he goes there. Horácio says that the worst of it
is that here in Spain there is always some personality from there
that they have to o tertain, someone immortant, and that the
attention they need is continual, and sometimes it is necess-
ary to attend to the people here in Spain, which prevents
thon from attending those who arrive from there, but they
don't understand this.

He continues to talk with Horacio and he is indignant. Ruis
days that he has been in the Revolution since he was twenty
years old, when he began to think for himself. "He says that
he belongs to no party, none other, that is, but the Cuban
communist party. He says that the situation is becoming so
uncomfortable regarding him, and he doesn't like it at all..
He says he puts everything he has an all he care possible
into doing his job.
Ruiz says that one never knows about these things in Havana,
and that it is possible that he won't be returning. In the
ovent that this should happen, he is going to leave Horacio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him during
his abscence.as Charge'de Affairs, and if he roturns ho will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants sembles
or models of the passports to take with him, and then he
tells Horacio that if he has not returned by the 18th of
July, that he should represent him at the official reception.
Ho gives Horacio instructions as to what to wear, what the
official coremonies are and just what they consist of.
Report No.354
30 June 1970
Ruiz speaks to someone that calls and gives him a message
which annoys Ruiz. Someone has called the Provincial Depart-
mont of ?,blic Hoalth of Santander saying that they (the Cubans)
use "boric acid" in the stoves (?) which they export. They
give him this message in the name of the Commercial Office of
Cuba, they have a Latin-American accent, and say that ther
would take adequate measures so that no stove would be shipped.
Ruiz says to Horacio that he doesn't have time to take care
of this matter, and for him to accompany Franco and go to the
General Department of Security and rake charges about the
telephone call which is interfering with the trade between
Cuba and Spain. He says to go right up as far as the Coneral
Director if necessary, not explaining the "boric acid" one way.
or another, but simply as to the malicious call which was
made in the name of the Commercial Office of Cuba. This can
cause a delay of six or eight days in the departure of a ship
while this call is being explained in Public Health.

1. Relative to Subject's recall to Havana, which came.

him and Orestes BARREDA Perez to return, QUDOZE has
recorded Subject's reaction to the unexplained call as follows:

2135 116
A. on 26 June Subjećt talked at length with
Horacio FUENTES Martinez speculating on
Havana's possible motives for requesting his
return at this time, when in a matter of a few nicz
weeks he was scheduled to travel to Cuba for the recall to
26 of July celebrations which he expected to
combine with his vacation leave. He was extremely
upset and complained bitterly about companeros
who have tried to discredit him in Havana. He
wondered if Havana was going to put him on the
carpet for charges brought against him by these
companeros. He recalled one COLON (he was
not sure of the name) who last summer made false
accusations against him, for which he received a
letter of reprimand from Havana.
B. Subject also wondered if Havana could have
any complaints about his work. He had always main-
tained good relations with the Spaniards and despite
their contrary political idiology, he was careful
not to ruffle their feathers while upholding his
government's position at all times. He could not

2 years ago with the cover position of chauffeur. "AWARE!

ALVAREZ a routine chauffeur's essigment. Whereupon ALVAREZ.
tumed to the individual and said, "I didn't come here
to be a chaufrou" ALVARNS has never functioned prominently
as a chauffeur, "and they had to change his status after
a while, because he couldn't fool anyone in that role.'
F. Chopin denies that he knows anything of their manner of
operations; who their contacts or agents are; and, in a word,
the inner workings of the intel annars tus.
G. Chopin acknowledges that many Latin Americans visit the
Embassy, "but they gɔ upstairs to the Consulate," and he
does not know their identities, nor the exact purpose of
their visits. His lone contact with Iclin American types
are when they enter his section asking for propaganda
material. In those cases, Chopin directs them to help
themselves from the racks of Cuban publications available.

SUBJECT: Jules Chopin
At 2200 hrs on the evening of Saturday, 20 June, Jules Chopin
entered the Embassy offices as instructed. His face showed the
strain of the situation, yet he renaced to force e trin. lle vas
taken to a convenient office and for the next hours was deicfed.
While sipping Scotch throughout the evening he managed to control
some of his natural fears of the présent and future.
In all fairness, he must be commended for answering our questions
in a straightforward, sincere manner. While not every question--
from the various interested parties--was put to hip, the majority
vere. In some cases, he was given requirements for the next meeting.
and in addition, he offered several worthwhile reports.
Apart from the business aspects of the meeting, there were two
dominating themes numing throughout: His passionate please for
the personal safety of his family in the US and stand that after
his conduct on 12-13 February 1970, he had to prove his worth and
good faith; not to me, but to the powers that be, who were highly
distrustful of his intentions.
Specifically, the following matters were discussed:
-
1. Asked if he knew what the DGI was, Chopin was confused, but
understood when I said "DSE" or "G-2". In his circle, the intel
people are knom as "Semuridad del Estado" or "G-2". He denies
that he has ever worked for the wittingly. He doubts that he has
ever worked for them unwittingly, because he has never had more than
a. passing working relation with them. Chopin states that he has
never knom officially who the intel personnel are, "but after awhile,
you can hear and see things that leave no doubt." Asked to identify
those persons who he feels are intel and their hierarchy, Chopin
stated:
A. In early 1969, Ammando LOPEZ, appeared to be Chief of Intel
and DIAZ Vigo, the number two man.
B. When Orlando CASTRO defected in c. Harch 1969, LOPEZ was
immediately recalled to Havera and has not been heard from
since. DIAZ Vigo assumed head of intel, and Havana sent
Emidio VAIDES Heptines as a replacement. With VALDES, care..
his wife Magda (Hadeloys, ESPOSA Viver)ho went to work as
DIAZ Vigo's secretary. Chopin considers her to be an intel
agent as well.
C.
In c. late February or early March 1970, Diaz Vigo was recalled
to Havana. He has not been heard from again and there is

Mendez is a "great apple polisher", according to the

when the "Ambassador", his boss (indirectly) spoke so favorably
of the U.S. AMMART IN 1-1's wife, on the other hand, said that
Lydia Mendez was having a somewhat similar problem with

He remarks about problems his
own children have given him. He refers to an incident where
one of the children was invited to a First Cormunion, and
speaks of the freedom he gave the child to make his First
Communion also, if he wanted to.
Then Ruiz says that his other son "ALEJANDRO, is inclined to
remain in Spain, and he is willing to let him if this is what
the boy wants. He says that these things have to come from
one's own self, and if they are opposed in these actions it

Ruiz tolk this student with whom he is conversing that Alejan-
dro DE LA NUEZ has gone to the United States, and adds that
De La Muez' wife never came to meetings or reunions that
were held at the embassy
.
She always gave as an excuse that
her nerves were bad. Ruiz says that De La Nuez took the money
with him.
This comrade (F) left at 12:15.
He said goodbye to her very
cordially. Apparently around the 29th of the month she is
going to Paris.

Later Ruiz entered the office again and out the radio on very
loud. He didn't leave the office all morning, but the radio
continued to play very loud; so much so that you can hardly
tell when anyone goes in or out of the office.

A person from the Feria in Barcelona comes into the office.
He has some business to do with oracio here in Madrid.
They hope that Rail LEON will arrive on Thursday, as they
have many things to work out together regarding the
Chamber of Commerce in Madrid. He sneaks about "Cubaexport"
and a problem that they have with the brand name. He says it
would be better to postpone the process and continue exporting
neanwhile to the Canary Islands, until it is all settled.
He has visited the Chamber of Commerce in Barcelona. He has
eaten and had supper with some of the people from there. Ho
mentions GUERRERO y Garabon, to whom he and ROVIRA have given
an explanation: First, the problem that exists with the Can
Chamber of Commerce can be resolved by a simple diplomatic
resture, Second, the individual that has an interest in it, it is

Nilda says that they have received a call from Paris telling

says that they have, but that no one answered the cable.
They
have received only one cable from Moscow saving that he was
coming. Then they sont another cable back asking on what
Flight, and on what day, but they have had no answer.
Report No.346
Two people enter Ruiz' office. One of them is called "PORRILLA" (ph).
They are discussing: De La Nuez. Zorrilla says he has been very
hurt by it all, not only politically, but personally also. He
says that he always felt that De La Nuez was a person one could
trust, and that he has failed them. Ruiz says that hero everyone
trusted him.

Report No.345
18 June 1970
Nilda speaks to Ruiz about someone that spoke to her that wants
to stay in Madrid for a few days, but they don't have any money,
(Possibly it is ALPARA) and they have asked her if they can stay
at her housė. It seems that the people she is talking about are
on their way to Cuba, and they say, if they don't have the money
to stay in Madrid, then let them go directly to Cuba.
Nilda says that CHAIN's son-in-law is going to Morocco as
Cuban ambassador. The one that he had as his secretary.
When Alfara was in Madrid he said that the son-in-law had
neither the personality nor the qualifications for the position.
Ruiz says that if they are referring to the head of Chain's
office, that he is going to Poland as ambassador, but Nilda
insists that it is the husband of Chain's daughter.
-
Two comrades arrive, a man and a roman. They are going to
Holland, where they will spend a week, and they want a visa.
They will ro to other European countries also, and will be a
month and a half al together. (It seems that it is only the woman

believes that the whole affair was handled by the C.I. A.
Ruiz asks them who has been named ambassador to Morocco, and they
confirm the fact that the husband of his daughter (CHAIN-?) has
been appointed.
They return to the topt of De la Nuez. Ruiz says the only thing
they know is that he has gone, but they don't know where. In
any case, most likely they had family or friends among the
refugees in Mami.
Ruiz aska the girl if there are new people in the Ministry
there (Havana-?), if new ones are coming in. She says that her
enterprise has 71 employees, and that 55 of them are outside of
the enterprise, that the personnel situation is very bad. Two
days ago they started giving language classes in French and German,
and they talked with RAUL and he believes it is very necessary,
because it is very difficult to find people. In addition to their
being of trust, what is difficult is their lack of culture.
Again they discuss De la Nuez' case and his wife. They tell
Ruiz not to be too discouraged because it is the irst time that
Ruiz tells them about

Report No.346 (continued)
They continue to talk about De La Nuez, particularly the visitors.
Ruiz says that after his they are going to have to strengthen
the cadros, that it is important for everyone. He says he has
spoken to . MAINEL CASTRISAIA (phon), and they have agreed to
form new very strict-cadres.-
The visitors leave and on saying goodbye Ruiz says not to
discuss the De La Nuez affair too much so that it won't spread
any further. Besides, they are all very impressed by it.
VALDES VIVO CALLS RUIZ on the telephone. Ruiz asks him if he
has arrived at the hotel and if he has seen MARISI (phon).
(MARISI is staying at the same hotel as Valdes). Ruiz says that
Zorrilla has just beon there, and he has given him the telephone
number of the hotel for him to call. He says they have had no word
on the Cubana flight, only that it is to arrive today and will
leave tonight. But, Huiz says if it arrives at 3 o'clock that
this will not give them time to inspect it and all to leave,
even though they will do it all at night. Both Valdes and
Marisi are leaving this evening on Cubana.
Ruiz then speaks with Marisi, and says that he had heard of his
appointmont as ambassador. Apparently this is the one that is
to be in Morocco. They say that this ambassador, in all the
capitals that he is going to, is visited by the best doctors.

Report No.348
Tho ambassador that has just arrive from Beirut enter the
office. He was at the movies last night and they comment on it.
Then two other persons come in, one of them is Zorrilla.
They speak of various bings; that by diplomatic mail they
should only send things of a confidential nature, everything
else should go by diplomatic poucho
MERCEDES enters and says that Comrade Armando VELAZQUEZ, whom
Ruiz does not know, is here. He is the father of the Cuban
consul in Jamaica. He says he has been here 15 days waiting
for something to be resolved. He adds that a Rosa Maria of the
Ministry was supposed to resolve this problem, but she hasn't
done so. He doesn't want to borrow money here, and BARREDA has
already given him 1000 pesetas. Ho wants then to send a cable to
Havana to resolve his situation. Mercedes says that this
consul studied in the University with Barreda and that he is a
very ine person.

On the other hand, on this same date I received word from our
Consul in Barcelona advising that he has observed a minimum of
interest in the industrial circles with which we trade. This
would make it appear that a problem exists at a high level
between the Government of Cuba and the Government of Spain,
which is holding back trade with our country. Specifically,
some industrialists have advised our representative that the Min-
istry of Commerce has spread the word that until certain
talks are held between the two governments authorization of
permission of import with estination Cuba have been suspended.
We are attempting to confirm this today and learn if there
exists some relation with what we have been advised by the
Ministry of Labor..
We would appreciate it greatly if you would, as soon as poss-
ible, inform us what the position of our Government was in the
meeting of the I.L.O. in Geneva.

of both the diplomatic and regular passports in order to
study them and compare them with those used by other

"To enlarge further on the report dated 7 of the current month
regarding my meeting with the Minister of Labor, Sr.LICINIO DE LA
FUENTE, in relation to the request of the National Institute of Fish-
ing and the Ministry of Basic Industries for contracting
Spanish technicians, we wish to inform you that today we
received a telephone call from the Executive Officer to the
Ministry of Labor.
He informed us that our request for Spanish
technicians is still being considered, but that the Minister of
Labor and the Spanish government wishes to communicate official-
ly to my Government, their official displeasure with the pos-
ition adopted by the Cuban representation in the last meeting
of the 0.1.7.(I.L.O) rewarding a proposition that interferes in
the internal affairs of Spain. Unfortunately the Minister of
Labor had confirmed the request of our representative in
Geneva contradicted the efforts that were being made at high
levels of our countries for the betterment of our relations, and
the cooperation, and for the brotherhood, that should exist
between two peoples of the same blood.
..
My total lack of knowledge of what took place in the I.L.O.
with regard to Spain, and the position takon by our delegation,
precludes e from answering with accuracy, limiting myself only,
to saying that I would pass on the words of the Ministor and
that an explanation of the problem would be given.

Ruiz says to work abroad they have to or should send people of
the greatest trust, otherwise it is better t hat they remain in
Cuba. If there isn't complete confidence it is a constant
struggle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy
life. They mention De la Nuez, and Ruiz says if he's gone he's
gone, but the interesting thing would be to know what motivated
him; his wife, his son, or money. He says that it has caused
a great impression here, and that no one even imagined such a
thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle
with all of them.
A girl that is in this meeting with Ruiz says that De la Nuez'
daughter is married to Juan Antonio GARCIA, who is Head
of Government..., that he has been proposed for ambassador (Ruiz
says that they will now have to reconsider this), and what they
all three agree on is that De la Nuez was not to blame,
Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Nuez' son in which ho says that
his father has betrayed them. They also mention an ambassador
who has left (for Cuba-?) and took watches as gifts to everyone
in the Ministry. Ruiz thinks that some of them will remain here
in Spain as they have a great deal going for them there.

Ruiz' is very displeased. He speaks to Horacio about how badly
some of the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana.
He asks him if he remembers the name of one of these comrades
that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca-
tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left,
After what COLON said they wrote him a letter calling his atten-
tion to the criticism. Ruiz is very worried about his re-call
to Havana. He tolls Horacio that he doesn't think it is about
his work, and Horacio says they are doing things there that are
super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are
resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions
contacts that he has had in Spain with different people, and he
never has committed an error, and has always handled everything
with great tact and in favor of his government, even when he has
had to deal with Falangists.
Ruiz says that ho is very sensitive and that things have got to
the point that he can't just let them go by, things they are
accusing him of in Havana. But, there is no one that has the
courage to tell him directly to his face 30 that he could

It seems that they would like to bring a professor from Halana,
so that the children could study the same revolutionary methods
as there, but Ruiz sees this as a very difficult thing to do.
Because, one would not solve the situation of the different
grades and ages, and they are not going to send four or five
because they are needed there. He sees it as a better possibil-
ity to hire Spanish profössors among the young capable people,
with revolutionary leanings and who are simpathetic toward
Cubans, and have them teach the methods, and from books that are
brought from there. In this way they could have many professors
or teachers for the various ares, and they could rent and
furnish an apartment for this purpose.
Apparently Ruiz has no problems

with the school his children attend. The Director of the school
is a friend of theirs and visits the embassy. Her husband is a
communist. The children that attend the school have the same political
leanings as their parents. Noither religion nor politics are
taught. Ruiz says that the two older ones eat at the school, but
the little ones don't as they need help. Ruiz pays over $100 for 4.
The person who is with him has two children and pays $100 for the
two.
The children of this new comrade that is talking to Ruiz arrive

Report No.352(continued)
that the Minister doesn't want to receive him or listen to
him when he roe's there. Horacio says that the worst of it
is that here in Spain there is always some personality from there
that they have to entertain, someone important, and that the
attention they need- is continual, and sometimes it is necess-
ary to attend to the people here in Spain, which prevents
them from attending those who arrive from there, but they
don't understand this.
He continues to talk with Horacio and he is indignant. Ruiz
says that he has been in the Revolution since he was twenty
Years old, when he began to think for himself. He says that
he belongs to no party, none other, that is, but the Cuban
communist party. He says that the situation is becoming so
uncomfortable regarding him, and he doesn't like it at all.
He says he puts everything he has anfall the care possible
into doing his job.
Ruiz says that one never knows about these things in Havana,
and that it is possible that he won't be returning. In the
event that this should happen, he is going to leave Horacio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him during
his abscence.as Charge'de Affairs, and if he returns he will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants samples.
or models of the passports to take with him, and then he
tells Horacio that if he has not returned by the 18th of
July, that he should represent him at the official reception.
He gives Horacio instructions as to what to wear, what the
official coremonies are and just what they consist of.
Report No.354.
30 June 1970
Ruiz speaks to someone that calls and gives him a message
which annoys Ruiz. Someone has called the Provincial Depart-
ment of Public Hoalth of Santander saying that they (the Cubans)
use "boric acid" in the stoves (?) which they export. They
give him this message in the name of the Commercial Office of
Cuba, they have a Latin-Amert an accent, and say that ther
would take adequate measures so that no stove would be shipped.
030
Ruiz says to Horacio that he doesn't have time to take care
of this matter, and for him to accompany Franco and go to the
General Department of Security and rake charges about the
telephone call which is interfering with the trade between
Cuba and Spain He says to go right up as far as the General
Director if necessary, not explaining the "boric acid" one way
or another, but simply as to the malicious call which was
made in the name of the Commercial Office of Cuba.
Office of Cuba. This can
cause a delay of six or eight days in the departure of a ship
while this call is being explained in Public Health.
