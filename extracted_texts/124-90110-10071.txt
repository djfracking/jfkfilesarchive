Reference is made to our memorandum number CSCI-3/773,057,
subject as above, dated 10 October 1962.
KP 5-26-98
2. Joseph MEROLA, 2018 North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida,
has advised representatives of another office of this Agency that he
learned from contacts in New York that (fnu) PECAR, a Yugoslav trade
official in the U. S., is being recalled to Yugoslavia and wishes to
remain in the U. S. According to MEROLA, PECAR will visit Miami from
12 to 19 April 1963.
3. While MEROLA has an unsavory background, the representative
who spoke with him is inclined to believe that he was telling the
truth in this instance. MEROLA claimed that he has also informed the
U. S. District Attorney of the above development.
4. It seems probable that (fnu) PECAR is identical with the
subject of referenced memorandum, who was assigned to New York in late
1962 as in INTERTRADE representative.
5. We would appreciate receiving any information available to
your Bureau concerning PECAR's alleged desire to remain in the U. S.
6. If the above information is true, this Agency may wish to
consider the desirability of contacting PECAR in an effort to persuade
him to return to Yugoslavia at our behest.
