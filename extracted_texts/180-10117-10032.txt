Levinson then moved to Newport, Kentucky, where he operated the
Flamingo Club, a casino, along with Las Vegas racketeer Irving
"Nig" Devine. In 1951, he moved to Miami Beach, where he
operated the bookmaking concession at the San Souci Hotel.
Levinson was chased out of Miami in 1951 by the Kefauver
Committee, so he ventured to Las Vegas and became part-owner
in the Sands Hotel, which was being operated for Joseph "Doc"
Stacher, a Meyer Lansky lieutenant.
By 1955, Levinson, having acquired interests in the Flamingo
and Dunes hotels, was ready to give them all up for his coming
involvement in Doc Stacher's Fremont Hotel. At that same time,
he also acquired a major interest in the Horseshoe Club.
late 1963, he was the largest single stockholder in the
Fremont Hotel and in the Horseshoe.)
"
(By
He became involved in the establishment of the Bank of World
Commerce, Ltd., which incorporated in 1961 under British law in
Nassau. Ed Levinson and Cliff "Big Juice" Jones, former Nevada
Lieutenant Governor, were listed as stockholders, with the direc
tors of the bank being Levinson; Benjamin Sigelbaum, a reported
bagman for Meyer Lansky; Irving Devine; and John Pullman.
Reportedly, the Bank of World Commerce served as a "laundromat"
for syndicate cash by allowing money to flow into the bank only
to return to the United States from Nassau in the form of
loans for everything from homes for gangsters to savings and
loan associations around the country.
During the 1960's Levinson became associated with several poli-
tical figures. No only did he aid financially troubled Teams-
ters President Jimmy Hoffa, but he became a partner in the.
Serv-U Vending Corporation with Bobby Baker, then secretary
to the Democratic Majority Leader of the United States Senate;
Fred Black, Jr., a Washington lobbyist for North American
Aviation Company; and Benjamin Siegelbaum. This company pro-
vided vending machines for companies working on government
contracts and was substituted for a firm that had handled
North American Aviation's vending business for years, despite
the fact that Serv-U had no employees, vending machines, or
experience.
In 1962, Levinson, along with Benjamin Sigelbaum, appeared to
be involved in Airway Hotel, Inc., the hotel corporation which
created the Intenational Airport Hotel
on Century Boulevard in Los Angeles.

During the 1964 Senate Rules Committee investigation of the
Bobby Baker case, Levinson claimed the privilege of the 1st,
4th, and 5th Amendments. During the investigation, it was
revealed that Levinson was a stockholder with Baker in the
Waikiki Savings and Loan Association in Honolulu, the other
members being Cliff Jones and his law partner, Louis Weiner;
Edward Barrick, a part-owner in the Flamingo, Fremont, and
Horseshoe Club; Mike Singer, deceased labor racketeer and former
business agent of Teamster Local 626 in Los Angeles; Morris
"Moe" Genser, former assistant chief investigator for the
California Department of Motor Vehicles, later indicted for
bribery, grand theft, extortion, and assorted other crimes;

dictment of income tax evasion against Levinson; Edward Torres
former vice president of the Fremont Hotel; and Paul Weyerman
and Cornelius Hurlay, former stockholders and employees of the
Fremont Hotel.
In March 1968, Levinson pled nolo contendere to the "skimming"
charges, admitting that he had "willfully aided and assisted
in the preparation of false corporate tax returns for the fiscal
year ending in 1963", and was fined $5,000.

In 1967, a group of organized crime figures attempted to de-
fraud the Chase Manhattan Bank of almost $2 million, using the
Exchange Bank of Geneva, Switzerland as a cover. The bank was
owned by a group of Americans, including several prominent
businessmen, as well as Levinson and Benjamin Siegelbaum. The
investigation revealed that the Swiss bank had served as a
laundry shop" for Mafia money for years.
On March 1, 1974, Levinson's wife, Betty, invested approxi-
mately $90,000 as a stockholder in Lake Elsinore Sands, Inc.
a "restaurant, cocktail lounge, and gambling casino" at Lake
Elsinore. The officers of Lake Elsinore Sands, Inc., are
Jack Barenfeld, President, who was arrested in 1934 for sus-
picion of murder; and Carl Braverman, Vice President and
Treasurer, who was arrested in West Virginia in 1927 for larceny
and again in New York in 1943 for untrue advertising.

Ok, Doris go ahead and go back to when you first met Gino
I met Gino last summer, he and some of his friends came into
where I work and I dated him all last summer, he kept in contact
with me after I quit work and went back to school and then when
I came down here again this summer, I went out with him once or
twice and he would come in to see me at work.
You say some of his friends, do you know their names?
D
Sully, Jason's brother, Jason, Patrick Sherman
M
Sully, who is Sully, do you know his full name?
D
No not positive, but it might be David Sullivan, I'm not sure
M

David Sullivan
☐ D
It might be, but I'm not sure.
M
Well, how did it come that you met Gino
D
Well I work
M
D
uh and his place is just down the
road, they stopped in for a drink and we talked to each other
you know, and he asked me if I needed a ride into work the next
day, which I did, he took me to work and then we just started
going out.
Did Gino indicate to you where he lived at?
Bethesda, or what ever it is
M
Bethesda
D
yeah, he lived in a condominium there
M
-
D

Do you know the address:
No, Gino would never give me his address or his phone number
he didn't want me to know

but he said he lived in a condominium in Bethesda
uh huh, I'm pretty sure that is what he said, I'm pretty sure
that is what he told me, I never really, Gino just always wanted
to keep a lot of things to himself so I never really questioned
him too much. I didn't ask where he lived or anything like that
How did you get in touch with him
I never did, well either I called Gino's Classic Cars or else
I didn't get in touch with him. He usually was the one who would
get in touch with me.
do you think that he was mixed up in something that wasn't
exactly on the up and up?
yes
what makes you feel that way?
just for the different times when he wouldn't give me his phone
number of his address. He said he didn't give it out to anybody,
and at times he said he wished he could tell me things but he
just couldn't and a awful lot of times he indicated things but
didn't come right out and say

D
M
D
Oh, yes, several times, Gino and Jason and I went out to dinner
and Jason whenever Jason was in the area, Jason and Gino would
stop in to see me and I talked to Jason a few times over the
phone
Could you describe Jason to me?
he is a nice looking man, gray hair, medium build, I'd say he
is about 5'8", 5'9", blue eyes
M
about how old?

I would guess 45

Uh, pretty frequently, as a matter of fact he was just there,
a couple times this summer his partner lives in New York and
Gino went there quite often and he spent a good deal of time in
California recently.
how recently?
oh, I guess it was, well it was my second semester of school,
you know, which was this past term, so it must have been in
February, March, April
Did he say why he went to California?
I was under the impression it was for art, looking for cars and
things like that
did he drive out or fly out, do you know?
I think he, I'm almost positive that he drove back because that
is when he bought his second Lincoln
that is the one that he presently owns
yes, he owns two presently, and he drove it back and I'm not
exactly sure how he got out there.
the uh, back up a little bit, you mentioned that you had seen
Gino's truck go down the road, Monday and uh that is the brown
one, did it have Maryland tags on it or?
D
yes it did
M
it had Maryland tags on it
D
well, uh, you know
M
you assume it was Maryland tags
D
well, I've been in it before and I am almost positive it had
Maryland tags on it. I believe he bought it off somebody in
Pennsylvania, but it did have Maryland tags on it
M
you don't know who he bought it from do you?

no

Did Jason ever tell you what kind of business he was in?
no,
.
uh, I questioned Gino one time as to what Jason did and
Gino evaded the question and another time I asked Gino how
come if they were partners, how come it was Gino's Classic
Cars and uh you know Gino just said, not to ask questions
and made a joke of it as he usually does
to your knowledge, did Gino carry a lot of money on him?
always
always
D
M
D -

always
M
M
M
can you give me an estimate of how much
no I never
a couple of hundred dollars
sometimes even more than that, he always you know had quite
large sums on him
uh huh, who did Gino have working for him, you know immediate
workers, right there all the time
D
Patrick just quit
M
Patrick
D
Sherman, just quit
M
what did he look like?
D
:
uh, red hair, long, very long mustache, fairly heavy, he was
short, 5'7", 5'8"
M
do you know why he quit?
D
uh, Gino said that it was because he felt that he was holding
Patrick back and that Patrick was more or less in a rut and
Patrick said that he had a lot of things on his mind and Gino
had a lot of things or his mind and it was better for both of
them if they split. Patrick was back in the area, Patrick had
been in a hospital and he came back, a matter of fact he was
in Sunday night, the night before the last when I saw Gino and
then he also came in with Gino's brother uh and sister-in-law.
with Patrick when he came in last Monday
do you, have you been inside the building up there

some other places, just general it was a better place
M
why wouldn't New York and Philadelphia necessarily be a good
location to be close to
D - I don't know
M
you don't know
D
M
D
-
I'm not positive, but I think Gino was thinking of moving out
to the coast very soon
out to the coast, why do you say that
he, uh, liked it out there and he said something to me about
moving out there and that uh in talking to his brother that
you know the just of the conversation about moving out to the
West Coast
which brother came to visit him
M
D.
Joe, the baby in the family
M
Joe, where was he from?
D
Connecticut
M
Connecticut.
Did Gino ever buy you anything?
oh yeah, uh he sent me roses and little things
D
M
did he ever buy you any jewelry
D
S
D
S
-
D
no, not that I can think of
I'm just curious, when we first started talking about him, you
mentioned the fact that you felt there was something, something
wasn't quite right about what Gino was doing and you spent some
time in the shop and everything, did you have any idea what
that might be
no, I uh, I never, I often wondered about it and I even mentioned
it to my sister, my sister had advised me to stay away from Gino,
but
well, why did you tell your sister if she advised you to stay
away from Gino
just that I thought he was doing something illegal that I thought
he was mixed up in something, I don't know what just
cars.

you must have had some guess or something

you must have had some guess or something

D
S
M -
-
-
no, it was just you know, I thought it was very odd that he
would never give me his phone number or things like that and
well impression of other things, everything seemed very odd to
me
for instance, what types of things did you question
uh
don't miss understand, we're not trying to divulge any evidence
against Gino in any way,
we're trying to find out who did this to him
D
right off, I just cant think
S
D
S
what about his partner, did he every say anything about him
no, not anything much
how often did his partner come down here, about, that you know
D oh, not that often, they would call each other quite frequently
you know, like once every day, they would call each other

once a day

when you say not that often, how often do you mean
uh, lets see, I'd say once every few months Jason would be down
cause as far as I know Jason may have been down twice this summer
to my knowledge
how recently, what is the most recent time that he was down
he was definitely down here in JUne because he stopped in to
see me, but he may, I'm not positive, I think he was taking a
plane out of Baltimore and I think he stopped in, I think Gino
had taken him to the airport, but I'm not positive about that
out of Baltimore to where, back to New York
I have no idea
going back to the very recent past, the last time that you saw
Gino was say about two weeks ago
D
uh huh

M

does he have a lot of cars in there
D
M
-
D -
well uh, he used to have three usually three in the showroom
and he had about three in the back that he was working on and
I don't know if he did sell that Cadillac or if it was stolen
or uh, there had been a car in the paint room
now did you hear that a Cadillac was stolen in the paint room
from California
I had heard that only through reading the paper, as a matter of
fact someone else called my attention to it, I didn't even know
and I couldn't understand why Gino didn't mention it to me that
Monday when he was in. Because from the way I understood it,
the robbery happened on Friday or Saturday night and Gino was
in here Monday and I couldn't understand why he didn't say
anything to me
you say he had some stuff stolen from the showroom
M
D
that is what, I was told from other people
M
D
M
D
M
D
M
D
-

did he have a large number of people hanging out up there
no, he also had another boy working for him, a young kid,
named Jay, Jerry, Jack his name was Jack. I think he was only
about 16 or 17
do you know where he lived at
no, he was just a young kid and then of course the uh man who
lives next door he re-does furni, he refinishes furniture, he
would come over occasionally and the man who has the garage
just down from him would come down, but other than that
did Gino ever indicate to you that he commuted, commuted between
Bethesda
oh yes
that is a long drive
yes it is, I often asked him why he didn't bother to get an
apartment or house up here, but he didn't want to
did he ever say why
M
D
M
-
D -
no
did he ever say why he got located here instead of down in
Bethesda, his business
he said that he felt this was a better location because of its
where it was in relationship to New York and Philadelphia and

".
what did the conversation involve
oh, they were giving me a hard time before and like being very
funny towards Gino and you know they were teasing him about
you know things like that, that was basically the, other than
general, his brother had bought a new car and he had brought
it down for Gino to look at it to see what Gino thought
was and the conversation just jumped around about cars and that.
was about it
what type of car was that, do you know
it was something like a Vega, something like that
he bought it here in Maryland or
no, well his brother bought it in Connecticut and wanted Gino
to see it and they were on there way to uh Virginia Beach or one
of the beaches for a few days
did Gino every during the time you said, that you were trying
to break off the relationship, at least slow it down some, un
at any time during when you were having a good relationship,
did he ever give you any indication of how his business was
doing or anything like that
uh, Gino always tried to make everyone think that he was doing
very well, you known
was that including you
yeah, occasionally he would you know make a joke if I don't
get this car sold that I'm not going to have you know, you
know some money, things like that, but usually he would try
to make it sound as if he was doing very well and he would
try to you know show off his money, try to be very extravigant
with his money
when you were dating Gino, last summer, about how often were
you seeing him
D
about every week and he would take me almost every week
S
once or twice a week, something like that

well, I'd see him, you know I would see him two, three, maybe
four times a week and then, uh, Gino did buy me a piece of
jewelry, he bought me a charm for a charm braclet, they had
a going away party for me but that was just you know everybody
had bought me, Gino wouldn't always take me out on my day off
because a lot of things would come up that is another thing that
I couldn't understand is uh we would make plans to go somewhere
and all of a sudden he would call me up that afternoon and say
I'm sorry but I must go to Philadelphia for I must go here, he
just made a recent trip to Philadelphia as a matter of fact, uh
he stopped by to take me with him, but I already had another
date, so he left
did he say why he was going to Philadelphia

no,

cars usually
this is sort of personal, but did he every purpose marriage
to you

that Gino worked very hard for everything that he has gotten.
Patrick I think was trying to advise Gino to get out of what
he was doing, I don't know what Patrick, when Patrick was drinking

two or three years ago
D
uh, I guess quite a few you know
M
D
let me ask you this or maybe you can give us some kind of an
answer, or a speculation anyway, since you have known Gino and
dated him and so forth, did he ever indicate to you or did you
ever get a feeling that maybe there was somebody out to get him
no, but uh, not so much Gino, but I knew Jason has had a couple
stunts with people in his neighborhood really and they had gone
as far as doing damage to cars and things like this, and I knew
Jason wasn't too well, you know slashed roof tops and things
like this, I knew things like that, but as far as Gino not I
didn't know of anything

in Bethesda
Gino would always just refer to it as outside of D.C. and then
just recently he had been more specific where he was living and
I know Gino has a housekeeper or somebody, because Patrick told
me that Gino had somebody coming in and all the time watching
his dog and watching the house for him and Gino didn't get along
well with his neighbors as far as I know

because they always complained about where he parked his cars
occasionally I guess he would drive the older cars home and he
would want them right on the lawn close to the house and he told
me several times when people would come over and try to fight with
him he would tell them off and as far as I know he wasn't close
to anybody down there, with exception of the man who owned the

cars stolen?

no, not at all

extremely good mood

things on his mind, he never elaborated on it.

7:00, sometimes he would stay until later on, depending on what
he wanted to get done

Florida is when he went out to California and he didn't bother
to write to me at all from California, he called me he never
would write
When he called you did he call collect?
No, a lot of times he would call me person to person

he got a traffic ticket last summer and when he pulled out a
Maryland license, I said I thought you lived in D.C. and he
said well I say D.C. but it is really Maryland
Did he ever talk about going down to West Virginia any?

it to here, they had it worked out, so I know Gino went to

M.
Gino used to have drivers, but right now I think Gino was doing
it himself, I'm not positive, but I think so
Jason's brother and Gino and this other man who will be at that
car rental place, all ran around together, the three of them
Jason's brother, the guy that ran the car rental place
the one that Gino would come see at the car rental place,
Gino, uh I was there twice with Gino at this car rental place
and both times he was there, so I know he does something there
now, this is at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport
D right and if you can't get ahold of that man
M
-
what does this man look like?
D
uh, he has glasses and he is dark hair, if you can't get him
there I know another place where you would be able to find out
some information, it's called the Tim Buck Two Bar somewhere
in that area and that man goes there all the time, as a matter
of fact Gino used to go there a lot with him
M

and they were good friends

you know the first time I met Gino the three of them were
together, David and Sully and Gino were together

Sully or something like that
No there is three, David is one person and Sully is another

that runs the place

D
M
D
S
right and it is either David or Sully, I always got the two of
them mixed up because whenever Gino would talk about them there
and I couldn't keep them straight
Well, the reason we asked you if you had any inclination that
Gino was married is because he was
I thought that he, he had been because, well, last year there
would be note on his desk saying, you know, he had gotten a
phone call from what was her name Carol
uh huh
Carol, OK, and uh I didn't want to say anything you know about
it to Gino and he suspected that I suspected something and he
got real, very upset with me and we argued over it and it is
something I didn't want to know either way because I just didn't,
I didn't want to no and Gino was real upset that night
does that, knowing that he was married does that explain the
secret about it, about his business and everything or do you
still feel there is something that there is something of a
mystery about it
I still feel there

because you did suspect at the time

It isn't that he was married, up until he died he had a wife

OK, I just wanted to make that clear. This is a very mysterious
situation and we are trying to get to the bottom of it all and
ther is only one way of doing it and that is to talk to people

some questions for us, but if there is anything else that you

mention it to me and he said that when you asked how Patrick was
I said fine and he was fine, I said why didn't you tell me that
he was in the hospital and Gino just made a joke out of it,
just because he was in the hospital he was still doing fine
and that is the way he passed it off. I thought that was kind
of odd that Gino wouldn't tell me that Patrick was in the
hospital

301-272-3145 and Wayne Ratcliff, employed at Greir Chevrolet,
Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, rented the rear portion of Gino's
building for a short period of time. They did body work
and operated under the business name of W & W Body Shop.
Allegedly they did some work for Gino. Although unconfirmed,
information has been received that Clayson stated Gino
always talked about being a hit man.
Ben Addison, the owner of J & J Furniture Refinishing, located
next door to Gino's, advised on Monday 8-2-76 he observed
three subjects in Gino's building. They had the door
opened and acted as if they belonged there. They loaded
some cars on the trailer which was being pulled by the brown
International truck owned by Gino. The trailer had "Horseless
Carriage Carrier" written on the side. Two White males
left Gino's in the truck and a black male followed them
operating an antique car.
On 08-13-76 Doris Duafala, Gino's girlfriend, was questioned
about whether she observed a vehicle following the truck
the day (Monday) she saw it traveling East on Route #40.
She stated she believed she saw a black guy operating an
antique car following the truck, but she is not real certain.
She further added that Gino had no black people working for
him. He hated black people because one was suppose to have
shot him accidently in the arm while in the Marines.
According to information received Gino was not seen at the
business very often. The place was not open all the time.
Up until a couple of months ago a person by the name of
Pat acted as a watchman. At the beginning of the year Gino
use to spend more time at the shop working. Lately more
expensive cars would be in the shop. Carrafa seemed to be
a nice guy. He wasn't a flashy dresser. He usually was in
work clothes. He didn't seem to be the drinking type. He
was friendly, but not too close.

In November 1967 Roselli came to Washington, D.C. where he
allegedly met two attorneys who were former FBI agents, several
senators, and an inspector of police who drive him to the air-
port. It is speculated that the inspector was Joseph Shiman.
This trip was, allegedly, for the purpose of straightening out
his immigration problems and it is of note that he was never
deported prior to his demise.
In December of 1967, following a Los Angeles Federal Grand Jury
probe into the cheating of card players at the Friar's Club,
Roselli was indicted along with Maurice Friedman, Manuel
(Ricky) Jacobs, Benjamin J. Teitelbaum, and a prominent Beverly
Hills physician. The indictment against the physician was
later dropped.

Telephone interview with Mrs. Carrafa wherein she relates that
Jay Knohl has possession of her husband's 1976 Suburban
station wagon, Maryland registration EPP 200, serial
#CCS166F161048, title %236101813.
Mrs. Carrafa further related that her husband carried the
titles to both '32 Lincolns in his attache case, as well as
the title for the Suburban; and her husband carried the attache
case everywhere. She feels that if her husband had received
$10,000 and gone on to Los Angeles he would have kept the
titles with him; however by Jay Knohl's advertising these two
'32 Lincolns for sale, she assumes that he now possesses the
titles and took them from Carrafa's attache case following:
his demise.

Writer contacted MSP Trooper Burns reference the three classical
cars reported stolen by CARRAFA on 07-22-76 to 07-23-76, and
he stated that CARRAFA refused a polygraph three times; and
CARRAFA told him that the reason was that he was into other
things. Burns feels that the theft of these vehicles was
staged by CARRAFA as he showed Burns one point of entry and
a United States Fidelity & Guarantee Insurance Adjustor another
point of entry. Burns also related that there were no tire
marks in the dirt road that led to Gino's Classical Car's
garage. USF & G adjustor is one Sharon Kohler, (301) 547-3569.
Burns noted that a vacationing Pennsylvania police officer, on
07-21-76, two days before the theft, observed a blue GMC Tractor
with a yellow trailer operated by two negro males at the Union
76 Truck Stop in Colesville, Pa. The truck was being followed
by a negro male in a maroon Rolls Royce. The yellow trailer
was loaded with six classical cars, a white over black Cadillac
a Mercedes, what appeared to be a Rolls Royce but could have
been the Packard and three other cars.
Lastly, Burns related that one Investigator Jones, Maryland
Motor Vehicle Administration, assisted CARRAFA in going into
business. Burns and Hones inspected Gino's numerous times and
found violations such as un-notarized titles, but Jones took no
enforcement action.

Baltimore reference the 29.0 mg % ethanol in Piccerelli's
liver reveals that this is the normal amount of ethanol pro-
duced by a decomposing liver; and if this was translated to
a blood-alcohol percentage it would only be .03%.
In essence, Janice Mae Piccerelli did not die of an overdose
of alcohol and/or tranquilizers.
