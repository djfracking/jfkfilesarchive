MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG
SUBJECT
Chief, DCD
Chief, LA Division
: Mitchell Livingston Werbel III
114003
i
i
.1. was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has been indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on 29 March
in Miami, Florida. The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantities of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial.
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was the defense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
Buffalo, New York in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA
General Counsel as a defense witness.
2. The Justice Department has received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.
11J
3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in
Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975. Bayard, reportedly an
associate of Werbel's, had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business
2 March.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
December 9, 1973
-
Period of
Interim Report
12/3/73 - 12/9/73
Resuits of the Inquiry:
The following people were contacted by the writer:
Jay Mallin (December 3, 1973.) Mallin states that to the
best of his knowledge there are only two groups known to be active in the
Abaco Movement--the group that Werbel (Mitchell Livingston Werbel III) is
associated with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown.
Brown is currently in Washington and is about to return to his home
which is in Boulder, Colorado. Mallin indicated that if anything were about
to occur Brown would certainly be in the Miami area.
Brown is a white American and an ex-Special Forces type. He has
formed a group of ex-Special Forces Specialists that in Mallin's opinion
"could really raise Hell.". Brown, according to Mallin, has been working for
Chuck Hall. However, Hall is also aligned with WerBel.
3.2

--- Image 104-10182-10072_page_107.jpeg ---
4-00000
there are a couple of { cks.
Hall is publishing a min raphed newsletter
:
under the name the Abaco Independent Movement.
Mailin indicated that, "the whites cannot do anything in Abaco
without everyone knowing about it."
There has been a series of thefts of weapons in the Bahamas and
Mallin believes that Black militants could possibly be involved. Mallin
further believes that there may in fact be a Black militant group operating in
the Abaco area.
Mallin stated that, "WerBel's bringing in of Colin Mitchell was just
a lot of noise." He went on to say Mitchell did not accomplish anything.
David W. Wike, Associate Security Director, University of Miami..
Wike has not heard of any unusual activity in the Bahamas. In answer to a
direct question from the writer Wike stated that the only member of the Uni-
versity community known to be travelling to the Bahamas frequently is a
student who is a suspected narcotics dealer. Also, no prominent Bahamian
personalities or members of their families are known to be attending the
University.
John L. Curtin, Cade County Public Safety Department. Curtin
states that, "the trouble has been building for the last six to eight months."
He believes a direct assault would have to be made on Nassau itself in
order to accomplish the desired objective of stopping the seizure of the
casinos. Curtin further stated that the Mafia has been "buying guns like
crazy." On. December 5, 1973, Curtin, was recontacted due to the fact that
he had dinner with a prominent Bahamian businessman who is known to be in
the lumber business. This businessman is white but is well liked by the
Blacks in the Bahamas. His identity is unknown to the writer.

?
Mallin states : all of the planning sessions r Brown's group
have been held in the living room of Mallin's Coral Gables home.
Brown's group is all white but he has been in contact with some of
the local Blacks in Abaco. The Blacks have had no formal training nor do
they possess the proper weapons for any sizable operation. In order to
obtain weapons and training the Blacks have made friendly overtures to Brown's
group.
Mallin stated that some of the local Blacks could move on their own
but he believes that it would be highly unlikely.
Mallin speculated that U.S. Mafia money may be being spent in the
Bahamas in order to finance the overthrow of Pindling's government to stop
the seizure of the casinos. He did not have any evidence to substantiate the
theory.
In answer to a direct question from the writer Mallin further commented
that Paul Bethal is totally out of the Abaco situation. Bethal's only role,
according to Mällin, was the one meeting he arranged for Werbel, Hall, a Michael
Lightbourne (Phonetic) and George Wackenhut. Bethal, Mallin further stated,
trys to give people the impression that he has very high level connections
including members of the National Security Council and that the prepares papers
and other briefings for the Council. Mallin states that this is not true, that
Bethal in fact has no such contacts.
Mallin went on to say that Werbel would not get involved with anything
that would jeopardize his U.S. government contracts especially the sale of
his silencer to the Army. In addition, according to Mallin, Werbel is a CIA
informant and would advise the Agency of his activities. On December 9, 1973,
Mallin was recontacted by the writer. Chuck Hall travels to Miami a great
deal and contacts Mallin when he does. Mallin said his last contact with Hall
was about two months ago. Hall's supporters are mainly white although

A
staffer
This business stated that, there is definite] increased activity
but that no specific date for any overt action has been mentioned.
This businessman believes that Mafia money is an important factor and
that Blacks will be hired to do the actual fighting if there is any fighting.
He views the casing issue as the crucial one. He believes Blacks who are
opportunistic will seize upon the casino issue to obtain weapons and money
from the Mafia and attempt to seize power.
Dr. David Cartano, Sociology Instructor, University of Miami.
Cartano was contacted due to his being a past member of the Institute for the
Study of Change. When he first became associated with the Institute he
was introduced by Mallin as being a Bahamian specialist.
Cartano could not contribute anything pertinent to this inquiry. He
has not renewed his contacts in the Islands in over one year's time. He does
have two Bahamian students in one of his classes but neither of them has
mentioned anything of any significance. He doubts their value as sources.
Gorden 0. Rothwell, Chief of Security, Sheraton Four Ambassadors
Hotel. Rothwell could not contribute anything pertinent to this inquiry. In
addition no prominent Bahamians are presently or have been recently in the
hotel.
W. Bruce Wrightson, Chief of Security, Sheraton Royal Biscayne
Hotel. No prominent Bahamians are presently or have been recently in the
hotel.
:
A confidential local law enforcement source indicated that
an attorney in West Palm Beach is selling automatic weapons. He is free
lancing and has a small warehouse with two separate alarm systems installed.
on the warehouse.

eral agents last December.
The guns, called "the largest
collection of private guns in the
world" by Mr. WerBell and
Federal attorneys, include 2,000
machine guns and silencers.
Mr. WerBell said his com-
pany, Defense Systems Interna
tional, Inc., would continue "toj,
do what we have always done!
-serve this country."
He said he and his sons have!
plans to sell radios, electronic:
equipment and military sup-ja
plies not covered by the agree-s
ment.

sure of protection from random
violence or he may find, if real
trouble starts, that in his isolation
he's utterly defenseless.
Unless, of course, he has planneŭ
ahead-as far ahead and as care-
fully as the originators of what one
can only call, for the moment, the
Abaco Plan (it remains to be seen
by events, of course, .hether the
Abaco planners were as wise and
prescient as they were farsighted
and careful). The originators of
the Abaco idea were the first to im:-
plement the urge to abandon Amer-
ica with a concrete design, includ
ing a destination, provision for per-
sonal and financial safety, monetary
reward and even a Utopian social
program. Though the men behind
Abaco are nearly the opposite of
the commune-seekers of the late
Sixties and early Seventies, their
objectives are much the same. They
seek a way out and a return to
fundamental values, but their most
fundamental value is the proposi
tion that each of them should be
many times a millionaire, untrou
bled by inflation.
By the time you read this, the
men of Abaco may have accom-
plished the first stages of their pro-
gram (in which case you will have
read about them in the newspa-

straight out of a Forsyth script:
the take-over of Abaco-an action
that will allow these men to get
themselves and their money profit-
ably out of the U.S.
To be sure, any resemblance to
popular fiction stops short with the
basic idea. Commando politics is
dead. It will no longer do to break
open a case of bootieg hand gre-
nades and storm the palace. In fact,
Abaco has no palace. What it does
have is six to seven thousand native
inhabitants who lead lives ranging
from quiet stagnation to mute
poverty.

ent. A top executive of Des modification, the tactics must be
different. Wer Bell's first assault on
Abaco has been psychological. With
ness, the citizens of Abaco are con-
vinced, step by step, that they must
become an independent nation; that
becoming an independent nation is
the greatest, most rewarding thing
in the whole wide worid; that it is
they, the citizenry of Abaco, who

a taste for irregular warfare as an
O.S.S. commando leader behind
Japanese lines in World War II,
Wer Bell is rumored to have taken
a hand in a long string of mini-
wars since then, from the South
China Sea to the Caribbean and the
Mediterranean. But Wer Bell frowns
on crass badinage, especially with
food. At Zeibert's the table talk is
mostly-about gastronomy today, in
part because the dill sours and soft-
shell crabs are truly remarkable, in
part because the host at the neigh-
boring table is Clifton Daniel, the
silver-haired Washington bureau
chief of The New York Times.
But by the time coffee and Cour-
voisier arrive, Daniel and his party
depart. WerBell lights a finely

lunch is all about. The island
is Abaco; not yet an inde

with close attention. "They finally
got the slips. They've already dis-
tributed half of them. They'll make
a one-spot run this weekend and see
how they score. They think it'll be
sixty to sixty-five percent."
"
No translation is needed. As the
Watergate tapes have demonstrat-
ed, men who share a secret scenario
come to share a secret language, as
if by osmosis. WerBell's remarks
reveal that he has had a long-dis-
tance conversation this morning
with one of his chief operatives on
Abaco, using a clear phone line-
i.c., a connection involving untapped
phone numbers. (If the conversa-
tion had not involved a key agent
on Abaco, and if the phone' had
been suspect, the conversation
would have been brief.)
The agent on the island—most
likely C. R. "Chuck" Hall, who has
served as WerBell's principal oper-
ative on Abaco during most of the
Summer of 1974--reported that the

devised by a prestigious U.S. opin-
ion-research firm, are to monito:
sentiment on Abaco in favor of in-
dependence-not just once, but
week by week, as WerBell's psywar
campaign unfolds.
Furthermore. WerBell learned
this morning that a test sampling
focused on a single Abaco settle-
ment, perhaps Marsh Harbour or
Fox Town, had been scheduled by
his agents on Abaco for the coming
weekend. The organizers expected
to poll between sixty and sixty-five
percent in favor of independence-
an impressive score, reflecting the
fact that the covert political cam-
paign of Wer Bell and Co. is in its
sixth month.

.
Professor von Mises, the longest-lived
(ninety-two), most prolific (nineteen
books) and least self-effacing economist
of the Austrian School founded by
Bohm-Bawerk, died in 1973 in New
York City (where he'd been teaching
since 1940) just as, after a half een-
tury of obscurity and neglect, his teach-
ings began to enjoy a renaissance here,
much the way Karl Marx came into
vogue in Eastern Europe at about the.
time the siege guns of the Red Army
became audible in the distance.-
'
Had more people listened to Von
Mises in time, there would be more gold
milionaires like Oliver today, and al-
though not many did, the professor's
tiny enteric of admirers often compared
him in epochal stature to Karl Marx-
a Marx of intraconservative capitalistic
convictions, of course.
Von Mises was a polymath and his
teachings are complex, but some of the
principal doctrines are not difficult to
grasp. Von Mises believed that human
freedom and laissez-faire capitalism
were one and the same thing. He had
passionate, sacramental faith in the
market, not as a mere institution-the
sort of vulgar "computer" seen by Key-
nestans which the government can tink-
er with whenever it needs to—but as a
metaphysical process which regulates
all human affairs. Much as one cannot
hope to fix a fine watch with a bung
starter, Von Mises was convinced that
government could not intervene in eco.
nomic affairs, in the providential work-
ings of the market, without causing
damage. "Interventionism" was a self-
defeating, vicious circle: the first gov-
ernmental intrusion into business neces-

worst consequences of the second; then
a fourth intervention to alleviate the

Chaos and tyranny-that is
Mike Oliver foresaw as early as
the inevitable result of America's "in-
terventionis:" and "collectivist" fiscal
debauchery. That he made millions of
dollars in cold profits along the way did
not really reassure Oliver, it merely
confirmed his premonitions. Of course,
the protits helped: to people who tend
to think in terms of moles--that is
most of us-they seemed to prove that.
Oliver had something.
To tell the world what he had, Oliver
wrote a book in 1968: A New Consti-
tution for a New Country, Printed
· privately, never noticed in a book re-
view, written in pedestrian declaratory
style, the book has thus far sold 19,400
copies through the mail-proving that'
there does exist that contradictory
thing, a genuine underground best
seller.
The subtitle on the cover reads: "Has
the Time Come To Abandon the United
States?" Oliver's answer is
is a firm
"Yes." The book tells why, and how.
"The United States can no longer be
saved from severe crisis. . . . Though
not yet under complete tyranny, preva-
lence of totalitarian ideas and increased
use of suppressive measures prove that
the end of freedom is in sight: [in
America]: *. . [Only] those who ar
[Only] those who ar-
range for a timely departure will es-
cape the coming horror."
The book is not a tract; it's a plan of
action. If Ludwig von Mises is indeed
the Karl Marx of monetary libertarian-
ism, and Harry Browne, the best-selling
author who invented Peter Panic, per-
haps its Bakunin, its prolific pan-de-

"The person with self-respect has a

Oliver's book reassures the reader. "But

providentially, at this critical june-
ture in mid-1974. Michael C. Oliver,
in associatior with Mitche!! Wor
Bell, offers the driven rich an alter-
native: not just some backcountry
hidey-hole, but citizenship and resi-
dence in an entirely new country; a
newborn commonwealth wholly ded-
icated to the protection of private
wealth and the survival—indeed,
the reriral of the classic free-
enterprise system.
Long before the Dow hit the five
hundreds, and coffee went up to
fifty cents a cup, long before old
people began eating dog food and
farmers dumping their calves into
ditches, Mike Oliver foresaw that
the free-enterprise economy was
doomed in America: It sounded
strange at first, coming from Mike
Oliver, this single-minded belief in
a man whose daimon senses a chal-devaluation, decline and fall, for in
lenge. "You have a good point, a
small point but a good point. 'Just'
and 'fair' are only words until
somebody decides what they are
supposed to mean. On Abaco, I will
decide. That's the big point, isn't
it?"

is what that stands for) and special
personnel drawing contract pay on

meant to enforce what Mike Oliver
considers just and fair and desir-
able. Ted Roussos knows it, too; he
resigns from the project the day
after the luncheon meeting. But no
one else does. Why should they?
Mike Oliver is here, after all, not
just as the founder and constitu-
tional creator of a perfectly seri-
ous American new-country move-
ment, but in representation of a
powerful syndicate of financial
backers. It is, above all, Oliver who
is making independence an immi-
nent reality for the citizens of
Abaco, most of whom have never
heard his name.
But among the driven, troubled,
questing financiers of America,
Oliver is more than a name. To
many business leaders he's a mira-
cie worker, a minor prophet on the
crumbling walls of the city, a far-
sighted sentry registering the ap-
proach of the forces of darkness.

the mid-Sixties the dollar was still
the fixed star of the economic firma-
ment, the U.S. economý was boom-

very embodiment of the American
dream of success: a European im-
migrant to the U.S. at eighteen, he
had made his first million by thirty
(real-estate development, construc-
tion) and 1965 saw him living on a
charming wooded estate in Nevada
with a pretty wife named Betty and
three lively children. Approaching
fifty, Oliver was the president of
several medium-sized corporations,
a settled, induential community
leader and the employer of a ray-
ishingly beautiful secretary named
Vicky Jo Todd, who was crowned
Miss Nevada in 1970. Yet for al-
most ten years, where other busi-
nessmen and economists saw only
progress and prosperity. Oliver di
vined a long-range trend toward de-
pression and disaster.
Worldwide travel and an intense
reading of economics helped con-
vince him by 1965 that, as he told
a visitor years later. "They're go- .
ing to screw up the money." He
felt certain that debauchery of the
dollar would lead to political crisis,
inflation, and ultimately to some
sort of dictatorship.
"Once I saw that the dollar was
kaput, that whatever the govern-
ment did would only make matters
worse. I dumped my stocks and
bonds and switched to a strong
position in gold coins. Everyone

All three inviduals reported their involvement with the WerBell group
and had sought guidance from the Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with Wer Bell. On 27. June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in
the effort to bring: Abaco's secession. In September 1974 WerBell
reportedly went to Greece to sell arms to the Greek Government.
Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's
Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Fifth Amendment
on the question of whether or not he had supplied arms to Robert Vesco.

In Powder Springs, Georgia, where
Col. Bayard is sweating five special per

popeyed from the jabbing of rapid-fire
recuils, the colonel and his boys, whose

of the sort used by golfers, they roll si-

the WerBell estate, up to the manor
house where they draw "midmorning

can biscuits, cold milk in fourteen-ounce
classes. Then it's down to the rifle
range for three hours of marksmanship
instruction with a remarkable training
device devised by Wer Bell himself: a
standard 7.62 N.A.T.O. military rifle
converted to fire 22 long-rifle cartridges.

The lawyer begins with the usual
question about Abaco as a potential tax
shelter, and Oliver fields it with prac
ticed ease.

he says. "It's a tax-free nation. Have
you read any of our planning papers?

SUBJECT: Press Reports of Ex-CIA Employees Involvement with
Persons under Congressional Investigation
1. Press reports of Sentator Lowell P. Weicker's investigation of
CIA's involvement with other government agencies surfaced the contact
of Lucien Conein of DEA, a former employee, with an electronic manu-
facturer named Michael Morrisey. The same reports have also tied
Morrisey with a Mr. Mitchell L. WerBell, III, who, according to our
files, has claimed United States Government and CIA connections in
the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked the Fifth Amend
ment when appearing before Senator Jackson's Subcommittee investigating
DEA on whether or not he supplied arms to Robert Vesco. Also, while
not mentioned in the press, at least one retired CIA staffer and possibly:
two others may have been involved with Conein and Morriscy.
staffer is John P. Muldoon, a friend of Conein's, who currently is a
private security specialist who has dealt with Morrisey in the purchase
of audio sweeping devices for his business. Muldoon was retained by
WerBell during first half of 1974. The other two, Walter J. Mackeṁ,.
an acquaintance of Conein's, and a Theodore J. Roussos, both of whom
were in contact with WerBell for possible employment in a scheme to
promote the secession of the Bahamian Island of Abaco, an enterprise
publicized in February 1975 issue of Esquire by Andrew St. George.

2. We have no information in our files on the B. R. Fox Company
or the Fox Company principals mentioned in the press accounts.
We were,
however, told by DEA that Mr. Sandy Smith, Time magazine reporter,
was working on a story to the effect that the late Bernard Spindel, former
owner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in "wire tapping for
the Teamsters Union and providing explosive devices for organized crime."
Although Mr. Smith did not allege that either CIA or DEA were associated
with the Fox Company or Spindel, our DEA source said that Mr. Smith had
no intention of dropping the story and we can expect further press coverage.
3. In conclusion, there has been no CIA involvement with the
B. R. Fox Company or with Michael Morrisey. Moreover, Mr. WerBell's
claims of CIA affiliation or support over the years are simply not true.

SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910)
25 January 1975
1. Mitchell Livingston Wer Bell, who appeared in recent press
reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a
representative of the United States Government and of CIA. The facts
do not support this contention.
2. CIA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted
General Cabel indicating knowledge of Cuban and Dominican affairs.
Mr. Thomas J. Flores of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell
and considered using him as an Fl asset. A POA was granted on
7 July 1959 for this purpose. By October. 1959 it was apparent that he
did not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked
upon his association with CLA as a means of furthering his various
business schemes. All contact was then severed.
3. From that time until the present Mr. Wer Bell has cropped up
in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections
or support. He was reported to have been involved in arms sales to
Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain
South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an
abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti in 1966. He also turned
up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purporting to be a counter-
insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
queried the Agency re Mr. WerBell, asking if Wer Bell had a contractual
agreement or association with the Agency, as Werbell was awaiting a hearing
before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in
the aboritve Haiți învasion. The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request
intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which
DoD revoked because of his Haitian caper. He was told this, could not bel
done. In 1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to sell arms!
1973 he was under investigation by U.S. Treasury Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Customs Service for activities
relating to possible mercenary activities in Abaco Island, Baḥamas. In
this connection WerBell contacted three ex-CIA employees, John P. Muldoon,
Walter J. Macker and Theodore Roussos in a scheme to involve therp inj
the activities of an organization called the Friends of Abaco (POA) which is
advocating the secession of the island from the Commonwealth of Bahamas.

won't be. Whatever services private
business can provide competitively will
be left to private enterprise."
"Like the police" the lawyer smiles.
"There's a cute deal-if you don't pay
your premiums, they can't arrest you
for overtime parking.”
"Well, no. Not really," says Oliver.
"They can't arrest you for overtime
parking anyhoir, because this govern-
ment won' have the right to tell you
how long you should stop your car at
the curb why should it! But if you're
guilty of force or fraud, you'll be ar-
rested whether you are a paid-up par-
ticipant or not. What a nonparticipant
won't have will be the right to conduct
civil litigation, to set up a surrogate
trust, to collect damages on a tort, and
so forth."
"What sort of a government will it'
be, anyhow?" asks Bond. "I mean as an
organization. How will it be run?"
"Well, in some ways it'll run just like
the government here," says Oliver.
"Just like the U.S: Government. The
constitution calls for a bicameral legis
"lature. An assembly elected on a pro-
portional basis and a senate. And there,
you see, the similarity stops. Abaco will
have no foreign. service like the State
Department, only trade representatives
in countries where business demands it.
It will have no public school system.
Beyond the fourth grade, there'll be
only private schools, privately main-
tained."
"No school system,” says the lawyer.
"Why not?"
"Because what is called the school
system in the United States is really an
indoctrination system," says Oliver.
"It's a system for bureaucrats to brain-
wash young people in favor of collec-
tivism and statism."
"And socialisin," says Bond approv-
ingly.
---
"Yes. In the high schools and col-
leges, in favor of outright socialism,"
says Oliver. "This is not to say Abaco
won't have an educational system of its
own kind, but every school will have to
be financed privately, by the families of
the students or private benefactors. It
will mean, here and there, some hard-
ship, some long-term borrowing, maybe
- and that will be made feasible at very
low interest, I expert-but collectively
it will mean the survival of freedom in
its one essential provenance-in the
minds of the next generation. Because,
you see." Oliver holds his bony finger
before his face to silence all interrup-
tions, "Abaco is not joing to be another
banana republic. That's not the point: 1
wouldn't spend an hour's time just to
make some money that way. The pant
is that the Republic of Abaco will be,
first of all, a moral experiment, a piner
where we'll try to keep individual frit
dom alive even if it doesn't survive in
America."
“But won't you need an army?
Bond doubtfully.
"Oh, sure, Abaco will have its armed
forces,” says Oliver, “We will call them,

Cher was with Sonny. They were al-
really separated but Geffen didn't
know this: he promptly fell in love. In
September of 1973, the only date in his
life that he remembers with any ac..
curacy, Geffen, Rb Dylan and Robbie
Robertson of The Band went to see
Neil Young's show at Geffen's club,
the Roxy. A friend told him Cher was
alone and wanted to join them. "Cher
said. Let's get together for dinner,'
and we were never apart since," says
Geffen with a small preen in his voice.
After the taping of the last Sonny and
Cher show, David and Cher surfaced
together at the Grammy Awards. That
produced the. famous butterfly-emer-
gent picture of Cher, bare midriffed, in
white with a butterfly over one ear
and another in her cleavage, and a
shaved-for-the-occasion Geffen, in his
sharpie tux; on her arm. It was Cher
who talked him into the Corniche Rolls
with the wire wheels. Cher who threw
out all his shirts and dressed him. And
now because of Cher and their mutual
psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Grotjahn, he
can go into this boutique on the Strip
and have the two $345 suede jackets
fitted and ask if they have a third so
he will have one in every possible
color.

While Cher brought him to this
California ostentation and flat-out
American exuberance, Ahmet Ertegun
influenced Geffen in another way. Ahniét
was so composed in his power, so re-
laxed at handling the totally wrecked
rock stars who'd come crashing off

of his dignified back and expect to he

Ahmet, at a time when they still expect
to be cochair men of the Atlantic/Asylum

back to the time when he had gone to
Ahmet in 1968. It was the second or
third time they'd met, and Geffen, then
managing Laura Nyro and supporting
them both, was broke and trying to sell
Ahmet an artist. Ahmet asked what it
would take to keep Gelen going for a
year. Geffen said fifty thousand dollars,
naming the figure he had been making
when he ran the Ashley Famous music
department, the figure that represented
wealth to him when he was a busboy
in the Catskills and being rich meant
having a Cadillac and living on Ocean
Parkway. "If you earned fifty thou-
sand dollars a year, that was the most
any man could possibly ask for, and
that was my goal, Ertegun took out

The official. Lurion Conein, had cone
to the firm last spring to inspect cine
tronic surveillance equipment that DEA
wanted to purchase, according to
agency spokesman, Robert H. Felkamp.
Concin and a second 'DEA official; Cyril
Frank, also observed a demonstration
of the explosive equipment but did not
buy any of it, according to Feldkamp.
A cataloque of equipment apparently

several devices designed to carry ex:

The catalogue states. "The devices have
been designed and tactured for sale

States government, specifically intended
for application outside of this country...
The information contained herein is

government use only. The handbug and

Feldkamp said that Con and Frank
observed a demonstration of "several”
devices although Feldkamp said he did
not know which devices they saw. Concin,
a former employer of the Cential inteli
gence Agency, is acting chief of special
operations and field support for the DEA's
office of intelligence. Feldkamp said that
Concin's office is the operational arm of
the intelligence'duation and devises ways
to penetrate Heralding operations.
"
'Conein was not available for comintent.
Feldkamp said that Frack said empat
cally that the demonstration was not re-
quested."
Conein's reaction to the demonstration,
Feldkamp sand, was, "Very interesting.
However, that's not why..I'm here.'" Asked
why the demonstration was made by the
salesman, whom Feldkamp said he could
not identify. Feldkamp replied, "Like any
good salesman, the guy was trying to
make a sale. He was told EHA has not.

He said Werbell would probably call him from Athens that
weekend and he would give Werbell a final negative reply.
Werbell planned to meet with Greek Defense Minister
Averoff. Roussos said that if the U.S. wanted to stop
this deal that we should contact Averoff directly.
From what Werbell said, Roussos believes the arms
requested by the Greeks would be for guerrillas and
not main force units.

wanted Roussos to be his advisor in this venture and to
go to Athens. Werbell indicated that the total deal could
reach $5,000,000. Roussos told Werbell that he would
check with his "friends" (the Agency) before giving
Werbell an answer. Werbell asked Roussos to see if his
"friends" were in favor of such arms deals or not. Roussos
had generally explained this call to me on the telephone
on 29 August. My reaction on the telephone was negative
-to Roussos' participation in such a deal, and he had
conveyed this negative reply to Werbell by telephone
before Roussos and I met personally on 31 August.

2. During our personal meeting, Roussos explained
that Werbell intended to pursue arms sales legally and
He said that
via the required U.S. Government channels.
Werbell does have the capabilities to design and produce
weapons because of his access to arms factories. I told
Roussos that Werbell's business activities were his own
concern. I strongly advised against his getting involved
in this deal. I explained to him the problems which the
U.S. Government was having in Greece and the current wave
of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.
If Roussos as a former CIA officer well known in Greece
became involved in such a venture, a flap of substantial
proportions was likely complete with widespread press
play. Roussos understood and agreed not to get involved.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Director of Central Intelligence
VIA:
SUBJECT:
Deputy Director for Operations
Mitchell Livingston Werbell III
:
1. Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, who served briefly
with the OSS in WWII, has been engaged for the past several
years in arms dealings and swash-buckling promotional
activities which have brought him to the attention of various
government agencies. He has always remained within the
law by a fine edge. His latest scheme involves a Movement
for the Independence of Abaco, an island to the East of the
Bahamas. For this he has obtained apparently substantial
financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British
Lord.
2.
'
Werbell operates through a number of front businesses
in Washington, D.C. and in Marietta, Georgia, where he owns
'one outfit named Central Information Agency (CIA). In all
his dealings, Werbell broadly hints that he has current
connections with the Agency. We have just learned that
Werbell may be in possession of a one-line note from you.
stemming from a chance meeting with you at an OSS alumni
dinner, reading something like "good to see you again."
-
3. Three retired Agency employees are currently employed
by Werbell in various capacities. This past spring these
employees sought contact with the Agency basically to report
their concern over the legality of Werbell's activities. We
quickly established that the matter was outside our charter
and asked these retirees to report directly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. We also furnished the Bureau with
all the pertinent information in our files. It is to be
noted that somewhere in Werbell's scheme of things there
appears the ubiquitous Andrew St. George, who plans to write
a story on Abaco for True magazine.

·MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Telephone Call from John MULDOON
=
-
1. Approximately 1655 hours, 13 August 1974, a call
was received on C/WH/7's extension, 351-4221 by the Secre-
tary, Miss Annamarie Ruppert. She answered the extension
by number and the male voice asked to speak to Mr. McTighe.
The secretary asked who was calling and the caller replied
"John MULDOON." The secretary then replied that she was
sorry but Mr. McTighe couldn't be reached. In response to
MULDOON'S query, "Why not?" and before the secretary could
reply, MULDOON became obstinate and asked who he was speak-
ing to. Miss Ruppert replied "his secretary" and then
added that Mr. McTighe was away. When MULDOON asked where
he was, the secretary replied that she was not at liberty
to discuss that. Then MULDOON asked to speak to McTighe's
deputy and was told that there was no one around whom
MULDOON .could speak to. (C/WH/7 was on leave and AC/WH/7
was in the PMC meeting.) MULDOON apparently didn't believe
this reply but then asked when McTighe was expected to
return. The secretary replied "within a few weeks"
(McTighe is on TDY) and then asked if she could take a
message to give to McTighe upon his return. MUL DOON
became belligerent at this point, apparently thinking he
was getting the run around' and replied, "just tell him
to talk to Jack Anderson" and hung up.
2. AC/WHD was briefed on the above telephone call at
1740 hours, 13 August. He decided no action should be taken
on 13. August, but would like to meet with C/WH/7, Al Spera,
on 14 August.
3. At 0950 hours, the following met with AC/WHD:
Mr. Natzke, Mr. Wedemeyer, Mr. Spera and Miss Lehman. In
view of C/WHD's previous decision that no further Agency
contact should be made with MULDOON, RUSSOS, or MACKEM it
was decided that no one would return MULDOON's call. How-
ever, AC/WHD would brief ADDO, Mr. Blee, on the above threat,
and WH/7 would ask OPS/LIAISON to telephonically pass to the
FBI the fact that MULDOON again contacted the Agency and
threatened to go to "Jack Anderson. A copy of this memoran-
dum is being sent to OPS/LIAISON for this purpose.

Reference is made to TOFIRDB-315/07634-74,
dated 10 August 1974, which reported on the growing
concern of the Bahamian Government about renewed
secessionist activity in Abaco. In addition to the
information in reference, the official Bahamian
service, which was the source of the above report,
also provided a representative of this Agency on 7
August 1974, the following text of a memorandum it
prepared for the Secretary of the Bahamian Cabinet:
"Please be advised that on 3 August
1974, information has been received from
our overseas contacts that Chester
ZOCHOWSKI, alias Chester GARY, has recently
been in touch with Mitchell L. WERBELL, and
has reported that WERBELL is still planning
unspecified revolutionary activity in Abaco.
It is also reported that he has the support
of some former U.S. Government employees
and that he is trying to recruit a former
Special Services officer to promote revolu-
tionary activity in Abaco (the name of
Robert ARMSTRONG has been put forward as a
possibility). There is also a suggestion
that Robert VESCO might be financing some
of the activity.'

2. The "overseas contact" described above was
identified by the Bahamian Service as the British
MI-5 representative in Washington, D.C. The Bahamian
Service did not identify the "U.S. Government employees"
referred to above.

Associate General Counsel
SUBJECT
: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III
1. As you are aware, on the instruction of United States.
District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to
the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject
for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-
nation was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government..
This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the
jury.
2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency
contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding
non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a
* formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency. Sheres
subsequently returned the affidavits to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

possible use in October 1959. From December 1965 to November
1966, Ferbell contacted this Agency's Domestic Collection.
Divisior in Coral Gables, Florida to voluntarily offer infor-
mation.
6. Serbell has been assessed as an unscrupulous wheeler-
dealer, a promotor of grandiose schemes, a man who lives beyond
This means, and a high pressure advertising and promotion man.
He has repeatedly misrepresented himself as both an employee
of the U.S. government and the CIA. As an arms dealer, he has
been involved with numerous Latin American governments and exile
groups since the late 1950'e and is now involved in Bahaman af-_
fairs. In 1969, he was in Thailand, attempting to sell the
government arms and a program to neutralize the communist threat
in that country.
7. Werbell operated a public relations firm in Atlanta which
went into bankruptcy in 1959. He subsequently became Vice Presi-
dent and Director of Research and Development of SIGNICS, Inc.
of Atlanta, Georgia and later became a partner in Defense Systems
International of Powder Springs, Georgia.

news. Flores and WER BELL discussed the Dominican
Republic and Cuba. On 3 August Flores phoned
WER BELL and told him that his clearance had not
been granted and that he should not predicate his
activities on the expectation of the clearance at
any given time. WER BELL said that the Pedraza,
group was air lifting and dropping material into
Cuba.
h. A 9 September 1959. Memorandum for the
Record signed by T. J. Flores reported that
WER BELL called Flores on 9 September 1959 to
provide information on Cuba. He was told by
Flores that his clearance had not yet been

'
i. According to a 23 September 1959
Memorandum for the Record signed by T. J. Flores,
WER BELL called Flores on 9 September 1959 to
ask if his clearance had come through since
he wanted the Agency to finance his trip to
the Dominican Republic. He was told it had
not. WER BELL told Flores about some people
who had been discussing the counterfeiting
of U. S. dollars and Cuban pesos for use in
connection with Cuban revolutionary activities.
He was told by Flores to contact the FBI. On
13 September WER BELL had phoned Flores at home
to say that the FBI had referred him to the
Secret Service on the counterfeiting aspect,
and that no one seemed particularly interested
in the gun running. The Secret Service asked
him to go to Miami at his own expense to obtain
further information on the matter and WER BELL
asked Flores' advice. Flores said that he could
not influence him one way or the other since he
was not in a position to direct his activities,
but felt he might be better off to take no action.
He was told that Flores would be in touch with
him as soon as he had any further information
concerning our possible use of him..

approved by the Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before
Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of the transcript
of that proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court
for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced.

methods under the "SWP case criteria" and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O on the evening of 1 September. These processed
documents were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on
2 September.
4. The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0830 hours on
2 September that I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency
files on Werbell, had culled them as to possible "Brady" documents
and was prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.
He was on the bench with a tight schedule and asked that the possible
Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy
Act request (Tabs A and B of OS response), consisting of media
publications and security investigative data, were also provided
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's
use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, a declassified copy
of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's
use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The
related OS Headquarters assignment document was not provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership of Venus by the "JURE"
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but not made available.
5. While the above documents were provided the Department of
Justice with the understanding they could be passed to Counsel for
Werbell due to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady" documents without consultation and instructions

15. WER BELL was also the subject of two memorandums
signed by Lawrence R. Houston. Mr. Houston, answering a
request from Joseph J. Liebling, Deputy Assistant Secretary
of Defense, on 23 February 1971, denied WER BELL's alleged
affiliation, with the CIA. On 28 October 1971, Mr. Houston
wrote Mr. David H. Henretta, Jr., of the Industrial Security
Clearance Review Division, to return notarized Interrogatories
previously sent by Mr. Henretta.

articles reporting his death which were forwarded by the FBI.

11. In December 1965 WER BELL contacted a Miami DCD
asset and told him that he and six Cuban exiles in the 11. S.
had organized a group, including approximately 20 Cubans
inside Cuba, to perform a commando operation in Cuba during
early January 1966.. Their primary mission was the assassination
of Fidel Castro, with the secondary mission of blowing up the
WER BELL,
generators that supply electricity to Havana, Cuba.
at the time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light"
from CIA to proceed with the mission, and inferred that the
mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.
12.
On 7 February 1966 the Miami office of the FBI
reported that KER BELL had been in contact with various news
agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro,
and reportedly also had discussed the plan with Mr. Richard
Phillips, Public Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington,
D.C. WER BELL claimed to have a group of some 500 men infiltrated
into Cuba and said that they were ready for action to overthrow
the regime immediately following the assassination of Castro.
According to the FBI, WER BELL gave the impression that he is.
acquainted with many high government officials, both in the U. S.
and other countries, and implied that his assassination plan
had been approved by CIA.
13. According to a memorandum in WER BELL's file, on 7
February 1968, one Bruce Arman Baker telephoned an employee
of this Agency and said he had been in contact with WER BELL.
Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing
business and delivered them by air throughout the world.
Mr. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for
CIA. Mr. Baker said that he understood from WER BELL that he
would have to get a CIA security clearance to fly for WER BELL.
Baker said that he was afraid that his past smuggling record
might keep him from getting a CIA clearance.

9. On 22 July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may
be in possession of a one-line note from former CIA Director
William Colby stemming from a chance meeting with the Director
at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to see
you again." This note was apparently used by WER BELL to
suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-

6. Mr. Muldoon contacted Agency employee E. James
McTighe on 22 May 1974. Mr. Muldoon told Mr. McTighe
that he was nominal Vice President of a Washington-based:
firm called "Security Consultants International." He presented
Mr. McTighe with a report, containing the essential data he
possessed concerning WER BELL and other members of FOA whom
he had met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington, D.C. According
to Mr. Muldoon, WER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming
casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering
to the U. S. tourist crowd. As a consequence of some run-in
with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL
is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his
ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence.
Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions WER BELL
made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated
with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of
its independence. On several occasions, WER BELL introduced
Mr. Muldoon and Mr. Roussos as active Agency officials, implying
that either the Agency or the United States Government supported
the aims of the FOA. WER BELL also proposed to Messrs. Muldoon.

involving a visit to Abaco; to determine the feasibility of
Abaco's independence in political and economic terms. The
study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior
to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in
Abaco on 28 June 1974. In default of the collaboration of
either Muldoon or Roussos, WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph
Macken, a former Agency friend of both Muldoon and Roussos.
According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted
the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the
activities of the FOA. Mackem was informed that the case
comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official

Mitchell Livingston WERBELL III, the principal
owner of the arms manufacturing firm Defense Systems.
International and an international arms dealer, has been
encouraging a group of Bahamian citizens on the island
of Abaco who seek to secede from the Bahamian Commonwealth.
In this affair WERBELL has been collaborating with a
group based in Miami called the "Friends of Abaco."
Active in the Friends of Abaco is Michael OLIVER, a wealthy
land developer residing at 2089 El Rancho Drive, Carson City,
Nevada. OLIVER, a naturalized U. S citizen, was born
Moses OLITSKI on 11 December 1928 in Lithuania.
4. In encouraging persons in Abaco to seek
independence of Nassau, OLIVER's apparent motive is to
establish a prototype government based on principles of
free enterprise expounded in a paperback book which he
has authored called "A New Constitution for a New Country"
(Fine Arts Press, Reno, Nev. - 1968). WERBELL, on the
other hand, has privately expressed a desire to establish
a tourist mecca on Abaco to include hotels, recreation
facilities and gambling casinos. Officials of Holiday
International, a Baltimore firm specialized in recreation
and health spas, have been briefed by WERBELL and OLIVER
recently on the Abaco movement. Robert A. C. HAMILTON,

Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution
in behalf of the Abaco Independence Movement on the floor
of the British House of Lords, following conversations
with WERBELL in Washington in late May.
5. Despite the seeming innocence of the enterprise,
however, we have observed that WERBELL, in particular,
has made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly
affiliated with this Agency in the activities of the
Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.
On several occasions, involving at least two former
officers of this organization, MULDOON and ROUSSÖS cited
above, WERBELL has introduced them as presumably active
Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply, according
to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the
United States Government supports the aims of the
Friends of Abaco.
6. Most recently, WERBELL has proposed to both
retired officers in separate conversations that they
conduct a study, involving a visit to Abaco, to determine
the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and
economic terms. The study would include interviews with
citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on
independence to take place in Abaco on 28 June 1974.
To be included in the investigation is research on the
probable reaction in the United Nations Organization to
a petition from political groups in Abaco for support on
independence, notably any parallels to be found in
precedents such as the Biafra secession from Nigeria.
7. Andrew ST. GEORGE, a nationally known free-lance
writer, has become active in WERBELL's organization and
claims to be preparing an article on WERBELL and the
Abaco movement for publication" in True Magazine.
ST. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that
WERBELL, OLIVER and their associates have had with the
two retired Agency officers, Mr. John MULDCON and
Mr. Ted ROUSSOS.

Memorandum for the Record
Subject: Agency Retiree's Involvement with
Abaco Independence Group
44 Ming 74
1. Through the intermediary of Robert Brown, DC/EA,
and retired staffer Jack "Red" Stent, I was put in touch
on 22 May 1974 with John MULDOON, another retired staffer
who is now nominal vice-president of a Washington-based
firm called "Security Consultants International."
Muldoon made the contact with me apparently on the
advice of Bob Brown and Red Stent whose counsel he
sought in an effort to protect himself from the possible
implications of his involvement with a group promoting.
the independence of the Bahamian Commonwealth island of
Abaco. We met at 1100 hours at "Tony's" on L street
and 18th N.W. in downtown Washington. Red Stent was:
there to introduce me to Muldoon but he did not participate
in the discussion.
2. Muldoon presented me with a typewritten report
containing the essential data he possessed concerning
a group of individuals with whom he had met on Friday,
17. May 1974 in Washington. Attending the meeting with
Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchell WERBELL III (aka
"Mitch Three"), Lord and Lady BELLHAVEN (alleged British
peers), Mike OLIVER (a wealthy electronics tycoon of
European, possibly French, origin who currently resides
in Carson City, Nevada), Howard HANDELMAN (Washington
correspondent of "U.S. News and World Report"), Renee
(lnu) (the evening's object of Werbell's seemingly
voracious affections) and an employe of the Library of
Congress whom Muldoon chose not to identify to me.
a subsequent meeting on Monday, 20 May 1974, Muldoon
had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew St.
GEORGE who is also involved with WERBELL in the Abaco
independence enterprise. The Werbell group is known
as the "Friends of Abaco" (already documented as such
in our files).

from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay and
defendante subsequently rested their case. The DOJ had little else
to add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3 Sept: mber.
The remaining copies of Agency documents were returned to Headquarters
by the undersigned the evening of 3 September. On 4 September the
=
jury returned a verdict of "not guilty." As a result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents on Werbell was not provided to
counsel for Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.
It should be noted all copies of documents taken to Miami were excised
in accord with the "SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,
these were destroyed by the undersigned.
6. As a related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Interna! Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned
seeking background information on Werbell. The undersigned suggested.
Egbert first review the files of the FBI on Werbell as most of the data
we have is contained in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient.
for his needs I suggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office
of Security via the normal DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

3. Island of Abaco From available file
information we know that Abaco is a small island at the
north end of the Bahamas archipelago a short distance..
off the Florida coast, which was populated in 1785 by
British Loyalists and their Black slaves fleeing the
United States following independence. The island remains
about 50% white. Openly apprehensive in anticipation of
the Bahamas' independence from Great Britain, the residents
of Abaco, both white and black, have found themselves
since independence - the object of apparent antagonism
and administrative neglect on the part of the Pindling
government, which has fueled talk of secession from
Nassau rule. This talk has been institutionalized in an
indigenous organization headed by a white, Charles "Chuck"
HALL, and called the Abaco Independence Movement (AIM).
HALL is a resident of Marsh Grove, the country cross roads
which poses as the metropolitan capital of Abaco; he
frequently visits Miami where he meets with Werbell.

WERBELL was a member of OSS in the Far East during World
War II where, according to Muldoon, he came to know the
Director and Lou Conein. Werbell currently a resident
of Atlanta, now is president of an international arms
peddling firm called Defense Systems International (DSI).
in addition to industrial security systems, according to
MULDOON, DSI sells automatic weapons (including a minia-
ture machine pistol with a silencer) and bomb-booby trapped
items of various sorts (e.g., a tennis ball with a fuse.
which is automatically activated when you stop playing)

5. Muldoon took some pains to gain reassurance that
he would not be pinpointed by Werbell as the source of
this information if any action were taken on it. I
assured him that, apart from the particular incident on
17 May 1974, the general outlines of WERBELL and his
activities and aspirations for Abaco have already been
reported by two or three other sources. Since there is
nothing the Agency can plausibly do at this juncture.
about WERBELL's apparent effort to con his supporters
into thinking that the CIA was backing the Abaco.

to make his side of this story a matter of record and
let it go at that.

6. To cap off the story, Red Stent invited us to
lunch at the Class Reunion on Eye Street and 18th. When
Muldoon and I arrived to meet Stent we found him ensconced
at a corner table with three other people. Red rushed
over to inform us that he would be introducing me as a
colleague of his from AEROJET. He then presented me to
WERBELL, Werbell's date Patricia BOTOND and Cecil BROWNLOW.
of "Aviation Weekly. WERBELL, looking for all the world
"
like Jerry Colonna, was intent on the task of seducing
Miss BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention
for the Atlantic Union organization, a political enterprise
which is an offshoot of the World Federalists Movement.
Miss BOTOND, as it turned out was reared in Shanghai, China,
at the same time as Stent. Red had attended school with
her brother the German School in Shanghai. Miss BOTOND

had been expelled from the German school in the late 1930s
for having had anti-Nazi doodles in her copybook.
Brownlow had helped Red obtain aerial photos of the
ChiCom consulate compound in Geneva in the early 1960s
when Red was stationed in Paris. When Werbell had
wearied of the reminisences of Stent and Botond and had
managed to hustle his prey off to a private table, Stent
revealed to BROWNLOW that I was not AEROJET but CIA.
Fortunately my name was mumbled at the introduction so that
no one could have repeated it. No one in fact seemed
interested.
