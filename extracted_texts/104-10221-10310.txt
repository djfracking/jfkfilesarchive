INTRODUCTION In Reference B JUWAVE forwarded a review
the nature of its relationship with AMCARDON=2 This review
indicates that the relationship with ALICARDON=2 evolved from that
action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security
breach would not occur as a result of an invostigation which was
bolag carried out by the Identity 1 relative to tho fact that the
stablishment of the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT
South Campus as a result of security restrictions which wero in som
way
y related to JÚDUSK. -While the relationship with AMCARDON-2
stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis
tuation, tbo ostablishment of a working relationship with the
Identity 3 was an objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain
As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made
that JLWAVE be given approval to contact the major South Florida
news media, in an attempt to work out a relationship with these news
media which would insuro that they did not, turn the publicity:
spotlight on those KUDARK activities in South Florida which might
come to their attention Thus, when a relationship was established
with AMCARDON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE
might be able to use this contact at the Idontity 3 as a means of
achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3
which would simultaneously insure the security of JUWAVE's operations
and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for
surfacing certain select propaganda items. In the period October to

CONTINUATION OF

UFGA-14781
December 1962, all of JUWAVE's business with the Identity 3
was handled via ARCARDON-2. In mid-December 1962, ARCARDON-2
made the suggention that he introduce REUTEMAN to ARCARION-1
in order that there be a backup contact, in the event that
AMCARTION-2 were out of town or unavailable at such times ag
REUTEMAN might require assistance from the Identity 3. REUTEMAN
agreed to ANCARDON-2's suggestion, and, as a result, ARCANDON-2
hosted a luncheon on 12 December 1962 at the Minmi Club in the
Hotol Columbus, Miami, Florida, at which ALCARLON-2 introduced
ANCARDON-1 to REUTILAN.. As a result of Unis initial mcoting on
12 Doccmbor 1962, an operational relationship has doveloped with
AMCARDON-1, and it is believed that this rolationobip contributes
to the fulfillment of the over-all JUWAVE mission. In view of
this, special activitios report is boing submitted to cover the
nature of JNTAVE' rolationship with ANCARBON-1 during the
period December 1962 to March 1964.

PRAKE OF REFERENCE, FOR; FIZAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH, ACA, DON=1
Whon AMCARLO,-2" Introduced ACARON=1 to Nurman, ALCARION=27
reviowed the ground rules under which he had been cooporating
1th REUTELAN. This review was conducted for ALCARDON-1'ô
benofit in order that he might clearly understand the frame of
roference which should prevail in his relationships with REUTEMAN
In this fovicy, ALCARDON-2 pointed out that it was tho policy
of tho Identity 3 that it would tako no action which would
purposoly embarrass KUDARK or its South Florida oporations
As
a rosult, if any embarrassing items relative to KUDARK's operations
in South Florida did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this
matōrial would bo brought to REUTEMAN's immodiate attention.
ANCAREON-2 made it clear to ALCARDON-1 that such items should be
discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner. In addition, ANCARION-2
made the point that, after an item was discussed, ALICARION-1
should follow REUTEMAN's guidanco relative to how any particularly
embarrassing item might be handled by the Identity 3, 80 that it
would not expose KUBARK operations and, at the same timo, would
not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3.
In addition, AUCARION-2 pointed out that, if ANCANLON-1 brought
a potentially embarrassing itom to REUILLAN's attention and
remedial action on the matter was not taken by REUTHIAN within
a reasonable period of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free
to expose any ineptness on KULARK's part. AMCARDON-2 pointed
out that in return for this cooperation from the Identity 3,
REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be available for contact by
telophone or periodic porsonal meetings at which AMCARDON-1
and AMCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in
Latin American affairs. AMCARDON-2. advised ALCARPON-1 that this
arrangement did not mean that AMCARDON-1 could expect to obtain
any classified information from REUTICIAN. The point was also
made that ALCARDON-1 should not press for the obtaining of
classified information, but ho should be alert to stooring tips
which REUTEM might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories.
ALCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference
which had been outlined by AMCARBON-2. This frame of reference
has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARDON-1
during the period December 1962 to March 1964.
3. AMCARION-1'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER. ALCARBON-1 originally
started to work for the Identity 3 in 1957 on the City Desk,
and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment
which entailed covering major political dovelopments in Florida.
At a later date, AMCARDON-1 became a feature writer for the
Identity 3. Then in July or August 1962, ANCARBON-1 was made
This assignment was considered to be a significant

1.
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. On occasion, AMCARDON-1 in used
to carry out certain operational support tasks. In such instancos,
\'CARBON-1 makes his inquirios or carries out the required action
within the context of his normal journalistic activities. The
use of ANCARDON-1 for operational support tasks enables JMWAVE to
Harness the investigative facilities of the Identity 3. Several
xamples of how AMCARDON-1 has been used in operational support
tanks are outlined below:
and
a Andrew ORDONO Camps. In March 1963, Andrew *ORDONO-
Camps, DPOD 30 Ceptember 1914, Gibara, Cuba, A 12 837 617, arrived
in Miami and was given routino CAC processing. Tho dotails of this
processing are contained in MIAN-0085, dated 12 March 1963. Aftor
being rolonged by CAC, ORDONO was interviowed by the Identity 3
a sensational story was developed.. In view of this story
story, JHWAVE
tried to locate ORDONO for debriefing. This effort was not productive
thus ANGARDON-1 was asked to locate ORDONO AKCARDON-1 did locato
ORDONO in Houston Texas See WAVE-6307, dated 25 March 1963, for
details,
Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the URR Splinter Group.
In UFGW-2555, dated 13 September 1963, lloadquarters suggested that
JUWAVE might be ablo to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611)
of the WRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN' over inflatod claims
relative to his faction invading Cuba. llcadquartors' intorost in
Headquarters interest in
discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN's
irresponsiblo publicity stunts were causing problems for AMDIDDY-1.
As a result of cadquartors' Interest in this matter, NEUTEMAN had
à luncheon Bossion with AMCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which
ANGARDON-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was loss
than accurato in ito claims relative to its activities in Cuba
In view of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want
to soft poddlo any future war communiques which the BANDIN faction
might relenso. AMCARDON-1 stated that, in view of REUTEMAN'a
comments, the Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would
ignore the BANDIN faction in the future. Once BANDIN was discredited
with AMCARDON-1, the word was soon leaked by AMCARBON-1 to other
newspapermen that BANDIN was not a reliable source. As a result
of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage
in South Florida since September 1963.
6. OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. In the period February 1963
to Fobruary 1964, AMCARDON-I has furnished JMWAVE with operational
intelligence as outlined below:
FJ.
a. In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, ANCARBON-1
reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was the object of
a great doal of press interest in view of AMBEND-1's rolcaso from.
a lavana prison. AMCAREON-1 also indicated that AMBEND-1 would
probably bo a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the
UR in Cuba. This operational intelligence was most helpful in
terms of keeping JыWAVE informed on AMEFND-I's movements. Subsequent
developments revealed that AMCARDON-1 could not contact AMBEND-1,
and thus AMBEND-1's return to the United States did not cause the
publicity stir that was initially anticipated.
b. In WAVE 6170, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported that the Identity 3 was attempting to research a full
feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion. The intent of this
article was to furnish a recapitulation of the entire tactical
situation. In this connection, ANCARBON-1 pointed out that he was

United States térritorial waters. REUTEMAN advised AUCARIA-1
that KUMARK had played no role in mounting a provocation operation
against the GOC. At the same time, REUTIMAN pointed out that
it was highly unlikely that CUIROLA was a GOC agent. As a result.
of this conversation, arrangements were mado for JLWAVE to check
out cortain aspects of the GUIROLA story. At the same time?
AMCARDON-1 was provailed upon not to write a story which sight
lead the public to speculate on whether GUIROLA was an agent or a
plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC.
7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET. AMCARDON-1 has been used successfully,
during the period covered by this report, as a propaganda outlet
through which itoms of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in
the free world pros8. Examples of how ANCARDON-1 has been harnessed
in this field are outlined below:
ANCRAB=1. The AMGRAB-1 dofection story originally
surfaced in the area on 13 October 1963 via
-
u Kith played go an API rolcaso from
las Amorican which played up API rolcaso from Montevideo.
The API Montevideo story highlighted ANCIUAB-1's information
rolativo to GOC activition in Uruguay. The story in the Diario
de las Amoricas had an extremely limited impact on Spanish readerí
in the Miami aron, AB a result, it was
it was decided to do a series
of feature stories on AMCRAE-1, pointing up the fact that AUGIAB-1
was typical of the voterans of tho Granma oxpedition, who felt
they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions
of obscurity onco tho rovolution had put CASTRO in power. ASCALDON
was briefed in dotail on the ALCRAB-1 story, and he was given an
opportunity to debrief ANCRAI-1 under controlled conditions in a
JMWAVE Bafchouso. Aftor completing his debriefing, ALCARIO9-1
wrote a series of feature articles on ANCRAB-1. The first article
in the series recoived front page headlino play. The series of
articles on AMCRAB-1 wore well writton, and they provided an
excollent peg for JMWAVE to mount a replay operation via other
propaganda assets. AMCRAB-1 was picked up
by UPI, API and othors, and it was played throughout Latin America.
The details of this surfacing can be found in WAVE 5826, dated
14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE $174,
dated 21 October 1963.
ANCAREOH-1's story on via other
b. Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Story. On 26 February 1964;
JMWAVE learned that when Mr. Charles
Charles GRIFFIN's sons went to Cuba
to reclaim tho hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY REB, they found that
Bolect items were missing from the boat when it was turned over
to them. It was bolloved that this information would make a good
human interest story which JHWAVE assots could use to counter GOC
propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items
from the Cuban fishing boats which had violated United States
torritorial waters. In view of this opinion, a steering tip was
given to AMCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in
Key West interview Mr. GRIFFIN This interview was carried out,
and an articlo outlining the points which woro of interest to
JAWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the
Identity 3.
4.
C
LAYC Story. The March 1964 LAYC mooting in Santiago,
Chilo, was not receiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida
newspapers; as a result, REUTEMAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March
1964 and suggested that the LAYC meeting was a story which the
Identity 3 should pursue. ALCARBON-1 was grateful for this steering
tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC
to one of the mombers of his staff. A story on the LAYC was
subsequently published in the 6 March 1964 edition of the Identity 3

8. POSITIVE, INTELLIGENCE. Attempta have been made to
obtain disseminable, positive Intelligence from ANCARION=1 during
the poriod covered by this report. This attempt has been generally
unsuccessful in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of
contacts in Latin America who would give him inccess to worthwhilo
intelligence appreciably in advance of the information appearing

As a result, ANCARDION-1 is usually not aware of in

as overtaken by other developments before AMCARDON-1 could finish

In WAVE 0904, dated
July 1963, ANCARDON-1 advisod
JUWAVE that Mr. Trevor ARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the
Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting

was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-1's
representatives were tolling the outside world about their
oporational activities.
1. In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-1
informed JMWAVE about the flood of
of
being received at the Identity 30 calls which were
relative to so-called KULANK
vessols which were located in South Florida waters. This
information alorted JMWAVE to the fact that pross scrutiny was
going to bo directed toward the Identity 5. Armed with this warn-
ing, JMWAVE was able to take action which minimized the publicity
repercussions from a renowed press interest in the Identity 5.
•
B. In WAVE 7071, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported to JMWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from
Peru which contained an interesting operational lond to one
Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Poru. This lead was examined by JIWAVE,
Headquarters and the Lima Station. This examination revealed
that the lottor was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no
real operational potential in this lead. This incident did underscoro
the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significant
operational loads to JMWAVE's attention.

In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1

indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had defected
from a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previous]
been seen in Miami during November or December 1963. At the same
timo, ANCARBON-1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought
that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona
fide defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, who
was being used as a means of creating an incident which would
embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating
