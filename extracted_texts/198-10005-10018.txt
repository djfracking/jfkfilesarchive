TO DISCUSS WITH LOPEZ MATEOS.
2. LOMBARDO GAVE ROMERO THE FOLLOWING REASONS FOR HIS TRIP TO .
BRAZIL. HE SAID THAT A GROUP OF BRAZILIAN PERSONALITIES AND
INTELLECTUALS HAD CONVOKED A CONGRESS WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD.
IN RIO DE JANEIRO IN MARCH 1963. HE SAID THE TWO PRINCIPAL AIMS
OF THE CONGRESS ARE:
TO CREATE AN ORGANIZATION IN DEFENSE OF CUBA.
B. TO EXAMINE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS EXISTING IN LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN AMERICA.
3. LOMBARDO SAID THAT SOMETHING WENT WRONG IN BRAZIL BECAUSE,
APART FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH CONVOKED THE CONGRESS, A SECOND
SEPARATE COMMITTEE HAD SPRUNG UP WHOSE AIMS ARE. THE SAME, AND
THAT A SORT OF RIVALRY HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.
LOMBARDO SAID THE RESULT WAS "THAT MY COMRADES IN EUROPE HAVE
ASKED ME TO GO TO BRAZIL TO INTERVENE IN THE MATTER, TO TRY TO ORGANIZE
A SINGLE UNITED COMMITTEE, AND MAKE DEFINITE PREPARATIONS FOR THE
HOLDING OF THE CONGRESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS."
HOLDING OF THE
LOMBARDO
SAID "THE COMRADES IN EUROPE" SHOULD HAVE SENT AN ARGENTINE, A CHILEAN;
A URUGUAYAN, OR SOMEONE NEARER BRAZIL, BUT THEY INSISTED ON SENDING
HIM BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCE, AND THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT HE CAN
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT SATISFACTORILY.

2.
Maximo Gruber, a major in the Cuban Army and one of the
leaders of the G-2 section, has been appointed technical leader
of the Communist guerrillas in Sumapaz, Colombia. 1 Gruber,
a Polish Jew, was formerly a commissar in Spain. His wife
is European. His son Maximo is a graduate of the Lenin
Institute in Moscow. On his frequent trips to Bolivia,
Uruguay, and Cuba he carries a Bolivian diplomatic pass-
port identifying him as "traveling inspector of the
Bolivian Foreign Ministry."
Gruber is being assisted in his tasks in Colombia by
Jaime Guerra, also known as Captain Veneno. One of his
liaison officers to the Communist Party of Colombia is
Blanca Diaz y Collazo, a lawyer and former member of the
Cuban Embassy in Bogota, who was trained in Prague in 1952.
1.
Headquarters Comment. An official British service
reported in April 1961 that Maximo Grobart, nationality
unknown, was training guerrillas in the Sumapaz area;
Grobart, who claimed to be of Hungarian origin, had a
Cuban passport in the name of Jose Blanco and might
I have had other passports of different nationalities.

tion indicate the existence of an unhealthy attitude toward communism
on the part of at least some segments of São Paulo's working and
managerial classes. Further indications in support of or in refutation
of these signs will be submitted as they are noted.
On January 31, I was visited by the two top American ex-
ecutives of a Brazilian subsidiary of a large American corporation. §
They said that their firm, following a practice instituted some years
ago of periodically sampling worker sentiment in their plants, had
just finished a small survey conducted very informally by trusted
Brazilian employees among 55 or 60 of their semi-skilled workers
to discover how the latter would feel about the establishment in Brazil
of a communist system of government. The result of this survey was
so shockingly different from that of earlier pulse-taking that these
executives thought the Consulate General should know about it. Eighty
percent of the workers approached had indicated that while they did not
pretend to know much about communism, they thought they would be
better off under a communist regime than they are at present. Among
the reasons most commonly given were that things were so bad in
Brazil that any change would be for the Sexx and that communism
s
would put an end to the rascality (malandragem) which is so prevalent.
The other twenty percent thought that communism would be bad for the
country.

Carlos Guillen Fernandez, Costa Rican Communist who was formerly very
active in the Sociedad de Amigos de la Revolucion Cubana (Society of
Friends of the Cuban Revolution), left Costa Rica on 14 November, on his
way to Cuba, where he planned to remain indefinitely and to work.

The company executives attributed the pro-communist
sentiment as revealed, mainly to the economic difficulties ex-
perienced by low-income families as a result of the rampant,
inflation. They said their labor relations were good, that while
their pay scales were not as high as those in some other industries,
some popular fringe benefits were provided, and that to the best of
their knowledge there had been no communist agitators at work
among their employees.
Not long before this visit I was lunching one day at the
Jockey Club with Sr. Paulo Ayres Filho, a Brazilian banker and
pharmaceutical manufacturer who is the spark-plug of IPES
(Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas e Sociais), the principal demo-
cratic action group in the local business world. Looking around him
at the other tables, occupied by a good many well-known figures of
São Paulo's conservative upper classes, Sr. Ayres said to me,
"Apart from the two of us, there isn't a man in this dining room who
is seriously concerned over the communist danger in Brazil."
No conclusions, obviously, should be drawn from such
slender indications. It has been my observation, however, that
most Brazilians either believe that a communist take-over would
be impossible in Brazil, or believe that even if it occurred, it
would take a relatively mild form with which they could live. The
Brazilian's boasted calm, which is genuine and in most circumstances
a virtue, could in the present state of affairs be the cause of his undoing.

Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating. Their Activities
C
Orthodox Communists in Peru are apparently putting
aside their differences and moving toward closer
co-operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction,`
believed to be leading the recent outbreak of
disorders. The groups are reportedly co-ordinating
previously random plans to carry out extensive
destruction of industrial and agricultural
installations and to provoke uprisings. Cubans and
other Latin American nationals as well as Havana
and Moscow-trained Peruvians are said to be.
instrumental in this latest development.
Members of the Peruvian junta have expressed
serious concern over the internal situation
and hinted that they favor strong action. Although
constitutional guarantees have been suspended in a
fourth department, and several Army units have been
moved into the areas of disorders, the junta has
taken no further action. It has requested riot
control equipment from the US and says it is
ready to embark on an anti-Communist program upon
assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.

Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti-Communist Move
Continued Communist-incited disorders and an alleged
Havana-Moscow plan to take over the government
prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional
guarantees in Peru and institute a nationwide state
of siege early on 5 January. Military commanders
assumed political control in their respective zones,
and a reported 800 Communist Party leaders and pro-
Communist subversives have been arrested. The
Lima headquarters of several Communist and
Communist-front organizations, as well as their
publications, have been closed.
According to the Communist plan, subversive activity
was to have been intensified between 15 and 20
January in all parts of Peru, with assaults on
banking and commercial institutions, military
garrisons, vital communications facilities, and
universities. A clandestine radio station operating
on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct
and co-ordinate this activity.
The junta has regarded members of the leftist but
non-Communist American Popular Revolutionary
Alliance (APRA) a greater danger than the
Communists and originally tended to blame them
for the disorders. There is no proof that AP RA
has been involved in anything but legititmate
strike activity. Suspension of constitutional
guarantees would enable the junta to strike at
APRA to discredit and weaken it before the scheduled
elections next June. (SECRET)

SUPPLEMENT
THE VENEZUELAN SITUATION
A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of
the year have publicly called for revolution, in other Latin
American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country
with top priority.
Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the
Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) planned to step up terrorist
activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US
visit. The recent incidence of terrorism, which has included
attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and the
burning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part
of this campaign.
Involved in the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of
National Liberation (FALN). The FALN, although purporting to
represent all of the opposition, includes some prominent
Communists and is emerging as a paramilitary force of the PCV
with its main strength in the Caracas area.
Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but
there is no firm evidence that their activity is coordinated
with that in the Caracas area. Venezuelan army units, with
air support, have been used in a recent campaign against
these guerrillas.
The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining
internal security and of defending the nation's borders
against neighboring countries. The vast majority supports
constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.
The armed forces would not hesitate, however, to take over the
government in order to maintain order or to forestall a
Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly
frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist-
instigated disorders. Betancourt's recent willingness to
take more vigorous action, however, coupled with the strong
support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has overcome
much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces' support of
the government is greater now than it was six months ago.
The officer corps is generally free of Communist
penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the
Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved
in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.

Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence
1
As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan
Communist Party reportedly plans to mark the fourth
anniversary of Betancourt's presidency on 13 February
by guerrilla bombings in the Caracas area. Other
Communists are to see to it that the capital is
flooded with propaganda that day. According to un-
confirmed reports, Venezuelan authorities have
charged the Castro government with ordering the recent
terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an
extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity
in both countries. Colombian military authorities
have reportedly drawn up a plan to prevent terrorism
in Colombia's cities.

Alternative US Public Posture on Subversion in Latin America
1. Although our public posture on subversion in Latin America may
be too firmly established for instant and radical revision, the following
analysis is offered on the assumption that some change in emphasis is
both possible and desirable, now or at some time in the future.
2.
Given the existence of a Communist state, of either major per-
suasion, what is the likelihood that it will engage in subversion toward
neighboring states?
a. Total. All experience of the past forty years demonstrates
that a Communist state emanates subversion as the sun emanates heat.
sabotage.
b. But let us be clear that two kinds of subversion are involved:
(1) Hardware-centered that is, funds, guns, tools of
(2) Egalitarian and libertarian ideals.
3. How much does this fact of inevitable subversion raise the prob-
ability of Communism spreading to target countries?
a.
-
Subversion is never a sufficient condition and frequently
not a necessary one.
b. If subversion is really dangerous to a target state, there

that if Nasser were disposed of, the trouble in Algeria would magically

that France would have been in an even deeper morass if her military
forces had managed with the British to occupy Cairo.)
:
How feasible is it to control subversion at the source without
destroying the Communist State?
Usually it is infeasible to do so or the costs are prohibitive.
For instance, the costs of a protracted tight quarantine which
could prevent the export both of hardware-oriented and idea subversion,
would be very high, even if the activity were accepted by Cuba and the
Soviet Union. This would mean inspecting every vessel, searching every
traveler, forcing planes down for inspection, etc. We submit (a) that
ideas would still be exported and (b) that by so doing we would magnify
the importance of Cuba beyond imagination. It would become a kind of
forbidden fruit. The analogy with prohibition in this country comes to
This course involves an increment of prestige and lure to Cuba
which would be likely to outweigh the doubtless desirable diminution in
the export of trained subversives and associated hardware. Furthermore,
given the success of such an effort, the obvious Soviet counter would be
to use other channels which we could not survell without major East-
West confrontation. The Cuban subversion export organization might well
move to Moscow, Prague and/or even Peiping. Therefore, to take a public
stance opposed to Cuban subversion without having resolved on invasion
is to be committed to a policy bound to demonstrate US impotence.
mind.
5. If we want to control subversion at the source by destroying
the Communist State, Cuba, how useful is it for us publicly to emphasize
hardware-centered subversion as the reason?

a..
For many people outside of the US, even the export of
subversion by force and sabotage also involves ideas and dedication,
es well as funds, arms, and other equipment. (We, for example, are
not ashamed of the Bay of Pigs expedition except that it failed.)
b. Usually attitudes toward violent subversion depend on
attitudes toward the target. (Example: acts against Jiminez, Trujillo
did not offend US/ most of Latin America/ most of the world; the paral
lel today: Somoza, Ydigoras, Stroesser). We run the danger of falling
into the USSR projection of the US as the "world gendarme.
directed against the Dutch government would outrage not only all Americans,
but also all non-Communist Europeans; its legitimacy is total, But the
same can not be said for most LA governments. The difference is decisive
and perhaps sometimes neglected.

Ci
Subversion
Most people generally recognize that when violent subversion
is powerful, it is because it taps fundamental sources of discontent.
d. We in the US tend to look at subversion in Latin America
from the point-of-view of hardware. But a great deal of the subversion
in Latin America is or at least appears as idea-centered, not hardware-
centered. The export of "armed aggression" by dedicated revolutionaries
is only a part of the process. Another part, which is at least as impor-
tant, and probably more so, is the export of propaganda. This, however,
to much of the world, including Latin-America outside of the oligarchies,
will appear as an export of ideas and ideals (perhaps wrong, but never-
theless ideas). Our approach, then, tends to pass rather than meet the

Case A: Boomerang we would almost certainly enhance the
prospects for Communism.
Case B: There would be strong popular Latin American support,
some governmental outrage, but the prospects for Communism would be
diminished.
Case C: Paradoxically, the result would depend on what ensued,
because most Latin Americans do not trust the US (and particularly would
be skeptical of "free elections" if US soldiers were present).
CONCLUSIONS
1.
K
Conditions in most parts of Latin America are such that sub-
version (Cuban or Bloc or both) is really dangerous.
1.85
2. Since this is so, the US public posture should not recognize
this; and we should abstain from public pronouncements that subversion
is conceivably a casus belli.
3. The point-of-view set forth in this paper, insofar as it can
be made operative, may tend to bring a fundamental alignment between the
US public posture and LA opinion.
4. The US course of action towards any LA country has to weigh the
advantages and disadvantages, in any given case at any given time, of
subversion control (a) at source or (b) at point of impact.
5. The same principles would apply if another Communist-oriented
government were to come to power in any part of Latin America.

position of the Tsarist gendarmes who tried to use brute force against
the power of ideas. The trap
The trap is that we may seem thereby to be acknow-
ledging the decline and imminent fall of our own ideas.
One consequence of this line of reasoning would be that,
if we ever find it necessary to invade Cuba, we should do so "to stop
the firing squads," "to guarantee free elections, but not to save
Somoza.

"*
6. How feasible is it for us to control both kinds of subversion
at the target rather than at the source?
It is often feasible. This is how we have in fact success-
fully controlled subversion except in the dubious case of S. Vietnam.
Even in the difficult case of Greece, we succeeded by a combination of
military and economic measures.
b.
The point is not that this is always a feasible way of hand-
ling the problem; rather it is often practicable and also often the most
desirable way.

The British consul in Santiago de Cuba has informed Washington
and the Governor of British Guiana that two alleged US citizens,
John Allram Johnson, aged 53, and his wife Margaret Frances Johnson,
were leaving Cuba on 31 December on the Cuban vessel BAICIA DE TANAMA
destined for Georgetown, British Guiana. On board with them were 17
cases in their name, including two large wood crates understood to be
"very similar to those recently unloaded from a Soviet Union ship
in Santiago de Cuba." The British consul notes the unlikelihood of
US citizens' leaving Cuba in this manner, and the resulting doubt as to
their real identities and intentions. (British Foreign Office to
Washington, No. 9759, 31 December, 1962 (SECRET))

5. In the last elections Jagan ordered some of his (Indian) Peoples
Progressive Party (PPP) supporters to join the United Front Party
(UFP) in order to impress the world in general and the US in particular
that democracy in British Guiana was working. By virtue of the fact
that the UFP membership was "growing,
'growing," it was "obvious" that Jagan
was not a dictator. I was told this by two Indian Guianese who were
working for Jagan.
6.
7.
I was in British Guiana for about 12 months on my latest trip.
Since much of this time was devoted to geological surveying in the
hinterland, I was accompanied by an Indian Guianese doctor. A well-
educated man of the upper-middle class, he told me that arms were
being smuggled into the country from Cuba. He did not go into any
detail on the subject, but he did mention that his sons, who were
members of the Progressive Youth Organization (PYO) frequently brought
arms into their home, kept them for a while, and then disposed of them.
The doctor was so much concerned and pessimistic about the
situation that he emigrated from the country shortly after I departed.
Malaria is not a factor now. Even well into the interior there is
less than 1 percent incidence. But anywhere away from the coast
filariasis presents a problem. At first I did not believe it when my
Indian Guianese doctor said that mosquito bites incurred in the day-
time were harmless but mosquito bites at night would infect with
filariasis. After several months in the back country I believed him.
The disease seems to affect women more than men, causing women's legs
to swell. But the disease's affect on men's sexual organs was not
exactly encouraging. I never did understand why, but my doctor said
that to be effective in detecting the disease a blood test must be
made at night (preferably between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.), and analyzed
quickly. If filariasis is treated promptly, a man's sexual prowess
can be saved. We found that the disease is very common throughout
the country.

Effort
Reval.
Source has frequently traveled to and within British Guiana in connection
with geological surveys for his company. He has known Jagan for about
nine years, and on his latest trip had several conversations with Jagan.
On the basis of many conversations with Chedi Jagan (mostly concerning
possible investments by my company in British Guiana), I am convinced
that he is not a Communist. In fact, Jagan does not know what he is.
He is simply looking for anything new that will help to pull up his
people quickly. In this context he sees Soviet and Chinese Communism
as the two principal Twentieth Century economic experiments --/and as
economic experiments he is willing to try them.
In talking with me, Jagan has made clear that he is not a "Castro Type."
He wants help from anybody. The one thing that might in the future
seriously hinder his getting economic aid from the USSR is that he
demands that aid be without strings.
Both Jagan and his Trade Minister, Frank Hubbard, have told me that
Jagan would hesitate to do anything (such as confiscating foreign pro-
perties in an attempt to increase revenues) which would offend the US
or the UN for fear of ruining any future chances of obtaining US or UN
aid. Jagan is of course quite conscious that he is still under the UK
and that it is therefore unconstitutional for him to expropriate anything.
After British Guiana achieves independence, I am confident Jagan would
not expropriate anything if he is getting aid from the US or the UN
that is, until the money is spent. If at any point (after independence)
Jagan is receiving no such aid and has no prospects of receiving such
aid, then anything could happen. I would, however, temper this somewhat
depressing,estimate of Jagan by commenting that in 1953 when he entered
office, he was something of a wild-eyed fanatic without direction.
Since then he has matured considerably..
Heme
The PPP capability for increasing the industrial wealth of British
Guiana is hopeless. Jagan indiscriminately wants all kinds of factories.
His "Five Year Plan" is no plan at all. In his eagerness to do something
for British Guiana, Jagan thinks he ought to build any kind of factory
that the country does not have. Whenever he thinks of something, he
just tells a subordinate to add it to the Plan. But there is no one in
the Jagan government whe has done or can do the marketing research, etc.,
which is necessary for any such investment.

The CIA station in Rio de Janeiro has reported that some efforts
may be made to put pressure on President Goulart to publicly take some
note of the Cuban intervention in Brasil's internal affairs, allegedly
show by some 16 pages of Spanish-language documents found in the
Varig plane crash which carried a Cuban delegation to their deaths in
November. The documents are considered by a Brazilian source who made
them available to the CIA station to be "explosive, since they prove
the Cubans are sponsoring revolution in Brazil." Paraphrases of those
documente have appeared in the lims press; but it is unlikely that
President Goulart vill give any support to publicizing them. (CIA,

Eight Dominican pro-Castro leaders were aboard the Czech airlines
flight to Cuba which transited Shannon Airport on 14 December, according
to an official Irish service. The Dominicans included Maximo Lopes
Molina, Tomas Parmenio Erickson, and Gustavo Ricart, leaders of the
outlawed Dominican Popular Movement (MPD), one of the most active pro-
Communist groups in the Dominican Republic. The eight Dominicans were
among the ten who were deported from the Dominican Republic to France
earlier this year. Another source reported last November that the Cuban
ambassador in Paris had a meeting with the ten Dominican deportees to

An expert Cuban electrical technician in the Borjita sugar mill
has told a former close associate who is now a regular clandestine
source that Cubs is training personnel in the techniques of using
explosives prior to sending them to the United States on sabotage missions.
It is intended that such persons will go in the guise of anti-Communist
refugees, and the sabotage will be so arranged that in some cases it vill
be taken to be merely accidents. The electrical technician added that
there is a large Commmist espionage ring operating with a ring in the
United States across the border, with several plans already under wey.

MEMORANDUM:

4 October 1962
Cuban Subversion in Other Latin American Countries
I.
General Summary
1.- The Castro regime denies that material support is being given
any anti-regime group outside Cuba. Castra claims that such assistance is
unnecessary since the people of these countries, thanks to Cuba's example,
are becoming aware of their revolutionary potential. The publicly stated
position of the Cuban leaders is that their country, "the first socialist
state in America," has become the example, the "beacon" In fact, however,
Cuba's moral and material support to Communist and Communist influenced
groups has been felt in varying degrees in every one of the 19 other Istin
American republics. The Castro regime has become an effective instrument
of the Sino-Soviet effort to weaken and eventually destroy democratic
political institutions in Latin America.
2. Cuban subversion has become more subtle since 1959, when a Cuban-
mounted expeditionary force was launched against the Dominican Republic and
smaller "invasion forces" left Cubs for abortive attacks on the governmente
of Fanama, Nicaragua, and Haiti. Now Cuban subversive efforts generally fall
in three categories:
II.
The indoctrination and training of hundreds of Latin
Americans in Cuba;
The intensive propaganda beamed at Latin America by Cuban
radio stations and circulated through printed material and
the Cuban-subsidized international "news" agency, and;
The covert material support given subversive groups in
other countries.
Cuban Subversive Programs
A. Training of latin Americans in Cuba:
3. Fidel Castro announced on 9 June 1961 that his government would
grant 1,000 scholarships to "poor students" from other Latin American
countries for the next school term and 100 scholarships to students from
other countries of the world. Hundreds of young Latin Americans have been
subjected to Communist indoctrination. In addition to whatever formal
training they receive in Suho, many of them receive training in guerrilla
warfare and other techniques of revolution.
4. Cuban refugees who have arrived recently in the United States have
provided detailed information on the training programs offered to some of
these young Latin Americans.

TOP SECRET
COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION FOR LATIN AMERICA
"
Information on the Communist apparatus for Latin America and its
relationship with Cuba and the Sino Soviet Bloc is largely derived from
highly classified intelligence which is provided separately. From the
reports contained in this section, it may be concluded that the organize-
tional links vary from country to country depending upon, among other
factors, the legal status of the Communist party, whether diplomatic
representation is located in a country, the relative strength of Communist
alliances with other leftist or opposition parties, and the character of
current government leadership in these countries. Next attached is an
unclassified report prepared in October for release as a White Paper.
Although this paper was not released due to the missile crisis, it repre-
sents an agreed summary (State, DOD, CIA and USIA) of the Communist
apparatus in Latin America. The report contains briefs on Communist
activities in each of the Latin American countries.
The reports vary with respect to the country priority for Castro/
Communist action in Latin America. Brasil, Venezuela, and British Guiana
are mentioned most frequently as the likely priority targets. There are
also conflicting reports on the relative independence of Castro from the
Soviet Union and indications that the publicized Sino Soviet disagreements
are reflected in local Communist organisations throughout Latin Americe.

9. The program to the Dominican Republic, for instance, is announced
as the program of the Dominican Liberation Movement (MID), and the program
is entitled Patria Libre. At present, Radio Havana beams the 20 minute
Patria Libre program to the Dominican Republic on Thursdays and Saturdays.
Just prior to the program, the Radio Havana announcer explains that the
station is making its facilities available to the MLD for its program.
There are some areas in the Dominican Republic where, due to the absence
of local radio stations, the Cuben broadcasts are the only ones heard.
Last July, the subversive content of these broadcasts to the Dominican
Républic led the Dominican government to protest to the Organization of
American States.
10. The content of such broadcasts is exemplified in the stated goals
of the "Voice of Revolutionary Nicaragua," the program which is regularly
beamed by Redio Havana to Nicaragua. On 31 August this program celebrated
its first anniversary by repeating its original statement of its purposes:
"The Voice of Revolutionary Nicarague has set itself the goal
of contributing to pointing out the real way to Nicaragua"s
liberation from the dominion of Yankee imperialism and the
Somoza tyranny. Elections (scheduled for next February to
choose President Somoza's successor) with the Somozas in pover,
and under the State Department's economic and political control
of Nicaragua, vill be a farce. Without. . a prior revolutionary
overthrow of the Somoza tyrenny there can be no free elections
in Nicaragua nor can a popular government be established. This
program will be at the service of the revolutionaries end
against the electioneers...The Voice of Revolutionary Nicaragua
will defend the Cuban revolution because it is an important
part of the Latin American people's liberating revolution."
11.
Cuban propaganda is also disseminated through the offices of
Presna Latina, the Cuban-subsidized international "news agency" which
bas close working relations with TASS, the New Chine News Agency, and other
propagande media for the Sino-Soviet bloc.
12. Cuban printed material is circulated throughout the hemisphere;
Che Guevara's book on guarrilla warfare has received vide distribution.
Periodically, the Mexican government, most recently last August, has been
obliged to confiscate large quantities of propanganda materials from Latin
Americans passing through that country enroute from Cube to their homelands.
C. Cuben covert support for subversive groups:
13. Cuban covert support for Communist or pro-Communist groups in
other Latin American countries is provided in a number of ways. In the five
Latin American countries where Cuban diplomatic missions are still resident
(Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Bolivia), these missions have often
been the channel. The Cuban embassy in Mexico is known to have provided

One refugee, a deserter from Castro's army, reported from
personal knowledge that in late 1961 there were a number of students from
Chile, Equador, Argentina, Guatemala, and Brazil living in a Havana suburb
who regularly attended classes in Marxism-leninism, propaganda techniques
and other subjects to prepare them for active revolutionary roles in their
homelands. He reported that those male students who were between 16 and 20
years of age were sent as part of their training to the Mines del Prio
training center in Oriente province. During this phase of their training they
received familiarization in the use of small erms and hiked to the top of
Cuba'e highest mountain, Pico Turquino, in the Sierra Maestra, the locale of
Castro's guerrilla varfare against the Batista dictatorship.
b. Another refugee, who lived in Oriente province, learned from
conversations with militia-men in the area and from Latin Americans training
there that continuous training of students from other Latin American countries
is going on at Las Arenas, Oriente. The trainees receive instruction in
military tactics, guerrilla warfare, subversion, sabotage, propaganda, and
Communist ideology. The refugee did not know how many Latin Americans were
involved, but believed the duration of each course was about eight weeks, after
which another group replaced the one that had been training.
5. Much of the travel of Latin American students to Cube for training
and indoctrination is handled by the Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los
Pueblos (ICAP - Cuban Institute for Friendship with Peoples).
6. Cube is also a major takeoff point for Latin Americans traveling to
and from the Sino-Soviet bloc. Over 400 Latin Americans returned from last
Ove
July's Communist-sponsored Youth Festival in Helsinki aboard a Soviet passenger
vessel with the 400-man Cuban delegation. They disembarked in Havans and
stayed in Cuba some weeks before some of them began returning to their home
countries. Others may well be remaining in Cuba for some time.
B.
Cuban Propaganda:
7.
International broadcasts by Cuban radio stations maintain a
relatively constant propaganda level at all times, with regularly scheduled
and special broadcasts to specific countries as well as general transmissions
to all of Latin America. The general theme of all these broadcasts is
that "the Cuban example" is avakening the "people" of Latin America to
the opportunity for revolutionary action against the "corrupt "regimes in
power and against "Yankee imperialism" which allegedly supports them.
8. There are regular programa beamed by Havana radio to Nicaragua
the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras. They are all
subversive in content and frequently incite to rebellion. These programs
to specific countries are apparently directed and produced with the
guidance of exiles from the countries concerned resident in Cuba.

frequent assistance to exiles from Guatemala, Nicaragua, and other Central
American countries living in Mexico. In other instances
In other instances, assistance is
provided through travelers coming from Cube and through Prensa Latina
representatives.
14. The assistance is usually financial. The Cubans appear to have
been careful since 1959 to avoid being caught in a blatant act of subversion
that could be used to justify concerted inter-American action. Financial
assistance is often just as useful and much less risky than actual weapons
deliveries. In
In a number of American countries, small arms and other wespons
are available for a price. Unscrupulous or cureless arms dealers in the US
have also contributed to the arma traffic from which pro-Castro groups have
benefitted, directly or indirectly.
15. As the following country-by-country rundown indicates, Cuban support
for subversive activity has affected in varying degrees every one of the 19
other Latin American countries.

the Argentine national holiday, he addressed the group of Argentine citizens
resident in Cuba and told them that he hoped that next year they would be
celebrating in Argentine under "the flag of socialism." At another point
in this address he said: "Our revolution is one which needs to expand its
ideas...and other people are helping us. Let the other peoples of the hemisphere
get angry and take up arms or seize power and ald us in this task which is
the task of the entire hemisphere and of humanity.

The Argentine community in Cuba last April organized the
"Cuban-Argentine Friendship Institute" with headquarters in Havana. One
of the leaders is John William Cooke, who was for a time chief of former
Argentine dictator Peron's political machine in Argentina. Cooke continues
active in that faction of the Peronista party which seeks concerted action
with the Argentine Communists. Cooke maintains regular contact with sympathizers
inside and outside Argentina through travelers and through his wife,
Alicia Eguren de Cooke, a resident of Montevideo, Uruguay, who apparently
has regular means of communication with individuals in Argentina. Argentine
citizens have been recruited through this channel to go to Cube for training.
There are also strong indications that terrorist activities by Argentine
Peronists and Communists have been encouraged and perhaps assisted through
this channel.
Frio Prior to the diplomatic break between Argentina and Cuba.
last February, the Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires provided financial assistance
to anti-government groups there. An Argentine journalist who has contacts in
the Communist party there reported last December, for instance, that the
Argentine Communist party had received the sum of 50,000 pesos from the
Cuban embassy as a contribution to the railway workers who were then on
strike in the province of Cordoba.

fact, that Juliao's Peasant Leagues have received not only money but also
shipments of small arms from Cuba. These Brazilian Communist leaders also
said that the reason Juliao sent his family to Cuba was his fear that they
might be endangered in the civil war he expects to erupt shortly in Brazil.
The Cuban government has also during the past year cultivated
particularly close relations with leaders of the dissident Commmist Party
of Brasil (CPB). One of the CPB leaders who had visited Cuba last May
told a friend of a long conversation he had had with Fidel Castro in late
May. Castro expressed identity of feeling with the dissident Brazilian
Communists and criticized the regular Communist party for its failure "to
take a strong revolutionary line" in accordance with the decision of the
22nd party congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. Castro
approved the insurrectionary policy of the CPB and urged the leaders to
organize guerrilla activities and start the revolutionary movement in Brazil
as soon as possible.' Castro advised them that government reprisals against
revolutionary action in Brazil would serve only to increase popular dis-
content in Brazil and swell the ranks of the revolutionaries. He advised
CPB leaders to give special emphasis to securing agvride a base as possible
emong agricultural workers and the inhabitants of rural areas.
##
The Cuban embassy in Rio de Janeiro, like Cuban embassies
elsewhere in Latin America, has been a source of assistance to Communist and
pro Communist elements. Last May leaks to the Brazilian press reported dis-
cussions in the Brazilian cabinet on the subversive activities being directed
by Cuban ambassador Joaquin Hernandez Armae. The Navy and Army Ministers are
reported to have expressed particular concern over Hernandez' activities.
d. Chile: Senator Salvador Allende, leader of Chile'
Communist-dominated popular front and a leading presidential aspirant, has
made at least two trips to Cuba.
The Cuben embassy in Santiago is the source of propaganda
support for pro-Communist groups, mostly those associated with Allende, who
are intent on coming to power in Chile through elections or revolution.
Orlando Prendes, cultural attache of the Cuban embassy, is known to be super
vising the printing of Cuban propaganda on a clandestine printing press in
the home of Julio Bocanegra, who also prints propaganda for the Chilean
Communist party. This activity has been going on for some time.
As long
ago as August, 1961, Chilean officials investigating political agitation
and resulting unrest in the Salamanca ares learned that after a visit to the
area by a Cuban diplomat the previous month, pro-Cuban propaganda was being
distributed in the area, and Communists and pro-Communists there were saying
"The mountains of Selamanca are going to be the Chilean Sierra Maestra.'
Last March, when Cuban Minister of Education Armando Hart
went to chile for an international conference he took with him several sacks
of propaganda.
Colombia: The United Front for Revolutionary Action (FUAR),
organized early this year by Colombian extremists, is believed to have
received financial assistance from Cuba to promote its objective of creating
a guerrilla movement aimed at the overthrow of the government. A Colombian

On
Though the Cuban embassy is no longer in Buenos Aires, Cuban
clandestine assistance to Argentine Peronist-Communist groups continues.
19 July of this year the federal police in Buenos Aires reported the un-
earthing of a center of Communist and Peronist activities in the capital.
Two Buenos Aires policemen were shot and killed at a surburban warehouse in
June. Investigations revealed that a quantity of explosives and propaganda
were stored in the warehouse. The trail led to the arrest of one Jose
Maria Aponte, a journalist and known Peronist activist, and one Mario
Massi, owner of the firm which owned the warehouse. It was revealed that
Messi had been maintaining contact with Cuban Communists, with John William
Cooke, and with an unidentified woman associated with the Cuban embassy in
Uruguay who was probably Alicia Eguren de Cooke referred to above. According
to the Argentine police investigation, some 150 Argentine citizens had been
sent from Argentina to Cube (through Uruguay and Mexico) for training in
guerrilla warfare. On their return to Argentina, these men were to be used
in planned activities in the provinces of Formosa, Tucuman, Salte, and the
wooded areas of eastern Argentina. A number of other individuals were appre-
hended by the Argentine police in connection with the subversive activity
revealed in these investigations.
b. Bolivia: Bolivia has been the recipient of special Cuban
attentions. The number of Bolivians receiving "scholarships" in Cuba this
year--between 130 and 150-- appears disproportionately high. The Bolivian
government felt obliged to request the departure of Cuban Ambassador Tabares
in 1960 and of Cuban Charge Garcia Trians in 1961 for blatant intervention
in internal Bolivian affairs, including support for Bolivian Communiste and
attempts to incite extreme leftist members of the governing MNR party to leave
the party. In June 1961, the Bolivian government published a series of
documents linking the Cuban embassy with a Communist conspiracy to seise
control of the government. One of these documents, a statement by an arrested
Bolivian agitator who had been in close contact with the Cuban embassy,
gave the names of a number of Bolivians who had received financial support
from the Cuban embassy. This evidence
This evidence was used to justify the request for
the Cuban charge's recell.
The present Cuban charge in Bolivie, Ramon Aja, has also been
active though perhaps a bit more discreet than his predecessors. He has
been particularly energetic in cultivating relations with Bolivian campesinos.
The peasant union in the Cliza Valley of Bolivia has been reported to be the
recipient of Cuban financial assistance.
C. Brazil: During the past two years the Castro regime has
developed increasingly close ties with Francisco Juliao, self-proclaimed
Marxist and leader of the Peasant Leagues in the troubled northeast region
of Brazil. Juliao, whose wife and children are resident in Cuba, has
traveled there on several occasions, and a number of his associates and rank
and-file members of the Leagues have gone to Cube for agricultural
training which is undoubtedly heavily larded with ideological indoctrination.
Transportation direct from northeast Brazil to Cuba has been provided by
Bubana airlines on at least one occasion. Circumstantial evidence strongly
suggests that Juliao has received financial assistance for his movement from
the Cuban government.. Brazilian Communist leaders have privately stated, in

13 November group, which had recently engaged in guerrilla activity in
Guatemala. The Cuban gave him $4,000 which he sold was the first install-
ment of a total of $10,000 to be used to establish a new guerrilla front
in Guatemala. On 8 March, Castro's emissary gave the Guatemalans the balange
of the $10,000 and told one of the 13 November leaders that the decision to
provide them with the money was taken by Fidel Castro personally. Castro,
be said, had sent instructions that the group did not have to account for how
the money was spent, that no strings were attached, and that he hopes they
are successful so he can provide them with additional assistance.. Later the
Cuban emissary met with leaders in Mexico of the orthodox Guatemalan
Communist party. These Guatemalan Communists had apparently complained that
the Cuban money was not going to them. They were told that Castro wanted
the money to go to the 13 November group because this group had demonstrated
Its capacity to fight the Guatemalan government, a capacity which the
Guatemalan Communists had not shown. The Cuban said: "It is not a matte
of standing around with Arab fatalism waiting for events to take place-
We should act efficiently so as to precipitate the death of imperialism.
Because of this we are ready to help anyone who may decide to struggle against
imperialism anywhere.'
Cuban propaganda media have sought through publicizing the
activities of the 13 November group to increase its prestige and chances for
success. A Prensa Latins
A Prensa Latins reporter published an alleged interview with
13 November leader Yon Sosa.
k. Haiti: A cadre of Haitian Communists led by Rene Depestre is
resident in Cuba, and many thousands of Haitian citizens living in eastern
Cubs are now being subjected to Communist regimentation and indoctrination.
1. Honduras: Prior to the break in Cuban-Honduran diplomatic
relations in April 1961, Cuban personnel under the cover of consular and
diplomatic offices engaged in proselyting in the north coast region of
Honduras. Honduras now is the target of a particularly vicious regular radio
program beemed especially to Honduras by Radio Havana. Many Hondurans are
in Cuba under the "holarship" program.
n. Mexico: The Cuban embassy in Mexico City, the consulate in
Merida, and the "Cuban Mexican Cultural Center" in Merida have all g
engaged in propaganda activities designed to encourage the pro-communist cause
in Mexico, particularly the Communist-influenced National Liberation Move-
ment (MLN). Former Cuban ambassador in Mexico Portuondo is reported by people
in close contact with MLN leaders to have concluded an agreement whereby
some of the money sent by Havana to cover the expense of the embassy is ear-
marked as a contribution to the MLN. Mexican officials were disturbed at the
participation of Cuban embassy officials in inciting the anti-US demon-
strations by Mexican students in July and August 1960. Mexican authorities
have periodically impounded quantities of Cuban propaganda being sent through
Mexico to other Latin American countries. The most important aspect of
Mexico in Cuban propaganda and subversive operations in Latin America is its
use by the Cubans se a way station or jumping off place between Cuba itself
and the rest of Latin America.

18. Cuban overseas military capabilities remain severely
Umited by lack of the requisite air or sea lift. The Cubans could
probably not undertake an overseas operation on a saale larger than
one battalion. For political as well as military reasons, the Castro
regime is most unlikely to undertake military operations of this nature.
It would prefer to concentrate on rendering clandestine support to
local insurgents.

citizen who has contacts among FUAR members reported last June that Fidel
Castro had just given the group $15,000 and promised further financial
aid semi-annually. Gloria Gaitan de Valencia, the wife of a FUAR leader
and the daughter of the Colombian leader Gaitan whose assassination in
1948 sparked the disastrous Bogota rioting, is a long-time personal friend
of Fidel Castro. He has visited Cuba frequently and probably returns to
Colombia with specific advice and assistance from the Cuban government.
The FUAR has succeeded in drawing members from the extremist wing of the
regular Colombian Communist party who are dissatisfied with that party's
reluctance to engage in ipen revolutionary action.
Costa Rica: The small Costa Rican Commmist party, the
Popular Vanguard party (PVP), is charged by the Cuban government with the
selection of young men to be trained in Cuba. Riboberto Carmona and Jose
Murillo, PVP members, left Costa Rica last June for training under this
program, and PVP leaders had plans for organizing guerrille training programs
in Costa Rica under the direction of the Costa Ricans who had received training
in Cuba.
The Dominican Republic: The provisional Council of State,
which is preparing the country for its first free elections this December
in more than 30 years, has been a major target for Cuban subversion. A
cadre of Dominican Communists is headquartered in Cuba, and clandestine con-
tact is probably maintained with sympathizers inside the Doninican Republic.
Broadcasts to the Dominican Republic from Cuba have helped incite the
frequent riots in Santo Domingo. The fact that broadcasts from Cuba have on
occasion referred to very recent events in the Dominican Republic strongly
suggests the presence of clandestine radio contacts between the two countries.
h. Ecuador: The Communist party of Ecuador has formed the
nucleus of a small guerrilla organization. This group was drawn largely from
the pro-Castro Revolutionary Union of Ecuadorean Youth (URJE), which was
involved in a two-day battle with government forces last April. The leader
of the April affair, as well as several other Ecuadoreans involved in sub
versive activities, has received guerrilla training in Cuba. A URJE leader
told a friend last June that this organization has so far in 1962 received
$22,000 in financial aid from the Cuban government.
Manuel Araujo Hidalgo, pro-Communist former Ecuadorean Minister
of Interior who has visited Cuba and who recently traveled in Communist
China, appears to be working with the URJE. He is reported to have received
a considerable amount of money from the Cuban government for his efforts,
according to a private statement by the URJE leader.
1. El Salvador: On 1 March 1961, the Salvadoran government
broke relations with the Castro regime after it had received evidence of
conversation between the Cuban charge, Roberto Lassalle, and leading Salvadoran
Communists in which Lassale urged increased revolutionary activity.
J. Guatemala: On 5 March 1962, a Cuban arrived in Mexico with a
message for a leader then in Mexico of the Guatemalan Communist-influenced

n. Nicaragua: A cadre of Nicaraguan Communists is based in
Cuba. Contact between them and pro-Castro Nicaraguans in Nicaragua and in
exile in other countries of the Caribbean area is maintained at least on a
sporadie basis. A number of Nicaraguans periodically have traveled to Cube,
and some have received training there in guerrilla tactics. Reliable reports
indicate that some of these Cuba-trained Nicaraguans have been among the
small guerrilla bands that have infiltrated Nicaragua across the largely un-
guarded Hondruan border. The Nicaraguan government is the target of a
regularly broadcast Radio Havana program to Nicaragua which is announced as
the program of "free Nicaraguans.'
0. Panama: Cuban Financial assistance is believed to be
channeled to the pro-Communist National Action Vanguard (VAN) in Panama. One
of the VAN leaders, Deputy Thelma King, is a frequent traveler to Cuba and
claims to be a personal friend of Fidel Castro.
p. Paraguay: Paraguayen exides in Uruguay and Brasil have
received Cuban financial assistance. Four members of the United Front for
National Liberation (FULNA), a Communist Paraguayan exile group in Uruguay,
receive the equivalent of $230 monthly each from the Cuban embassy in
Uruguay to finance clandestine pro-Castro activities in Uruguay, according
to a Paraguayan exile in Uruguay who is in close touch with FULNA.
q. Peru: At least eight Peruvians traveled to Cuba by way of
Mexico last June to receive training and indoctrination in that country.
Other Peruvian Communists or pro-Communists have long been in Cuba and a
regularly broadcast Radio Havine program is beamed to Peru.
Uruguay: The Cuban embassy in Montevideo has been engaged
in promoting pro-Castro propaganda. In January 1961 the Uruguayan govern-
ment was obliged to declare the Cuban ambassador persona non grata for
intervening in internal Uruguayan affairs.
Venezuela: The Castro regime has been extremely vitriolic
in its propaganda blasts against the Betancourt administration in Venezuela.
Cuban assistance has been channeled to members of the militant opposition
Leftist Revolutionary Movement (MIR), which is attempting to develop a
guerrilla movement in Venezuela with the aid of its ally, the regular Vene-
zuelan Communist party. While there is little evidence to indicate direct
Cuban involvement in this Communist effort, a significant number of the lead-
ing figures involved, including Fabricio Ojeda, are known to have traveled
to Cuba, where they probably received financial and other assistance in
addition to official encouragement and propaganda support for their activities.

31. The decline of his prestige has at least for the moment
reduced Castro's capability for subverting popular groups and
moving them into action against their own governments and

on other than local issues.

Policies Toward Latin America
42. Here Castro has more capability for independent
action than in any other field except the internal politics of Cuba.
Gastro is deeply committed to a policy of armed insurrection
throughout Latin America. Because of his own experience he has
a deep-seated belief that only through insurrection can revolution
be promoted in Latin America. Further, he apparently believes that
a successful revolution in another Latin American country would give
great impetus to the revolutionary movement and would also consoli-
date his own regime in Cuba. In trying to foment insurrections, he
apparently does not believe it crucial that he cannot now give direct
military assistance to them, nor does he seem to consider it impor -
tant whether he has or has not Soviet support. For the Soviets,
however, such an inflexible approach smacks of the Chinese position
and causes great problems in dealing with other Latin American
Communists. Most important, however, it is probable that the
Soviets believe such a posture will damage Soviet prospects for
penetration of Latin America and inevitably bring about a confronta-
tion with the US.

32. Nonetheless, Castro continues his appeal for revolution in
Latin America on the Cuban model. Those Latin Americans who are
committed to violent revolution continue to look to Castro for help,
particularly from his training program in Cuba and his large-scale
dissemination of printed and broadcast propaganda. Communist
agitators are concentrating their efforts increasingly in rural areas,
as they have done in Peru recently. In addition, there has been an
increase in sabotage and other violence perpetrated by extremists,
of the sort not requiring the participation of large popular groups, yet
designed to provoke drastic countermeasures by governments and to
increase popular anti-government sentiment. These widespread
activities have demonstrated that the ability of local Communists to engage
in terrorist and subversive activities and their willingness to accept Cuban
and Soviet support do not dpend upon Castro-s prestige or upon their
opinion of his doctrines and policies.

Che Guevara's mother, who lives in Argentina, told a clandestine
source in mid-December that during her recent visit to Cube her son
told her that Cuban leaders now feel they will have to rely more and
more on their own efforts to promote Communist penetration in South
America. Querrillas will be used on a large scale after they have
received training in Cuba, Guevara said. He explained to his mother that
this is necessary since both he and Castro feel Khrushchev "let them
down" and has no further interest in spreading Communism in South America.
Guevara added that be and Castro believe they and the Chinese are
better Communists than Khrushchev. (CIA DD/P Buenos Aires, 19 December,

given reliable advance information of important developments) expressed
the opinion on 30 November that there will be revolts in Caribbean
countries which vill masquerade as "mational revolutions" so as to
negate the accusation of Cuban complicity. In fact, however, these
revolutione vill be directed from Cube throuch revolutionaries from
various countries who are now being trained in Cuba. (CIA DD/P IN 46717,

means of Cuben subversion in Latin America
the training of hundreds

SUPPLEMENT
THE CASTRO THREAT TO LATIN AMERICA
Despite diminished prestige, especially among government
leaders, Castro retains great influence over politically
unsophisticated Latin Americans. He is also supported by
Western Hemisphere Communist parties and the vast majority
of extreme leftists. Castro's main appeal lies in his claim
to be the leader of a successful revolution against "Yankee
imperialism" and in the support he is ready to provide
subversive activities throughout Latin America.
The degree to which Cuba is involved in, current
hemisphere unrest is not clear. Antigovernment nationals and
Communists of various Latin American countries, however,
have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro-Castro
indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962, 1,000 to 1,500
are believed to have received intensive education and training
in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Significant representation
has been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. There is no definite
proof that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups,
but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are
reliably reported to have been furnished. .
Cuban leaders have also called with increasing frequency
for open rebellion as the "only road" to liberation for the
Americas; they have been especially vociferous since the first
of the year.
Leading officials, such as Castro, Blas Roca,
Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are
among those calling for revolutionary violence. The
"Betancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a
primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high
priority. The use of the Prensa Latina organization and
the agent network already in existence makes it virtually
sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities.
Latin American governments are generally now more alert to
Castro's threat. Inadequate security forces and widespread
poverty throughout the area, however, make it almost certain
that Cuban-supported insurgency will have an effect out of
proportion to the number of people involved.

CIA Report 21 Dec 62 Rome
Translation of report dated 6 Dec 62 from Italian Embassy Havana to
Foreign Ministry in Rome. 'As I noted in my 9 November report is is
difficult for Castro to remain calm. Therefore the revolutionary regime
will continue with all means at its disposition to disseminate subversive
propaganda in the whole continent, as demonstrated by the fact that all the
states of Latin America (including Mexico) are taking strong measures
against the dissemination of this propaganda. But it is doubtful that
he
today Castro can do much more and that/constitutes a real menace to the
security of other countries, if only because he lacks the necessary funds.
I tend to share the opinion of the Ambassador to Brazil that the Cuban
leaders are trying to concentrate all their subversive efforts in one
country, and that they have selected Venezuela for various reasons, in-
cluding the old ill feeling between Castro and Betancourt. I note in
passing that, according to what was told me by the aforementioned
Ambassador, during the recent meeting of the OAS the Venezuelan representative
accused the Cubans of promoting the recent attempts in his country but, when
asked to furnish proof, he was unable to do so."

Cuban Developments
Following Fidel Castro's call for revolution in
Latin America in his 2 January speech, other Cuban
speakers are emphasizing the same theme. Che Guevara
told a group of Central American delegates in Havana
recently that they must prepare for simultaneous
revolutions in all Central American countries and pointed
to Venezuela and Chile as major targets for revolution.
Long-time Communist leader Blas Roca, on 23 January,
praised Venezuelan Communists for their recent
acts of sabotage and pledged continued Cuban
support for the struggle of the people against the
Betancourt "tyranny." Venezuela has long been a
major Castro-Communist target, and Blas Roca's
remarks imply Cuban support for the present upsurge
of Communist activity there.

(EXCERPT FROM UNCLASSIFIED DEPARTMENT OF STATE WHITE PAPER ON CUBA ISSUED
AUG 1960)
1. Armed Incursions.
No sooner had the Revolutionary Government of Cuba taken power
than it launched a program for exporting its revolution to other countries
in the Hemisphere, particularly in the Caribbean area. The memories of
the invasions and attempted invasions of Pename, of Nicaragua, and of
the Dominican Republic, following closely upon one another in the spring
and summer of 1959 are still fresh. Support of Cuban officials for
military expeditions against the Governments of these countries, although
vehemently denied, hes been established beyond reasonable doubt. With
the invasion of the Dominican Republic came the realization among the
American Republics that international tensions in the Caribbean area,
to which Cube had significantly contributed, had risen to the extent that
a Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American
States was necessary.
The Investigating Committee appointed by the Council of the OAS,
acting provisionally as Organ of Consultation under the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, in the Panama case in June, 1959 con-
cluded "that the Republic of Panama was the victim of an invasion,
organized abroad, that sailed from a Cuban port and was composed almost
entirely of foreigners". The Committee report stated that the Chairman
of the Committee was able to confirm that 82 of 84 imprisoned invaders

The
Ambassador to Haiti and his five military attaches, in the attempt to
overthrow the Haitian Government was denounced by that Government.
Cuban Government, though admitting that the invasion was launched in
Cube and all but one of the participants were Cubans, conveniently dis-
avowed the acts of the Cuban citizens involved.

were Cubans. Further, the Government of Panama, prior to the departure
of the invasion group from Cuba informed the Cuban Government of reports
about this impending event, invoking the 1928 Habana Convention on the
Duties and Rights of States in the Event of Civil Strife. The Cuben
Foreign Minister in turn assured Paname that the Cuban Government would
take the necessary preventive measures.
In connection with several of the invasions or attempted invasions
of Nicaragua from Costa Rica and Honduras in June, 1959, and the
individuels organizing them, documentary and other types of evidence
which came to light demonstrated Cuban officials support in the form of
arms and financial contributions.
Official Cuban complicity in the invasion of the Dominican Republic
in the same month was clear. The expedition was organized, trained, and
equipped in Cuba with the undoubted assistance of Cuban officials. An
officer on active duty with the Cuban Rebel Army was one of the expedi-
tion's leaders. The Cuban Navy escorted the three landing craft used
by the invading force on their voyage to the Dominican Republic.
Even during the Fifth Meeting of Consultation in Santiago, Chile,
e report was received of the invasion of Haiti on August 13, 1959 by a
group of armed men coming from Cubs. The Haitian Government after the
Santiago meeting expressed its fears of further invasion attempts. It
charged that the August 13 invasion from Cuba was a violation of the
1928 Habana Convention on Duties and Rights of States in the Event of
Civil Strife. The assistance of Cuban officials, including the Cuban

An arms cache of weapons and ammunition recently discovered at the
Idgas Camponesas guerrille training center in the interior of the
Brasilian state of Goias is believed by US Embassy and CAS officers to
bo of Brazilian rather than Cuban arms, despite a Brazilian newspaper
suggestion that they were Cuban. There were also discovered about 125
copies of Communist publications including Che Guevara's well-known
treatise on "Querrilla Warfare". The training center was described as
organized sccording to that book. A confidential report on the discoveries
added that "members of the center want to be the Brazilian equivalent
of those who fought in the Bierre Maestra and so bring the hard Chinese-
Cuban type revolution to Brazil. Some 90 to 95 persons in the locality
are reported members of or sympathetic to the Ligas Camponesas activities,
but only 2 of the 24 for whom warrents were issued have yet been taken
into custody. (Am Emb, Rio de Janeiro 1122, 10 December, CONFIDENTIAL,

33. There have been indications of disapproval of Castro-s
policies on the part of those Latin American Communist parties
which are committed to a more gradual and less violent approach to
revolution. Castro has shown himself willing to collaborate with any
group, Communist or not, willing to resort to violence and in so doing
to circumvent some of the regular Communist parties. Some of the
latter resent such tactics and have appealed to the Soviets against
Castro. It seems likely that the question of relations with other
Latin Amin Communist parties, as well as the question of tactics,
is likely to hamper Communist revolutionary efforts in Latin America
and cause strains in Soviet-Cuban relations.

COREIGN DISSEM
The recent spate of public addresses by leading Cuban officiala
on the subject of insurrection in other Latin American countries reflects
a more aggressive stance than prior to the "missile crisis" and suggests
that a decision to step up Cuban support for subversive groups in other
Latin American countries may be under discussion within the inner circle
of Cuban leaders.
Che Guevara and Education Minister Armando Hart have been in the
forefront since late November in publicly expressing the view that the
only road to the "liberation" of the Latin American peoples is the road of
insurrection. Fidel Castro's earlier public line had been to deny the
necessity for Cuba to "export" its revolution; Cuba's "example" was
sufficient. This line is given only perfunctory attention in the recent
Guevara and Hart speeches. The line emerging in these speeches appears
even stronger than that espoused in the "Second Declaration of Havena"
promulgated last February which suggested that in certain circumstances
Communist-dominated coalitions could come to power by peaceful means. The
whole tenor of the recent speeches suggests that Cuba intends to provide
every assistance within its means to Latin American insurgents. The
attention given in the Cuban press to developments in Venezuela in recent
veeks strongly suggests a more than academic interest in developments there.
Canadian Ambassador Kidd, speculating on the Trotsky-like dedication
to permanent revolution" apparent in a 21 November speech by Armando Hart,
commented that Cuban leaders may be attempting to counter "the humili-
ation of the withdrawal of the Russian missiles" by making renewed efforts
to "light revolutionary fires in neighboring countries," (Comment on:

Among much of the revolutionary left, discussion has
tended to shift to the need for indigenous, nationalist revolutions, and
away from internationalism and alliance with Moscow-oriented
Communists and fidelistas.

Panamanian Communist Party (FDP) leader Ruperto Thomas' recent
trip to Cuba was evidently an effort to persuade Castro to support the
PDP rather than the more activist Panamanian pro-Communist VAN group.
When he returned to Panama on 14 December, Thomes reportedly said that
Jorge Turner, who also went to Havans in September and has not returned,
and other VAN leaders are still campaigning against the FDP in Cuba.
However, the Cubans claim to have told VAN leaders they must cooperate
with the PDP to get Castro support.
The Castro government seems consistently to favor the VAN with
funds and international trips. The Cubans may distrust the PDP's poor
organization and believe VAN charges that the FDP is infiltrated. However,
the VAN is a rather unstable group and the Cubana are probably trying to
keep on good terms with both. Thomas said he received no military training
but was taught a few things like how to dismantle a machine gun.
Thorns commented that no particular group seemed to be in command
in Cuba, resulting in such disorder that it was a wonder the revolution
had survived. He believes the ORI is merely a mechanism.
Merico would not issue Thomas a visa, so he returned to Panama via
Prague where he talked with Czech Communist officials and may have
pleaded the PDP case against VAN with them. (CIA Panama City TDCS-3/

some concessions have eased tensions and softened violent anți-US

To undercut the CCI, the government plans to complete the land

year. Although this may alleviate discontent in the agrarian
sector, rising population and mounting unemployment will continue

reportedly continues, the threat of retaliatory action from forces
rallying around deposed Air Force Chief Lemus has apparently
diminished, and the majority of the armed forces still supports
President Ydigoras. The President's intention with regard to
leftist ex-President Arevalo, who plans to return and seek the
presidency in next December's elections, is an unsettling factor.
The armed forces universally oppose Arevalo. Some factions want
to replace Ydigoras with a civilian-military junta and call new
elections before Arevalo becomes eligible to run in March. Should
Arevalo return, the military will probably move to prevent his
candidacy and the coming months may be critical.
Honduran President Villeda Morales, although not a strong
leader, is expected to complete his term. The ruling Liberal
Party will probably retain the Presidency in the October elections,
and maneuvering for the nomination has begun. Rodas Alvarado,
President of the Congress and one of the three leading contenders,
has used his position to build up strength, but the armed forces
regard him as the least desirable and a developing anti-Rodas
coalition may prevent his nomination. Either of the three leading
candidates would probably follow the present government's policies,
including its relatively soft Communist stand. The Communists,
while not yet a direct threat, are steadily increasing their
influence in the labor field and are exploiting the country's
discouraging political, economic, and social conditions.
El Salvador, faced with a serious Communist threat about
two years ago, continues to show political and economic progress,
but there are clouds on the horizon. President Rivera, who
assumed control last summer in a full return to constitutional
government, still has widespread support and military backing.
The government is moving ahead with its reform program, but
there is some resistance to the proposed new income taxes.
Communist activities have been curbed, but the Communists still
retain a subversive capability particularly among labor and
student groups.
There is concern over the likely election of a
pro-Communist as rector of the university, a center of sub-
version and intrigue.
:
Costa Rica continues to be one of the most democratic and
politically stable countries in Latin America but there are
reverberations of unrest stemming from the deteriorating economic
situation. The ruling National Liberation Party, which was
returned to power in last year's election in a bitterly contested
but peaceful election, represents the liberal left, although it
includes a number of moderates such as President Orlich and some
members of his cabinet. The Communist Party is small and illegal
but well organized and effectively led. It recently instigated
disorders in the banana zone and, while not an immediate threat,
has long-range potential should economic conditions worsen.

Cuban Anniversary Celebrations
C
(See pictures following)
The Cuban Armed Forces parade in Havana yesterday
included infantry, naval, artillery, armor, and air
formations. The most significant display was that
of SA-2 missiles and possible cruise missiles.
Ground units included 15 companies of the 2d Western
Army, units of the National Militia, and other
infantry units in a "new parade step" resembling the
goose step. The artillery unit had antitank guns, heavy
artillery, multiple rocket launchers and AA artillery.
Three battalions of medium tanks, heavy tanks and
assault guns, along with the surface-to-air and possible
cruise missiles made up the final unit of the parade.
The air formations included helicopters, propeller-
type training planes, and MIG-15's, 19's and 21's.
Soviet participation in the parade has not been established,
although Soviets and Czechs may have piloted some of
the aircraft.
Premier Castro's speech following the parade brought
no surprises aside from its unusual brevity. He
made an effort to indicate Cuban control of the air
defense system, including the SA-2's, and, in a
probable reference to US reconnaissance flights, said
there could be an incident "at any time".
Castro reiterated the five demands he first made
after the announcement that the Soviets would
withdraw offensive missiles from Cuba. He
included his usual anti-US statements and slurs at
President Kennedy and made a low-keyed appeal for
"unity" within the Communist Bloc. He called for
revolution in Latin America, with special emphasis
on Venezuela, and cited Cuba's "historic task
of serving as an example" for that revolution.,
"
☑
In the USSR, Cuban and Soviet spokesmen lauded Cuban-
Russian friendship and unity, and the Soviet
spokesman, Suslov, pledged that his country would
"never leave Revolutionary Cuba alone in distress."

Soviet fishing boats, under cover of fishing Atlantic waters,
are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.
The boats are met outside the territorial waters of those
countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.
On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few
Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who
pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American
manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
regime and those taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The
Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda and pamphlets
containing military instructions, the same type of material
being sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico.
A Belgian in Habana who says he represents a Belgian firm,
has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality
of arms for payment in dollars. The Belgian has made a
similar offer of sale of arms to a representative of an
anti-Castro group in Habana.
In August 1962 a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
to use his boat for transporting small groups of men, in
civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also knew of
other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men
and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long as four or
five days. The fisherman did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and arms.

Construction of the fishing port in the Bay of Havana, whose
announcement as a Soviet undertaking caused so much concern last fall,
will be directed by a team of Soviet technicians and Cuban engineers
and will start in February - according to a Havana radio announcement.
The port is to be completed by the end of 1963 and is to cost 12 million
posos, which vill be met by a loan from the Soviet Union, to be amortized
over 10 years. The port is expected to serve 130 vessels of the Soviet
fishing fleet and from 24 to 30 of the Cuban fleet. It will have
installations such as freezer plants for 10,000 tons of fish, factories
for processing see products, machinery for making no less than 80 tons
of ice a day, a fleeting dock to repair ships of up to 2,500 tons, and
well-equipped repair shops. The announcement emphasized that the port is
to be operated by and will be the "absolute property of the Cuban state."
It has also been announced that Poland has now formulated plans for
building the shipyard envisaged in the port of Mariel. The installation
will be managed by Cuban technicians who are presently receiving training
in Polish shipyards on the Baltic. Ship construction will reportedly
reach a level of 70,000 tons per year. (FBIS 58, 17 January, and Daily

THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, PANAMA, AND MEXICO
Central America is relatively stable. Preparations are
under way for President Kennedy's scheduled meeting with the Chiefs
of State of these countries at San Jose, Costa Rica, on 18 and 19
March. Tensions are rising, however, in those countries having
elections scheduled this year%3B Mexico's political stability is
threatened; and the Cuban subversive potential remains a problem
throughout the area.
During the forthcoming meeting, an attempt will be made to
center discussions on areas of common interest. Economic integra-
tion of the Central American region one of the major objectives
of the Alliance for Progress Program will undoubtedly be em-
phasized. Central America, which has been moving toward greater
political unity, has begun to take steps toward economic integra-
tion, and presently envisages the creation of a Common Market by
1965. The Cuban subversive threat is also likely to be given top
priority. All of the Central American countries regard this as
one of the major problems and are seeking ways to meet it.

On 3 February, Nicaraguans are scheduled to cast ballots for
the first time in nearly 30 years for a Presidential candidate
who is not a member of the Somoza family. Rene Schick
the
government's Liberal Party (PLN) candidate and hand-picked by the
Somozas is expected to win easily, however. Effective oppo-
sition to Schick collapsed when the major opposition party
Traditionalist Conservative (PCT) -- boycotted the elections
because the government refused to permit OAS supervision. The
only opponent is Diego Manuel Chamorro Bolanos, a last-minute
candidate of the splinter Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN),
whose entry into the race seems to have been engineered by the
government to provide a semblance of opposition. Castro-
Communist elements, militant conservatives and others may attempt
to create disorders before or during the elections, but the
Nicaraguan National Guard is believed capable of controlling
any troubles short of a general uprising or wel 1-coordinated
rebel invasion neither of which seems likely.
'
Anti-Somoza Nicaraguans have alleged fraudulent registra-
tions and may attempt to challenge the elections. Although
Schick may not turn out to be a Somoza puppet, opposition

Campesino Strike Scheduled in Bolivia
A planned Campesino (peasant) strike in Bolivia today
could lead to violence if it occurs. The Government
reportedly plans to block all entrances into La Paz,
and campesinos loyal to the government are assembling
and arming to counter the strikers who are led by
pro-Communist Torribio Salas.
Torribio Salas. A government spokesman
claims that the Cuban and Czechoslovak Embassies are
financing the strike and that the Cubans are training
campesino militia in other areas as well.

President Paz has reportedly said he will do every-
thing to prevent the strike but will call on loyal
campesinos for aid if he fails. If armed conflict
develops between the two groups of campesinos,
the Armed Forces would probably be forced to step in.
President Paz might also have to take action against
trouble makers like Salas, something he has tried to
avoid.

Three top Brazilian Communist Party officials, including Luis
Carlos Prested, are reported leaving for Cuba vis Prague prior to
13 January to discuss certain political problems with the Cuban
Communists responsible for pro-Cuban activities in the different Latin
American countries. Before leaving they planned to be briefed by a
Brazilian Communist Party member who has just returned from a visit to
party leaders in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia to get their
opinions about holding the "Latin American Congress in Support of Cuba,
now rescheduled for March, in Rio or Sao Paulo. (CIA, Rio de Janeiro,

The National Erecutive Commission of Brasil's orthodox Commmist
Party (PCB) reportedly planned to meet on 7 January to discuss the
party position in relation to Francisco Juliao, Brazilian Peasant-League
leader who has been closer to Brazil's dissident hard-line Comminist
Party than to its orthodox group (CPB). The PCB leaders planned to
consider the possibility of sending a high-level party delegation to
Cuba to confer with Fidel Castro, not only to improve relations but
to protest a report that Castrol is supporting Juliao. (CIA Sao Paulo,
TDCS-3533404, 9 January, SECRET)
Comment: Cuba has for some time had a divisive influence on
Brazilian Communist affairs. The dissident Communist Party formed in
late 1961 has - like Juliao favored a more revolutionary line and has
apparently received considerably more support from Cuba than has the
orthodox party. Another indication of the divisive influence of Cubo
is the report that Francisco Leives Otero, PCB loader responsible for
matters pertaining to Cuba, attacked party subservience to the CPSU at
a national PCB conference on 29 November. Leivas maintained that the
PCB should discuss the Sino-Soviet dispute with complete independence,
rather than maintain silence on it as it had been doing. (SECRET)
