this was that Oswald was an ex-Marine, and had been through
this process, and that therefore at least that he might have
been acting within the context of the Soviet plan, is that
right?
Mr. Angleton. That is the thrust of what he was trying

negate the implication of the original Golitzen call or that
they were involved?
Mr. Angleton. I want to congratulate you, because that

Mr. Angleton. Just to show you the ground you are
treading on, Golitzen gave us information regarding the
penetration of our own organization. And we worked down to
identity. And the FBI disagreed with us. And I am talking
about not a few minutes, but several weeks and months of work.
23
And the Bureau's attitude was, you have got the wrong man, and
24
the allegation therefore does not affect the CIA, and we

Coming back to what you stated, with our litmus paper and
with our analysis of him, we treated him as a walk-in, as
part of the thing to confirm Nosenko's bona fides, and the
build-up.
And he is the one who gave the full description of
the fact that for six months the place was immobilized for this
investigation, of all the high level all over the works,

Senator Mathias. You contrasted the way that the Russians

in that connection, to your knowledge was Oswald every

Mr. Angleton. I don't know

I probably would know, but

13
I don't know whether the military normally that would fall
within the jurisdiciton of the military, since he was a
military man who defected.
So I don't know' the answer to that

Senator Mathias. What about from Cuba?
17
Mr. Angleton. I can't answer that.

Mr. Angleton. I think the Bureau interviewed him.

General, and then there would be somebody in the Senate or

during the military phase began to take on a character of
their own in the civilian phase in the very long term Soviet

And then I got into all fields of labor, subversion,
illegal immigrants, and then revolution. I was in Greece.
And our penetrations at that period were fairly high level and
sophisticated, because of the reaction to Stalin.
And as the Soviet troops occupied new territories, it
was faced with these ambiguities, the defectors coming
over to us at very high levels.
And in the course of this, of course, was the Israeli
immigration. Technically we were still a part of AFHQ, which

were that our activities be directed in supporting their

prevent immigration.

ministers. And they were very much involved.

came from, say, an engineer that had a factory, or what not,
in other words, it had a very direct bearing on our own
R&D and our own defense budget.
Now, our own way of handling it was to give false
attribution, reports, so that if the report was ever compro-
mised, it would not compromise the operations, or the immi-
gration. And, therefore, that was one of the issues.
On the other issue was that to politicize the Agency,
as I stated, on the tactical problems, which are going to
be with us for a long time.

I started from the south side with two Jewish men who
worked with me during the war. He sent them over as ordinary

He wanted to make a real attempt to see if there could ever

We had two allies that had just fought a war with us, and

both of whom betrayed us. And Eden's head went with it. And tha

Mr. Angleton. I have heard that, but I haven'tlooked at
the dossier for the last ten years. He came to our attention
basically in connection with the leaks in the Bay of Pigs.
Senator Tower. Will you go back to the Szule-Wells-
5
Angleton meeting?
6
Angleton. This basically
the thing that began to
really disturb me was, number one, his comment, as I said before,
8
tha Hersh told him that the thing that really bothered him
9
about this story was that it came fromthe same source who
10
gave him the 22nd of December, without identifying him, and the
11
fact that when he was going through this business that he had

the best sources in the Agency, and that was Sidney Gottlieb,
and here was a scientific allegation, plutonium and the
scientist and all the rest of them.
And again, if he did have a live source in that
area, that means he would have a live source across the board.
When he asked me about my successor, told him that
I was not prepared to respond to that, that every new man was
entitled to one free shave.
And he says, I know your successor. And I don't think he
actually mentioned the name. But in this article which has jus

Senator Baker. Who was your successor?

Mr. Angleton. Goorge Kalaris.

They were consistent, but they weren't

Mann is a person who fits within the Philby, et cetera,
complex in a false story of this sort, which comes to the
British who pull out a file on Mann, and they read down and
go back into the fact of Mann's association with me, Mann's
association with Philby, all this stuff of my actions with the
Israelis and all that, regardless of what the U.S. Government
tells the British or the French, or the Canadians, or the

technology and technological assistance, was passed to the

straightforward story without any if's, and's and but

of the question that he asked?

work against that Russian business in order to transfer the
knowledge to Vietnam.

And therefore he used those

Well, to begin with, I went into OSS in
1943, in 1943 from the infantry: And then Iwas assigned to an

Donovan. My immediate chief was James R. Murphy, who had been
a protegee and obtained his law degree in General Donovan's
office. And he is a practicing attorney here in Washington.
And he was Chief of X-2, which was the counter intelligence.
And during that time a number of us were put together who
had never had any experience in the subject.

That is enough of Cherapanov.

So immediately we tried to get the breadth of his career
that we know where the priorities are. And the first thing
he tells us is that while he was in the Second Chief
Directorate in the American Section, Oswald's KGB dossier went
over his desk. And his first story, as I recall it, was that
it was two volumes or three volumes. And finally it went down
to one volume and a small sheaf of papers.
Also he said that the dossier showed clearly that Oswald
was mentally unbalanced, and that he was a poor shot, and
therefore couldn't get a hunting license, and a lot of stuff
20
of this sort.

which had responsibility from the Russian KGB for assassina-

And we had observed
12
13
14
that when the Russians transferred documents concerning
Oswald, that there was no reference in there to any such
debriefing by Department 13. And another important part of

in the normal course of events, we might have put Golitzen in
contact with Nosenko, which may have meant the assassination
of Golitzen, because the whole approach of Nosenko was one
where logically you would bring them in and have two bodies,
one from the First Chief Directorate, that is, Golitzen, the

against the KGB. But we didn't do that. Because there were
certain things, litmus papers, questions put to Nosenko. And
as far as I was concerned, if he was bona fide he would have
answered one way, and he did not answer that way. And they had
to do with some deeper secrets regarding a meeting of the
2000 members of the KGB and the Soviet Government in May of
1959, presided over by Shelepin and attended by many members
of the Central Committee on the reorientation of the Soviet

it was given to Helms or somebody, or Mr. McCone, who passed

Mr. Schwarz. Was there a connection between the FBI and
Oswald?
Mr. Angleton. I don't know the full FBI story. I know
there was tremendous flap in the Bureau. And one of the best
men they had in my view is a professional a man called Burt
Turner, who I understand just got his law degree. And Burt
Turner was one of the finest men on Soviet KGB activities in
10
the US, one of the analyzts. And he was in the Washington
11
Field Office. And it is my understanding
and this is
12
basically hearsay, but from pretty good sources
--
that Burt
13
Turner was handling the Oswald ore related matters at the time
14
the President made the trip down to Texas, and that there was
15
some confusion that the Bureau had not turned over, or had
16
not taken enough initiative in turning over, all the informa-

tion on Oswald to the local police. I had been told that
there was a black mark put against Turner's name, and that he
confronted Mr. Hoover and stated he was not going to permit,
or have it be known to his children, that his negligence was
responsible for the death of the President.
And he was pretty
forceful about his position. And as a result, this was
expunged or something to that effect. And that is the reason
he went to the Washington Field Office instead of staying in

And
we know enought about the Second Chief Directorate and the

automatically, to any part of the Soviet Union he went, there
would be a dossier that would go, and there would be also an
operational directive to put him on tap, check his mail, to
do the following, and so on and to put an agent near him.
There wouldn't be any leaking anything in the air on that.

a Frenchman. And I might add that the Frenchman never re-

single important breakthrough of the entire war. And he had
obtained it about eitht to nine or ten years prior to the out-
break of war, when it was non-operative. And he had the
prescience to know that the systems could only be one thing,
that it would be operative in a time of war.

No, through Soviet agents and everything,

at my house. They were absolutely boiling, because they had

And that is what he told them, he said, stand down on
this and I will be back in touch.
And then Bill told me the whole story in detail of how
he had gone over from California and followed him in this
thing, and how Harvey had put him in his car and he went off.

And also I wanted a person, because there was a radio
going to be put into Havana, and let somebody say we need a
radio in Havana, or drop some men in. And then the point is,
I get the radio to Tel Aviv, and to Havana and then put it
someplace, and then tell him, you go to such and such a place
and find the radio, and then have some men come in and call
the whole setup.
So for many a long period of time this worked perfectly.

And he would spot one of the waiters or a headwater who was
Jewish and it wouldn't be long before he would say, you are
from the Israeli Embassy, and pretty soon one thing led to
another, and his production was without question the greatest
production there was.
Well, it got so complex in names and geography, and so on,
that is when I came to the point that I brought Harvey
together secretly with this individual, the only person I put
in touch was an Israeli, in this context. So later on the
