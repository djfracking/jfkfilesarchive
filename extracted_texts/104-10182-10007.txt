Miami, Fla.
Dear Mr. Sounders:
Miami, Fla. Ausust 13 1935
Three months have passed by since my return from
Leopoldville and as I explained to you in our rast
meetings, the angunts borresponding to the basic pay
of of March, April and up to the 13th of May, when
my contract expired- are still unpaid therefore lea-
ving an outstanding balance of $1950.00 in my favor.
row
Although I areciate your concern in this case,
I wish to info about certain facts concerning
my work in the Congo that will explain how every cent
of the mentioned alcunt was earned.
When pilot Fausto Gomez was shot down near Bunia
-Dec. 17th 1964- that Air Base became paralized as
two of the pilets resigned and the only one remaining
was ready to leave. Every one refused to take charge
of the Bunia Base beeruse of the proximity of the re-
bels, dangerous terrain, living conditions below stan-
dards, improper food, etc. Under these adverse circums
tances I accepted the position of Chief Pilot and left
the confortable quarters of Stanleyville. Arrived to
Bunia Dec. 25th 186 and next day reasured full air
operations against the rebels flying two and three mis-
sions per day as squadrom leader with now unexperienced
pilots. These pilots did not have shooting, combat ma-
nuvering instruction, therefore I instructed then and
also in Dead Reckoning, instrument flying, etc. We hit
the enemy day by day forcing them to retreat to the ve-
ry border of Northeast Congo. M. Godofroid. Munongo -Mi-
nister of the Interior- personally congratulated us for
Your accomplishments in behalf of the Congo.
When I became ill, due to improper food, parasites,
etc.. I was ordered back to Lecpoldville for medical
treatment. Unable to recover and having lost 25 pounds,
Dr. Elkhoury suggested fe return to Miami for a more a-
dequate treatment. Photostatic copy of certificate are
attached. Loft Loopeldville April 3 1965 with the un-
derstanding that my contract was not being cancelled.
I sincerely believe that my work and dedication thro-
ughout the entire campaing in Northeast Congo deser-
ved the full payment of the mentioned contract.
Your consideration to this matter would be apprecia-
ted.

:
1.
On 22 June 1971. Mr. Ed Sullivan, WH/Security officer,
informed DC/WH/COG that he had been advised by SOD that Mr.
WHITEHOUSE was in Miami and had some information which he would

with the Agency from November 1964 to April 1965 as a pilot under
the WITHRUSH Project in the Congo. He has not worked for the
Agency since that time.
2. Mr. Sullivan requested SOD to have Mr. WHITEHOUSE
use the Domestic Contact Service channel in Miami for passing
his information to us.

Dear Mr. Medell,
Mr. Whitehouse was seen by me 8. April 1965 for
a return physical examination. All laboratory
and Xray that date was relative the complete
physical examination.
The $10.00 charge for treatment included injection,
medicine and prostate massage. Ther was no
extra Charge for sinus treatment.
Office visits from April 9th through 28th were
primarily for his tenseness and apprehension.
The only additional charge, relative his sinus
condition, was a $20.00 charge for sinus Xrays
on April 9, 1965.

Re: WHITEHOUSE, EDUARDO
Dear Mr. Medell,
Mr. Whitehouse has had sinus trouble off and on
for many years. This has been increased recently,
probably due to pressure changes in aircraft.
It has been advised that he have a nasal operation
for deviated septum. 1 This structural defect is in
no way related to his occupation.

SUBJECT
WITHRUSH Contrect
14 May
1965
On Wednesday, 12 May 1965, I discussed with Mr. Dơw
Letcher, OP/CPD, the WITHRUSH contract with which you are
familiar and under which Bouardo Whitehouse served in the
Ceago. This is the standard contract for Cuban and Europesa
WITHRUSH pilot omployees. Specifically, I was interested in
learning from Mr. Letcher if he believed Paragraph 7 D could
be applicable to the case of Mr. Whitehouse stnoe Mr. Whitehouse
desires assistance in paying medical bills for a physical dis-
ability (which may be temporary) which may have been incurred
while he was serving with us in the Congo.
2. This covorandus makes record of the fuct that, judging
from what Mr. Lecohur had to say about the WITHUSH contract,"
and also in view of Mr. Ben DePelice's recently expressed con-
oarn regarding the besefits aspects of that contract, action
should be taken to review and, if necessary, revise the contrast
at the earilost possihis date. This steas from the strong pog-
cibility that Cuban pilots who suffer injuries or disabilities
while serving with WITHRUSH may wish, as in the case of done,
to olata benefits after the termination of the contract, for
conditions which originates during the term of the contract.

3. Evaluation of each pilot as follows:
a.
-
Iden A Had flown C-46 about 1200 hours before and was
picking it up very nicely. I gave several engine our - · single
engine landing and go-arounds - no flap landing - emergency geer
extension. Short field landings several ILS approaches.
-
'
b. Iden C Was the pilot who cracked up the other C-46, plus
he was unwilling to fly at night. I gave him 1½ hours of air time
and recommended he be used only as a co-pilot on grounds of poor
head work.
˚C. Iden B
-
He is an older pilot who would bounce the airplane
and then sit there waiting for it to hit again, without adding posser
to let it down easy.
He also wanted to feather the wrong engine
after one was cut. Recommended he only be used as a co-pilot.
d.
Iden D - He had been flying in and around Iden ) for several
years, however, in his training he was quite sloppy in his flying.
he would not come within 200 of assigned heading turns at the begining.

Mr. Whitehouse was seen by me yeaterday for a
general physical examination. He holds a current
F.A.A. Class II medical certificate issued by
me 10 Nov. 1964.
Mr. Whitehouse related a history as follows:
He has been out of the country for five months
and had bloody diarrhea off and on for 2½ months.
He has had sinus trouble with pain and nasal
discharge and increased symptoms with pressure
changes. His weight loss has been 20 pounds.
His prostate became inflammed and tender.

Results of yesterdays physical exam are as follows:
Chest Xray was normal and consistant with one taken
at this office 10 November 1954; E.E.N. & T. all
normal; Heart normal size, rhythm, sounds; Abdomen.

Dear Captain Whitehouse:
Thank you for your views and observations contained
in your letter of 22 October 1964. Your interest is
appreciated.
Contrary to the information on which you base your
desire to discuss Cuban matters, be advised that this
agency is not rendering help to Cuban organizations.--
Thus it is believed that a discussion of this topic would
not be of benefit to either of us.
Thank you again for your interest.

Dear Mr. McCone:
I am one of the Cuban rints survivor of the
Bay of Pigs ill-fated invasion to Tuba. Flow
several missions and talk with the four Ano-
rican pilots who died in the morning of April
15th 1961 while flying as volunteers for our
cause.
Contrary to the general in on that the
CIA was to lame for that fiasco, I wish to
express to you my admiration on gratitude
an
for the exellent instruction received wile
training in entral Amori a anor those who
-gave-up-their-ives for the cause of Democra-
cy. A wrong and regretele decision by the
Administration turned a positive victory in-
to a sh meful defeat for the Cubans and the
United States.
I understand that corte n than organizations
are receiving direct holy from your Agenty. Re-
gret to inform you that most of them are unwor-
thy of such help and not so long ago, their lea-
ders were astro's followers..
"
Would "ike the opportunity of discussing this
matter personally with you for the welfare of both
our countries
Please accept the testimony of my highest con-
sideration.

Dear Jerry:
Wish to thank you for your personal concern
and satisfactory solution obtained in the finan-
cial settlement of my case.
I consider it a privilege to have worked with
you, cooperating in a small way to preserve De-
mocracy in the Republic of Congo.
If I can ever be of service to the United
States -beloved country of my ancestors- I would
consider it a high honor.
Do let me hear from you and feel sure that I
am your devoted friend.

:
1. Edward W. LORENTZ met with Eduardo Whitehouse on 17 August
1965, relative to finalizing the Whitehouse claim for monies still
due from his previous contract. LORENTZ emphasized that he was
authorized to pay monies due per contract through 7 April 1965,
plus a four day layover in Rome during Whitehouse's return to the
"U.S. This layover was due a Panam strike of which Whitehouse was
inadvertently delayed through no fault of his own.
2.
The aforegoing authority is based on ref and calculated
as follows:
-
A. Base Pay for March USD 800.
B. Base Pay 7/30 for April - USD 186.66
plus USD equivalent of USD 41.00 for actual expenses
while 2 days in Rome.
C. Total USD 1027.66.
3.
Whitehouse although feeling that he should be allowed the
full amounts due amounting to USD 1950.00 has accepted such adjud-
ication of his claim. LORENTZ feels that possibly he was suffic-
iently satisfied that he received any funds, that probably in his
sense of fair play that the case might be considered closed.

professional pilot and could be an asset to KÜBARK interests.
