CAN ANEERING
}
SUBJECT
Chief, WHD
Replacement for Arnold F. AREHART during Home Leave
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Reference:
HMMA 23522
1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's apprecia-
tion of Newton T. RUTSAY's high level of performance during his
recent TDY in Mexico and requested his return TDY was brought to
the attention of the appropriate KURIOT officials.
.
2. Unfortunately, RUTSAY will not be available to replace
AREHART during the latter's home leave period in the fall of 1964,
and KURIOT has no one else they can release for a prolonged period
this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two months,
Headquarters wonders whether a technician is absolutely required.
Does the Station believe that an operations officer, with some
Spanish and who could merely take over the administrative work and
make the Station contacts, could fill in during this period?
3. We are not sanguine that a replacement can be made avail-
able particularly since the man will of necessity need to be
In the
"exposable" to liaison, but will try our best to find one.
meantime, please forward the exact dates it is desired the hoped
for man should be in Mexico to allow for adequate overlap.

1. MOSCOW'S STATEMENT OF 11 SEPTEMBER ON CUBA APPEARS DESIGNED TO
ADVANCE VARIETY OF SOVIET OBJECTIVES, FOREMOST AMONG THEM BEING TO
DETER US FROM ACTIVE INTERVENTION IN CUBA. ALTHOUGH STATEMENT AGAIN
USED VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE TO AVOID CLEAR-CUT COMMITMENT TO
DEFEND CUBA IN ALL CONTINGENCIES, IT HAS FURTHER ENGAGED SOVIET
PRESTIGE IN ENSURING SURVIVAL OF CASTRO REGIME. AS BEFORE, HOWEVER,
USSR IS ATTEMPTING TO CREATE IMPRESSION CUBA IS UNDER PROTECTION OF
SOVIET NUCLEAR AND MISSILE POWER.
STATEMENT WAS ALSO CALCULATED TO ENABLE MOSCOW TO CLAIN FULL
CREDIT FOR HAVING PROTECTED CUBA IF NO US-SUPPORTED INVASION OR
INTERFERENCE WITH SOVIET SHIPPING MATERIALIZES, IN ADDITION TO THIS
DETERRENT EFFECT, MOSCOW APPARENTLY IS ATTEMPTING TO CHECK GROWING
CONCERN IN US AND LATIN AMERICA OVER SOVIET INTENTIONS IN CUBA, IT
STRESSED DEFENSIVE NATURE OF SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT BEING FURNISHED
CUBANS AND IMPLICITLY DENIED ANY SOVIET INTENTION TO ESTABLISH
MILITARY HINES BASES IN CUBA.

1. Arnold F. AREHART asked that his TDY replacement
inquire at Headquarters regarding the status of his request
for equipment which the Station forwarded to Headquarters as
Requisition No. 359-19-64. Headquarters has shipped to
Corpus Christi the items he requested in connection with
the Revere (shipped 20 April), and the Heath and Allied items
were shipped on 7 May. The Ampex and B-10 items have not yet
been received at Headquarters from the supplier. Headquarters
will pouch all items from these that weight and size will
permit, the remainder will have to be shipped to Corpus
Christi. In view of the equipment listed in LGIS 6020,
18 May 1964, which is also awaiting pickup at Corpus Christi,
perhaps there will be a flight soon.
2. It is requested that the above information be
passed to AREHART.

SUBJECT
: LIENVOY TDY Report
1. TDY support of the LIENVOY operation in Mexico
City was provided by this office during the period 23 April to
15 May 1964. The Staff Agent, ARNOLD F. AREHART who manages
this operation underwent surgery for a hernia on the 24th of April.
The undersigned assumed the responsibilities and performed the
duties associated with the LIENVOY operation during AREHART's
convalescence. He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until
12 May. His operation was successful and recovery was normal.
AREHART returned to work on 12 May in a weakened condition and
three days of overlap was allowed to provide assistance with
the more strenuous and tiresome chores.
2. The LIENVOY installation was found to be in
excellent condition. The operating personnel were well disciplinod
and their procedures were well organized. The daily work was
being accomplished in a business like and efficient manner.
AREHART has done a commendable job in establishing and main-
taining this highly productive operation,
3. The equipment in this installation has been in use
fifteen hours a day for over four years. As the result of good
maintenance practices it is in good shape and functioning well.
The minor difficulties encountered during the shake down period
have been overcome and equipment maintenance and repair pose
no significant problem There was no loss of coverage on any
line during the three week TDY.
4. The following observations and recommendations are
included herein to improve KURIOT services to the Field and to
aquaint responsible officers with technical discrepancies.
A.
Pertinent technical information is not being
communicated to AREHART.

1. Attached are two copies of General Alberto Bayo's book
(in Spanish) for use in briefing or training agents or members of
security forces with which we have liaison. This book is a "do-it-
yourself” guide to paramilitary and sabotage techniques. It demon-
strates Cuban support for such activities and the need for training
in counter-reasures by friendly security forces,
2. Headquarters has recommended that all WH Stations have
one or zero of these books, especially those where official or unofficial
lisison exists with a security force.
3.
It Station Mexico is interested in this book, a limited
number of cepies can be obtained. Prior to releasing any of these copies,
Headquarters must know the individual and service receiving the book
thereby allowing its clearance release.

The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,
Dial Recorder has been a constant nuisance since
the beginning of this operation. The pressure
sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this
problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure
tape were received after nearly four years of
struggling with the defective pens. It is
recommended that pressure sensitive tape be
supplied to this operation for future use.
The tea rolls of pressure sensitive tape
received during this TDY were wound back-
wards on their spindles.
The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are
drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate
traction on the flywheel. This causes tape
feed problems. It is recommended that three
dosen new idler wheels be pouched to AREHART
immediately. Several of the defective idler
wheels are available in this office for
inspection.

FYI. 1. In connection Venezuelan complaint to ais,
discussions in Standing Group of NSC have identified two
alternatives for cooperative system surveillance and interception
of vessels and aircraft engaged in transporting arms for subversive ·
purposes to Latin America (especially Caribbean area) directly
or indirectly from Cuba. Difference between alternatives centers
on need for CAS authorization for use of force in international
waters.
2. Alternative A would require OAS authorization use of
force in connection with visit-and-search in international waters
against selected Cuban vessels and selected vessels OAS countries,
It would be a cooperative system of surveillance and interception
involving visit-and-search in international waters on a siective
basis, with force to be used if necessary.
Visit-and-search and,
if resistance met, force would be applied by naval units of US
or of cooperating als countries against selected vessels suspectèd
of transporting arms from Cubu,directly or indirectly.

Alternative B would not require OAS authorization
use force inasmuch as visit-and-scurch would take place only
within territorial waters. It would be a cooperative system of
surveillance and interception involving visit-and-search only
within the territorial waters of an OAS country, with force to be
applied, if necessary, by that country's forces or by forces of
another QAS country acting under a bilateral agreement.
Control
of suspect vessels destined for non-OAS country or territory
(e. g. British Guiana) would depend on cooperation that county.
4. In both alternatives interception or seizure of
suspect aircraft would be carried out only in territory of als
country of destination by forces of that country or of another
OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement.
5. Comparison of alternatives:
(a) Alternative A would be much harder to sell to
OAS countries than Alternative B because authorization for use
of force rquired.
(b) Alternative A would be somewhat more effectiv
both in fact and as deterrent than Alternative B, although both
can be circumvented.
(c) Alternative A would constitute harassment of
Castro whereas Alternative B is purely defensive.
(d) Alternative A would incur substantially
greater risks of escalation than Alternative B.

TELLO SCORES CAS ROLICIES, CUMA EXCLUSION
Havana in English to Europe 2020 GHT 11 December 1953--E
(Tr) Hexico City--Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello criticized
the Organization of American States, saying that it is in a state of
crisis. Tello also criticized the exclusion of Cuba from that
organization. In the interview with the Mexican daily NOVEDADES,
Foreign Minister Tello said timt Cuba's exclusion on the CS is not
in conformity with the Q'S charter. He said that the charter does
not contemplate the exclusion of any member state.
Referring to the present international situation of the OAS, Tello
emplasized that an organization which does not base itself of friended
cooperation, and tolerance is likely to face a crisis. The Nexican foreign
minister stated that in the present state of the OS, the clements or
bases for the organization to strengthen democracy do not exist.
pointed out that contrary to agreemonts adopted at Chapultepec and
Bogota, almost all the present Latin American representatives to the
QAS are also their countries' ambassadors. in Washington.

Vice President Junu Lechin on behalf of the foreigners held at Catavi

The cable says: "I appeal to your labor union principles in the name of
the 28 million ORIT member workers in favor of the hostages. These
persons are well known es democrats working in Davor of the spirit of
hwarity and social economic progress. The Bolivian revolution," the
message adds, "demands that its prestige and vindication be held high."

PANAMA
12 Lucumber 1903
PLAN OF TERRORISM IS UNFOLDING
David La Voz del Paru in Spanish 2100 (2 11 December 1963--P
(Station commentary)
(Te:) It appears as if a preconceived plan of terrorism, not known
before in Panama, has been unleashed since members of our armed forces
were at Fort Gulick. The barbarous death of labor leader Aguilar,
beaten and kicked in Puerto Armuelles; the beating of Intian Rebor
Leader Palacios Salines; the denunciation through a newspaper of a
labor leader who was lianged and beaten in Colon; another case in
Boquete; and many other known cases constitute pathetic proof of the
pian.
If the objective of the wave of persecution is to attack the ideas of
men with bullets, sticks, imprisonment, and other similar measures,
it is a stupid move, because ideas are fought with Meas. If some
of the humble class try to protest in defense of their rights, they
are called communists. The privileged classes have used frequently
this pretext against the working classes. If we analyze the situation
we will see how the privileged classes have maintained their own
monopolistic organization.
The oligarchic groups have greatly increased. Yesterday they could be
represented in the two or three existing parties which were directed
and governed by them; today, they have seen the need to increase the
number of political parties, as much as 20 in a small country, in order
to control the public administration. Each party is formed by a
privileged family whose only wish is to continue its life of leisure
and luxury. This kind of life calls for plenty of noney, so in crder
to obtain the money they need they increase each day the taxation
of the poor, who must pay and thus sink deeper into poverty, discase,
and ignorance.
Ir the people do not have work, they cannot earn money; and if they
do not have money they cannot pay taxes. If the people try to
organize in self-defense, they are accused of being communists,
and they are fought with sticks. If the cause of all the evils
of democracy is communism, the solution is obvious. We all know who
invented communism, and who is living according to it and upholding it.
The way to fight communism is to open sources of work to build schools,
hospitals, and better roads.

FRUSTRATED BY AIDE TO ROMERO, LT. RODRIGUEZ, WHO REFUSES PERMIT "WITTEN-
BERGER TALK TO ROMERO, EVEN WHEN HE AVAILABLE, WHICH IS RARE BECAUSE
OF NUMEROUS OFFICIAL CEREMONIES. WHEN WETHER ILL CALLED MORNING 28 MARCH,
RCDRIGUEZ SAID ROMERO HAD JUST TALKED TO WITTENBERGER AND MADE APPOINT-
MENT WITH HIM FOR FIVE O'CLOCK SAME AFTERNOON. WHEN WETHRILL SAID THIS
IMPOSSIBLE, R INSISTED HAD BEEN PRESENT DURING CONVERSATION.
2. WETHERILL CALLED AT 800 HRS, ASKED IF ALLEGED WITTENBERGER HAD
APPEARED ON SCHEDULE. RODRIGUEZ COUNTERED BY ASKING NAME WETHERILL'S
SECRETARY. GAVE HIM FIRST NAME. R SAID WOULD CALL BACK, AND HAS NOT
DONE SO. BELIEVE THIS IS END OF THE LINE. ONLY ALTERNATIVE AT THIS
FOINT IS TO ABANDON COMPLETELY SECURITY WHICH ALREADY BADLY LACERATED.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief,
ATTENTION
SUBJECT
Chief, Technical Services Division
Chief, TSD/AOB
: Request for TOY Replacement for Arnold F.
AREHART.
1
-
1. WH Division requests your cooperation in providing a
TDY replacement for Arnold F. ANEHART as Case Officer and
AREPART
technician for the 1IENVOY tap center in Mexico City,
has requested three weeks hope leave, from 10 to 23 September,
to drive his older son to the States to enroll him in his
freshman year of college ARFHART has kept his leave plans
to a minimum so that his TDY replacement will need to be on
loan from Headquarters for as short a time as possible.
2. The Division had offered to provide an operations
officer as a TDY replacement but Mexico City Station has re-
quested that a technician he sent instead since the burden of
AREHART's job is the maintenance of equipment along with the
WH Division sug-
protection of CTA's interests inside the UP.
gests that your release of Mr. Charles Deck for this assign-
ment would be ideal if he is available, as no overlap would
be required since he is already knowledgeable of this opera-
tion. The Station was also very pleased with the work done
by Mr. Deck on his last TPY to Mexico.
3. Because of the critical role the LIFNVOY Project
plays in the Station's whole operational picture, and because
of the importance the smooth-functioning of the IP is to car
liaison with top-level чexican officials, your assistance is
requested. If Mr. Beck is not available, any other suitable
candidate would be acceptable. Please inform Mr. Bustos,
WH/1/Mexico, X-4506, -4507 of your decision
your decision, as we would like
to be able to inform Mexico as soon as possible as to whether
a TDY replacement will be available.

1. The Polish proposal for a Central European
nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957
session of the UN General Assembly by the Polish Foreign
Minister. Adam Rapacki. Acting as spokesman for the
Polish Government, he formulated the proposal: should
both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-
tion and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,
Poland would simultaneously introduce an identical ban on
her territory. Rapacki did not mention Czechoslovakia,
but the head of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking
after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his
country would join the agreement, extending the ban over
her territory, too. The East Germans subsequently warmly
endorsed the proposal.
2. Rapacki's proposal had obviously been cleared and
coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.
Moscow promptly reported the proposal approvingly and the
Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would be wel-
comed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreement
on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and would
"help improve relations and bring closer together" the two
German states.
3. The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957
Polish government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki
to the US, British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw. The
then Soviet Premier, Bulganin, promptly endorsed the pro-
posal in a series of letters to heads of governments through-
out the world.
4. In 1958 Rapacki modified his plan, allegedly to make
it more palatable to the Western powers. The new version
of the plan, published in November 1958, called for a two-
stage program, in which: (1) current nuclear stockpiles and
bases would be frozen and production of nuclear weapons would
be banned in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany,
and (2) existing nuclear stockpiles and weapons would be

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement
for the four-nation area. The revised version of the
plan also called for "air and ground control' with NATO
and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control
system.
5. Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal
agreement on the Rapacki plan. Shortly after the opening
of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the
Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation
of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. The memorandum
basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the
Rapacki plan. The Soviet delegation is currently urging
that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question
of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.
6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it has had
strong support from Moscow. The Soviets have even urged
extending the zone to include Baltic and Balkan countries.
Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a means of
eliminating German power in Central Europe--one of Moscow's
major foreign policy objectives.
7.
The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing
it as a Bloc device to neutralize Germany, to deepen and
even perpetuate the division of Germany, and to secure
de facto recognition of East Germany. Implementation of the
proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous to the
West. US military power in Europe would be diminished with-
out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength. It would
weaken NATO.
8. The West German government is also vigorously op-
posed to the Rapacki plan and all such "disengagement" plans
in Central Europe for the same reasons. Bonn also considers
such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the
West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt with as if they
were inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creation
of conditions for their eventual communization.
4
9.
Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican
president would mark the first such specific approval by a
government leader outside the Soviet Bloc. His endorsement
would be widely propagandized by the Poles and the Soviets
and could set a precedent for them to secure such approval
by other nonbloc leaders.

For Your Information
DIRECTOR-65355, 12 January 1969
1. As indicated in Reference and other communications, a
training request was made by the Station and approved by Headquarters,
to train a group under the LIENVOY Project to follow up on leads
produced by the joint LIENVOY operation and presumably other
Mexican Government unilateral sources. Lee R. MYLECHRAINE, WOMOLD
instructor who was assigned to the Mexico City Station until
8 July 1968, was selected as the instructor. MYLECHIRAINE arrived
in Mexico City on 9 January 1969; the training began on 13 January
and ended on 10 February 1969. The training was conducted at a
training site, Calle Tabasco #228, Colonia Roma, Postal Zone 7,
Mexico City, provided by LIENVOY-2 and LIELEGANT; the building in
which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT,
and the latter and LIENVOY-2 have their offices there.
The unit,
upon completion of the training, will use the apartment in which
the training was conducted for their offices.

reviewed all written work with them, as well as plans for meetings,
etc., and this proved most helpful. Somewhat unusual for Latins,
all students were punctual; there were some very small and unimpor-
tant delays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly
difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons
apparently beyond their control. No student was absent from classes
during the entire training period, and no student was late for
more than 45 minutes or an hour,

In summary, the instructor and the Station feel that the
training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although
not yet experienced operators, have a sufficient enough understanding
of the basic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit them to
begin operations. They are all intelligent and alert men, and

aware where he was living in Mexico City. Likewise, they are not
aware that he has served previously in Mexico. There were no
incidents involving security during the training period, and no
other incidents or events that should be reported.

their men be trained. However, upon arrival in Mexico City and
