BACKGROUND:
S. C. Hocking, who has the formal title of Ei
Eirst
Secretary-Migrant Matters, Australian Embassy, Washington, D. C.,
has advised that the Vietnam Protest Movement in Australia
is considering inviting prominent Americans to lecture in
Australia on Vietnam. Martin Luther King, Jr., President of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, has been
mentioned by this group as one they might invite for this
purpose. Mr. Hocking has requested that he be furnished any
information of a political or subversive nature concerning
King so that his Director-General can brief the Prime Minister
of Australia.
OBSERVATION:
Since there is a good possibility King might be
invited to Australia in the near future, it is deemed
desirable to advise appropriate government officials of
his heavy alliance to Communist advisors and his immoral
conduct.

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed,
that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought
up to date.
This is an excellent suggestion and we have already
started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-
ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level
officials in Government of the wholly disreputable character
of King.
As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's
group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project
has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.
Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on
this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it
in a hard-hitting manner. To make the brief timely, we will
have it completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

Issue raised by the SSC here is that they have
detected in their investigation of the Internal Revenue
Service and through review of Cointelpro documents furnished
to them by the FBI instances relating to FBI use of tax
return information. Included in this material were a
number of cases in which the FBI locally requested and,
according to the documents, received tax returns or tax
return information from Internal Revenue Service employees.
Earlier the SSC had sought to interview individuals who
assisted us in several of our Cointelpro operations.
successfully resisted these attempts to obtain the identities
of such individuals and our assent to such interview by the
SSC. We were sustained in our position by the Attorney
General, Our position was based on the fact that we considered
that we had an obligation, expressed or implied, of confi-
dentiality toward such sources who had acted on our behalf.
We
The SSC now raises a question as to whether our
position concerning contacts with and identities of employees
of the Internal Revenue Service is the same as with the
"confidential sources." For the reasons cited in our letter
we do not believe it would be possible to sustain such an
argument.

Reference is made to memorandum from Mr. Michael E.
Shaheen of the Department of Justice to Mr. John A. Mintz
of this Bureau, captioned "Sonate Select Committee Request,"
dated September 9, 1975. Reference is also made to lotter
dated September 5, 1975, to Mr. Shaheen from Mr. Mark
Gitonstein of the SSC staff.
The issue raised in roforenced communications is
whether employees of the Internal Revenue Service who
supplied tax returns or tax return information to Special
Agents of the FBI in response to formal or informal requests
are to be characterized as "confidential sources" and, as
such, to be spared being interviewed by the SSC.
It is the position of this Bureau that regardless
of the formality or informality of requests made in the
above context they cannot be characterized as "confidential"
since they represent official responses to official requests.
Therefore, we cannot consider them in the same light as the
"confidential sources" issue raised earlier in Cointelpro
matters.

out that the responses were not officially approved, they
were nonetheless made by federal employees who should
have been acting within the scope of their official duties

subject to interrogation regarding the circumstances of
their acting outside their authority.
In what is perhaps an excess of caution in view
of the pending discussions regarding the questioning of
'confidential sources", we are submitting this situation
for your review lest you should disagree with our analysis
that these individuals cannot properly be so characterized.

On 9/9/75, John Elliff, Domestic Task Force Head of
the Senate Select Committee, telephonically contacted SA Paul V.
Daly and requested that SA Douglas MacDougall be released for
purposes of submitting to a Staff interview concerning mail
openings.
-
-
-
-
Elliff stated that he was currently being interviewed
by Senate Select Committee Staff Members on mail covers; however,
he indicated there is an apparent misunderstanding as the Senate
Select Committee also requested that he be made available for
Staff interview on mail openings at the same time.
Elliff was
advised that this was not true and that James Dick of the Senate
Select Committee had requested only a release insofar as mail
covers was concerned for purposes of an interview with MacDougall
and that this particular topic had been confirmed with Dick on a
separate occasion to insure that their intent insofar as MacDougall
was concerned was to interview him on mail covers. Elliff then
requested that MacDougall be released for mail openings and in-
quired as to how long this particular procedure might take.
was informed that prior to MacDougall's being made available for
such an interview the Bureau would brief MacDougall concerning
his Fifth Amendment rights and would want MacDougall to have
sufficient time to consider whether he might want to retain
private counsel or whatever other steps he feels necessary to
protect his rights.
Elliff subsequently recontacted SA Paul V. Daly
telephonically and stated he had checked with James Dick,
Senate Select Committee Staff Member, and determined that
Dick had only asked that MacDougall be made, available for
interview concerning mail covers. Elliff stated that since

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75
MacDougall had traveled from New York for purposes of this
particular interview, they felt that it would be in their
interest to also interview MacDougall concerning mail
openings. He requested that MacDougall be released for
purposes of the mail openings interview. He also informed
SA Daly that after the mail covers interview, MacDougall
will return to the Bureau so that he can be appropriately
briefed by the Legal Counsel Division concerning his Fifth
Amendment rights.
RECOMMENDATION:
That SA MacDougall be released from existing
employment agreement for purposes of interview by the
Senate Select Committee concerning mail openings.

The attached letter is self-explanatory and, put in distilled
form, asks the following question:
Are employees of the IRS who supplied tax returns or tax
return information to agents of the FBI in response to formal or
informal requests made by Bureau agents to be characterized as ·
"confidential sources" and, as such, to be spared being interviewed
by the Select Committee?
-
Because the Attorney General and the Bureau have previously
addressed the Bureau's position on the nondisclosure of its sources
for interview purposes by the SSC staff, and because the issue raised
in the attached letter may represent a clear exception to the earlier
resolution of the Bureau's COINTELPRO-sources problem, I am forwarding
this to you for your prompt attention and views for early transmittal
to the Attorney General. I shall appreciate the receipt of your
views on or before COB Thursday, September 11, 1975.

Dear Mike:
ALL FBI INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN 13 UNCLASSIFIED
DATELLO
DATE 10/18/60 BY SP2ALM/ely
In connection with our investigation of the
Internal Revenue Service, we have received a number of FBI
COINTELPRO documents relating to FBI use of tax return
information. Included in this material are a number of
cases in which the FBI locally requested and, according
to the documents, received tax returns or tax return in-
formation from IRS employees, such as the local Chief of
Audit or Chief of Intelligence.
We wish to determine whether these requests
were treated by the IRS as official requests and pre-
scribed procedures thus followed for disclosure of the
information, or whether the requests were treated as
informal requests and prescribed procedures ignored.
cannot make this determination solely on the basis of the
FBI documents we have reviewed. In many cases, the only
way to determine how the requests were treated will be to
interview the IRS employees who handled the requests.
We
Since these requests were directed to a federal
agency, we are proceeding on the basis of a presumption
that the responses were properly cleared. If so, we do
not believe there is any basis for characterizing the IRS
employees in question as "confidential sources". They
would then be in essentially the same position as the Com- .
missioner of Internal Revenue is where the request is
directed through normal channels to the National Office

MacDougall was advised of his Fifth Amendment rights
by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division, upon returning from the
Senate Select Committee. MacDougall advised that he would pre-
fer contacting private counsel before submitting to an inter-
view concerning mail openings. He indicated that he was
attempting to make arrangements to consult with the attorney
in person.
SA MacDougall advised that he would telephonically
contact the Legal Counsel Division subsequent to his conference
with the attorney and advise whether he desires to submit to
an interview concerning mail openings. His decision in this
matter will be brought to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee.

low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I
had the impression that he learned nothing during the
interview that he had not known before. I told him
on several occasions during the interview that my memory
of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should
rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate
account.

approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no." He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.
Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.
I told him I knew of no such efforts.
He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him
Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no. He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.
He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
REVOLUTION
MERICAN
BICENTENNIAL
On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.
The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.
Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.
I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and
other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that
I had not been personally involved in the King matter,
that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
which might answer his questions. I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the
records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

Smith, Attorney, Office of General Counsel, Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), telephoned Special Agent Richard T.
Taylor, Jr., advising he recently received a written request
from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
(SSC) for access to the Federal income tax returns of one
"William Simon, a former FBI Agent residing in the Los Angeles,
California, area. Mr. Smith explained IRS receives approx-
imately three million returns from their Los Angeles district
and that upon review of IRS indices he is unable to identify
"William Simon," the object of the Committee's interest. He
noted SSC provided no additional identifying data concerning
Simon and did not furnish any indication as to the reason
for their interest in him.
"
Mr. Smith requested the address and Social Security
Numbers of retired SAs of the FBI with the surname "Simon"
who have resided in the Los Angeles area during the past
three years.
SA Taylor informed Mr. Smith his request will
be forwarded to our Administrative Division for consideration
as to its appropriateness and feasibility.
At 1:15 p.m. on 9-4-75, Mr. Smith telephoned SA
Taylor and advised he had located the income tax return of
one "William Simon," a former FBI Agent, who resides in
Los Angeles and is presently engaged in the practice of law
there. Mr. Smith rescinded his earlier request 2-1163

A briefing for Senators Church and Tower has been provided
covering warrantless electronic surveillances, surreptitious entry for
recovery of cryptographic material, teletype coverage requested by the
National Security Agency and electronic penetration of communications
equipment requested by the National Security Agency. The White House
asked that agencies of the intelligence community not respond to any
requests from the SSC covering these matters until the briefing had been
given. The goal of the briefing was to confine knowledge of these matters
to Senators Church and Tower and avoid proliferation of this information
throughout the SSC staff. In view of this, it is recommended that the
enclosed material not be made available to the SSC staff until it is dis-
cussed with the White House. I further urge that it be made clear to the
White House that if this material is to be made available to the SSC that
access to the enclosed material be limited to Senators Church, Tower,
and SSC Staff Director William Miller only.

In accordance with instructions received from
the Bureau, I am enclosing a bill in the amount of $750.00
from the law firm of Kantor, Shaw & Davidoff. Mr. Herbert .
Kantor is an attorney who acted as my counsel during an
appearance by me before the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Operations in Washington, D. C. on August 12,
1975.
After notification by the Committee and the Bureau
that my appearance had been requested, I was advised by the
Legal Department of the Bureau that I had the right to have
an attorney accompany me during my appearance. I was also
advised by the Bureau that neither they nor the Department
of Justice could provide me with counsel due to a possible
conflict of interest on their part.
The matters to be discussed before the Committee
involved only my prior official duties in the counter-
intelligence field. At this point, I strongly believed
that to best protect both my constitutional privileges and
the Bureau's overriding interest, the most prudent course
of action would indicate the retention of an attorney. I
would like to advise you that much thought was paid to the
selection of an attorney since confidential Bureau activities
would have to be discussed with him and it was felt that the
person selected would, in effect, be representing the Bureau
in addition to myself.

The specific legal fees incurred, as itemized in
the enclosed bill, are only in connection with the preparation.

be located concerning any instructions by Mr. Sullivan and/or
II. C. D. Urennan to subordinates in 1967 to revise any earlier
monograph pertaining to King.
With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summ rizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King.
In some
cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in
IBI files came from electronic surveillances of King; however,
there exist arces where documentation of the information is
not precise and no accurate determination can be made.
Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the
material being furnished do not contain information developed
as a result of electronic surveillances of King.
In connection with any response where we have
included Xeroxes of newspaper articles or nous releases, we
have not necessarily furnished all relating to e perticular
motter which may be scattered through FBI files, but have
included those readily available and generally representative
of the media accounts of the particular matter. An example
would be those included in the response to Item 6 of the
July 8, 1975, SEC request,
With the delivery of the materials with this
memorandum ve have fulfilled all requests contained in the
July 14, 1975, request.
The remaining materials in SSC requests relating
to King are receiving continuous attention and the results
will be forwarded on a periodic basis as soon as possible.

Dear Mr. O'Connor:
Pursuant to Section III. A. of the notification
attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I am
forwarding herewith an additional request for materials
which relate to this matter.
.
The specificity of this request is not, of
course, intended to limit in any way the agreement to come
forward with all relevant information and materials, includ-
ing documents, whether or not they have been brought to the
Committee's attention or have been specifically requested
by the Committee.
As Mr. Schwarz and I indicated in our meeting
with you a few days ago, there are still outstanding sev-
eral items relating to this matter which the Committee re-
quested some time ago. This request should in no way delay
further the availability of the previously requested items,
and we would expect that individual items will be supplied
whenever they become separately ready for submission.

September 3, 1975
Atlanta, Georgia
On September 2, 1975, Mr. Paul G. Wallach, Counsel
to the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate
arrived at my office located at 6165 Barfield Road, Atlanta,
Georgia 30302, at approximately 10:10 a.m. His interview with
me commenced at approximately 10:15 a.m. and lasted until
approximately 10:50 a.m. This interview was not conducted
under oath. Mr. Wallach did not advise me of my rights.
drove Mr. Wallach to Perimeter Mall where he caught the 11:00 a.m.
bus to the Airport.
I
During the interview Mr. Wallach asked how long
I had served in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and what
areas I worked in during my FBI career. He was told that my
FBI career started on March 19, 1951, and ended with my
retirement on January 27, 1973. During this time I was
assigned to criminal work for two years, worked in the Soviet
Intelligence field for approximately 17 years, and again handled
criminal work for the last three years of my Bureau career.
Wallach wanted to know if I worked with James Kehoe.
I told him that for the most part Kehoe and I were on different
squads, although we both worked in the Soviet Intelligence
field. We did work on the same squad during the first years
of our assignment to this type of work.
Wallach wanted to know if I was aware of the operation
involving the mail at Kennedy Airport and at other post offices
in the New York area. I told him that officially I was not aware
of these operations but that in fact I knew of the operations.
Wallach wanted to know if I had ever been assigned to work in
a post office and my answer was "no".
Wallach then wanted to know if I was acquainted
with Sam Jaffee. After my affirmative answer he wanted to
know how I met him, why I interviewed him, whether I had to
have permission to interview him, what kind of information
he furnished, whether I had ever asked him to do anything,
and whether Jaffee was an informant. He also wanted to know
when I first met Jaffee, how frequently I saw him, over what
period of time I was seeing him, and when I last saw him.

SPECIAL AGENT (SA) EDWAID F.
GAMDER BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
11
Set out below is information concerning an interviev
of former FBI SA Edward F. Gamber by an SSC Staff Member.
On receipt of information by the FBI that the SSC
night interview Gamber, he was contacted by the Atlanta,
Georgia, Field Office of the FBI on August 15, 1975, and
advised of the necessity, should he be interviewed by the
SSC, to protect matters relating to sensitive Bureau operations.
Such matters would relate to sources, methods, techniques,
third agency consideration and ongoing investigations. Ho
was told that if he desired, after being contacted by the
SSC Staff, ho could contact the FBI's Legal Counsel Division
by collect call for information to assist him, including his
obligations as to confidentiality of the information acquired
as an FBI employee. It was emphasized to him that the FBI's
offer of assistance was not intended to impede the SSC
work but was done as a cooperative gesture and to safeguard
sensitive Bureau information.
On August 21, 1975, Gamber advised the Atlanta
Field Office that he had been contacted by Paul Wallach, SSC
Staff Member, who had arranged to interview Gamber in the
Atlanta area on September 2, 1975. Gamber also advised that
Dep. AD Adm. _ he intended to contact the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI
Dep. AD Inv. by collect call on August 22, 1075.

I told Wallach that I could not remember dates
and other details of my relationship with Jaffee, but that
information responsive to his questions could be found
recorded in FBI files as I had prepared detailed memos
reflecting all of my contacts with Jaffee. I told Wallach
that if he were entitled to the information he was seeking,
I'd suggest that he get hold of the file on Jaffee. Wallach
said he understood my position, but that before going through
the process of getting a file "they" liked to talk to a few
individuals to see if information the Committee had was
worth pursuing.
Wallach acknowledged that it would not be possible
for me to furnish specific information, such as dates, after
the passage of such a long period of time. Thereafter, in
response to inquiry, he was told that Jaffee was in contact
with many diplomatic officials, including Soviets, in his
capacity as a CBS newsman. I could not specifically remember
how this information came to the Bureau's attention. I did
have some background information on Jaffee and it was necessary
for me to get permission before I could interview him. He
was told that I did not know specifically who authorized the
interview.
Wallach wanted to know what approach was used
during the initial interview with Jaffee. He was told that
I could not specifically recall this information, but that
John Willis and I conducted the interview. Both of us were
keenly aware of the FBI's policy of not interfering with the
Freedom of the Press and we wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood this. We also wanted to make sure that Jaffee
understood that we did not want to place him in a difficult
or embarrassing position by talking to him and that if he
found our presence to be a problem we would leave immediately.
He was told that Jaffee proved to be most cooperative and that
thereafter we were in contact with Jaffee frequently. Wallach
wanted to know how often and he was told that sometimes we
were in contact with him two or three times a week, once
every two weeks, or perhaps once a month. He was told that
all contacts were recorded in writing in the file, along with
the results of the contact.
Concerning information which Jaffee furnished,
Wallach was told that Jaffee furnished information concerning
current events of major and minor importance on the inter-
national scene, which came to his attention as a result of

his contacts with numerous individuals in diplomatic
circles. He was again told that all of this information
was reduced to writing and I understood that it was
disseminated to other government agencies, including
the U. S. Mission to the UN and the State Department.
Wallach wanted to know how I knew this to be the case.
I explained that FBI policy required dissemination of
information to other government agencies and I felt certain
that this policy was followed in the case of memoranda
prepared as a result of my contacts with Jaffee.
Wallach asked if Jaffee was an informant and
I told him that Jaffee might more properly be called a
Source of Information.
Wallach then wanted to know if I requested Jaffee
to do anything in the course of contacts with him. Wallach
was told that Jaffee may have been asked to follow up on
information which he furnished or make contact with a specific
individual but that this did not occur very often, if at all,
since Jaffee was a free spirit, who usually did as he pleased.
I then explained that during my contacts with Jaffee I received
frequent calls from other FBI Agents who said that Jaffee was
using my name in order to cross police lines or get information
while covering a story of major importance, such as airplane
hijacking. This in spite of repeated requests on my part
that he cease doing this.
Wallach asked if I knew whether Jaffee had ever
been followed by FBI Agents. I pointed out that Jaffee had
been followed by FBI Agents and, in fact, talked to Agents
who were following him, as well as Agents going about their
business. He often mentioned my name to these Agents.
Wallach asked if I was aware that Jaffee did a
television program on the FBI. I said that I was aware of
this and in fact, at his request, arranged to have him visit
Camp Smith with a camera crew to cover our firearms training
program.
Wallach was told that I could not remember when
I last saw Jaffee, but that I last talked to him when he
returned from Hong Kong. At this time Jaffee called my home
from Washington, D. C. and told my daughter that he had to
talk to me immediately about an urgent problem. When I

Wallach then asked if I had ever talked to any
other newspaper people. I told him that I once talked to
Irving R. Levine many years ago. He wanted to know if I
knew of any other Agents of the FBI who were talking to
people in the news media. I said that I did not.
Wallach then made reference to newspaper articles
of recent date concerning the FBI's relationship with
newspaper people friendly to the FBI, In response to inquiry
I told him that I knew absolutely nothing about this.
At the outset of the interview Wallach asked if
I told the FBI about his visit and I said that I had called
the Atlanta FBI Office and that as soon as he left I would
again call the Atlanta FBI Office and give an Agent a rundown
on the interview. He said that the FBI had notified the
Select Committee about my call.
He wanted to know if I had called the FBI in
Washington and I gave a negative reply. He also wanted to
know if I had talked to John Willis. I had not.
Before leaving Wallach commented that he did not
know who cost Jaffee his job, but that he, Wallach, was certain
someone caused Jaffee to lose his job.
I believe I have covered the interview in its
entirety, however, I did not make any notes and the possi-
bility of some minor omission does exist.

I then
Wallach was told that this was typical of Jaffee
who often thought that there was something personal involved
when he failed to get an assignment or a news item, which he
covered, was not shown on the evening news program. Wallach
was told that Jaffee was an intelligent and personable guy
with a burning ambition, who wanted to become a Walter
Cronkite or a Marvin Kalb overnight. Wallach was told that
I did not believe that Jaffee completed college and he was
probably not otherwise qualified for some of these positions,
which he would like to have had immediately. I then told
Wallach that in my opinion Jaffee had the same problem at
ABC that he had at CBS and at both places he was probably:
overly aggressive and not amenable to direction.
Wallach was also told that Willis and I found
Jaffee to be an interesting guy who we enjoyed talking to
but that he positively would not accept advice or direction.
Wallach wanted to know if I was acquainted with
Special Agents Reeves, Winton or Graves and I gave a negative
reply. It should be noted that Wallach had a first name for.
each of these individuals but I do not recall these names.
He then wanted to know if I knew Burt Turner.
Bert Turner as a Supervisor in WFO and possibly at the Bureau.
Wallach wanted to know if I would be surprised
to learn that Jaffee had been interviewed by Bureau Agents
for four days upon his return from Hong Kong. I said that
I would be surprised.
He also wanted to know if I would be surprised
to learn that the FBI or CIA had furnished information to
ABC-TV which cost Jaffee his job. I said that I would be
most surprised and that I did not believe there was any
possibility that this could happen. I told Wallach that
in my opinion Jaffee was perfectly capable of losing his
job on his own.

of the interview, he should call Bureau Headquarters collect and discuss
the matter with SA Elmer Larson.

Re: Mail Intercept Programs
NOTE:
The incoming letter delivered on 8/1/75 is undated
and it requested that the FBI make available for review by
the Criminal Division attorneys, all memoranda, records,
letters or other correspondence from 1951 to date which the
FBI had received or generated with respect to its contacts
or involvement with the White House, the Attorney General,
Post Office Department or Postal Service and CIA in connection
with the inception, implementation or declination of partici-
pation by the FBI in mail interception programs. This relates
solely to the information in Bureau files concerning Bureau
Informant 200 also known as Project Hunter which was the CIA
code name for its interception program. In accordance with
discussions held with members of the Staff of the Senate
Special Committee on 8/15/last, it was requested that this
program be cleared with the Criminal Division first. The
Hunter policy file has been reviewed and documents considered
to be pertinent have been Xeroxed and will be held for review
by Departmental attorneys.

Re: Request Pertaining to Electronic
Surveillance
In respect to tesurs, on facilities under the control
of the SCLC and approved by the Attorney General, the reason
for the placing of such tesurs lies in the fact that the SCLC
and Martin Luther King, Jr. as its president, were subjects of
intensified FBI investigations at that time. (see Exhibits
A and B). Thus, an integral phase of the FBI's coverage of
King was also its coverage of the SCLC.
Court Seal [JFK Law 10(a)1]
In respect to that part of Item 5, wherein the BSC
requested a list of all elsurs which "intercepted and/or
monitored" any conversations of Martin luther King, Jr. at any
time between January 1, 1960 and April 5, 1968, an extensive,
exhaustive review has been made of Bureau files, including a
review of the elmur indices, Martin Luther King's main file
and other files directly and indirectly related to the
Investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., to satisfy this
part of the request. As a result of this review, it was
determined that Martin Luther King, Jr.[
One
In addition, to further
satisfy this part of the request, inquiries have been made
of some field offices concerning this particular aspect.
However, their extensive review has been unsuccessful.
reason for the unsuccessful attempts to retrieve this
particular information both at FBIHQ and in the field can be
attributed to the fact that FBI elaur indices did not come
into existence until October 5, 1966, and did not become
operational for a period of time following October 5, 1966.
In respect to Item 6 (d) which requested data
concerning FBI dissemination of information concerning King,
we are not supplying this data pursuant to an agreement between
Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the SSC Staff and Special Agent
Elmer Larson of the FBI.

In respect to Item 6 (c), there are enclosed,

As previously set forth, a misur was installed on

A thorough, exhaustive search was conducted of
numerous FBI files in an effort to locate an FBI Headquarters

instructions were carried out regarding this misur coverage
and indicates that Bureau authority was obtained.
(see Exhibit F) revealing that a misur
In regard to the matter involving the authorization
of misurs, the procedures in effect at the time most of these
misurs were in operation did not require specific written
authority from the Attorney General. At that time, authority
for FBI misurs was maintained at FBIHQ and authorization for
utilizing a misur was made by the FBI Director or his
designees based on a memorandum from Attorney General
Herbert Brownell dated May 20, 1954, which recognized FBI
authority to institute such surveillances. (see Exhibit W).
Subsequent to March 30, 1985, the aforementioned procedure
was changed wherein the FBI, in requesting authority for the
installation of a misur, in each instance forwarded such
request to the Attorney General for his approval or disapproval.
(see Exhibit X). Other exhibits enclosed with this memorandum
and pertaining to the approval of misurs by FBI officials
contain the initials of the late Director J. Edgar Hoover or
his designees to make such approvals.

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,
suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realid
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection
with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances
of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise
in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most
conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI.

The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine v.
California 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveilles
by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal of
the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters
relating to the internal security of the country.
_
It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone
surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities
of espionage agents, possible sebster's, and subversive persons. In.
such instances I an of the opinion that the national interest requires
that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of

evidence for prosecution. The FEI has an intelligenpe function in
connection with internal security matters equally as important as
the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and
the national security requires that the FEI be able to use ricrophone
surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.
The Department Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance
by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.
I do not consider that the Hecision of the Supreme Court
in Irvine v. California, sur, quires a different course. That
case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the
Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-

On September 17, 1975, Mary Wagner, an attorney in the office
of the Deputy Attorney General, accompanied by Bruce Baird, an attorney
recently appointed to the Deputy's office, met with me in my office and
advised that they have been assigned the responsibility of drafting guidelines
for the Attorney General's approval concerning legal representation of
Department employees. She explained that they view the problem of
legal advice to employees as larger than the request made by the FBI
concerning Bureau employees, and that the guidelines would address the
larger problem. She asked for my suggestions concerning the proposed
guidelines.
IN 66-19166-2
SGINAL FILED IN
I told Miss Wagner that in the beginning of the inquiries received
from the Senate and House Select Committees, we had been advised by the
Department that a conflict of interest would prohibit Department attorneys,
including lawyers in the FBI, from providing legal representation individually
to the employees of the FBI in matters relating to the Senate and House
inquiries. As a consequence we have been advising our employees of the
procedures involved in Congressional committee interviews and appearances
for testimony; the limitations imposed on the employees in regard to sensitive
areas of testimony which might require special approval; their right to
counsel and of the limitation imposed on us that personal counsel would have
to be privately employed. I told Miss Wagner that my reading of the
Attorney General's memorandum for the Director dated September 12, 1975,
was that the Attorney General intended to make personal legal advice available
to employees requesting it and that we would like for the guidelines to be
written broadly enough for employees to receive effective assistance of legal
counsel.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and
the installation of microphones, you will recall that I advised you
that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I
recommended that all Government agencies refrain from wiretapping
unless there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney
General who is the chief law officer of the Government. I repeated
the same recommendation to each successive Attorney General following
the administration of Attorney General Clark.
a
by
I have always felt that there was a very lax control in the
handling of wiretapping by Government agencies. I am the only head
I
of a Government investigative agency who does not have the authority
to authorize a wiretap, but under the system which I personally set
up. Therefore, requests for wiretaps are sent by me to the Attorney
General for his approval or disapproval. I know that no such system
is followed in other branches of the Government and, in fact, in many
instances subordinates quite far down the line of authority tap tele-
phones without the specific approval of the head of the agency and
certainly without specific approval of the cabinet officer in charge
of the department.
1
I still feel quite strongly that no Government agency should.
tap a telephone unless it is specifically approved in each instance by
the Attorney General. This would certainly circumscribe promiscuous
wiretapping on the part of Government agencies and would centralize
in one place, the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps
which have been placed by a Government agency.
As you are aware, in the case of the FBI we do not request
phone taps except in cases involving kidnaping and espionage. This
has been predicated upon my theory that when the life of an individual
or the life of the Nation is in peril a phone tap is justified for
intelligence purposes as any information obtained over a phone tap
cannot be used in the trial of a criminal case.

Memorandum for the Attorney General
In line with your suggestion this morning, I have already
set up the procedure similar to requesting of authority for phone
taps to be utilized in requesting authority for the placement of
microphones. In other words, I shall forward to you from time to
time request for authority to install microphones where doomed
imperative for your consideration and approval or disapproval.
Furthermore, I have instructed that, where you have approved either
a phone tap or the installation of a microphone, you be advised
when such is discontinued if in less than six months and, if not
discontinued in less than six months, that a new request be submitted
by me to you for extension of the telephone tap or microphone
installation.

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,
suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection
with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon. the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances
of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise
-in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
(of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will exit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner nose
conducive to our national interest. recognize that for the FBF-
6 fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of
¡internal security and the national safety are paramount and, there-
[fore, may compel the restricted use of this technique in the national
interest.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees
I suggested to her that the Attorney General might approve the
appointment of a special counsel within the Department whose responsibilities
would be somewhat similar to those imposed on the Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination in that he would be relieved of other Department
responsibilities and his allegiance would be only to discharging the obligations
of personal counsel when requested by an employee. I suggested that such
special designation would permit the Department lawyer so assigned to
avoid the conflict of interest problem and at the same time it would impose
on him the obligations of the attorney-client privilege.
Miss Wagner commented that she understood that in some cases
handled by the Civil Division of the Department, Government attorneys
represent employees in civil suits, but require that the employee waive
the attorney-client privilege to the extent that should the Government employee
become aware of information that should be communicated to another division
of the Department, the attorney would furnish such information to the other
division. If the attorney learned of criminal conduct on the part of the
employee, he would not be prohibited by the attorney-client privilege from
making such conduct known to the Department.
I told Miss Wagner that an essential element of the relationship
between the special counsel for furnishing advice to employees would be
that the attorney-client privilege would apply and it would not be possible
for such a waiver to be required in exchange for providing legal advice.
She agreed.
I suggested to Miss Wagner that the Department special counsel
could be available for consultation concerning such matters as appearances
before Congressional committees and for such preliminary advice as would be
useful to employees called to testify. At the point where the special counsel
determined that the employee required more in-depth legal assistance in order
to protect his legal rights, the special counsel could recommend to the
Deputy Attorney General that the employee should be afforded an opportunity
to have private counsel whose fees would be paid by the Department of
Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees
In regard to the question of security clearance for such outside
counsel and the possibility that an employee might seek to employ an
attorney whose background would suggest that he would not be approved
for security clearance, I told Miss Wagner that the provision of private
counsel to an employee would be done in the discretion of the Department
and that a reasonable limitation could well be imposed by the Department
as to those attorneys in private practice who would be eligible for appoint-
ment to represent individual employees. Such limitation would permit
the Department and the employee to agree upon an attorney who would be
qualified for security clearance.
11
Miss Wagner inquired as to when the Department's responsibility
for furnishing legal counsel to an employee should terminate. I told her
that an appropriate time would be when the Department advised the
employee that a decision had been made to prosecute the employee. Up
to that point the inquiries would have been directed toward the determination
of the circumstances and that the employer-employee relationship would
justify protecting the legal rights of the employee, but at the point at
which the Government determines and so advises the employee that the
employee would be prosecuted, the Government and the employee would
become adversaries.
We discussed the provision in Federal law for the appointment of
counsel for Federal defendants in cases where the defendant is indigent.
I suggested that they consider the possibility that even in those cases
where an employee is to be prosecuted, the Department consider the
possibility of employing existing law to provide counsel to employees
who may become defendants in criminal cases.
As to the scope of the representation of the employee, I told
Miss Wagner that the initial need is for legal advice in situations where
an employee is called for an interview or testimony by Members,
committees, subcommittees, or other units of the Congress. However, I
explained that due to the publicity of the Congressional inquiries, others may
well be interested in pursuing independent inquiries concerning the same
matters or other matters and that employees may well request legal
advice when they are called for interview or testimony by the Criminal

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Legal Advice for Present or Former Bureau Employees
Division of the Department, the Civil Rights Division of the Department,
or other Federal Government entities including Federal Grand Juries.
Further, state and local prosecutors and grand juries may seek to inquire
concerning matters within their jurisdiction arising out of the employee's
Federal activities and the employee would require the assistance of counsel.
Therefore, I asked Miss Wagner to include in the guidelines a provision
that legal counsel would be available through the Department for employees
in all circumstances where the employee is being questioned concerning
matters arising out of his employment in the FBI.
I told Miss Wagner that the concluding paragraph in the Attorney
General's memorandum for the Director indicated the possibility that a
determination would be made in some cases that the employee's activities
were beyond the scope of his duties and in such cases legal counsel would
not be provided. I told her that such a determination would be critical
and the policy followed in making such decisions would color the entire
program of providing legal assistance to employees. Therefore, I
requested Miss Wagner to address the question of scope of duties in the
guidelines by expressing a presumption that the employee's activities
were within the scope of his duties and that such presumption would be
overcome only by a showing of facts clearly indicating to the contrary,
and that such determination would be made at least by the Deputy Attorney
General himself.
I told Miss Wagner that this matter was most urgent and that the
Special Agents of the FBI throughout the field are anxiously awaiting the
announcement of the Attorney General's policy in regard to availability
of legal advice to employees concerning matters arising out of their
employment. She advised me that work would begin immediately and that
she would be in touch with me concerning its progress, and to discuss
the guidelines as they are developed.
RECOMMENDATION:
For information of the Director in response to his request.

DATE/0
The recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Iwine v.
California, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveil-
lances by city police in a gambling case makes appropriate a reappraisal
of the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters
relating to the internal security of the country.
It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone
surveillance is the only possible way of uncovering the activities
of espionage agents, possible saboteurs, and subversive persons. In
such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires
guir
that microphone surveillance be utilized by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. This use need not be limited to the development of
evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in
connection with internal security matters equally as important as
the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and
the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone
surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.
The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance
by the FBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.
I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court
in Irvine.v. California, supra- requires a different course. That
case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the
Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-
tions. It is quite clear that in the Iwine case the Justices of the
Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of
installing a microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization
of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The
Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and
intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all
cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installa-
tion of a microphone in a bedroom or in some comparably intimate
location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however,
that important intelligence or evidence relating to matters connected
with the national security can only be obtained by the installation of
a microphone in such a location. It is my opinion that under such
circumstances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the
Supreme Court's decision in the Iwvire case.

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you
as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,
suggest that the views expressed have been tentative in nature and
have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow
rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized
that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection
with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a
trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect
of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus
obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances
of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise
in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the
circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities
of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.
It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation
which will permit microphone coverage by the FBI in a manner most
conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI
to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of
internal security and the national safety are paramount and, there-
fore, may compel the unrestricted use of this technique in the national
interest.

Memorandum for the Attorney General
In line with your suggestion this morning, I have already
set up the procedure similar to requesting of authority for phone
taps to be utilized in requesting authority for the placement of
microphones. In other words, I shall forward to you from time to
time request for authority to install microphones where doomed
: imperative for your consideration and approval or disapproval.
Furthermore, I have instructed that, where you have approved either
a phone tap or the installation of a microphone, you be advised
when such is discontinued if in less than six months and, if not
discontinued in less than six months, that a new request be submitted
by me to you for extension of the telephone tap or microphone
installation.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
With reference to the proper controls over wiretapping and
the installation of microphones, you will recall that I advised you
that back under the administration of Attorney General Clark I
recommended that all Government agencies refrain from wiretapping
unless there was specific approval in each instance by the Attorney
General who is the chief law officer of the Government. I repeated
the same recommendation to each successive Attorney General following
the administration of Attorney General Clark.
I have always felt that there was a very lax control in the
handling of wiretapping by Government agencies. I am the only head
of a Government investigative agency who does not have the authority
to authorize a wiretap, but under the system which I personally set
up. Therefore, requests for wiretaps are sent by me to the Attorney
General for his approval or disapproval. I know that no such system
is followed in other branches of the Government and, in fact, in many
instances subordinates quite far down the line of authority tap tele-
phones without the specific approval of the head of the agency and
certainly without specific approval of the cabinet officer in charge
of the department.
I still feel quite strongly that no Government agency should
tap a telephone unless it is specifically approved in each instance by
the Attorney General. This would certainly circumscribe promiscuous
wiretapping on the part of Government agencies and would centralize
in one place the Attorney General's office, a record of any phone taps
which have been placed by a Government agency.
As you are aware, in the case of the FBI we do not request
phone taps except in cases involving kidnaping and espionage. This
has been predicated upon my theory that when the life of an individual
or the life of the Nation is in peril a phone tap is justified for
intelligence purposes as any information obtained over a phone tap
cannot be used in the trial of a criminal case.

Senate Select Committee
° Sonstudy) 1775
①. Harter food
On the afternoon of August 19, 1975, John Ellif of the
SSC staff, telephoned me to report that the Committee has
decided to defer on its pending request for the identity of
various so-called "recipient-source" witnesses in the COINTEL
program.
Mr. Ellif also emphasized that he wished to apologize
to the Attorney General for possibly misstating the grounds
as to why the Committee and the staff had decided to reject
the proposals apparently agreed upon by Senator Church and
the Attorney General.

Finally, I noted to John Ellif that I continue to have
difficulty in understanding why the staff insists that they
need further witnesses to establish any possible "damage" to
the targets of the COINTEL program. Ellif finally agreed
that since they do know the names and identities of the targets,
the latter probably would be the best witnesses on this issue
in any event. Nonetheless, Ellif did stress that it is possible
that later on in the fall, the Committee and its staff may choose
to come back and press its demands for the right to interview
the recipient-source witnesses.

On 9/10/75, SA Daniel A. Flynn of the New York
Office (NYO) was interviewed by a Staff Member of the U. S.
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) in
its offices in Washington, D. C., on the subject of mail
'openings. The interview was recorded by an SSC stenographer.
On the morning of 9/26/75, SAC Robert Denz, NYO,
telephonically contacted Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the
Senstudy 75 Project and advised that Flynn had been contacted
by James Dick, the SSC Staff Member who had interviewed him.
Dick informed Flynn that the transcript of the interview
is available for review by Flynn but that the review must
be done in SSC offices, pursuant to SSC rules. The deadline
for Flynn's review is 9/30/75. Also according to SSC rules,
Flynn's review will not permit any substantive changes but
only changes as to grammar, and the like. Flynn desires
the opportunity to review the transcript and authority was
sought for his coming to Washington, D. C., the morning of
9/30/75.

In addition to seeking authority for the trip
Peperom
SAC Denz inquired as to the position Flynn should take in
the event he reviews the transcript and finds the recording
as inaccurate from a substantive standpoint. Phillips told
Denz that, before coming to Washington, D. C., Flynn ought
to review any notes he has, as well as the LHM which Flynn
prepared and submitted to the Bureau after the interview.
If Flynn finds that in his opinion the transcript is inaccurate
from a substantive standpoint, and he is unable to persuade
Dick to make any changes, Flynn should submit another LHM

Former Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan tele-
phonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of the Legal Counsel
Division on 9/22/75 to advise that he had been requested bý
the Senate Select Committee to appear before that Committee
at 5 p.m. on 9/23/75 to testify under oath concerning his
knowledge of the "Huston Plan." Brennan was further informed
that he was being requested to testify during open session of
the Committee on Thursday, 9/25/75, regarding the same topic.
He was advised generally of his legal rights and of the appro-
priate provisions of the rules of procedure concerning the
Senate Select Committee. He was informed that the Bureau was
cooperating with the Committee and had furnished considerable
information in the form of briefings and documents some of
which directly relate to the Bureau's knowledge and partici-
pation in the "Huston Plan."
Brennan expressed concern as to exactly what topics
he might discuss during an open session of the Senate Select
Committee and it was explained to him that he should contact
Section Chief William O. Cregar of the Intelligence Division
who would appropriately advise him concerning this area.
Brennan asked if SA Daly would have Cregar contact him con-
cerning this matter and stated he could be reached at tele-
phone number 790-6132. Cregar was appropriately advised of
the aforementioned and indicated he would contact Brennan.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395
2. Was there a memorandum concerning the
expansion of the AI to include individuals of local
prominence? (Memorandum of G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.
Sullivan dated 11/22/67 requested approval of an SAC
letter for expanding the AI to include local leaders as
well as national leaders involved in racial disorders.)
3. Were individuals included on both the AI and
the SI and, if so, wasn't this a duplication of effort?
(Individuals were included on both the AI and the SI;
however, this was not necessarily a duplication of effort
inasmuch as the SI was to be utilized in the apprehension
and detention of individuals considered dangerous and the
AI was an administrative aid to follow the activities and
movement of individuals attempting to cause racial
disorders.)
4.
When did the SI become automated and was the
Reserve Index (RI) ever automated? (The SI became automated
during the early 1950s and was updated throughout the years
with the advancement of computer technology and purchase
by the Bureau of more advanced computers. Following
discontinuance of the SI the ADEX was continued in the
computer systems in an "off-line" manner. The RI-A –
was placed on automatic data processing (ADP) equipment
the same as the SI. RI-B was maintained at the field
level only and was never placed in the ADP equipment.)
5.
-
Has the Bureau's copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the Emergency Detention Program (EDP)
been returned? (One copy of the Attorney General's
portfolio concerning the EDP has been located and is
currently maintained in the Security Informant Unit of
the IS-2 Section, INTD.)
6. Who were the Bureau individuals who
(a) maintained the Attorney General's portfolio during
1968 and (b) involved with the EDP during the 1940s?
(The following individuals were identified through
review of pertinent communications during time period
in question: (a) 1968 - C. D. Brennan, P. F. Enlow,
T. P. Rosack%3B (b) 1946-D. M. Ladd, J. C. Strickland;
1948-Lish Whitson, W. H. Winterrowd, J. W. Yeagley.

7.
When did the Department start reviewing and
approving the SI list? (Matters pertaining to the old
Custodial Detention List were first referred to the
Department during March, 1941. Copies of the SI were
submitted to the Department during 1951 and the Department,
on a continuing basis, reviewed matters pertaining to the
SI except for brief periods of time when funds and manpower
were not available until the SI was discontinued in 1971.)
8. Was there a form used by the Department
concerning the continuance or cancellation of individuals
on the SI and, if so, what does the form look like?
(Forms were utilized and copies have been obtained to
exhibit to SSC Staff Members.)
9. Do we have a copy of the form for including
or deleting an individual from the AI? (FD-397 was
utilized with the AI. A copy of this form will be
exhibited to SSC Staff Members.)
At the closure of this briefing SSC Staff Members
expressed their appreciation to the Bureau personnel present
and indicated the briefing had furnished them a better
understanding of the Bureau's utilization of the above
indices and the KAP.
ACTION:
With your approval and in accordance with your
previous instructions the Senstudy Unit will initiate contact
with Mr. Gitenstein so answers relating to the above nine
questions may be orally provided to the above-named SSC
Staff Members.

were advised there is no plan of action in the FBI for the
apprehension of the individuals so listed. The SSC Staff
Members were advised individuals currently listed on the
ADEX would merely be afforded priority investigative attention
during any national emergency which should occur; however,
they would not be apprehended. SSC Staff Members also
indicated they felt criteria for inclusion on the ADEX
when first established were the same as the criteria for
inclusion on the old SI. They were advised when the ADEX
Program was initiated the criteria were basically the same;
however, after closely following the matter for a period
of approximately 8 months, the criteria were reevaluated
and revised so only individuals who were considered
currently dangerous were to be included on the ADEX.
SSC Staff Members were also advised that the SI was
stored "off-line" in the Bureau's computers and as such
was utilized in a strictly in-house operation. Informa-
tion was therefore not available to outside agencies or
terminals tied in with the Bureau's computer system.
Staff Members also indicated from a review of material
made available to them it appeared as though there was
friction between the Bureau and the Department during the
late 1940s and early 1950s with respect to establishing
guidelines and policy in connection with the SI and they
desired to know what the cause of this friction was. INTD
representatives present advised they were unaware of the
cause of any such friction.
Other questions similar to those above were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and were answered by INTD personnel
present. In addition the following nine questions were asked
by the SSC Staff Members and Mr. Wannall indicated answers
would be obtained and orally furnished:
1. Was there a memorandum which established the
RRI and does it indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before the
Civil Unrest Commission? (A memorandum dated 8/3/67 from
C. D. Brennan to Mr. W. C. Sullivan indicates Mr. Hoover
instructed an index be compiled of racial agitators; however,
the memorandum does not indicate Mr. Hoover appeared before
the Civil Unrest Commission.)

On 9/11/75, Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., was advised that
Senator Howard Baker had reviewed the information con-
tained in Bureau files pertaining to him per instructions
of the Attorney General and in response to the letter from
Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee,
dated May 27, 1975. Baker requested that one particular file
be made available for review by his designee on the Senate
Select Committee, James Madigan. This file is titled ALLEGED
TAPPING OF TELEPHONE OF UNITED STATES SENATOR HOWARD BAKER,
WASHINGTON, D. C. (Bufile 139-4744). Shaheen was asked what
the Department position was concerning this particular request
inasmuch as the file had been made available to the Senator
pursuant to the instructions of the Attorney General.
REC-7
Shaheen advised that inasmuch as the initial request
was from the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee for access
to files for Senators that any modification of that request
giving access to Senate Select Committee Staff Members should
also be pursuant to a communication from the Chairman of that
Committee. Shaheen indicated that making the file available
to Senator Baker's designee may get precedent which could-
On the Committee to gain
access for their designees. Shaheen offered to telephonically
advise John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select
Committee, that the Department would not grant access to this 1975
particular file for Madigan. He was advised that the Bureau
should perhaps respond to Senator Baker's request inasmuch as
it was made to the Bureau and that unless he was advised to
the contrary the Bureau would advise Senator Baker of this
decision. Shaheen interposed no objection to this decision
be used by other interested Senators on the C which
RECOMMENDATION:
That Senator Baker be advised that it was not
possible to grant access to his designee, Madigan, to the
above-described file.

On 8/25/75, SA Daly determined from Michael
Epstein of the Senate Select Committee that this
particular interview was not considered an "abuse"
interview and if the Bureau so desired, they could have
a representative present during the interview. Accord-

On 8/22/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director for
the Domestic Intelligence Task Force of the Senate Select Com-
mittee, advised that regarding proposed plans for testimony
by Bureau officials before the Senate Select Committee that
the Committee tentatively scheduled hearings for mid-October.
He cited October 16th as being the approximate date. Ini-
tially, according to Elliff, hearings concerning the Bureau
were to have been initiated in the first week of October but
the Staff Members did not have the necessary background in-
formation to conduct the hearings at that time and instead
scheduled hearings concerning IRS for early October.
Elliff indicated that the tentative format for
these hearings would be to furnish the Bureau an outline of
or a series of questions pertaining to the area to be covered
in testimony prior to our appearance. He indicated that the
hearings would cover a narrow topic on any given day so that
a Bureau official could be briefed and respond to questions
raised concerning the particular subject matter.
Elliff indicated that typical subjects of hearings
concerning the FBI would be a one-day hearing on political
abuse or a series of hearings on COINTELPRO

-

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's intent
to continue hearings regarding the FBI into mid-December once
they are initiated with the Bureau testifying at least once
a week during that period. He advised they also envisioned
the initial hearing as setting forth what the scope of the
Senate Select Committee inquiry had been into the FBI and of
topics to be covered by hearings. Elliff felt this would
inform the House Select Committee of what areas the Senate
Select Committee had delved into.

It is the Committee's intention to insert in some of the
blanks in the documents an identifying description of IRS
personnel who assisted the FBI in certain instances, such
as "an IRS Special Agent" or "an IRS Inspector". We will
make these identifications based upon our notes from the
· documents, and will supply you with copies of the documents.
in which such descriptions have been typed in order that
you may check the accuracy of the descriptions. In this
way, we will avoid public identification of the IRS per-
sonnel even though Bureau agreement has previously been
obtained that these individuals are not "sources".

Reference is made to the request of the SSC dated
August 26, 1975, for FBI materials. Included in this request, Part I,
Number 6a through r, was a request for extensive material relating
to the discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) of this
Bureau. Except as noted below, this material is being delivered with
this memorandum.
Items 6b, c and d, of the above request relate to docu-
ments included in the FBI Cointelpro which targeted Soviet-Satellite
intelligence. Because of the sensitivity of these documents and their
foreign intelligence ramifications, they are not being delivered at
this time; however, they are available for review by members of your
staff in Room 4171, JEH Building.
Item 6f refers to an August 25, 1967, letter "described
in Item e above," which sets up requirements for status letters to be
periodically submitted and requests all such status letters. No letter
of this date is described in Item e. A review of FBI files indicates
the August 25, 1967, letter is captioned "Counterintelligence Program,
Black Nationalist; - Hate Groups, Internal Security." Copies of a memo-
randum dated February 29, 1968, and an airtel dated March 4, 1968,
which set up the requirements for status letters in this Program, are
included in material forwarded under Item 6a. Under this item it is
also requested all status letters submitted in accordance with instruc-
tions in the August 25, 1967, letter be submitted. The status letters
submitted under the "Counterintelligence Program, Black Nationalist -
Hate Groups" Program are being furnished under Item 6j which requests
all progress letters under that Program.

Enclosed is a list of documents which the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities may decide to declassify
for its public hearings on the Huston Plan. We invite your
opinion on any sections which you think ought to be sanitized
before declassification. Of course, the great majority of
key documents on the Huston Plan are already a matter of public
record.
Since these hearings may be held as early as September 23rd
and certainly by early October, your quick response would be
most helpful.

The letter's penultimate paragraph requests my "personal

[me] that these documents should be provided to the Committee in
unexcised form (except for the names of so-called "live". infor-

Reference is made to letter dated September 19, 1975,
from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, SSC, to Mr. Paul V. Daly,
Office of Legal Counsel, FBI. This communication enclosed
a list of documents which the SSC may decide to declassify
for public hearings on the Huston Plan. The FBI was requested
to advise whether any of the documents required appropriate
excisions prior to the declassification.
On September 21, 1975, Messrs. William O. Cregar
and Elmer W. Larson of the FBI met with Mr. John Elliff of the
SSC Staff. During this meeting, the documents, which were
enclosed with the September 19, 1975, letter, were carefully
reviewed and excisions were made and mutually agreed to.
This is to advise that the FBI has no objection
to the declassification and use of the documents for public
hearings providing the excisions mutually agreed to on
September 21, 1975, are in effect.

ALL FRI INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE
10/17/0002 ALM
The following two documents, which relate to the Martin
Luther King, Jr. matter, are the subject of a pending Committee
· request for documents:
A.
Airtel dated 2/12/62 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject "Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., SM-C (00:Atlanta); "and
B. Airtel dated 8/15/66 from SAC, New York, to
Director, FBI, subject "Communist Party, USA,
Counterintelligence Program, Internal Security
- C (Stanley David Levison)."
These two documents had been previously provided to the
Committee in heavily or almost completely excised form.
Virtually the entire contents of Item A. (a 3-page airtel)
were excised because "it could result in identification of an
FBI informant," and more than 12 pages of Item B. (a 29-page
airtel) were excised because such portions contained information
which "tends to identify highly sensitive sources of continuing
value." A third document which is needed by the Committee, and
which would presumably also be provided by the Bureau only in
excised form is a New York field office letter to the Bureau
dated 6/21/62 as cited in the last paragraph of page 9 of the
10/11/62 memorandum from the SAC, Atlanta, to the Director,
FBI, subject "Communist Infiltration of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, IS-C
RECEIVED
(00: Atlanta)."

September 16, 1975
The Bureau's position with respect to the excised portions
of Items A. and B. above was reiterated by FBI representatives
at our September 9 meeting, notwithstanding our position that
these materials were deemed to be absolutely essential to our
complete understanding of the King investigation. As you are
aware, several other documents previously provided to the
Committee contain conclusionary statements about Stanley Levison
as predicates for many of the actions taken with respect to
King, and it would appear that the withheld portions of
Items A. and B. above, as well as the 6/21/62 New York letter
described above, would contain the detailed bases for such
conclusions.
I am sure you would agree that the underlying facts
concerning Levison are vital in order that we can meet our
responsibilities to fully assess the propriety of the FBI's
activities with respect to this case. Accordingly, I would
appreciate your personal attention to this matter, including
your own examination of the three documents in question, and
hopefully, a determination by you that these documents should
be provided to the Committee in unexcised form (except for the
names of so-called "live" informants).
An early resolution of this matter is essential, and I
would hope you can respond by the end of the week.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI AÐ BY SSC
NOTE CONTINUED:
coverage was on his home as opposed to the coverage on
his offices at Southern Christian Leadership Conference
which we obtained while I was there..
$
"Based on my brief discussion with Epstein
and his manner in making the appointment, I hɛd the
feeling that his interview of me was arranged over the
Labor Day weekend to suit his personal convenience
or to fit his personal travel plans. He was pleasant,
low-keyed, and not at all aggressive or probing and I
had the impression that he learned nothing during the
interview that he had not known before. I told him
on several occasions during the interview that my memory
of this ten year old matter is very poor, that he should
rely on the records made at the time for a more accurate
· account...
"I also had the impression that he is pursuing
leads based on material furnished to him by Sullivan."
The foregoing impressions of Ponder are not being
included in the material being furnished to the Department
as it appears obvious Ponder intended this information for
the exclusive information of the Bureau.

an interview on September 23, 1975 at 2:00 F.M.
I have learned that the "Hunter" matter, on which
I'm to be interviewed, is presently under review for possible
criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice. Accordingly,
since, while being associated with "Hunter", I was under Bureau
direction, I am requesting that an attorney be appointed for
me by the Department of Justice or arrangements be effected
that I can be reimbursed if I secure my own attorney.

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

REVOLUTION
AMERICAN
BICENTENNIAL
On August 28, 1975, I received a call from Mike
Epstein of the Staff of the Senate Select Committee. He
said he planned to be in Southern California on Labor Day
weekend and asked whether I would be available for
interview on Sunday, August 31, 1975. I told him I would.
Epstein subsequently called me on August 30 and agreed
to meet me at my home at San Clemente on Sunday afternoon,
August 31, 1975.
The interview with Epstein took place between
3:40 pm and 4:05 pm. This included the time spent in
amenities and general conversation.
Regarding my Bureau background Epstein asked
during what period of time I was Special Agent in Charge
in Atlanta. I told him from April or May 1964 to
December 1966. He asked where I had been assigned before
that (Buffalo) and where I went after leaving Atlanta
(New York). He asked no other questions about my Bureau
career. He asked if I were aware of telephone taps
maintained by the Atlanta Office on Martin Luther King.
I replied that I was aware of certain taps placed and
removed during my tenure in Atlanta. He asked if there
were such coverage before I arrived in Atlanta and I told
him I was not aware of any. In response to these and
other subsequent questions I pointed out to Epstein that
I had not been personally involved in the King matter,
that I had various other responsibilities in Atlanta and
that after ten years I cannot now clearly recall information
which might answer his questions. I told him that every-
thing that was done was properly recorded, that the
records were accurate, and wherever my recollection differs
from the record, he should rely on the record to determine
what happened.

Senate Select Committee (SSC) convened public
hearings 9-16-75, at which Chairman Frank Church an-
nounced the chief purpose of the inquiry was to examine
the role of CIA disobeying direct orders of President
Nixon who had ordered the destruction of biological/
bacteriological agents and weapons of war by Presidential
Order, 11-25-69. Chairman Church referred to previous
executive testimony of Director Colby which established
that CIA had maintained a supply of approximately 6 grams
of shellfish toxin, a lethal agent, until June, 1975, in
apparent contravention of the Presidential Order of 1969.
The retention of the toxin had been ordered by a midlevel
employee without the knowledge of former Director Richard
Helms.
While Chairman Church stressed it is not the
purpose of SSC to denigrate the importance of the FBI
and the CIA of their contribution to the welfare of the
United States, he stated subsequent SSC hearings would
highlight the necessity that Federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies operate in a manner which will not
infringe upon the rights of American citizens,.

CIA directive to destroy or impinge on his decision to

was directed toward offensive biological weapons of war

Dr. Gordon pointed out that the shellfish toxin over

I have been orally advised (and will be in receipt of a

The Bureau is, therefore, requested to provide relevant

In other words, the request made in the September 4, letter is
for Bureau response except as Elliff's letter of modification

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);
INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JOSEPH K. PONDER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
He asked whether the request for the King
coverage originated at the Bureau or in Atlanta. I told
him I did not recall, but that in any case it was
approved by the Bureau. He asked where it was monitored
and I told him the monitoring was done in an apartment
rented for that purpose. He asked if I knew the name in
which the apartment was rented and I said I did not. He
asked why the taps were discontinued and I told him I
do not now recall whether I was told why they were
discontinued, but if I were I cannot now recall the
reason. He asked whether we had a bug on King as opposed
to a tap and I told him, "no. He asked whether it were
possible there were taps and 'bugs placed and maintained
without my knowledge. I told him that was not possible
because of the size of the office and the relationship
I had with the supervisors and Agents that nothing was
done without my knowledge or without Bureau approval.
$
Epstein asked whether we had conducted any
Counterintelligence Program against King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and I told him I recalled
none. He asked whether we had made efforts to prevent
King from receiving the Nobel Prize or efforts to interfere
with or make more difficult the raising of funds for a
banquet to honor King for his receipt of the Nobel Prize.
I told him I knew of no such efforts.
He asked whether Sullivan (Assistant Director
William C. Sullivan) had visited Atlanta. I told him
Sullivan had been to Atlanta in connection with a regional
conference dealing with the Bureau's investigation of the
Klan. He wanted to know if Baumgartner had been with Sullivan
and I told him I thought so. He asked who else had
accompanied Sullivan and I told him Arbor Gray had
accompanied Sullivan and perhaps someone else whose name
I cannot now recall. He asked whether Sullivan had met
with Ralph Magill (then publisher of the Atlanta
Constitution). I told him Sullivan may have met with Magill,
that I may have accompanied Sullivan to Magill's office,
but I cannot specifically recall such a meeting and if it

DATED 1700 BY
ALLIDIRTC
BYSPZALM/
Attached is a letter from John Elliff of the SSC staff
which modifies the language of the August 29, letter from the SSC's
Chief Counsel Schwarz to the Attorney General. The last sentence
of the first paragraph of the August 29, letter read as follows:
"Where an Internal Security Division request was
made with respect to a person or organization on whom
the Internal Security Division or the FBI maintained
or maintains a file, we would appreciate the opportu-
nity to review the entire file". (emphasis mine)
The modification of the first paragraph effected by the attached
letter deletes the words "or the FBI" as underlined above: Such
a modification exempts the raw files of the Bureau from inclusion
in this request. The request still requires response by the
Bureau for "all documents" in its possession as requested of the
entire Department generally by the modified first paragraph.

Dear Mike:
As Mark and you discussed today on the phone,
it was the Committee's intent in Fritz Schwarz' letter to
you of September 4, 1975, that the FBI, as well as the
Internal Security Division, provide information pertaining
to the individuals and organizations listed in that letter.
Of course this letter and the August. 29 letter are modified
by my letter of September 10. Furthermore, this request is
of the highest priority and therefore we want to be kept
informed of its progress on a daily basis. Perhaps the
,best approach would be to have Bureau representatives con-
tact either Mark Gitenstein or Art Harrigan immediately so
that we might prioritize the names listed in the September
19/17/75 than 4 letter.

a letter dated August 29, 1975, from the Senate Select Committee
which contained a "partial list" of selected cases in which IRS
files indicated that the Department had received tax returns and
other tax information. You will recall that that letter requested
that the Department expedite the production of its files showing.
the origin of each request, the use made of the information, and
the names of Departmental personnel with firsthand knowledge of
the request for and use of the tax information in each instance of
such request.
Attached for your further attention and additional response
is what is hoped to be the Committee's completed list of selected.
cases for which the SSC seeks the same information as requested in

Please advise me as soon as possible of any delays that may
make prompt compliance with this request impossible.

RE:
Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
SENSTUDY 75
Subsequently, Gitenstein telephonically recontacted
SA Paul V. Daly and advised that the request for investigation
had been done "behind his and Elliff's back" apparently referring
to John Elliff, Task Force Director for the Senate Select Com-
mittee. He indicated that this request had been discussed with
the Deputy Attorney General's Office and was an investigation
being conducted by Senate Tower and Kurt Smothers, Minority
Counsel. He requested that SA Daly contact Michael E. Shaheen,
Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the De-
partment, to verify that arrangements have been made for the
Bureau to conduct this investigation.
SA Daly contacted Shaheen and Shaheen advised that
he knew nothing of this request. Shaheen was informed that
absent specific instructions from the Attorney General the
Bureau would not conduct the requested investigation and
Shaheen agreed that this was the proper position for the
Bureau. Shaheen was informed that the Senate Select Com-
mittee Staff Member conducting the investigation was David
Bushong and Shaheen stated that he knew Bushong and Bushong
had formerly been the Administrative Assistant to former
Attorney General William Saxbe.
Subsequently, John Bayley, Assistant Minority
Counsel for the Senate Select Committee, telephonically con-
tacted SA Daly and apologized for the request that the Bureau
conduct an investigation for the Senate Select Committee and
he indicated that he thought arrangements had been made for
this investigation through the Deputy Attorney General's Office.
Bushong advised that Senator Tower was currently attempting to
locate the Attorney General to straighten out this particular
problem and apparently arrange for the Bureau to conduct such
an investigation.

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Request
Reference is made to my memorandum of September 5, 1975, by
which I forwarded to you for your attention and appropriate response
a letter dated August 29, 1975, from the Senate Select Committee
which contained a "partial list" of selected cases in which IRS
files indicated that the Department had received tax returns and
other tax information. You will recall that that letter requested
that the Department expedite the production of its files showing
the origin of each request, the use made of the information, and
the names of Departmental personnel with firsthand knowledge of
the request for and use of the tax information in each instance of
such request.
Attached for your further attention and additional response
is what is hoped to be the Committee's completed list of selected
cases for which the SSC seeks the same information as requested in
their letter of August 29.
Please advise me as soon as possible of any delays that may
make prompt compliance with this

David Bushong, who identified himself as a Senate
Select Committee Staff Member, telephonically requested on
9/10/75 that the Bureau determine the listing for telephone
number 714-756-3388 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California, and the
listing for Post Office Box 515 in Rancho, Santa Fe, California.
Bushong indicated that the fact he was attached to the Senate
Select Committee could be verified by inquiry with Staff Director
Bill Miller or Security Officer Ben Marshall of that Committee.
Mark Gitenstein of the Senate Select Committee was
telephonically contacted by SA Paul V. Daly and advised of the
request received from David Bushong. He was informed that the
Bureau did not have authority to conduct an investigation for
the Senate Select Committee in the absence of instructions from
the Attorney General and that the Bureau would not conduct such
an investigation in the absence of same. Gitenstein agreed that
the Bureau should not conduct the investigation and indicated he
would bring this to the attention of Bushong.
Subsequently, ASAC Arthur Barger of the San Diego
Office telephonically advised he had been contacted by David
Bushong and asked to make available to him information he had
requested the Bureau to furnish. Barger was informed that the
Committee had been notified that this was an improper request
and that the Bureau was not going to comply. He was told to
tell Bushong that Mark Gitenstein of the Committee had been
apprised of this matter and he should contact Gitenstein.

Gitenstein was telephonically recontacted and advised
that Bushong had contacted the San Diego Office requesting an
investigation and Gitenstein was reminded that he had stated
previously he would insure that Bushong was advised that his
was an improper request. Gitenstein explained that he did not
realize Bushong had left for San Diego and that he would SEP 25 1975
straighten the situation out.

were held I cannot recall anything discussed. He asked
the purpose of such a meeting and I told him if such a
meeting took place it was in the nature of a social
call with Sullivan paying his respects to Magill and a
public: relations-type of meeting. He asked whether there
was any discussion between Sullivan and Magill regarding
any anti-King activities and I told him, "no. He asked
whether Sullivan had made any other visits to Atlanta
and I told him I knew of none.
He asked whether I was aware of any inquiry
made by the Bureau into the handling of the King
investigation either through the Inspection Staff or
otherwise. I told him I was not aware of any. He asked
whether Nichols, the Agent assigned to the King
investigation had been in Atlanta while I was there. I
told him I had hazy recall of Nichols, but did not
recall him. He asked the same thing about Al Sentinella.
I told him Sentinella was there when I arrived and was
still there when I left Atlanta. He asked who had
supervised the Security Squad. I told him Supervisor
Charles Harding.

stitutional Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, on
February 27, 1975.)

Elliff indicated that the Bureau will ordinarily be
given transcripts of what witnesses have furnished the Commit-
tee concerning the topic of the hearing prior to the hearing
and will be given a list of documents which will be used during
the particular hearing prior to that hearing. Gitenstein stated
that this was intended so that the Bureau could be responsive to
questions asked during the particular hearing. Additionally,
Gitenstein indicated that the Bureau will be requested from time

making the request ten days, if possible, prior to the Committee's
intended use.
Elliff in a subsequent conversation indicated that
this procedure had not been worked out by the Committee and
that there were many options being considered concerning the
declassification matter. One of the means. being discussed by
the Committee is to have a suitably paraphrased substitute for
the document to be used in hearings.

coverage on John Rosselli. Without further advice as to the identity of
"any White House person" or "any DOJ person” no logical search of

INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
i
RE:
1
Set out below is information concerning an interview
of FBI SA Fred J. Cassidy by a Staff Member of the SSC. Cassidy
is currently assigned to FBI Headquarters. The details of the
interview are as furnished by Cassidy.
On advance notice from Mr. Loch Johnson, SSC Staff
Member, Cassidy was advised that he was to be interviewed on
August 20, 1975. Cassidy was informed by the Legal Counsel
Division of the FBI that he was being released from any
applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC interview
concerning the Huston Plan. It was explained to Cassidy that
he had a right to counsel; however, the FBI was unable to provide
private counsel. Cassidy was also told that there were certain
privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to
answer questions. These areas concern information which might
divulge the identities of FBI sources; information relating to
sensitive methods and techniques; information which might adversely
affect ongoing FBI investigations; and information which had
originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies. Cassidy was informed that if a question arose during
the interview in one of these areas, he had the privilege, before
replying, of consulting with an FBI representative.
The following is a first-person statement prepared by
Cassidy reporting the interview of him.

Mr. Johnson asked if I had met Tom Charles Huston
prior to the initial meeting of the Huston Plan working group.
I advised him that I had never heard of Huston prior to the
mentioning of his name by W. C. Sullivan at the initial meeting
of FBI personnel involved in the Huston Plan, which meeting
occurred early in June, 1970, and had never seen him until the
first meeting of the working group held at CIA Headquarters,
Langley, Virginia, shortly thereafter.
Mr. Johnson asked about the initial meeting of FBI
personnel concerning the Huston Plan. I told him it was held
in Mr. Sullivan's conference room in the Federal Triangle
Building and that as best as I could recall it was attended by
Mr. Sullivan and the branch Inspectors of the Intelligence
Division as well as the Section Chiefs. Sullivan told us of
the plan and as I recall indicated this was a golden opportunity
to regain the coverage afforded by techniques, which had been
denied us for the most part, since 1967. I told him that in my
view Sullivan was going to make this one last effort to regain
the coverage and if this effort failed was prepared to retire.
Mr. Johnson asked if former Inspector T. J. Smith was
at this meeting. I told him I could not recall.
The initial meeting of the Ad Hoc group at CIA was
discussed and I advised him that, as I recalled, at that meeting
it was decided that each participating agency would submit a
paper listing the restraints on their particular agency which
were hampering them in doing their job. I pointed out that the
FBI submitted an extensive list of restraints and that this paper
was circulated to the other participating agencies without being
cleared through Mr. Hoover.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
On August 20, 1975, Mr. Loch Johnson of the Senate
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect
to Intelligence Activities (SSC) staff interviewed me in my
office, Room 4821, JEH Building, concerning my knowledge of,
and participation in, the so-called "Huston Plan.
Mr. Johnson did not place me under oath or advise me
of my rights.
He asked about my background which I provided, including
the fact that I have been a Special Agent of the FBI since
August 7, 1950.
With regard to the extent of my participation in the
Huston Plan, I advised Mr. Johnson that I was selected by former
Assistant Director William C. Sullivan to act as the liaison
officer for the plan, probably because of my experience in the
FBI Domestic Liaison Section and my extensive liaison contacts
through my participation in the various United States Intelligence
Board (USIB) Committees. My duties with regard to the Huston Plan
were to insure that appropriate notification of meetings was made
and that the various papers prepared as the result of meetings
held were delivered to the proper individuals in the other agencies
participating in the plan. Some of the papers were delivered
personally by me, others were sent by courier.
I advised Mr. Johnson that I was generally aware of
the contents of the papers prepared through my attendance at the
meetings of the working group and discussions with participating
personnel; however, I personally made no input nor did I participate
in the preparation of the workpapers or the finished product.

RE:

FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
Sullivan then tried to have the other agencies
listed as the agencieswhich submitted the restraints. Having
accomplished this, he was then in a position to advise Mr. Hoover
that this or that was not wise or necessary. When the final
report was prepared, the FBI then footnoted most of the recom-
mondations as opposing them.
Mr. Johnson said he had been advised by Mr. Helms and
Admiral Gaylor that the final draft which they reviewed prior to
going to Mr. Hoover's office to sign it did not contain the
footnotes and that they were not aware that the FBI was objecting
to the recommendations until they saw the final version of the
report in Mr. Hoover's office.
I told him that I cannot specifically recall what was
in the final draft; however, I was aware that all of the working
croup was aware of the FBI position as it was so stated at the
necting in which the draft was hammered out. I told him I
specifically recalled this as it had put Mr. Sullivan in a most
embarrassing position. At one point when asked why a change was
to be made or why the FBI was going to object, Sullivan responded
with words to the effect that because fr. Hoover caid so.
Ifr. Johnson asked why covert mail coverage was listed
as a restraint as CIA was engaged in such coverage in 1970. I
told him I was not in a position to discuss CIA operations with
him. He also asked about the removal of restrictions or use of
curreptitious entries to obtain cryptographic materials. I told
him I was not free to discuss such activity with him.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
FRED J. CASSIDY BY SSC STAFF MEMBER
Mr. Johnson asked if I was aware of who was the
instigator of the Huston Plan. I told him I had no direct
knowledge but would suspect it was W. C. Sullivan, Huston, or
possibly former Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian;
however, the answer to his question would have to be obtained
from those individuals or such records as he may be able to
locate.
He asked my impression of Tom Charles Huston. I told
him I felt Iluston was a very bright young man who saw this plan
as an opportunity to become the Henry Kissinger of domestic
security and thereby enhance himself and his political career.
Mr. Johnson stated that his investigation had developed
that Sullivan at the outset of the plan appeared to want to push
through the plan; however, he seemed to take a direct turnabout
and began to advise Ifr. Hoover against adopting some of the
proposals being made by the various participating agencies. He
said it was his impression that this turnabout occurred at the
time Sullivan was promoted to Number Three Man in the Bureau.
He asked if I could shed any light on this turn of events.
I told Mr. Johnson that I could not speak for Sullivan
and could only give him my impression of what occurred, that being
at the outset of the plan Sullivan truly felt this was a golden
opportunity to get the coverage back, and decided to lay his job
on the line to accomplish this. When he was moved up to the
Number Three job, I felt he saw the opportunity to someday become
the Director of the FBI. Further, as the drafts of the plan were
being written, Sullivan realized that sooner or later Mr. Hoover
would see them and at that time realize that Sullivan had dissom-
inated to the intelligence community all of the restraints
Mr. Hoover had imposed on the FBI.

Reference is made to the letter from the Chairman
of the SSC to the Attorney General dated August 28, 1975,
requesting delivery of previously requested FBI materials
pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr. Reference is also made

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
:
-
In respect to Items 14 and 15, we are delivering
a document dated December 17, 1964. As indicated on page 2
of this document, it was approved for Mr. Sullivan by
someone whose initials appear to the right of "WCS/."
Although we cannot say with absolute certainty who that person
might have been, the initials appear to be those of former
FBI Special Agent (SA) Daniel J. Brennan. Former SA E. R.
Clayton approved the communication for Mr. Tolson. Notations
on page 2 indicate that Mr. Belmont approved it and also
advised FBI Director Hoover of its contents on December 18,
presumably 1964. No written approval by Mr. Hoover is noted.
In respect to Item 21, we are delivering a document
dated August 24, 1967. We have previously furnished the
SSC, by memorandum dated June 24, 1975, and subtitled "Request
Pertaining to Electronic Surveillance," an excised copy of
the August 24, 1967, document. The copy which is now being
delivered contains certain administrative data which had been
excised on previous delivery. However, those excisions
remaining relate to the substance of the memorandum and were
made to protect the identity of a representative of a friendly
foreign intelligence service, the name of that service and
the name of the country involved.
With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information in
FBI files came from electronic surveillances of Dr. King;
however, there exist areas where documentation of the
information is not precise and no accurate determination can
be made. Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions
of the material being furnished do not contain information
developed as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

The enclosed article, captioned as above, is the
one we have been preparing in line with approval of our
recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a
very high level to show current communist activities in
relation to the Negro movement. It incorporates up-to-date`
material just received from our New York Office relating
to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National
Executive Committee. Discussion of racial matters was a
primary topic at the week-long meeting.
Pig
The enclosed article is a factual, documented
analysis of the over-all current situation. We believe
that it would be of interest not only to the Attorney General
but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House%3B Mr. McCone, at
the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department
of State%3B as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces
intelligence agencies of the Defense Department. Accordingly,
if the article as prepared is approved, we propose to dis-
*seminate it to the afore-mentioned individuals and agencies.
RECOMMENDATION:
ENCH} .
That the enclosed article be approved. If approved,
it should be returned to the Domestic Intelligence Division
for preparation of appropriate letters of transmittal.

Enclosed is a paper, captioned as above, which depicts the communist
influence in the Negro movement with emphasis on Martin Luther King, Jr. .
This paper is an up-to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared
under the date of October 16, 1963. In updating it we emphasized three
main areas: (1) the continued dependence of King upon former Communist
Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers and his continued
reliance on the long-time communist Stanley David Levison; (2) facts
relating to the moral degeneracy of King; and (3) the recent and current
Party aims and activities relative to the racial movement.
RECOMMENDATION:
-
Upon approval, consideration will be given to appropriate dissemina-
tion. When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic
Intelligence Division for printing, and the preparation of appropriate
letters if disseminated.

Memorandum to W. C. Sullivan
From F. J. Baumgardner
RE: COMUNIST INFILTRATION OF
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
100-438794
The Atlanta Office has
'U. S. Government are involved.
recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D, Georgia) be
advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial stuation that exists in the
South.
It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be, furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King. In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movement--A
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCIC and King, This summary deals with King's communist
connections and his personal immoral activities. With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would.
undoubtedly be removed from the NS program to obtain qualified
Negro students for southern schools.
The information concerning the SCIC participation-
in the NSF prograin is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies.
RECOMMENDATION:
There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr. Ieland J. Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and
the Negro Movement--A Current Analysis."

This memorandum recommends that the National Science
Foundation (NSF) be furnished information concerning the
communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) and its President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
This appears necessary since the SCLC has been contacted by the
NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools.
L
AT 1382-S* has furnished information that Cordy T.
Vivian, SCIC Director of Affiliates, was advised that the NSF
desired qualified applicants to enter the University of Mississipp
and other schools in southern states. where the NSF has its
program in progress. Vivian was advised that the NSE was
contacting organizations such as the SCIC and other civil rights
groups to handle the recruitmentxar-fx-negro
9
they did not want it to appear that the NSE was attempting to
put Negro applicants in southern schools.
Vivian-was-advised that each qualified applicant
: would receive a $3,000-scholarship from the NSE. Since this
is a Government, project any expenses incurred in this matter
would not come out of anyone's pocket." This would indicate
that any expenses incurred, by the SCIC in their recruitment
effort would be paid for with Government funds.
-
The communist influences exerted on King are well
known to the Bureau. Vivian has in the past been a member
of the Communist Party.
OBSERVATIONS:
It is incredible that an outfit such as the SCIC
should be utilized for the purpose of recruiting Negroes to
take part in the NSF program, particularly where funds of the
