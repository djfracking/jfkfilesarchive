A Provisional Operational Approval is granted for the use of this Subject
as set forth below.
A Provisional Operational Approval issued by CI Staff grants the same
authority, on a temporary basis, for the use of an individual as the authority
granted in an Operational Approval unless otherwise specified by CI/OA. It is
based, however, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
ject to a further final review when all investigation is completed.
Your attention is referred to the request for cancellation memorandum
submitted by SOD on 5 May 1965. Subject's amended QA was subsequently cancelled as
requested.
OA
A POA is being granted for the use of the Subject in the Congo under Project
WITHRUSH for a period of 90 days. Upon receipt of an up-dated FRQ Part II an
QA will be processed. The PRQ Part II of record pertains to prior WH/C/RR/QA

Project's WIPEGASUS or WITHRUSH.
POA is reinstated until 18 November 1965.
*
2457492* *29&
E
To process the Operational Approval, full information (completed PRQ
Parts I and II) must be submitted as soon as possible and not later than six
(6) months from this date. Al Operational Approval will follow when all
investigation is completed and upon the receipt of satisfactory PRQ Parts I
and II. Cancellation must be requested if use of Subject by interested Di-
visions ceases.

.
Ricardo was selected for the group because of
Case Officer recommendation and personal obser
vation and his training record plus the abib ity
to speak French and English as well as Spanish.
He is particularly bright, and during the prepara-
tory and holding phase, as well as during the phase-
in which he has been left behind to accompany Alberto
Perez home, he performed as required of a good
commando.
During the action he showed a surprising leadership
capability, taking ofer effectively a team which
needed it at the moment and continuing until he got
hit.
During a portion of the action he served as Major
Hoare s commo link with aviators whose English was
not good.
Ricardo is definitely recommended for spacial ops
in a leadership capacity, but it is mentioned here
that his use to KUBARK may be in a broader field and
that use as a commando may be wasting his talents.
:
Ricardo is not now employed at JMWAVE. He is not
felt in any way to have after-action security
concern.

PISTOLEROS Y TERRORISTAS

Junto con Ricardo Morales Navarrete, alto funcionario en la Ofi-

¡Asombroso! ¡Orlando Garcia ministro

Antes del sabotaje al avión comercial
cubano en las cercanias de esa isla ca-
ribeña, Orlando Garcia y su "curruña”
viajaron a ella varias veces. ¿Tienen es-
tos sujetos que ver con la preparación
del monstruoso acto terrorista, ampa-

pagados con dineros de la nación?

EN CURAZAO:
Por su cercanía a Venczulea y su
condición de estafeta de grandes ope-
taciones comerciales y de otro género,
Curazao parece ser un centro operativo
del gang de la CIA infiltrado en los
organismos de seguridad y altos cargos
publicos venezolanos regidos por ex-
tranjeros nacionalizades o conectados
con ellos
Se dice que Orlando Garcia estuvo
recientemente o está en Curazao. ¿Qué
hace alli? O que hizo? Seria intere
sante una explicación de los frecuentes
viajes de este individuo violador de los
derechos humanos en el pasadɔ y tra-
ficante de prestitutas y contrabando
hoy.
Su poder pařece no haber caido des-
pués del escándalo donde están invo⚫ .
lucrados otros apátridas de origen cu
bano y mercenarios a su servicio. con
motivo del criminal atentado contra la
nave de "Cubana de Aviación" el 6 de
octubré pasado. .
Desde hace tiempo Orlando García
es reỷ en los aparatos represivos y de
seguridad, tal como lo fueron otres ex-
tranjeros fascistas y mercenatios como
el.
Es el protector de Morales Navarre-
tc. Bustillo Pérez y demás pistoleros y
terroristas que ocupan puestos oficiales
on Venezuela. Está en connivencia con
Orlando Bosch, uno de los autores in-
telectuales de la masacre aérea de Bar-

1. COS met with a representative of LNERGO on 22 November 1972
in an attempt to clarify the confusing issue over AMDESK-1 as outlined in
reference A. The substance of LNERGO's remarks are as follows:
LNERGO ascertained from conversations with AMDESK-1 that the latter
had been in Venezuela some time during the summer or early fall of 1972
on Gramco business. During his visit to Venezuela, AMDESK contacted
his old friend CIRASH-6. In the course of this contact, CIRASH-6
evidenced an interest in re-establishing contact with BKHERALD. in
Washington. Subsequently, AMDESK-1, through the good offices of his
superior in Gramco, arranged this contact which eventually took place.
LNERGO has since been advised by AMDESK-1 that he (AMDESK-1) did not.
accompany CIRASH-6 to Washington.
.2.
The problem, therefore, appears to be that AMDESK-1, for
reasons not clear to us, reported to LNAGON that he and an unidentified
high ranking Venezuelan Government official had been in Washington
together, and he (AMDESK-1) met with a BKHERALD officer. LNERGO
mentioned that they have always found AMDESK-1 honest and objective,
but there is always the possibility that he could have misrepresented the
information he passed to LNAGON, perhaps to in some advantage for
himself with that service. In any event, LNERGO prefers not to pursue the
matter further with AMDESK-1 as they are reluctant to become involved in

what could be a misunderstanding between the Station and LNAGON.
The Station also prefers not to raise the issue again with LNAGON
as the letter sinime AMDESK-1 related the details of his contacts
with BKHERALD in confidence, and to pressure him now for more
facts would only tend to alienate him with LNAGON.

VEALED THAT A-1 HAS BEEN OF INTEREST TO LNERGO SINCE 1968-
WHEN STATION TURNED HIM OVER TO THEM. WHEN THIS FACT CALLED TO
LNAGON'S ATTENTION, LATTER COMMENTED THAT NOT ONLY DID THEY
REALIZE A-I WAS LNERGO CONTACT BUT THEY ALSO WERE AWARE THAT A-1 \
WAS RECENTLY IN TOUCH WITH EXCROWN.
2. LNAGON EASED THIS ASSUMPTION ON INFORMATION WHICH THEY'

3. ALL ATTEMPTS BY STATION TO AMPLIFY ABOVE
HAVE PROVED NEGATIVE. LÁGON, IS RELUCTANT TO
QUESTION A-I AGAIN ON HIS ALLEGED CONTACTS WITH EXCROWN AS
THEY HAVE IMPORTANT NARCOTICS TRIAL COMMENCING WEEK 6 NOVEMBER
1972 IN WHICH A-1 IS COOPERATING WITH LNAGON AND THEY DO NOT
WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT THIS TIME THAT MIGHT UPSET HIM.
ACCORDING LNAGON, A-1 RELATED ABOVE DETAILS CONCERNING HIS
CONTACT WITH EXCROWN IN CONFIDENCE AND THEY BELIEVE THAT TO
PRESSURE HIM NOW FOR MORE DETAILS MIGHT ALIENATE HIM WITH
LNAGON. _
4. AS FOR REGISTERING A-1 IN THE NARCOTICS SOURCE
REGISTRY, LNAGON STATED THEY DO NOT INTEND TO CONFER WITH
ENERGO AND NEGOTIATE WITH THEM HOW A-1 IS TO BE HANDLED
-LNAGON PLANS TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE A-1 AS THEY HAVE IN PAST.
LNAGON COMMENTED IT WAS THEIR UNDER STANDING THAT WHEN TWO

RECISTRY WAS MERELY TO ADVISE THE INTERESTED PARTIES OF THE

THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCREETLY INFORMAING NORBERTO HERNANDEZ

FROM THE SAME SOURCE WHOSE RELIABILITY HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY

1. On approximately 5 March 1972, a Station asset, CIFENCE-4,
while acting in his cover capacity had occasion to detain and question
one Ricardo MORALES Navarrete, a Cuban resident of Miami.
2. Morales N. told CIFENCE-4 that he, Morales, is employed by
LNERGO from whom he receives a salary of US$700 per month. Morales said
that he was en route to Colombia on a drug case at the time. During the
conversation Morales admitted to CIFENCE-4 having been responsible for a
killing in Florida.
3. CIFENCE-4 reported to the Station the above, as well as stating
that Morales has an extremely poor reputation in the Cuban community,
where he is prone to tell nearly anyone willing to listen of his affiliation
with LNERGO, with the implication that his employer sanctions his
activities.
4.
Morales also told CIFENCE-4 that a Cuban (true name of CIGOAL-5)
who works with SIFA in Caracas is an agent of BKTRUST.
5. Attached is a copy of the reentry permit of Morales, as well as
a clipping from the Miami press relating to the killing which Morales
allegedly confessed to having committed.
