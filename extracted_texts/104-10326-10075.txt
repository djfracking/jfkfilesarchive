3.J PAGES ONE AND TWO OF YOUR BRIEFING PAPER ARE RIGHT ON THE
MARK. PAGE THREE HOWEVER CONTAINS SOME-ISSUES THAT_WE_REQUEST YOU
DELETE AND/OR SOFTEN.
A. FIRST SENTENCE OF PARAGRAPH 4. DO NOT DISCUSS ANY
UNILATERAL OPERATIONS WITH THE SENATOR. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH ANY
DISCUSSION OF SOURCES; IN THIS INSTANCE THE CASE IS INACTIVE AND
WOULD NOT_ADD TO YOUR DISCUSSION.
WOULD NOT ADD
PARAGRAPH 7. PLEASE REDRAFT TO READ AS FOLLOWS:
REGARDING EMBASSY SECURITY, OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITHOUT A 24 HOUR
PRESENCE WE DO NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO SURREPTITIOUS
ENTRY. ELECTRONIC SECURITY DEVICES WILL ONLY TELL US THAT AN
SECURITY AT
ENTRY HAS BEEN MADE, IT WILL NOT STOP AN ENTRY.
EMBASSY MINSK WAS RECENTLY DISCUSSED BY CE OFFICERS WITH THE SSCI,
WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN TO THE DEPARTMENT. THE FACT, OF
COURSE, IS THAT STATE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO
HAVE MARINE GUARDS AT ALL LOCK AND LEAVE EMBASSIES AND NWBOLTON
APPRECIATES THAT. (FYI: THIS IS A PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE
WITH THE AMBASSADOR. WE SEE NO POINT IN ALIENATING HIM BY PUTTING
SECRET
