General Carter briefed the meeting on the provision of the security
advice to the President of Colombia.
General Carter read the CIA memo on CINCARIB communications
problems. The meeting expressed delighted surprise at our capability.
We are now a full-fledged member of the State - Defense group which is
considering this problem.
On Nicaragua, a memo is to be prepared for the Acting DCI describing
the degree of Cuban involvement, particularly in the shipment of arms to
Nicaragua by way of Honduras. This memo will also cover Communist
infiltration of student and labor and a discription of CIA activities in these
same fields.
There was a long discussion of the role of USIB in recommending coun-
tries to be placed on the counter-insurgency list. Full account to be gotten
from Tom Parroti.
There was discussion of the Southeast Asia status report, concentrating
on strategic namlets, the Montagnards, and the bad press situation in Saigon.
General Carter called attention to the memoranda on the North Vietnam
presenckie Laos. The question came up as to whether there was an SNIE
in the works on this. This subject is to be kept current, especially in view
of the 6 October deadline.
State and Defense announced that they had now sent the counterinsurgency
doctrine papers to everyone in the field.
