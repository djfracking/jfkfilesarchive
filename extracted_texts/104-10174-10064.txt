ICAP Corporation is
ternational consulting and
financial organization, *pe
cializing in the developing
countries, which offers three
principal services to its
clients:
Financial and industrial studies, particularly
feasibility reports and market research
Negotiation of international joint ventures
Investments and financing
ICAP's professional services are primarily intended
for the industrial investor or financial institution
interested in entering a foreign country. If the initial
feasibility and market studies are favorable, ICAP
can advise on the most appropriate way of entering
the new market: whether through a licensing or dis-
tribution agreement, contract manufacturing, a joint
venture, or a partially or wholly owned subsidiary.
The local ICAP affiliate can guide the investor
through the entire course of such an undertaking,
from the initial exploration of the prospects to the
selection of the local partner, the raising of local
capital, and, if appropriate, the eventual listing of
the shares of the resulting enterprise on the local
stock exchange.
ICAP is as concerned with enabling a client com-
pany to recognize as early as possible the fact that
it should not undertake a major commitment” in a
foreign country as it is with giving effective assis
tance to companies who determine to go forward.
It brings to these tasks a full range of professional
skills
have performed to the standards of
governments, major banks, and industrial companies
of international standing..
It brings to the service of its clients close relation-
ships on all levels of local government, banking and
industry. Thus, in addition to analyzing such ques-
tions as product demand, industrial technology.
financing, site selection and the like, ICAP can
counsel the prospectiv investor on the govern
mental attitudes he will face, and belp him make
friendly contact with those in the business and
official communities with whom he should deal.

INTERVIEW TECHNIQUESH COVER ETG
:
:
Sate
At the first masting and the one the next day before I made the
trip, my principal local political contact presented a possible
cost of operations in the coming election. I asked him if it were a
realistic figure and whether his analysis were realistic. He admitted
that it really wasn and I told him to go back and sharpen his pencil
and sit down and talk sense. It was therefore agreed that when I came
back from my trip we would sit down and go over it district by district
and problem by problem. He and his political cohort tried to lay out an
itinerary for me and they recommended the people I would see in each town.
Our
boy there dutifully wrote down all these names for me and then we
very dutifully threw the list away when it was all over and we started
making up our own list. Some of the people you gave me I included in
the list and saw. Also, our boy had a number of people. We bota agreed
that this trip would have to be played by ear, since after you arrive
you have a better idea of what you are doing. The only strategy that
we really agreed on was that I would take a plane and fly from the
south up.
I did exactly that. I flew over to the south and then went on,
smelling around. I used three methods: (1) street interview, shop
interview and in other words, people of no significance, (2) the
Rotary Club routine and (3) talks with lawyers.
Using the first method, I would go into a little shop and would
inquire about how much an article would cost. If the shop keeper could
speak English we then got into a conversation, and then
and then I would make
a purchase. If he couldn't speak English, then I would go to anothar
shop where they could. I bought all sorts of odds and ends a pencil,
a little notebook, a pair of slippers. I bought a pair of sandals
which I didn't wear because I took the advice of the people and remained
American all the way. I wore shoes, socks, shirt and so forth. Whenever
a great number of people were attracted to us, I considered this a good
opportunity for an interview. As you know, you talk to one native and
there are five standing around you they will surround you.
If they
speak your language they will participate. They won't interrupt when
someone else is talking, but when he is finished each one will get into
the act; this is wonderful.
And then I did the Rotary Club routine; there are Rotary Clubs all
over the dammed place. I was taken to one meeting which happened to be
taking place in a town where I was. In the hotel where I was staying they
had the Rotary International. I looked it over very carefully to make sure

It is interesting at first since you see so many museums, rooms and art

interests mə politics. Here is something that is after your own
heart, this local situation. I became Goddamned curious. Here was the
opportunity to tour this on a profit basis by

future and so forth. I made it logical enough. At first I trimmed it
pretty well with a lot of stuff about how I love these people (and that is
true too) My experience with them has been pretty much limited to students.
My experience with them has always been wonderful and I love them. They
were fine young men and women, I still find them to be interesting young
men and women and that I have a natural affinity for them. They liked
that. I said also that I had a sympathy for their men, their problems and
their traditions.
In my contacts throughout the area I maintained the same story. I
was lucky to hit on the right formula in the beginning and found that it
worked. With very few variations, I stuck to the main theme.
Very often I would fall into a good interview. For example, I was
looking for a small businessman with a factory. I asked a man where to
find him and was led to a lawyer's
a lawyer's office
office. This was a very fortunate
mistake; a couple of times they turned out to my advantage. This lawyer
turned out to be a fella who was very well informed and who had previously
been in politics. He was also close to the Roman Catholic hierarchy And
he gave me an interview which summarized the informed opinion that I had
run into in that area. (He also took me to the university and introduced
me to the priest who was the head of the school. There I had a chance to
interview students who showed an unwillingness to admit that they don't
understand and don't know; that paid off for me.) He characterised the
typical interview I got from the typical informed person. In these inter-
views I tried to be objective and find out, rather than inspire answers,

apply for collect and for a scholarship. I said that I wasn't an official
and didn't know the answers, or pretend to, but I created the impression
that there was a possibility of applying for scholarships to the schools,
or even to the U. S. Government. (I actually do intend to find out about
these things and follow it through since they were very helpful to me and.
I am very grateful.) There was some truth to what I said to them and I
wam't making up stories out of whole cloth. There was a basis foæ
everything I said to them although there night have been some exaggeration.
However, in the main, I could tell the story with great cúnsistency for

that they didn't have a list of mambers, aince I didn't want to claim to
be one and then have them find out that I wasn't on the list! There was
no membership list, but they did have the names of the officers. From
that I picked the name of a guy who lived near Detroit and for the occasion
he became a very intimate friend. He was a doctor and he lived in the
suburbs or some place outside of Detroit. I introduced myself as a member
and said that I had a very good friend also in the organization; they could

part called the Bar Association, which was a room where those lawyers met
and someone would serve tea or coffee. If you walked in you would usually
find at least one lawyer there. I introduced myself in the following
manner: I am so-and-so from Detroit, a member of the Bar. I have
been practising for thirty-odd years and an interested in the judicial
system and processes of your country. In no time, you have half of tae

it was tea because I hate their coffee; I hate coffee and theirs is even
worse). I would than start talking about my trip, my interest in the local
national situation, and then start asking questions which I already knew
the answers to. For example, "how do you discipline a lawyer, who gets off

and they would explain their methods of appeal, high court and
how the judges are appointed

a newspaper I would somehow arrange to get an introduction through a local
person to the publisher or editor, or maybe both, of the newspapers (be it
a Communist one, one of a Political Party,
one of a Political Party, or an independent paper - I
saw them all). I want with this explanation: I was a widower, my wife

Questions Did you know that you were an object of undue suspicion? Answer:
I presumed that I was. was an unusual stranger since tourism is not
usual thing in that part of the country. Hence I set about to remove any
suspicion. I acted very much American, being all over the place and being
curious; but I gave purpose to my curiosity and explained it in each place.
Everywhere I engaged people in conversation and gathered other people,
explaining my purpose, interests and why I had such interests. I think
that in each instance logically explained my presence and worked into the
questions that I asked. I think the idea of going to the Commists
accomplished my purpose. I was not a subject of interest to
subject of interest to the newspapers,
which I might well have been had they had suspicions. I worked out in the
open. In dining rooms I would find some excuse to say "do yo

prepared? we don't have it in the U. S., etc." Pretty soon we were sitting
together, ordering drink and invariably the owner of the hotel would come
and sit with us and tell me he would write a note to a particular newspaper
editor, eto. As a result, I found that about half of the time I was
directed to people. I never felt that I was suspect, except by Americans,
and I think they thought that I was checking up on them since they tried
to avoid me
Questions Did you ever find, or have the feeling, that you ware
followed from the airport, eto.? Answers I had that feeling once, but
I wasn't being followed. For example, I had the feeling that I had seen
the same man in several places, but dismissed it because I didn't see him
again. Also, so
so many of those people look alike, that I may have been
confused

the role of the curious American, but primarily one who is happy with their
country.

a tourist and since I wanted everything to look on the level, I made the
visit. I stopped at every village. If I could speak English there I
would; if not, I used this young fellow which was sometimes satisfactory
But you see, sometimes the villager
or the shopkeeper could speak English,
or some kid could and would translate and they were much more faithful to
the meaning. The driver got to thinking that he knew what answers I wanted
and that ruined his usefulness. I kept saying that I wanted to know what
they were saying, not what I would like to have them say; that how can I
write a good story if I don't know the truth
truth. He got to the point where he
was trying to figure out what I was after and was going to give me the
right answers. Hence I handed him right in the beginning

into some kids about 13 or 14 years old and used them as interproters;
they were good. I saw at least a dozen or more of the newspaper publishers
and correspondents, two of the editors a
two of the editors of two different Communist newspapers,
and I talked with four or five of the Communist leaders.
to about five of the secondary people inaa polit ders. I also talked
party and one of
the more important people in the latter. I talked to the Town Chairman
(mayor) in about half a dozen towns. I also talked with a local official
and to some other old-timers who are not active now, but will be in the
campaign. I feel that as a result of my survey I can give a fairly
authoritative opinion on what the situation is, why and what the future is.
I am confident that my reactions are sound and that my conclusions vill
be accurate.
Questions Did you experience any controls; anyone asking your name
etc. in the airport? answer: Only in the hotels, or when I entered and
left the country. At the hotels you make a full police report. When the
others whom I engaged in conversation (and told them what I was trying to
learn) asked where I was going next, I would ask them what they suggested
how far it is, what was a good hotel, etc. I would trick them into it.
Thus I tried to be a little naive. I was only concerned once.
Question: Did you ever talk voluntarily or involuntarily
you knew to be a policeman? Answer: I talked voluntarily the who

ccps and asked questions and directions. I chose my questions with great
care. Although it locked vary informal, I had it pretty well planned. Since
each question suggested another, it formed a pattern and was very logical.
I was a very happy person and found a lot of things to laugh about and a lot
of things to praise (this is one thing that I had suggested). Keeping in
mind that I was a tourist, I went out of my way to find and see things
and I went to many places which I felt were ridiculous. (Subject talks
here about personal experiences in hotels, plumbing, stc.)

obtained a good deal of useral information on these persons, their
philosophies, plans, etc. as well as information of a derogatory
nature on Fidel Castro (which was later exploited in the propaganda
field). Subject also provided several operational leads and suggestions
upon his return from Cuba. During this assignment, Subject traveled
as a tourist, but at the same time
same time, in order to give him added stature
for conversations stated that he represented American businessmen and
investors who were anxious to assess legal recourses re revolutionary
laws and to determine the possibilities for future development and
investments. WH was very impressed with Subject's ability and
operational maneuverability.
2. From 23 February-3 March 1961 Subject was in El Salvador
again at the suggestion of CA Staff and with the approval of WHD and
the Station. Again, Subject's mission was to provide an over-all
estimate of the fluid political situation. While in that area, he made
numerous political and social contacts of operational interest and "
subsequently made a number of operational suggestions during his
debriefing at Headquarters. Subject's cover for this mission was
tourist travel. Headquarters, the Station and the U.S. Ambassador in
El Salvador were all extremely impressed by Subject's ability to assess
the local political situation and to make the necessary contacts with
a minimum of Station assistance. (Detailed reports on both of these
missions are available in CA/PAG files.)
Current Status and Future Operational Potential:
Statur and Putar
Subject brought his family from California to Washington, D.C.
whe
he is expecting to receive a political appointment probably in the
field of Latin American affairs. He has suggested that if possible he
would like to be operationally active for KUBARK at the same time
Since he will undoubtedly be assigned to Latin America (possibly Mexico),
and will have some freedom of action, he feels he could perform worth
while clandestine services throughout the Latin American area. We
agree. CA/PAG is, therefore, arranging meetings for Subject with WHD
and IOD, both of whom have expressed an interest in this possibility.
(More details will be forthcoming on this.)

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
The Station will recall that part of Edward G. Tichborn'a cover is
provided by DTEMBARGO. Before leaving for Mexico, ho met Staff Agent Michael
J. Skirman (p) and was told to develop a relationship with DTEMBARGO and
Skirman through correspondence. It was suggested that he might submit an
occasional article for consideration by JHWOOL (Identity 6 of reference).
of magazines ("The New Leader" "The Reporter o
Or
Tichborn has submitted his first article. While possibly suitable for
publication in certain kinds
The Saturday Review"), it is not suitable for JMWOOL since it is a journalistic
think-piece and not a scholarly effort and it in by and large critical of The
Alianza para el Progreso and the United States role in The Alianza and in Latin
America in general.
It is therefore requested that Station explain to Tichborn, if he brings
this matter up, that JMWOOL is designed to support and foster United States
policies in Latin America and not gratuitously to criticize them, regardless
of the purpose of the criticism

difficult uncertain future.
The delegates had scarcely returned home when the Goulart-Brazilian
crisis crupted and thereby threatened the very beginnings of Kennedy's hope-
ful proposal. And certainly no seasoned cheerver of Latin American poll-
Ues can assume that the Brazilian crisis has been resolved by the quickly-
devised modus operandi which permitted Joao Goulart to assume the preal-
dency. Goulart instated the constitutional amendment limiting his powers
be submitted to Brazilian voters in a referendum, clearly indicating he wil!
not be content with a mere figurehead status. With the conservative mill-
tarists still adamant in their opposition to a fully-powered Goulart, a ciril
war (a prolonged and bloody one) may be in the offing. Meanwhile, the cre-
ators of the Alliance for Progress find themselves in a watchful, hopeful
dither.
But, aside from the Brazilian problem, the Allangs already had and
still has a number of formidable obstacles which were readily observable
from the outset. Fully granting the immense possibilities offered by this
economic Magna Carta for the Americas, It would be foolish to overlook or
to minimize those basic harah realities of which dreams are not made.
Among the toughest realities facing the Alliance is the Congress of
the United States, which has always been reluctant to approve long-range

Subject has recently solved his foremost personal problem;

shipment was considerably less than the amount authorized by Head
quartera
Subject shows signs of being a valuable asset to the Station.
He will be assigned to take over as a temporary replacement for RIKON
when the latter is on home leave over the holidays. He very probably
will maintain contact with the new student president on RIKCN's return
so that the Station will be able to utilize TICHRORN's knowledge of
election techniques in the next student elections at National University.
Generally, TICHBORN will be used by the Station as outside
case officer for operations in the intellectual field He has already
made contacts in the theatre, ballet, film, writing and student spheres.
In order to imrease his ability to meet and cultivate assets, the
Station is authorizing TICHBORN the rental of a small apartment, to de
sparsely furnished in a bohemian marmor. Subject is posing as a left-of
center Mexican-American, and will provide the Station with regular
reports on personalities and activities in the intellectual field, as
well as run operations at Station direction.

REFERENCE:
Project WUBRINY - Possible Operational
Support of Madrid Station Objectives by
Edward G. TICHBORN (P)
OSMA 23, 350 Dated 11 January 1968
1. Per Mr. Long's request, the undersigned on 30 January 1968
discussed with Edward G. TIGHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid
Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:
WUSALINE/Iberia can be used as an information collection
mechanism in cases where information requirements can be couched
in plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.
☐
b. TICHBORN can assess and develop selected Spanish contacts
of Madrid Station who may be visiting New York and who desire
introductions in US commercial circles.
to the
c. TICHBORN can develop Spaniards in New York as may be
of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TICHBORN has not
made an effort to develop Spaniards in New York but is willing and
able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired,
TICHBORN thinks he can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U.S.
through a friend, Senator Jose Montoya of New Mexico.
TICHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning
leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a pro-
minent publication, such as "Life International." TICHBORN
believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because
he previously published in "Life International" a four-page spread
on birth control in Latin America. This article was favorably
reviewed. TICHBORN suggested a related article on the popula…
tion explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible
topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen. TICHBORN,

reason for gloom. On August 2nd of this year the U.S. Department of
Cene pubdated a report indicate a sharp unprecedented crop in
Mubile
private U. 8. Investments in Latin America. Whereas in 1959 sald invest-
ments totaled 218 million dollars, the total catapulted to a mere 95 million
in 1960, a loss of more than 50 per cent in one year. Much of the blame
for this sudden fear can be traced to the Cuban revolution and the sudden
upsurge of revolutionary fervor elsewhere in the hemisphere. However,
fiscal experts are quick to point out two other factors: (1) the termination
of heretofore accelerated expansion of mining operations and (2) the sud-
den deceleration of activity in the petroleum ladustry in Venezuela In the
latter case one cannot diamtes the impact of Castro's expropriation policies
as reflected in neighboring republics.
Traveling through the U. 8. (reading and hearing prons and television
commentaries and talking with certain members of Congress), one gets the
Impression that the Allanka's primary problems will be of an economie na-
turo. But, here in Maxico and elsewhere in Latin America, one has the
feeling that the political obstacles will be equally if not more troublesome.

la a program of structural reforms
by all or most of the participating countrios. Perhaps too late, the U. 8.
has realized that the Castrolam it so vehemently abhors and fears has its
most effective base where aqualor and disease and social injustice abound
in the presence of arrogant wealth and power. Whereas Uncle Sam once
supported and coddled the Trujillos, Samson, Jimenes, et al,, it now

espouses political and social reforms
fundamental nature. But it is
this very insistence on reform (Kennedy has indeed reiterated the phrase
"revolation"), this penchant for social change, which has evoked the most
skepticism in Latin America.
In solema heraldic language the 21 nations of the hemisphere prom
ised in writing that the needed reforms would be accomplished, but there
must have been many a crossed flager guiding the peas that signed the final
document. Will El Salvador's powerful well-entrenched "fourteen famillles”
stand idly by while an agrarian program anatches away their vast coffee
plantations? And what about the land-rich bacendados of Bolivia. Nicaragua,
Para, Brasil and other hemisphere republics? For all the vagus illusory
promises of basle reforme at Pasta del Este, one cannot ignore this unavold.
able truth: most of Kennedy's hoped-for reforms will seriously affect the
personal economie fortunes of the governing cliques in the countries involved,
One seriously don'ts that these gentlemen shall willingly preside over the 11-
quidation of their personal empires. This in spite of the fact that all of them
are fully (or at least partially) aware that, unless voluntary drastic reforms
are accomplished, their vast holdings will be taken from them forcibly by
some emerging local Fidel Castro. And it may well bo that their stubbara
resistance to change is buttressed by the millions of dollars they have pro-
videntially stashed away in Swiss and American banks during the past few
years. In short, they may be engaging in a prolonged "bolding action" ta
the sare knowledge that their days are numbered.

public works projects on massive scales beyond the scope of the individual
entrepreneur.
Secondly, there's considerable doubt as to the real intentions of
Latin American governments in re flacal reform. It will be exceedingly
difficult, they say, to alter the long-standing pattern of heavy reliance on
import duties and stiff taxes for foreign corporations. Income taxes are
comparatively low and tax collection notoriously lax and subject to easy
evasion by individuals, merchants and local corporations alike,
Thirdly, these foreign investore are especially dubious about the
agrarian aspects of the Allanza. They are predictably apprehensive about
expropriation of their immense landholdings for distribution in small par-
cola among the landless campesinos. (In his state of the union speech on Sep
tambar 1st, Mexico's President Lopes Mateos reported the recent government
acquisition of three Auge latifundies heretofore owned by Americans.) But

the Fidel Castro type will prove "uneconomic," Rather than expropriate
and divide the existing highly productive andics, these gentlemen propose
immediate and widespread colonization of snused lands, This, they argue,
would be cheaper because there would be no cost of indemnification for ex-
propriated properties nor a disclaction of productive capacity. For this
reason they far prefer the colonization measure of Peru and Braail to the
more drastic style of Mexico and Potvin

foreign aid. Even before the U. S. delegation had returned to Washington,
Senator Thruston Marton grumpily informed the press that the Republican
Party would have no part of Dillon's "wild schemes. Then, in a week of
now-you-have-it-now-you-don't bickering in the House and Senate, the Al-
llance spenders were given to understand that the carte is not quite so
blanche as they might hops.
Even assuming a more generous Congressional attitude toward long-
range financing rather than year-to-year appropriations, some observers
were inclined to skepticism in re Treasury Secretary Dillon's laplied prom-
ise of 20 billion dollars over a ten-year period. Answering the skeptics,
Dillon assured the Punta del Este delegates that a large ahare of the 20 bil-
Hon would come from auch already-established and soon-to-be-expanded
agencles as the Export-Import Bank, Development Loan Fund, the World
Bank, the International Cooperation Administration, International Finance
Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. He also expects.
increased investment by private entities. But, notwithstanding such assur
ances, certala financial experts view Dillon's figures as overly optimistic.
They point cat, for example, that Dillon's expectation of 300 million dollars
from the World Bank is unrealistic in view of the fact that it extended only
148 million dollars in credits to Latin America in 1960.
As for Secretary Dillon's expectations for increased investments and
loans from private sources, the skeptics would appear to have even greater

Amerion.
However, all of the aforementioned uncertainties are of less concern
than the omnipresent X factor: the impact of Fidel Castro on all of Latin
How, why, and to what extent can Fidelismo affect the Alianza
para al Progreso? Some cheervers feel that Castro is indeed the real (if
not de jure) father of the Alliance; that without his cataclysmic emergence,
the United States would have continued to ignore the pour-couzla republics
er-cousin
of the south. (In the 1950's only 3% of our foreign aid want to the 21 nations
which comprise Latin America, Laos alone received more aid than al: of
these countries combined.) But, more importantly, the Chan premier
aroused the expectations of the heretofore sullen masses throughout the homis-
phere, and their respective leaders have become acately aware of the rambling
discontent. Some of these politicos would no doubt welcome a sudden disposal
of the Castro annoyance, but none of them would have participated in a move
to openly chastics Cuba at the Panta del Este conference. As a raatter of fact,
"Che" Guevara managed to accomplish a few minor triumpha despite the cool
reception he got from most of the delegates. His post-conference meetings
with President Frondial of Argentina and ex-Prealdant Quadres of Brasil
are not to be taken lightly.
Although the United States managed to obtain all of the desired signa-
tures on the final declaration at Uraguay, it would be naive for me to gespase
that we can once again count on the heretofore solld backing of Latin America.
There is, in fact, an increased spirit af neutralios or independence (call it
what you will) throughout the hemlephere. Note, for example, that chiring

In any event, the promised agrarian or flecal reforms may paradaxi-
cally lead to either of two extremos, both of which would frustrate the stated
intentions of the Alliance. On the one hand, Government X might place its
program in the hands of timid conservatives who interpret "evolution" as
"status que with minimal changes." Or the whole maiter might be referred
-nothing, what's in it for me congressional bodies, with little
or no prodalag from the executty's Franch of government. O the other hand,
Government X might indulge in hasty improvised measures born of publie
ta
clamor and political flaccidity, all of which could produce one of those night-
mare fracasos which embarrass over the most ardent revolutionary. Most
of Latin America considers itself decades behind in the socio-economic de
velopment of the West, and the urge to more quickly and drastically is every-
where evident.
Now a word about Mr. Dillon's expectations in the realm af private
investments as part of the Aliana para el Progreso,
According to reports
in some of the business journals, prospective investors from Aaropa, Japas
and the United States have certain misgivings about the program.
First of all, these businessmen feel that the Alliance offers only
minimal encouragement for private investment in Latin America. Indeed,
come ars quick to point out that in his initial speech at Punta del Eate, Soure-
tary Dillion did not esce mention private enterprise -- nar in any of his sub-
seguent comments before the committee on labor. They feal, therefore,
that the Alliance is oriented toward gover an eat-to-government loans and

as a result of journalistic collaboration with Katherine Anne
Porter, is represented in New York by a top-literary agent,
Monica McCall TICHBORN thinks that it would take him two
to three weeks in Spain interviewing top Spanish industrialists
and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets
informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of his
trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favor-
able reviewer comments. He could be essentially a free lance
journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter
connection, it is of interest that following TICHBORN's trip to
Spain, WUBRINY/I sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look
into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com
mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN's
trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafides.

And shortly after the conference, Prealdent Lopez Mateos told an opening
session of the Mexican congress that his country has been and will continue
to follow an independent course, free of any adherence to either of the great
powers.
It would aspear, therefore, that the Alliance for Pregrean faces a
tougher and more devious course than the Good Neighbor policy of Franklin
Roosevelt. And it is equally apparent that unlean the plan does succeed,
there will be a prolonged period of unrest, bloodshed and misery

SUBJECT: Final Arrangements for Edward G. Tichborn's (P)
Contract Status in Nexico.
REFERENCE: Memorandum for the Record, dated 17 May 1961
1. When I talked with Pichborn (P) on Wednesday, 17 kay,
to arrange a meeting with
meeting with him for kesara. Collins and McCoy,
he stated that he was most anxious to leave on Saturday for
Nexico City and wanted to know if final details could be
taken care of at our arranged meeting on the 19th in order
that be could depart on Saturday, the 20th. As I told Tichborn,
I was somewhat surprised that be planned to leave AO ROOM
although I did know he was anxious to get settled as soon
as possible. I said I would do everything possible to make
the final arrangements so that he could leave as be planned.
2. As a result, Mr. Charles Penney, WH/CA, Mr. Michael
and the undersigned of CA/PAG, and
19th at the Roger Smith Hotel to Ichborn met Friday the
talk about the terms of
Subject'a contract, to brief him on operational
Station contact, etc. Mr. Penney had also arranged that one
detai

the University of Florida meet Pieborn during the briefing.
This individual did attend the meeting briefly and it is
anticipated that perhapa at a later date, this organisation
might be useful as cover for Tichborn in some of his endeavor
and might also be used as a vehicle for bringing promising

Possible Exploitation of ICAP Iberia, S.A.
Reference is made to the meeting on subject with
Mr. Osborne Day, DCOS/Madrid, Mr. Stephen Munger, DC/E/IB, and
Mr. Gale Allen of DOCO just prior to Mr. Dav's departure for
Madrid. It is recalled that Mr. Allen agreed to pass the most
ecent information on ICAP Iberia, S.A. to E/IB for transmittal
to Mr. Day in Madrid. Mr. Day would review this information
together with that known to the station and determine if the
fire has an operational potential for the Madrid Station. In
the event of an affirmative determination, Mr. Day indicated
that he would be interested in the assignment to ICAP Iberia
or a DO career commercial operations officer who would be carried
on the DO t/o but would be assigned operational tasks by the
Madrid Station.
2. ICAP Iberia, S.A. (see brochure attached as Tab A) is
a joint venture company formed by a DO proprietary company, ICAP
Corporation, New York, and the Spa - Corporation banif S.A.
It is domiciled in the Banif offices at Juan Bravo 2, Madrid,
Spain, and currently has no staff. Two of the Banif Directors,
Miguel Echegaray and Juan Antonio Ruiz de Alda, concern them-
selves with ICAP matters on a day to day basis when required.
ICAP Iberia serves mainly as the clearing house for Banif business
requiring support by ICAP New York and for ICAP business requiring
support by Banif in Spain. Recently in a letter dated 4 October 1966
the Fresident of Banif, Juan A. Ruiz de Alda, suggested to the
President of ICAP Corporation that a man and secretary be assigned

Tichborn (P) is to concentrate on spotting students
who would then hopefully be brought
with political potential, who would then
to the U.8. for study. It is also anticipated that he would
be used from time to time to assess the general political
situation in various Latin American countries, as he has done
in the past, and perhaps also to act as advisor in election
operations when such need arises.
such need arises. Subject brought up the
subject of Mexican politics and stated that during his
conversation with Messrs. Collins and McCoy they had stated
that it would be helpful if he could make contacts with
Mexican politicians in order to report on the p itical
situation as a whole and on the split in the PRI party
particularly. (I checked this out today with Mr. McCoy
and he said that Subject had exaggerated a bit and that
this was only discussed in general terms, and that they
had specifically told Tichborn that his operational
instructions would came from the Station,) Mr. Penney
told Tichborn in this connection that he should only
concentrate on student affairs for the time being and that
it would not be to his advantage to begin working in
a field which is already being covered by the Embassy and
the Station. It is thought that he will eventually be
eased into this type of activity, but he
pe of activity, but he should not engage
in such activities until he receives a go-ahead from his
contact. Subject understood and agreed.
WED is now writing up the contract and it will be
sent to the Station for Tichborn's signature. It will bo
dated 25 May 1961. Mr. Penney has agreed to show this
contract to CA/PAG prior to forwarding it to the Station.
Other than clarifying cover arrangements for his monthly
salary deposits, there are no outstanding matters to de
settled in connection with Tichborn's contract status.

need to be worked out on the cover firm to be used in making
such deposits and this is being taken care of by both PAG

the past, Ashmead, Haniford Associates). Tichborn was
also advised as to some items which cannot be claimed
under "operational expenses

purchase of personal clothing, parking of automobile while

The operational potential of ICAP Iberia, S.A., other
than non-official commercial cover, must necessarily depend upon
the activities, personnel, and contacts of Banif. As may be
noted in the descriptive note on Banif attached as Fab B, the
activities of Banif include research, consulting, securities,
new business, underwriting, and investment. These activities
cut across most aspects of economic and political life in Spain.
Banif's personnel have impressive backgrounds and its clients
and references are of a very high level.
Attached as Tab C are three additional pamphlets on

officer to ICAP Iberia, S.A. Normally, when a DC commercial
mechanism provides a cover opportunity, the Area Division supplies
the officer to be assigned. DO would, of course, welcome such an
assignment in this case. DO,
in coordination with NR, would
also be willing to consider a suitable career trainee for assignment
to DO and thence to ICAP Iberia, S.A. as part of Do's development
of career commercial operations officers. Mr. Allen of DOCO

and discuss the Salvadoran situation with him (see SALY 3630;

apprised upon his arrival that if he did meet with Mr. Mann

being informed of this relationship by WHD in order to avoid
any possible embarassing situations.) Tichborn (P) was

SUBJECT: Debriefing of Edward G. Tichborn (P) upon Return
from El Salvador
REFERENCE: Memo for the Record, "Plans for Debriefing of
Edward G. Tichborn (P) in Washington," dated
8 March 1961
1. Edward G. Tichborn (P) arrived in Washington fro
California on 12 March and was debriefed on 13 and 14 March
1961. The debriefing was held in Subject's room at the Statler
Hotel and was tape recorded. Those participating in this
debriefing were Messrs. Faul Paxton and Brendon Burns of WHO
and the undersigned. Tichborn (P) related the contacts he
had made, their impressions of the local political scene, his
own assessment of the situation, personal comments on the
economy and government obtained from "slumming" among the
local lower classes, etc. Tichborn (P) also pointed out areas
in which we could make a positive contribution and gave a
umber of over-all recommendations concerning the political
and economic fields.
2. The WHD representatives were very favorably impressed
with Tichborn (P) personally and with his activities while in
El Salvador on the related TDY mission.
3. The American Ambassador to El Salvador had met Tichborn (P)
while there and was sufficiently impressed with him that he sent
a telegram to Mr. Thomas Mann of the Department suggesting that the

TO
Mr. Cale Ailen
DATE: 8 November 1966
FROM
Chief, DO Division
SUBJECT: – Information about Spain (and Portugal)
I have a request which seems to me to be right up the alley
of your friend, WUBRINY/1. I would hope, therefore, that he will try
to do us a fairly rapid and yet analytic job.
2. The request is for as accurate information as possible on
the following questions:
a. What or who, or both, represent the most significant
power elements in the economic or commercial field in Spain
today? Wherever possible, even in the cases where potent
companies have been named, specific individuals having the
positions of authority should be identified. In addition, where-
ever possible, relationships between these individuals and
American interests whether a company or another individual
should be specified.
14
b. What American interests, corporate or personal, have
major investments or holdings in Spain? What are the nature
of their investments or holdings and who are the individuals
basically responsible?
c. To the extent possible, provide the san:e answers as
requested above for Portugal. Since Spain is of greater inter-
est, this question should only be answered to the extent possible
without too great an expenditure of time. If on the other hand it
is felt that good answers can be provided with regard to Portugal
given extra time, I would suggest that the Spanish answers bu
submitted as soon as possible and the Portuguese information
given at a later data.
3. I would appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as pos-
sible WUBRINY/I's reaction to the above requests can he get the answers;
will they be in considerable detail and how long does he think that it will take?

him I would meet him there and bring some "friends" along.
(On this subject, Mr. Holman said he felt Mr. Herbert, DC/WHD,
might want to attend the debriefing.)

he will also sign the amendment to his contact and the out-
standing financial matters will be taken care of.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: ÍDY Assignment of Edward G. Tichborn (P) to El Salvador
A. Memorandum for the Record, 18 January 1961
REFERENCES: A.
B. Memorandum for the Record, 23 January 1961
1. In early January we had suggested to WH/Salvador that
they might find the services of a political consultant of value
in their area. The Division checked this out with the Station
who agreed that it was an idea worth looking into and asked for
additional details. This information was forwarded to the field
and in reply, the Station requested that we send the individual
concerned to El Salvador to assess the political situation and
to give them any related assistance possible.
2. As a consequence, Mr. Davis contacted Edward 0. Tichborn (P)
by telephone and told him of our interest. Due to the Station's
request which we wanted to fill promptly, and also to Tichborn's (P)
personal schedule (and the
and the possibility that he might receive an
appointment within the Administration in the near future) we
wanted to get him to Salvador as soon as possible. After con-
sultation with Tichborn (P) and with the Desk, it was decided that
he would leave California on 23 February and arrive in Salvador
the following morning.
3. In his telephone conversation, Mr. Davis vas forced to
rely on the system of "double talking" for the purpose of security;
however, the possibility that his services might be required had

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Plans for Debriefing of Edward G. Tichborn (P)
in Washington
1. On 6 March Edward G. Tichborn (P) telephoned C/PAG to
inform him that he had returned from his TDY assignment to El
Salvador. He felt that his trip has been a successful one and
that he would have a meaty report to submit He also suggested
that he felt it would be useful if he were debriefed by the
interested parties at Headquarters
2.
C/PAG and I agreed that this would be the most useful
manner for obtaining all of the details of his activities while
in El Salvador, as well as providing an opportunity for WH
officers to pose any questions they might have. Consequently
I contacted Messrs. Holman and Marshall of WHD and suggested
that Tichborn (P) came to Washington on Sunday, 12 March and
be debriefed on 13 and 14 March. They agreed this would be
an excellent idea.
3 Mr. Marshall vanted to check on the financial aspect
of Tichborn's (P) trip East.
(P) trip East. He asked if he would receive an
additional salary for that time period. I suggested (as C/PAG
had discussed with me) that we would recommend to Tichbora (P)
that the
debriefing be included in the salary he was informed
he would receive for this assignment (This figure would be
$500 per week, or $1,000 for two weeks.) Expenses covering this
projected trip to Washington would, however, be separate. I
also mentioned to Mr. Holman that this would be suggested to
Tichborn and that I felt be would be amenable since this would
bring the total time he was on assignment for WH to two weeks.
Mr. Holman agreed that I should call Tichborn (P) and ask him

6. WH had also told us that they might have to inform
the Department of Tichborn's (P) trip to El Salvador and
then decided that this would not be necessary. However, on
23 February, a final decision was made that this would have
to be done essa since C/WH works so closely with State. PAG
did agree to this but requested that this information be in
general terms only and that Tichborn's (P) name not be given.
WH agreed that it could be done in this way. WI also stated
that this information wi
be passed to Mr. Devine and would
be limited to him and Mr. Mann.
7. Tichborn's (P) instructions were that he would be
met at the airport if possible by JUEGGPLANT (whose true
name and description vere provided); if he did not appear
Tichborn (P) was to go to the Intercontinental Hotel and
wait there to be contacted by either JUEGGPLANT (Jerry
Caughlin) or the COS, Ben Stotts. Upon meeting Tichborn (P)
JUEGGPLANT, as a recognition signal, would say "I am a friend

:
8 Tichborn (P) asked if some expense money could be
provided him in El Salvador and he was assured that this
would be arranged. Since time (and the airlines strike)
did not permit his coming to Washington for a detailed brief-
ing on the political situation in Salvador and on his specific
mission, these matters plus the funds for expenses will be
handled by the Station.
-
9. Two cables were sent to the field
the field concerning the
subject of Tichborn's (P) arrival in El Salvador (DIR 26346,
OUT 76088 and DIR 26522, OUT 76527). These cables spelled out
Tichborn's (P) cover, the need for special discretion on the
part of those individuals who are witting of his relationship
with KUBARK, the meeting or contact arrangements, the fact that
detailed briefings by the Station would be necessary since it
had not been possible to undertake this at Headquarters his.

certain funds.
10. In summary, PAG's interest was to arrange for Tichborn's (P)
arrival in Salvador as soon as possible and at the same time to

already been mentioned to Tichborn (P) when he was in Washington
on personal matters in January (see Ref. B) Mr. Davis also
attempted to "second guess" Tichborn's (P) feelings on this
assignment when arranging the details with WHD. The fact that
he might receive an appointment was the major factor under
consideration, especially in the sense that first, we did not
want to expose Tichborn (P) as a KUBARK agent and secondly,
we did not want in any way to present Tichborn (P) with any
problems in relation to his possible appointment.
...
Mr. Davis told Tichborn (P) in guarded language which
was apparently well understood by him that the COS ("our senior
partner") and the Ambassador ("the senior partner of our cousin
firm) would be witting as to his KUBARK connections and that
undoubtedly JUEGGPLANT (an American cut-out and contact of the
Station) and the latter's brother-in-law JUVAN-1 (a Salvadoran
businessman and Station contact with whom he would be working)
would also be witting. However, as agreed with WH, the locals
other than JUVAN-1 would be unwitting as to his KUBARK connections
Tichborn (P) was informed that he would be "visiting" Salvador
and his "old friend" JUEGGPLANT and this cover story was to
be cited to the local Salvadorans.

arose at the Station's request. Mr. Davis added that of course
we would not want the Ambassador to take umbrage, etc. at
Tichborn's (P) visit or activities and that we had been assured
by someone (Paul Paxton) who knows Ambassador Murat Williams
that the latter could be counted upon for his cooperation and
discretion. Tichborn (P) then asked specifically whether he
would definitely talk with the Ambassador and Mr. Davis informed
him that this would depend upon the Station a judgment. (WH
had informed us that this was a possibility since Williams is
new to his post and the Station is trying to work closely with
him
from the beginning; WH felt that if Williams later learned
that Tichborn (P) had been in the area without his knowledge,
he might take offense.) In this event, the Station was advised
to
to request the Ambassador to use our channels for any communications
to the Department concerning Tichborn (P).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P) - Hernia
9 February 1960
1 On 1 February Edward G. Tichborn advised me that in lifting
his bag out of a taxi on his return trip from Cuba, he suddenly felt.
a pain in the groin and was afraid that he had a hernia.
2. On the way to the airport he asked me if there would be any
chance of the Government picking up his medical expenses in the event
that he actually had a hernia which required any substantial treatment.
I told him at that time that I did not know what the Government's
position would be, but that I would check into the matter and let him
know.
3. On 2 February, I contacted Mr. Vernon Turner, SSA/DDS, and
explained the circumstances to him. At that time, I also pointed out
that as far as the provisions of his contract were concerned, it was
stated that he was not an employee of the U. S. Government and while
it did not make specific reference to medical payments while he was
working for us, it did not specifically preclude such payments.
Mr. Turner opined that although the contract stated he was not an
employee of the U. S. Government, in actual fact during the period he
was doing our bidding, he was. I went on further to expl
Turner that in all probability we will call on Tichborn
future services for us and that while he was being paid, it was doubt-
ful that this reimbursement from us equaled what he would make in
his regular law practice. Mr. Turner stated that there were a number
of ways that we could alleviate his situation should it become
necessary.

25 September 1959
1. On the morning of 14 September I called Tichborn and arranged
to meet him at his office at 1230. As an attachment to this memo
I have outlined the standard approach which was followed in Tichborn's
instance; therefore, I will not go further into it.
2. Tichborn struck me as being extremely quick, intelligent, very

Mexican descent, speaks Mexican/Spanish fluently and according to him
can easily pass as a Mexican. Tichborn has spent considerable time
over the years in Mexico as well as attending the University of
Mexico for a year or two. He has also traveled to Cuba and is a
- friend of John Manson, head of Screen Gem, Inc. which is the Columbia.
Pictures outlet for Mexico. Mr. Manson is personally known to me and
might, at sometime, be of use to us. I shall not delve into Tichborn's
political history as that will be outlined in his PRQ, Part I when
it arrives. He is presently being urged to run for Congress from
the Los Angeles district; however, he has not as yet made up his
mind what he will do.

3. In the period of three hours that I was with Tichborn,
was extremely impressed by him and feel sure that he would do an
excellent job of briefing any individuals that we might desire him
to brief. I am also sure that if he was sent out on a TDY he would
acquit himself in superior fashion Tichborn is called upon from
time to time to give advice on the handling of Mexican/American
problems and show the great appreciation of the difficulties of
dealing with Latin Americans, their great sense of political morality,
their inferiority complex and of their unfounds but nevertheless anti-
gringo feelings. Tichborn was particularly interested in the situation
in Cuba and asked my opinion of it. My comment in essence was that

Utilization of Harpers for Nominal Cover
This memorandum contains a recommendation for your
approval in paragraph six.
2 Santo Domingo Station has requested that Edward G.
TICHBORN, an American Contract Agent of Mexican extraction
who is presently assigned to Mexico Station, be temporarily
assigned to the Dominican Republic to assist Santo Domingo
in the period immediately preceding the 1 June presidential
election. Mexico Station and TICHBORN have agreed to this
assignment and it is proposed that TICHBORN go to Santo
Domingo in the immediate future to read in on the operations
and then return to Santo Domingo on approximately 1 May to
carry out whatever operational duties Santo Domingo Station
may assign him. It is presumed that he would return to
Mexico City shortly after 1 June 1966.
;
3. TICHBORN, 46, is bilingual and has a wide range of
business and social contacts throughout Latin America.
Following graduation from Harvard Law School in 1948, TICHBORN
became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angeles which repre-
sented many Latin American
business connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in
California state politics and served in various capacities in
Democratic Party state and national organizations.
He par-
ticipated actively in the California gubernatorial campaign
of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan.
Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson campaigns for
President. He has been President of the Southern California
Young Democrats, a member of the California Democratic State
Central Committee, a member of the Host Committee for the
1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the Board
of Directors of the National Democratic Minority Conference.
In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordinator of the Kennedy
Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction which, it is
reported, contributed substantially to the success of the
Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try for
elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his bid
for the position of California Secretary of State.

Proposed
Cover
:
Investigation of suitable cover for utilization of Lopez
as a political action agent was successful in that
DODS indicated an interest in Lopez' background (Economics
and Law) as a possible Latin American specialist for
the International Capital Corporation (ICAP). ICAP is
an Agency proprietary corporation, which was established
by John P. C. Train, a contract employee of the Agency,
who owns and manages the Park Avenue firm of Train,
Cabot & Associates, a bona fide investment management
firm which has the ICAP as one of its subsidiary
companies.
.
ICAP does not presently have any contracts
in Latin America but has concentrated its activities
in Africa and the Far East. Train desires to expand

In late 1959, TICHBORN was hired by the Agency as
a political
tion advisor for Agency-sponsored election.
operations throughout Latin America In 1961 he became a
full-time contract agent and was assigned to Mexico City
under personal cover, to establish a degree of security
and mobility which would permit him to travel readily on
third country political action assignments. Since the
beginning of his relationship with the Agency, he has par-
ticipated in Agency sponsored operations in Cuba, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and,
most recently, in the 1964 election in Chile. At present
he is engaged full-time in managing a Mexico Station funded
left wing intellectual publication, Dialogos His cover in
Mexico now is nominal and he attributes his presence and
interests primarily to his activities in the legal field
for his former Los Angeles law firm employer. He devotes
most of his time to his position as editor of Dialogos.
5. TICHBORN has contributed stories articles and
interviews to United States and Latin American publications
His major accomplishment in this field has been the publi-
cation of an interview with Catherine Anne Porter in a
recent issue of Harpers magazine. TICHBORN suggests that
he might be able to arrange viable cover for his temporary
assignment in the Dominican Republic
Dominican Republic by writing to Harpers
and querying their interest in his preparation of an article
concerning the Dominican Republic political situation and
the forthcoming election. There is no reason to believe that
Harpers would turn down such a proposal and, in fact, it is
believed they would welcome it.
6. Recommendation The Western Hemisphere Division
recommends that approval be given for TICHBORN's approach
to Harpers to advise them of his planned trip to the Dominican
Republic and request of the magazine an expression of interest
in an article on the present situation in the Dominican
Republic. This will be done specifically as a cover for his
travel to Santo Domingo. In the event Harpers should commis-
sion him to do such an article, TICHBORN will present his
manuscript for Agency approval prior to forwarding it to

the operations of ICAP into Latin America and was
looking about for a Latin American specialist at just
the time that WH Division offered Lopez It appears
to be a fortuitous meetin
of the minds, i.e., Lopez
apparently has many of the attributes and some of the
background necessary for the position and Train needs
a man He will be trained by Train and presumably
will devote a good deal of his time to ICAP activities.
However, he will be made available on short notice
for any assignment the Agency may have for him.
2.
What is extent of the possible utilization of
Lopez over the period of the next year and in the
future? (I HAVR Some Maue work is ens)
Based upon the above, what would be an equitable
contract arrangement, 1.e., how much money is Lopez
worth to WH Division when most of his time will
be spent working for ICAP and DODS? DODS in
dicates that after he begins to make a contribu-
tion to ICAP (Probably six months to a year) they
would be willing to pick up a portion of the con-
tract costs but they see no justification for such
an action at present
