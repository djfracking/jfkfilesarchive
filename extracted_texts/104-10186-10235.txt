An untested source gave a representative of this Agency a copy of
a list of regulations issued on 15 May 1960 by the National
Revolutionary Police, which came under the Ministry of the Revolu-
tionary Armed Forces of Cuba, for the discipline of members of
the Servicio Secreto Revolucionario (Cuban Revolutionary Secret
Service - SSR). This document was signed by Fernando FUENTE Coba,
Chief of the Confidential Section of the General Command of the
National Revolutionary Police.
3. In a report dated 19 May 1962, an untested source, who was a guide
and interpreter for the ICAP, a Cuban government agency which
handled the needs of foreign visitors to Cuba, said that First
Lieutenant Fernando COBAS was chief of the DTI until sometime in
1960 when he started working for the Tourist Police, a part of
the PNR. In January or February 1961, COBAS transferred to the
Transit Police.

In a report dated 20 September 1962, an untested source reported
that Fernando FUENTES Covas was with the Policia Transita (Transit
Police) in the DTI.
Another office of this Agency, in a report dated 26 December 1962,
reported that Fernando FUENTES Coba, a Cuban national, had been
convicted in 1957 of violation of the United States immigration
laws. FUENTES was engaged in forging birth certificates to assist
Cuban nationals to enter the United States as Puerto Ricans.
FUENTES moved to Miami, where he became an ardent Castrista. In
July 1959, he served as a provocateur in luring an American flyer,
Rafael del PINO, to Cuba, ostensibly to smuggle someone out of
Cuba. Because of his success in luring del PINO back to Cuba,
where he was badly wanted by the Castro regime, FUENTES received
an important position in the Confidential Bureau of the Cuban
G-2, and for a time served as chief of the Bureau.
On 29 January 1963, a source whose reliability cannot be determined,
reported that he had seen Fernando FUENTES Coba, described as a
Castro agent, debark from the SS Shirley Lykes on 25 January 1963,
at Port Everglades.
An

Fernando FUENTES Coba was born on 21 June 1928, in Habana, Cuba.
FUENTES was a former permanent resident of the United States from
1946 to 1949, and served in the United States Army. At the time of
this report FUENTES was described as a photographer with the
Tourist Commission in Habana. Source, in a report dated October
1963, reported that FUENTES was settled in Halifax, Canada, and
had obtained temporary employment.
