CCS has a standing position on non-release of citations
24.32
and awards to persons retired under cover (Bagley is retired in
Bolgium under State cèver
cover)) so he would have to make a decision on
that before he could have the material. He could not be given some
of his personnel records, as they are clsssified, although he could be
shown them as in a Privacy Act request; he is not now cleared for
access to classified material, although his attorney is. CI Staff
considers the materials not cited in the Hart testimony as inclassified;
those portions authorized for use are unclassified only to the extent
used by Hart; the exception is the entire handwritten list of options,
which has been provided the Committee at its request, and he can see that
when he appears before the Committee.
4. I tried to contact the DDA and DDO, reaching John McMahon.
He agrees with this preliminary position. Mike Malanik phoned me back, today,
indicating that when the cover aspect is straightened out Bagley should
ww
be treated as anyone else. Dick Rininger of OGC, meanwhile, had advised
Mr. Chabot, Bagley's attorney, that the cover consideration has to be
resolved first. Bagley was there and Rininger also spoke to him, with
Bagley indicating his intention to have his cover removed.
