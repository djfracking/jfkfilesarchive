1. AMBASSADOR BRIEFED COS AFTERNOON 16 OCT ON HIS HOUR AND
ONE-HALF SESSION WITH MR. AARON ON 15 OCT. DISCUSSION COVERED
THREE MAIN TOPICS: (A) RISKS AND NEED FOR "FANCY POLITICAL
SOURCES" IN BONN; (B) COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS; AND (C) DEGREE
TO WHICH AMBASSADOR COGNIZANT OF STATION ACTIVITIES.
R 2.
ON POINT GĦA. AMBASSADOR STATED THAT MOST STATION
POLITICAL SOURCES WERE OF LONG-STANDING AND COMMENCED IN THE
EARLY POST WAR/OCCUPATION ERA. THEY WERE BASED ON PERSONAL
FRIENDSHIPS AND UNIQUE CHARACTER OF THE EARLY POSTWAR YEARS
AND WERE IN HIS BELIEF LIKELY TO PROVE IRREPLACEABLE..
THAT IS, AMBASSADOR OPINED THAT SIMILAR CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS
COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED BY STATION IN TODAY'S POLITICAL
CLIMATE AND IMPLIED THAT HE EXPECTED COVERAGE TO GRADUALLY
WITHER AWAY. BECAUSE OF THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE RELATION-
SHIPS, AMBASSADOR BELIEVED RISK WAS VERY LOW AND STATED THAT.

BASIS. WE EXPLAINED THAT MONIES IN THIS PROJECT ALMOST EX-

PURPOSES. THIS SEEMED TO SATISFY AARON.

5. HE ASKED NUMBER QUESTIONS ABOUT "FANCY" POLITICAL SOURCES,
ALONG: LINE THAT THESE COULD PERHAPS BE HANDLED AS NORMAL
DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS AND ASKED WHETHER THESE CONTACTS DID NOT
REPRESENT HIGH RISK IF EXPOSED. STIGGINS EXPLAIND AT SOME LENGTH
THAT THESE SOURCES VERY FEW IN NUMBER, AND WERE PRODUCT OF SEVERAL
FACTORS, INCLUDING MANY YEARS CONTACT WITH SPECIFIC CIA
OFFICERS, MAKING POINT THAT AGENTS CONFIDENCE IN CIA BASED ON
MANY YEARS ASSOCIATION. WE ESTIMATED FLAP POTENTIAL SLIGHT
THESE LONG-STANDING CONTACTS, WHICH COULD BE EXPLAINED AS OLD
FRIENDSHIPS FOR REASON THAT THEY WERE, IN FACT SUCH, THESE
RELATIONSHIPS COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED TO STATE DEPARTMENT
OFFICERS. WE MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THE LOWER LEVEL DEVELOPMENTAL
OPERATIONS ACTUALLY REPRESENTED HIGHER RISK AND CITED GENERAL
OUTLINE OF "HILTON AFFAIR" (WITHOUT NAMES AS EXAMPLE HOW
DEVELOPMENTAL CASE COULD BE TROUBLESOME. EMPHASIZED THERE HAD
'BEEN FEW OF THESE OVER YEARS...
6. AARON ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDREP REACTION IN-
EVENT OUR INCOMPATIBLE SOURCES EXPOSED, WE RESPONDED THAT IN
GENERAL GERMANS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN EMBARRASSING US AND THAT THIS
KEY ELEMENT, PLUS: FACTOR THAT WE HANDLED ALL INCOMPATIBLE ACTIVITY
VERY CAREFULLY, LED US TO CONCLUSION THAT WE WERE NOT RUNNING
RISK MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT BY CONDUCTING LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE

ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE COVERAGE THOSE AREAS IN EAST-WEST RELATIONS

COS REPLIED THAT IF ALL THE AMBASSADORS WERE AS ABLE AND AS

1. COS HAD TWO-HOUR SESSION WITH TRUEHART AND AARON LATE-
MORNING 24 SEPTEMBER, GENERAL IMPRESSION IS THAT BOTH WERE
BUSINESS-LIKE; QUESTIONS WERE INCISIVE AND DESIGNED TO ASCERTAIN
HOW A STATION FUNCTIONS IN AN EMBASSY, PARTICULARLY VIS-A-VIS
THE AMBASSADOR, RATHER THAN HOW MONTEVIDEO STATION IS FUNCTIONING
IN URUGUAY. HENCE MANY QUESTIONS WERE HIGHLY HYPOTHETICAL, MOST
IMPORTANT IMPRESSION WAS THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR TRUEHART (WHOM
COS HAD MET IN NIGERIA YEARS AGO) FEELS THAT AN AMBASSADOR
SHOULD BE FAR MORE. KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT ALL REPEAT ALL STATION
OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO JUDGE POSSIBLE "FLAP POTENTIAL".
2. COS DID NOT SHOW OD TO VISITORS SINCE THEY DID NOT ASK
TO READ IT BUT INSTEAD READ PORTIONS OF IT TO THEM AND DISCUSSED
IT WITH THEM..
3. THEY ASKED INITIALLY WHAT THE AMBASSADORS INJUNCTIONS
WERE WITH RESPECT TO PROHIBITED OPERATIONS. COS SAID

HIS OVERT CONTACT BUT, DEPENDING UPON RELATIONS, MIGHT ALSO
DISCUSS THE MATTER FRANKLY WITH POLITICAL OFFICER. WHAT ABOUT
DEFENSE ATTACHE? ANSWER: THE SAME,
5.
THIS LED TO DISCUSSION OF INTER-AGENCY SOURCE REGISTER.
HAVING JUST FINISHED WITH DEFENSE ATTACHE, AMBASSADOR TRUEHART
SAID DEFATT INDICATED HE HAD MANY SOURCES REGISTERED AND
THEREFORE WE WERE PROSCRIBED FROM RECUITING THEM. COS POINTED
OUT SOURCE REGISTER IS FOR COVERT AGENTS ONLY AND SINCE DEFATT
HERE IS PROCSCRIBED FROM RUNNING COVERT AGENTS, NONE OF HIS
SOURCES ARE IN INTER-AGENCY SURCE REGISTER. COS ADDED THAT
MANY DEFENSE ATTACHES MISCONSTRUE THEIR REGISTERING OF THEIR
AGENTS IN PENTAGON SERIES AS SYNONOMOUS WITH REGISTRATION IN
THE INTER-AGENCY SOURCE REGISTER.
6. TRUEHART ASKED IF WE EXERTED "REAL CONTROL" OVER DEA'S
OPERATIONS AS REQUIRED BY DCID. COS SAID THAT ON THE CONTRARY
WE EXERTED NO CONTROL OVER DEA NOR ARE WE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO
TRY TO DO SO, WE DO COORDINATE CLOSELY, REGISTER THEIR SOURCES,
PROVIDE TRACES AND ASSITANCE, ENCOURAGE LIAISON TO COOPERATE FULLY
WITH THEM, ETC. IN ADDITION, WHEN A DEA OPERATIN IS

AMBASSADOR DOES NOT WANT COVERT OPERATIONS OF A POLICTICAL NATURE
IN URUGUAY WITHOUT HIS PRIOR APPROVAL NOR DOES HE WANT US TO .
MOUNT "ELECTRONIC" OPERATIONS. WITHOUT APPROVAL. COS OPINED THIS
LATTER INJUNCTION MEANT UNILATERAL EFFORTS, AARON ASKED IF WE
HAD ON-GOING PRESS PLACEMENT MEDIA OPERATIONS. COS SAID WE
DID HAVE SOME BUT THESE WERE OF ROUTINE NATURE. AARON PURSUED
MATTER, ASKED IF AMBASSADOR WAS FULL Y AWARE OF THIS TO WHICH
COS RESPONDED THAT HE PRESUMED SO. COS ADDED HE HAD NOT
SPECIFICALLY COVERED THIS POINT WITH THE AMBASSADOR SINCE
COS ARRIVAL HERE LESS THAN ONE MONTH AGO.
4' BOTH AARON AND TRUEHART QUESTIONED AT LENGTH WHAT KIND
OF THINGS WE' COORDINATE WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND IN WHAT DEPTH
PRIOR TO INITIATION OF AN OPERATION. WHAT KIND OF AGENTS
WOULD WE IDENTIFY BY NAME TO THE AMBASSADOR? COS SAID HE
WOULD BE INCLINED TO REVEAL TO THE AMBASSADOR THE NAME OF
ANY SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WITH WHOM THE AMBASSADOR WAS
DEALING OFFICIALLY AND INTIMATELY, BUT THIS WOULD IN LARGE
PART DEPEND ON THE AMBASSADORS WISHES HIMSELF. WOULD WE
INFORM THE POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF OF THE IDENTITY OF ONE OF
OUR AGENTS WHOM THE POLITICAL OFFICER WAS TRYING TO DEVELOP?

THEN AARON ASKED IF IT WAS TRUE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME
WE DID NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY THROUGH COVERT AGENTS OF
INFLUENCE TO COUNTER SOVIET INITIATIVE WHICH PRESUMABLY
COULD THREATEN PRIORITY U.S. INTERESTS IN URUGUAY. ANSWER:
TRUE AT THE PRESENT TIME; WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO RURN TO
OTHER AGENTS POSSIBLY INCLUDING LIAISON SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY
IN THE NEAR FUTURE, PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION OF AGENTS OF
INFLUENCE, AARON ASKED WHY THAT PARAGRAPH IN OD SPOKE OF
MAINTAINING THE CAPABILITY TO COUNTER SOVIET INITIATIVES THAT
THREATEN THE STABILITY OF URUGUAY SINCE THERE IS LITTLE U.S.
COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN URUGUAY. WE ANSEWEREED THAT URUGUAY IS

THE STATION HAD TO BE ABANDONED), WHETHER CUTOUTS WERE USED IN

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and
Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad
There have been already and there will continue to be members
of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and
talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential
that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security
problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.
in."
I.
MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE
:
ABROAD. FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
INSTALLATIONS.
Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,
for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low
profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection
from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities
behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.
Thẹ mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence
of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those
countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and
other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,
care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions
6/25/75

13-00000

III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE
CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.
It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
I details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms--operational priorities,
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical
surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.
Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between
the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered
by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and
operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of the
host government.
IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT
PERSONNEL.
•
Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service
scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be
to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage would be
done to agent morale and motivation if their identity were to be .
*
revealed to Members or staff of the SSC..

--- Image 104-10400-10311_page_167.jpeg ---
13-00000
II.

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the
United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public:
exposure of such relationships. To help maintain the discreet
nature of the visit, it would be preferable if some reason other
than SSC business could be given to explain any visits by SSC members
and staff. No deliberate contact should be made with the local press,
nor should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating
officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity pertaining
to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all cases be
distasteful to the host government.
In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence
activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
-
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business
at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding
on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.
THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE
VISIT.
All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his
knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding.

--- Image 104-10400-10311_page_169.jpeg ---
13-00000
V.
:
4
MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES
WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.
Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the SSC:
politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard that
their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the
information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most
sensitive matters. Regardless what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters
with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause the host service to
reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence
activities.
--
VI. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN
TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.
In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection
sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.
Congressional representatives, especially where there is public
knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests. If such
a visit is considered essential, a special request must be
negotiated with the host country in advance.

VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND
STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.
This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives
of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as
appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the
visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location,
the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case
and the considerations which preclude the discussion of
operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.
Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that
they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition
intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff
members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly
travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

This letter is to confirm an oral request by Committee staff
for an orientation briefing for a visit to South America which two
members of the staff, David Aaron and William Trueheart, have been
asked to make next month.
Although plans are not yet firm, it is expected that they will
be free to travel during the second and third weeks of September.
It is proposed that they visit Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, and
Montevideo. If time permits, they might also visit another con-
sular post in Brazil and/or Buenos Aires.
The primary purpose of this travel is to discuss State-CIA
relations in the field with Embassy and Station officers.
propriate, past Agency programs may also be reviewed.
As ap-.
Messrs. Aaron and Trueheart are not expected to consult with
officials of the host government and, so far as the Committee is
concerned, the latter need not be informed of the visit.
Sincerely yours,
Bill

1. Pursuant to your request, forwarded as attachment A is a paper
providing examples of covert action operations targeted at right-wing
governments, which is responsive to a question from the Senate Select
Committee.
2. All of the cases in the attached summary are considered sensitive
by the area divisions and some are considered extremely sensitive up to

impact more severely on our foreign policy interest than the other dis-
closures on our foreign involvements. For example, a disclosure of our
past operations in Spain could possibly adversely affect the military
base negotiations now underway. With this problem in mind, we have
broken the operations into two categories: Category I are those oper-
ations about which full committee could be briefed, if necessary, and
Category II are those operations considered extremely sensitive about
which the committee Chairman and Co-Chairman might be briefed, if abso-
lutely necessary.

3. In addition to the attachment A summary, we also approve the use
(with the full committee) of the case summary on our operations to assist
the survival of the Betancourt government in Venezuela, which was pro-
vided to you directly by LA Division.
4. Obviously, we would prefer to forego providing this information
to the committee. However, should it be necessary to do so, we would
appreciate being advised promptly regarding the time and circumstances
of any use of this material outside of the Agency.

SENSITIVE
Covert Action Operations Concerning Right-Wing Regimes
CATEGORY I
1. ETHIOPIA: A project for covert support of the Ethiopian labor
movement was first approved for FY 1965. The purpose of the support
was to encourage the development of the labor movement as a democratic
force and as one of the few mass representative organizations in Ethiopia.
The project was terminated at the end of FY 1973. The total approved
budget for this project from its inception in CY 1964 to its termination
in CY 1973 was $291,006. Covert support to the Ethiopian labor movement
was approved by the Special Group on 22 August 1967, on 25 March 1970,
on 26 May 1971, and on 8 May 1972.
2. SOUTH VIETNAM: From 1955 to 1975, a series of projects was
begun designed to build up grass social institutions as a means of
strengthening the democratic foundations of the country. One of the
most long-lasting of these was aimed at supporting the soundly demo-
cratic labor movement through the provision of guidance and funds to
facilitate its growth among the workers and rural village peasants and
tenant farmers.
3. GUATEMALA: In 1972-73, the Guatemala City Station with access
to the government succeeded in dissuading the President from military
action against Belize.
4. HAITI: As early as 1963, the Special Group discussed ways and
means of influencing the Duvalier dictatorship. In 1967, a modest pro-
ject was approved for the support of Haitian exile radio broadcasts for
the purpose of offsetting "the inflammatory propaganda broadcasts to
Haiti from Radio Habana."
5. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: In 1963, CIA was directly involved in the
successful efforts to prevent the return to the Dominican Republic of
General Elias Wessin y Wessin and forestall his leadership of a right-
wing coup designed to prevent the holding of free elections.
6. GERMANY: From 1948 to 1960, CIA exploited an asset in a neo-
Nazi political movement both as a source of intelligence concerning its
plans and actions and as a means of covertly sabotaging the movement
and its European counterparts.

7. NICARAGUA: During the period 1962 to 1966, CIA participated
in efforts to interdict moves by General Somoza to purchase arms for
military actions against his neighbors.
8. SPAIN: In 1963, the Special Group approved a program to train
15-20 Spanish democratic labor leaders a year outside of Spain to build
an effective cadre of Spanish labor leadership. In 1966, the Special
Group approved a modest program designed to strengthen the Christian
Democratic movement in Spain through supportive efforts with youth,
political and labor elements.

CATEGORY II
1. SOUTH AFRICA: In 1959, after consultation with the Special
Group, the DCI approved an overall expenditure of $165,000 to a leading
South African political figure designed to encourage the creation of a
new political party. This party was established in 1960. The objective
was to influence the liberalization of the South African Government by
having a legally constituted party in opposition to apartheid. The
activity was terminated in 1962.
2. SOUTH AFRICA: A project was initiated in 1962 to encourage
the development of a multiracial trade union organization which opposed
apartheid. It was funded through a European philanthropic organization.
State Department approval was received in June 1963. A total of $311,705
was spent on this activity. The project was terminated in 1968.
3. KOREA: In 1963, the Special Group approved a covert action
project designed to encourage "emerging civilian government" vis-a-vis
the military leadership following President Rhee's resignation and in
anticipation of forthcoming elections; it proposed to support a group
of National Assembly members.
4. KOREA: The Special Group approved in 1967 a project designed
to support a private, rural self-help organization to encourage more
participation by rural farmers in local and national politics to increase
their influence on the Government of the Republic of Korea; it involved
the creation of agricultural training centers in rural villages, a news-
letter and student rural services. It was terminated in 1970 as a project,
but the movement has been continued under the auspices of the government.
5. ARGENTINA: Between 1950 and 1955, efforts of the CIA were
directed at countering Peron's program to obtain wide support in Latin
America for his Movement of Latin American Trade Unionists (ATLAS) which
was designed as one element of his campaign to expand his influence in
the area. Partially as the result of CIA's efforts, the movement never
caught on and it was abandoned with Peron's ouster from power.
6. BRAZIL: From the early 1960's through the ouster of Goulart
and the assumption of power by the conservative Brazilian military, to
1972, CIA supported a rural cooperative movement in the impoverished
Northeast. This support was provided in spite of strong opposition to
the movement first by the Goulart government and then by Brazilian
military authorities in that area and in spite of the effect particularly
after 1974 on liaison and diplomatic relations if this support by the USG
were discovered. The project was terminated in 1972.

Covert Action Operations Against Right
Wing Regimes
1.
Attached are revisions of the descriptions of the
three covert action operations in Africa, cited in your
memorandum to Mr. John Waller dated 18 July 1975.
2. In the case of Ethiopia, we understand from your
discussions with Mr. Clifton Strathern that the labor project
has not been eliminated from your list but that the Director
will request that discussion of it be limited to the Chairman
and Vice-Chairman only of the Senate Select Committee. The
Director should be informed of the potentially embarrassing
procedural errors in the presentation and review of this
project before the 303 Committee, and the risks of exposure
to two former assets who have been jailed by the new Ethiopian
regime.
3. The Ethiopian labor program was undertaken
without 303 Committee knowledge or approval. Subsequently,
the project was presented to the 303 Committee on 22 August
1967 and Mr. Walt Rostow, then Chairman of the Security Council,
asked why it had not been brought before the Committee before.
He was told that for projects costing $20,000 or less, it had
been the DCI's discretion to determine if a given project was
sufficiently politically sensitive to warrant bringing it
before the committee. Mr. Rostow directed that the 303
Committee should examine all political action projects.
Nevertheless, the project was not submitted to the Committee
for review in 1968, 1969 or 1973.
4. In addition to these procedural errors, the arrest
in 1974 and continued detention of two Ethiopian labor leaders
who are former assets under this project, and accusations in

SUBJECT:
Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad
i
There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:
Members of the SSC and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroad for
purposes of investigating CIA installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by.
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence.
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John Waller
SUBJECT
REFERENCE
Special Assistant to the DDO
: Covert Action Operations Against
Right Wing Governments
: Chief, SS/CAG Memorandum, dated
18 July 1975.
Subject: "Summary of Covert Action
Operations Against Right Wing Governments"
--
1. EA Division is concerned about Reference and its possible
use in briefing the Senate Select Committee. Specifically, our concern
centers on describing the EA operations contained in the attachment to
Reference as "were mounted against" "right wing governments"..
None of the EA operations DNSCOOP, DNSPROUT (both of which
took place in Korea) and TUMIX (which took place in Vietnam) --
were or should be so described as being mounted against the government
then in power. In fact, just the opposite is true. All of these
operations, while covert in the sense that the U.S. Government hand
was never disclosed, were primarily designed to broaden the base of
the governments in power and enhance its stayability by providing
advice and support to "grass root elements" in an attempt to get these
elements to function as a more cohesive organization in seeking
participation in the governmental process.
2. While all of the operations have been terminated, the
DNSCOOP operation is perhaps the most sensitive of the three, in that
it represented an initial effort by the Agency to establish contact with
opposition elements in South Korea. As noted above, the purpose of
this contact was not to overthrow the ruling government but rather to
assist the opposition in establishing itself as a more viable force in its
effort to establish a two-party system in South Korea. The Agency today

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.
Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be
opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

.:
the Ethiopian press that the trade union organization received
support from the U.S. Government, make any disclosure of CIA
interest in the labor organization potentially dangerous to
our former assets. Neither of the former assets was arrested
because of his CIA connections, and neither of the two assets
nor the labor organization have been accused of CIA involvement.
An admission now of CIA support to Ethiopian labor or to the
two Ethiopian labor leaders in jail could be a sentence of
death for them.
5. In the case of South Africa, CIA support to a leading
South African political figure to encourage the creation of a
new political party remains a very sensitive matter. The
principal agent is still a leading and respected spokesman
for the opposition party in South Africa and is a leading member
of the South African parliament. Exposure of the operation
could lead to his identification which would be extremely
damaging to him, to the opposition party and to our govern-
ment's relations in South Africa. For these reasons, we believe i
it would be desirable for the DCI to limit discussion of this
operation to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Select.
Committee only.
6. The European philanthropic organization which was used
to fund the development of a multiracial trade union organiza-
tion in South Africa was the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES),
located in Germany. The South African labor officials and
organizations which received funds from FES were not aware
that the actual origin of the funds was the United States
Government and presumably do not now know of U.S. Government
or CIA involvement. Aside from exposing a U.S. Government
involvement where none is known to have existed, FES was used
to support a number of other covert action operations in Africa
and elsewhere and exposure of the foundation would have
ramifications other than in South Africa. The Director should
be briefed on FES and its range of activities on behalf of CIA
if he has not already been informed.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged
for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.
Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.
-
-
Members of the SSC and their staff should not
interview agent personnel. Foreign agent
personnel frequently are under hostile or
local service scrutiny. For them to be placed
in touch with SSC members would be to run an
unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious damage
could be done to agent morale and motivation
if they were to think their role had been
revealed to members of Congress.
Members of the SSC and their staff should not
in most cases be in contact with members of
host country's intelligence or security services.
Many services will find contact with the SSC
politically difficult and will avoid it. They
further regard that their relationships with CIA,
the information they pass us and the sort of
cooperation extended as a most sensitive matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent of ours while
traveling in Europe.
You should know that we have been told that the
Senate Select Committee staff has already been in touch
with this agent by telephone. We do not know how they
learned his true name or his whereabouts. We have already
advised David Aaron of the Senate Select Committee staff
of a potential problem area in connection with such a
proposed meeting. The agent in question is, of course,
a subject of interest to the local intelligence service.
and we doubt that the host government or the intelligence
service would agree that a United States senator, especially
a member of the Senate Select Committee, may appropriately
conduct such investigations within its territory without
clearance to do so.
In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest and indeed of concern to the Department of
State and the senator might be well advised to consult
with them before proceeding.
For your information, the agant referred to is
QJWIN and we have not been in touch with him since about
1961.

1..
2.
3.
4.
Senatorial contact with a former CIA agent would run the
risk of his exposure to his local government and the press.
Because of his former activities and relationships he
might be subjected to reprisals from abroad, possible
prosecution for espionage at home from his local govern-
ment and harassment from the media.
Active as well as former CIA agents abroad would have
further cause to believe that the American intelligence
service is incapable of protecting its informants from dis-
closure. Contacting an agent under the insecure conditions
involved would violate the Agency's promise to this former
informant to protect the confidentiality of the relationship.
Foreign intelligence services with which the CIA is in
liaison would find this approach highly unprofessional
and risky. It is bound to raise further questions about
the dangers of continued confidential cooperation with
the CIA.
It is possible that the local government involved might
lodge a formal protest to the US mission protesting the
unusual procedure of a Senate investigating committee
interrogating its nationals in violation of its sovereignty
without requesting formal permission.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT
Senator Gary Hart's Request to Talk
to QJWIN While Traveling in Europe
This is for your information concerning Senator Gary
Hart's request to talk to a former agent while the senator
is traveling in Europe.
The agent is QJWIN. He was first approached in 1958
through the head of the Luxembourg intelligence service.
At first he was used mainly to spot potential agents in
various European countries. Later he became the major
asset under ZRRIFLE. In this capacity he made a brief
visit to the Congo, but took no actions.
On the weekend of 7 June 1975, members of the Senate
Select Committee staff spent many hours at Headquarters
reading files, including QJWIN and ZRRIFLE, among others.
QJWIN's true name contract is in the file which they read.
So is a street and post office address as of 1964, the
time when we ended our contract with this agent. We have
not contacted him since.
We have heard that David Aaron of the Senate Select
Committee staff telephoned QJWIN. This report remains
unconfirmed. We have protested to Bill Miller.
It is difficult to imagine how a U.S. senator could
talk to a former agent without arousing the interest of
the local intelligence service (probably Luxembourg) and
of the host government who might wonder about the propriety
of investigations being conducted on their territory and
involving one of their citizens.
In any event, an approach of this nature would be
of interest to the Department of State, and the senator
might wish to consult with the Department before proceeding.

HERE, PP 2 and 5
WITHIN THE HEAVY
BRACKETS,
SUBJECT:
GUIDELINES FOR MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND
THEIR STAFFS WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD
:
There have been already and there will continue to be members
of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and
talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential
that we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security
problems. The following specific guidelines are applicable.
I.
MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT PUBLICLY APPEAR TO BE
ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
INSTALLATIONS.
Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad,
for example, are under some form of cover, or are maintaining
a low profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of
protection from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence
activities behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum
protection. Ther mere visit of SSC representatives could be
noted as evidence of U.S. intelligence presence within the
country. Even in those countries where U.S. intelligence
efforts enjoy the shielding and other benefits flowing from
close liaison with the host government, care is required to
avoid the potentially grave political repercussions that
25 June - latest version, incorporationg
proposed changes by DoD.

could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison.
Several foreign governments or entities thereof
now willing to cooperate privately with the U.S. in intelligence
agreements-exchanges maintain strong neutral or anti-U.S. foreign
policies; continuation of such agreements-exchanges is therefore
dependent upon avoidance of their public disclosure. In many
cases termination of such agreements would result in the loss.
of unique strategic intelligence, and alternate collection
methods are either not available or are prohibitively expensive.
To help maintain the discreet nature of the visit, it would be
preferable if some reason other than SSC business could be
given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff. No
deliberate contact should be made with the local press, nor
should comments on SSC matters be supplied if investigating
officers are contacted by the press. Local press publicity
pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distasteful to the host government.
In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas,
discreet arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S.
intelligence activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with
senior officers within the covering embassies. Such visits are
contingent upon the SSC member not publicly declaring himself
to be on SSC business at the time of the visit or upon his
return, and his proceeding on a basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.

THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT.
All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because
of his knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding..
Brin
III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE
CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.
etc.
It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements
will only discuss operations in general terms--operational
priorities, the kinds of operations conducted, the operational
environment, relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches,
In all cases, such discussions will only be conducted in
physical surroundings which meet appropriate security standards.
Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of or general notes on intelligence agreements between
the U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered
by the host government as extremely sensitive, politically and
operationally, and cannot be divulged without the consent of
the host government.
:
IV.
MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT PERSONNEL.
Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local
service scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members

. 5
a visit is considered essential, a special request must be
negotiated with the host country in advance.
Senate Select Committee principals and staff should
understand the distinction between U.S. intelligence
installations abroad and joint U.S.-foreign intelligence
installations or foreign intelligence installations supported
by the U.S. intelligence community. Access to the former
is at the discretion of the U.S. Ambassador; access to the
latter two is at the discretion of the foreign government
involved.
VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS AND STAFF,
PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.
This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representa-
tives of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.);
as appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize
the visitor with the types of activities conducted at each
location, the restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities
in each case and the considerations which preclude the discussion
of operational details, names and terms in an overseas environment.
-
Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that.
they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition
intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff
members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly
travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

would be to run an unacceptable risk. Moreover, serious.
damage would be done to agent morale and motivation if their
identity were to be revealed to Members or staff of the SSC.
V. MEMBERS OF HOST COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE OR SECURITY SERVICES
WILL BE CONTACTED ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES.
Many foreign intelligence services will find contact with the
SSC politically difficult and will avoid it. They further regard
that their relationships with U.S. intelligence activities, the
information they pass, and the cooperation extended are all most
sensitive matters.
Regardless what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to discuss these matters
with members or staff of the SSC. The very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause the host service to
reassess the desirability of a relationship with U.S. intelligence
activities.
VI. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD NOT VISIT FOREIGN TECHNICAL
INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.
In those countries in which we operate joint technical collection
sites, the host would be firmly opposed to access by U.S.
Congressional representatives, especially where there is public
knowledge of the Congressional investigating interests.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION
DATE AND PLACE: 17 June 1975 1000 - 1100
Room 2E-45
SUBJECT:
Conversation by Mr. John Waller, SA/DDO with
Mr. David Aaron, member of Senator Mondale's
staff, with Regard to the Senator's Proposed
Trip to Europe
1.
According to Mr. Aaron the Senator and Mr. Aaron's itinerary,
while not yet fixed, will be along the following lines:
a.
30 June
-
1 July: London
b. Monday, 7 June: Vienna, for one day
c.
Paris and Bonn. Although the order has not yet been
determined, the Bonn stop would be two days and the
Paris stop, one day.
In the period between London and Vienna, the party intends to visit
Oslo and Helsinki. The purpose of this part of the trip, however,
has nothing to do with the SSC and the party does not want or need
Station contact.
2. Mr. Aaron agrees that in discussions with Stations, the
party should not get into specific operational cases. They want to
discuss "more generic" subjects: operational priorities, relations
with the Embassy, problems, scope of liaison, operating conditions,
etc. Their basic interests are related to "command and control".
It had occurred to Aaron that Vienna would be a good example of a
Station which concentrates on "East West" operations (read third
-
country, Sov and Sov Bloc operations). He recognized London was a
liaison station. Mondale, however, was anxious to talk to Cord Meyer..

Paris, he felt, would provide some understanding of "third world"
operations. Bonn, he felt, would be a good example of the inter-
relations of a CIA Station with the Military and the Foreign Service.
3. Mr. Aaron stated that he had already sought out Mr. Simon
of the British Embassy, requesting that contacts be arranged in
London with the appropriate Foreign Office or Intelligence Offices
in order to discuss the British experiences in "command and control".
Aaron is also interested in how the British Official Secrets Act
works. He had heard that it was proving inadequate. Mr. Aaron
stated that Simon had not been enthusiastic about the idea but
promised to look into it. Aaron felt that it had been better to
work directly with Simon, whom he claimed to know, than to involve
the Agency's go-between.
4. Mr. Aaron intended to make a similar approach to the German
Embassy.
--
5. Mr. Waller commented that such approaches to foreign
governments would make our liaison services uneasy and could
adversely affect their willingness to cooperate. To this reason,
we did not favor involving foreign governments at whatever
level or wherever in the bureaucracy. Moreover, contacts with
foreign governments increased the likelihood that the true purpose
of the Senator's trip could leak to the press. Mr. Waller mentioned
that he would want to bring this to the attention of others.
6. Mr. Aaron agreed that the Senator, through press conferences
or otherwise, would not make public the fact that his trip was
connected with Select Committee investigations.
7. Mr. Aaron said that he and the Senator were in touch with
Mr. Hyland of the State Department with regard to this trip. He
also suggested that they might get in touch with military intelligence
services in Washington and in the field. He made specific reference
to "Naval Intelligence".
8. Mr. Aaron stressed the fact that the itinerary was still
tentative and subject to change.

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.
Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be
opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

SUBJECT: Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad
:
.I-
÷
There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:
Members of the SSC and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroad for
purposes of investigating CIA installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence.
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged
for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.
Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide -
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

In sum, except in the case of very sensitive
areas, discreet arrangements can be arranged
for SSC visits to CIA's overseas stations and
with senior officers within the covering Embassy
provided the SSC member does not publicly declare
himself to be on SSC business and maintains his
Station contacts on a discreet basis.
Members of the SSC and their staff should not
question Station personnel on specific operational
detail. It is more fitting that Washington be the
place where operational details are conveyed to
the SSC. It is at Headquarters where the guide-
lines are best understood, where the most complete
and authentic records are kept (many Stations
finding themselves in dangerous crisis situations,
have periodically destroyed their files). There
is no reason, however, that Station Chiefs should
not discuss operations in general terms opera-
tional priorities, the kinds of operations, the
operational environment, relationships with the
Embassy, the service attaches, etc.

SUBJECT:
Guidelines for Members of the Select
Committee and Their Staffs While
Traveling Abroad
..
:
There have been already and there will continue to
be members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who
wish to travel abroad and be in conversation with our
Stations. It is important that we agree on guidelines
to avoid serious security problems from arising. The
following specific guidelines are considered important:
Members of the SSC and members of its staff
should not publicly appear to be abroad for
purposes of investigating CIA installations.
CIA Stations abroad, all of which are under
some form of cover, have and need varying
degrees of protection from exposure. At
one extreme are Stations behind the iron
curtain or in other particularly sensitive
areas which need maximum protection. At
the other extreme are Stations which enjoy
close liaison with the host government and
are thus less sensitive. In the first case,
Stations existing under strict cover conditions
in sensitive environments, the very presence of
SSC members could be highly provocative by
flaunting the fact of CIA's presence.
even in countries in which we enjoy a good
liaison with the host country's security
service, there remains a need to be discreet.
Many countries whose services want to be
cooperative with CIA cannot afford public or
parliamentary exposure of the relationship.
Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC
investigation abroad would in almost all
cases be distastefull to a host government.

SUBJECT:
Guidelines for Members of the Select Committee and
Their Staffs While Traveling Abroad
:
There have been already and there will continue to be members
of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) who wish to travel abroad and
talk to U.S. embassy and intelligence personnel. It is essential that
we agree on guidelines to avoid serious diplomatic and security problems.
The following specific guidelines are applicable.
I.
MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC SHOULD PUBLICLY APPEAR
TO BE ABROAD FOR SOME PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE
INVESTIGATION OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE INSTALLATIONS.
Most of these installations, including all CIA stations abroad, for
example are under some form of cover, or are maintaining a low
profile. Certainly all have and need varying degrees of protection
from exposure. At one extreme are U.S. intelligence activities:
behind the iron curtain. These clearly need maximum protection.
The mere visit of SSC representatives could be noted as evidence
of U.S. intelligence presence within the country. Even in those
countries where U.S. intelligence efforts enjoy the shielding and
other benefits flowing from close liaison with the host government,
care is required to avoid the potentially grave political repercussions

No matter what assurances are given them,
they would find it difficult and awkward to
discuss these matters with the SSC or its
staff, and the very fact that such matters
were under investigation could well cause
them to reassess the desirability of a
relationship with CIA or other U.S.
intelligence agencies. Exceptions can
perhaps be made in special cases.
Members of the SSC and their staff should
not visit foreign technical intelligence
installations. Again there may be exceptions
to this which can be arranged, but in most
countries in which we operate joint technical
collection sites, the host service would be
opposed to access by Congressional representatives.

that could result to U.S. and host country activities from exposure
of such liaison. Many countries that wish to cooperate with the
United States in intelligence endeavors simply cannot afford public
exposure of such relationships. Some reason other than SSC business
should be given to explain any visits by SSC members and staff to
help maintain the discreet nature of the visit. No deliberate contact
should be made with the local press, nor should comments on SSC
matters be supplied if investigating officers are contacted by the
press. Local press publicity pertaining to an SSC investigation abroad
would in almost all cases be distasteful to the host government.
In sum, except in the case of especially sensitive areas, discreet
arrangements can be made for SSC visits to certain U.S. intelligence:
activities overseas on a case by case basis, and with senior officers
within the covering embassies. Such visits are contingent upon the
SSC member not publicly declaring himself to be on SSC business.
at the time of the visit or upon his return, and his proceeding on a
basis satisfactory to the Ambassador.
II.
THE AMBASSADOR AT THE EMBASSY VISITED WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE VISIT.
All arrangements and contacts will be made by him, and because of his
knowledge of local situations, his advice will be binding..

III. FIELD DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL
SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ONLY IN GENERAL TERMS.
It is more fitting that Washington be the place where operational
details are conveyed to the SSC. Field intelligence elements will
only discuss operations in general terms operational priorities,
--
the kinds of operations conducted, the operational environment,
relationships with the Embassy and defense attaches, etc. In all
cases, such discussions will only be conducted in physical surroundings.
which meet appropriate security standards.
Members and staff of the SSC should refrain from asking to
see texts of, or general notes on intelligence agreements between the
U.S. and the host government. These are usually considered by the
host government as extremely sensitive, politically and operationally,
and cannot be divulged without the consent of the host government.
IV. MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE SSC WILL NOT INTERVIEW AGENT
.
PERSONNEL.
Foreign agent personnel frequently are under hostile or local service
scrutiny. For them to be placed in touch with SSC members would be

essential, a special request must be negotiated with the host country
in advance.
VII. AN ORIENTATION BRIEFING WILL BE PROVIDED ALL MEMBERS
AND STAFF, PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.
This briefing will be conducted by the DCI and other representatives
of the Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA, DIA, State, etc.), as
appropriate. The purpose of this briefing is to familiarize the
"
visitor with the types of activities conducted at each location, the
restraints which are imposed upon U.S. activities in each case and
the considerations which preclude the discussion of operational details,
names and terms in an overseas environment.
Members and staff of the SSC should bear in mind at all times that
they and their activities are matters of great interest to opposition
intelligence services, as well as to the press. Committee and staff.
members, particularly those who are publicly prominent, can hardly
travel inconspiciously and will be easily recognized.

THE SENIOR AGENCY OFFICERS OF A MISSION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY
HAPPEN TO BE INTERFACED ADMINISTRATIVELY WITHIN AN EMBASSY

AND FOR GOOD REASONS. A COMMANDER HAS À FUNDAMENTAL
INTEREST IN PROTECTING HIS COMMAND AND ASSURING THAT, SHOULD

ORGANIZATIONALLY, THE US INTELLIGENCE SETUP IN KOREA IS VIABLE.
THE RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES,
I.E., CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA), DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.
(DİA), AND NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA) WORK EFFECTIVELY IN
CONCERT WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE STAFFS AND THOSE COLLECTION ELEMENTS

OF QUALITY INTELLIGENCE.
LIKE ALL COMMANDERS, HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT FULLY SATISFIED WITH ALL
ASPECTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE EFFORT. THE PRIMARY NEED IS FOR.
RELIABLE WARNING INTELLIGENCE. BECAUSE OF OUR PROXIMITY TO THE
ENEMY'S AIRFIELDS, AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR TROOPS LIVE WITHIN
THE RANGE FANS OF HIS EMPLACED WEAPONS SYSTEMS, WE MUST CONSTANTLY BE
ALERT FOR THOSE ANOMALIES IN HIS BEHAVIOR WHICH WOULD TIP US OFF
TO IMPENDING ATTACK. UNFORTUNATELY, RECAUSE OF HIS READINESS AND
THE FORWARD DISPOSITION OF HIS FORCES, INCLUDING FORWARD POSITIONING
OF SUPPLIES, WE DO NOT HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF ASSURANCE THAT WE
WILL HAVE MUCH WARNING. WHILE WE MIGHT HAVE DAYS OR WEEKS, IT IS
MORE PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONLY HOURS. TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS,
US AND ROK FORCES MAINTAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF ALERT, PREPARED TO
QUICKLY ENGAGE THE FORCES OF THE NORTH SHOULD THEY INITIATE
AN ATTACK. CONCURRENTLY, WE AND THE NATIONAL LEVEL INTELLIGENCE

TO BE NOMINATED BY THE SPEAKER WITH CONCURRENCE BY
THE HOUSE MEMBERS.
5. THE PRESENT HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE (HSC) IS
TO BE PHASED OUT AS OF 31 JANUARY. THE CONGRESSMAN
WAS OF TWO MINDS AS TO WETHER THE COMMITTEE'S LIFE
SHOULD BE EXTENDED. IF TERMINATED ON SCHEDULE, THE
SPOTLIGHT WOULD FADE AWAY BUT THE RESULT WOULD BE
VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR "BAD" LEGISLATION. IF
CONTINUED, THE POLITICALLY INSPIRED MANIPULATION OF
THE COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE SEEKING SENSATIONAL
HEADLINES, HE SAID THAT HE FRANKLY DID NOT KNOW
WHICH WAS WORSE.

THAT FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES, MOST MEMBERS WERE "PRISONERS
OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF". HE HAS NOT BEEN HAPPY WITH
THIS SITUATION AND HAD INITIALLY PROPOSED THAT EACH
COMMITTEE MEMBER BE PERMITTED TO PERSONALLY SELECT
ONE STAFF MEMBER FOR ASSIGNMENT TO THE COMMITTEE,
HE HAD LINED UP A TOTAL OF SIX MEMBERS TO BACK THIS
APPROACH, WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AGREED TO LET HIM SELECT
ONE STAFF MEMBER IF HE IN TURN WOULD DROP HIS SPONSORSHIP
OF THIS PROPOSAL. HE AGREED, BUT SAID THAT HE HAD AS
YET BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE.
HE DISMISSED THE CURRENT COMMITTEE STAFF AS STARRY-EYED

A DISSENTING MINORITY REPORT FOCUSING IN A POSITIVE
MANNER ON THE CONTEMPORARY SITUATION. RATHER THAN
THE HISTORICAL ISSUES THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS FOCUSED
IN A NON-OBJECTIVE MANNER, HOWEVER, SINCE DECEMBER
IS FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES NOT A WORKING MONTH, THIS
GIVES HIM ONLY THIRTY DAYS TO PUT TOGETHER A REPORT.
SINCE HE IS A MEMBER OF THREE HOUSE COMMITTEES AND
CHAIRMAN OF ONE SUB-COMMITTEE WITH NOT EVEN ONE STAFF
ASSISTANT ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE HE IS FINDING IT
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP A MINORITY REPORT.
HE TURNED ASIDE THE SUGGESTION THAT FAVORABLE WITNESSES
BE CALLED AS IMPRACTICAL. HE SAID, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT
IF HE ASKED GENERAL WALTERS OR PRESTIGIOUS AND
KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSONALITIES WITH INTELLIGENCE BACKGROUNDS
TO APPEAR, THEY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO MAKE AN OBJECTIVE
AND BALANCED PRESENTATION, THE COMMITTEE'S LINE OF
QUESTIONING WOULD BE CONFINED TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE
"DEAD CATS" OF TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. HE ALSO FORESAW
NO POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE MAJORITY VIEWS OR THE
MAJORITY REPORT. HE WAS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT SAM ADAMS'

WITH "UNCLASSIFIED ASPECTS" OF THE REVIEW. (HOW
ONE RECONCILES THIS CAN NOT BE SUGGESTED FROM THIS
VANTAGE POINT, IT MERELY EMPHASIZES THE LACK OF
FOCUS AND THE CONGRESSMAN'S DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE, BUT HIS INABILITY TO FIND A "HANDLE".)
THE CONGRESSMAN COMMENTED THAT THE SECURITY OF
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL IN THE COMMITTEE'S HANDS IS A
MAJOR PROBLEM, THE HSC RULES STATE CLASSIFIED
8.0
MATERIAL MUST NOT BE RELEASED BUT THESE RESTRICTIONS
DIRECTLY CONTRAVENE HOUSE REGULATIONS ON THIS POINT
AND WOULD NOT BE SUSTAINED IF CHALLENGED.
HOWEVER,
SINCE THE HARRINGTON EPISODE HE DOUBTED THAT THE
HSC'S SPECIAL RULE WOULD BE CHALLGNGED (ACCORDING TO
THE CURRENT HOUSE RULES ANY MEMBER CAN ASK FOR A
COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT OF ANY CLOSED COMMITTEE HEARING
AND USE IT ALMOST WITH IMPUNITY).

NEVER HEARD OF THE DCID'S, HE NOTED THE SUGGESTION

THE CONGRESSMAN WAS CONCERNED THAT THERE
WA'S A DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND INTENTLY QUESTIONED
THE MULTICHANNEL NATURE OF REPORTING WHEN ONLY ONE
DICISION COULD BE TAKEN. COL. LONG, THE DEPUTY.
J-2, WAS PARTICULARLY ELOQUENT IN DEFENSE OF
MULTIPLE REPORTING CHANNELS, POINTING OUT THE
SPEED AND ASSURANCE OF COVERAGE WHEN SUCH WERE
EMPLOYED. HE ADDED THAT PLACING A UNIFYING LAYER
OF BUREAUCRACY ON TOP WOULD TEND: TO DELAY THE
MORE RAPID TRANSMISSION OF INTELLIGENCE; TO STIFLE
DISSENTING VIEWS; AND TO CREATE A MONSTROUS SIZED
SUPER-AGENCY WHICH MIGHT PROVE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE

RECRUITMENT APPROACH. IN COST EFFECTIVENESS TERMS, ALSO POINTED
OUT THAT THE RECRUITMENT OF A SINGLE SOVIET COULD AND DOES RESULT
IN A MORE ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE SOVIET THREAT AND THUS A MORE
A
RELISTIC ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO MEET IT. MR. SNOD GRASS ADMITTED
THAT THIS WAS SO BUT ADDED HIS UPINION THAT MORE RATHER THAN LESS
CONGRESSIONAL CONTACT WITH CIA FIELD PERSONNEL AS IN JAKARTA
WOULD BE A PLUS FOR THE AGENCY AND GIVE THE CONGRESS A BETTER
FEEL FOR OUR ENDEAVORS AND PROBLEMS.
S. MR. CAREY ALSO SAID THAT ON THE BASIS OF HIS TALKS WITH
MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION IT APPEARED THAT THE BRIEFING HAD GONE
'
DOWN WELL AND THAT THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING GIVEN AN ACCURATE

ABOUT IT.
