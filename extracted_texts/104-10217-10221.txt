CONTACT AND DEVELOPMENT
1. INDICATE NOW. THEN, WHERE. WHY. AND BY WHOW SUBJECT WAS FIRST CONTACTED OR DEVELOPED,
In response to Headquarters requests, London Station officer George E. Katzenbach
contacted Subject in London in mid-January 1965 for the purpose of debriefing him on
his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and western Europe up to the time
of his departure from the staff of Revolution in sping 1964. This was followed up by
in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room
on 17,18,19 and 23 February. On the basis of these talks it was decided to recruit
Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965 during which time
he would attempt to build long-term access and cover for reporting on activities and
personalities in the Afro-Asian community. KUDESK/ICG staffer Joseph S. Tiffany
vas dispatched to London TDY 1-7 June for this purpose. Kie After recruitment end
agreement to LCFLUTTER examination, Subject was introduced to his Paris-based Case
Officer, Rufus F. PODIGAST, on 3 June.
INDICATE WHETHER SUBJECT COULD BE TURNED OVER QUICKLY AND IN A SECURE MANNER TO ANY RESPONSIBLE CASE OFFICER FOR

14 and 15 June RODIJAST again met with 8/1 for further
debriefings on the latter's contacts in Paris. RODIQAST then briefed him
KUTUB requirements for MX and passed on the requirement: afizionati
forwarded in DIR 18107 and DIR 18675. RODIGAST's reports on these setings
are also included in Attachment B (USC). On 14 June 5/1 was passed $500.00
as an advance on his per diem and travel expenses for his next meeting with
BODIGAST. RODIGAST considers 5/1 an apt student who learned the S/W systema
well in some two hours of instruction. Paris KURIOT Officer DONARY noted
some carelessness on &/1's part in the test messages, and this was subesquently
brought to 5/1's attention in the overall security briefing he received from
HODIGAST.
5. The communications system established with S/1 consists of
re-arranged meeting sites and times, a one-way S/W system, and the use of the
classified advertising section of the Algiers El Foudjahid (received daily in
Paris) by 5/1 to signal a postponement of meeting dates. The one-way system was
chosen for this initial stage of the agent's operational relationship with KUBARK
for reasons of security; given the operational climate in Algiers and the
specific circles in which 8/1 must move, and adding to the sudden political
upheaval in Algeria, 5/1 would not be in a position to receive incoming commun–
ications safely. As of 23 June 8/1 had initiated S/W correspondence, his initial
effort being clearly legible and the content operationally worthwhile. (See
Attachment P).
6. The next RODIGAST contact with 8/1 is scheduled for 15 July in
D. (See CPLA 2538 for LCPIPIT's request for Rome Station support.) In
view of the events that have just taken place in Algeria the seeting may wall
be concerned as much with rethinking 8/1's operational objectives for the
period following 16 July as with debriefings, briefings, and passage of funds.
Even though latest indications are that Bandung II will pressed as scheduled,
it is questionable whether the AAJA or the Afro-Asian Koman's conference will
hold in Algiers this sums. Moreover, there is no assurance at this writing
that MEMINCE will not be either postponed, canceled, or moved elsewhere. Add
this the possibility that DEN A might be on the scene profiting from the
sudden rise in the political fortunes of his friends, and Algiers suddenly
Losss some of its appeal as an area in which to carry out a meaningful test
of §/1's operational capabilities. The next three weeks will tall us much
and perhaps allay many of our apprehensions.
7. Nevertheless, RODICAST must be prepared to handle a number of
eventualities in his 15 July meeting, not the least of these being a possible
revision of 5/1's mission. The following possible alternatives present them-
solves; va ask Readquarters to address its attention to them and to other
davelogmantal targets and to cable recommendations and guidance prior to 13
July:
A. 8/1 to remain on site, contime his efforts to establish
credentials and find a Job in Algiers, or elschere, in the national liberation
movement, and report en political developments in Algeria.
B. 8/1 to travel to Dar es Salaam to look into the job offer
time ago by Dennis FHEAR.
C. 8/1 to proceed to Brussels to continue development of
(ase CLA 2541).
D. 8/1 to return to London to write up reports and operational
proposals and polish up the translation of MEN B's book.
E. 8/1 to follow the MIMDICE caravan wherever it my lead (perhaps
Sofia?) and continue to look for job leads (outside the Blos).

2. Access and Limitations on Access. There apparently has been
circulated a charge that Gibson is a CIA agent. (This is reflected in
his 201 as dating from his days with the FPCC.) In dealing with this
question, however, KATZENBACH cites Gibson's own belief that he is still
able to operate in the circles which would be of interest to us.
It is,
of course, difficult to tell from his debriefing the extent and serious-
ness of this charge against Gibson, insofar as it affects his bona fides.
It does seem that in Gibson's milieu, gossip, personal attacks, muddled
loyalties and an aura of conspiratorial confusion are everyday facts of
life and that personal contact and effectiveness in building rapport
would far outweigh such critical personal charges -- which, indeed, pro-
bably circulate about most people. At the present time, for reasons not
entirely clear, Gibson feels that he would be unwelcome and restricted
were he to visit Ghana, and, in fact, would not like to make such a
trip. He has indicated, on the other hand, that he has friends in Al-
geria and believes he could probably get some kind of job there or at
least find a receptive and generally friendly reception.
reception. He also appears
to have some contact and standing with the Indonesian government, since
he claims their London Embassy offered him employment. It is not known
to what extent he might be able to parley such a contact into employment
in Djakarta or some form of official association in Europe, although
these questions could be explored further. The termination of his asso-
ciation with Revolution and Verges would not, according to his account of
it, discredit him in the eyes of those who might have been partisans of
the ideological line which this magazine purveyed. According to his
account, Verges is not in good standing with the pro-Chinese like Grippa
or even the Chinese, and that his (Gibson's) quarrel with Verges over
unpaid salary is well known. While this may not be unbiased, it is
apparently true that he has lodged a clain for payment against Verges,
and thus is not in the position of having been expelled from Revolution
for ideological deviation. As Gibson recounts it, it is Verges, not be,
who is discredited.
3. Motivation and Readiness to Cooperate. The debriefing reflects
between the lines what KATZENBACH Judges in his covering dispatch to be
a readiness to collect information for us knowing that we are an official
agency and probably suspecting that we are KUBARK. His professed moti-
vation is monetary, and frankly so, although a certain degree of fatigue
with his past profession of ideological punditry is discernable. There
are also a number of indications that Gibson would like to rehabilitate
himself lest he be forced to make his living for an indefinite period of
time in an environment that he finds both unpleasant and materially un-
rewarding. It is not possible, of course, to make an intelligent judge-
ment from this debriefing on the firmness and consistency with which he

1. Areas of Knowledgeability. A reading of the transcription of
Gibson's taped debriefing clearly underlines KATZENBACH's assessment
that Gibson possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of personalities and
groups ranging from Zanzibar to the U.S. It is not always clear from
the debriefing to what extent Gibson enjoys either a first-hand know-
ledge or even a friendly relationship with specific individuals or
groups. What is clear is that Gibson moves in a milieu on which we
presently have very little coverage; that he is already a member of
this loosely defined society and thus can be presumed capable of de-
veloping new contacts or strengthening old ones by means of present
and past associations.
--
--
.91€
It is difficult to categorize or devine what this milieu is.
It is not the world of commist parties although it contains a pre-
ponderance of communists; and it does not seem to be a society which
necessarily revolves about the Chinese. The primary common denomina-
tor covering most of the personalities involved in Gibson's reporting
is some association with the revolutionary movement in Africa parti-
cularly Algeria. A secondary means of characterizing these contacts is
a correlation with the radical French and Belgian left which lies out-
side such organized party structures as the PSU, PCF, BCP. (His main
access to Chinese communists runs through Jacques GRIPPA in Belgium and
Nils AHTERSSON in Switzerland with whom he claims to be on good terms at
the present time.) Another common thread, almost as general, is asso-
ciation with Trotskyism, although the meaning or clarification of this
political description is never spelled out. In general, Gibson displays
a good and often personal knowledge of target areas which might be
grouped as follows:
&.
African exile revolutionary circles in France, Algeria
and London, including the PAC, ANC, MPLA, MPA, and other less
organized pockets.
b. European leftist sympathizers of the liberation movement
in Africa.
c. Algerians or Algerian contacts in Europe who were asso-
ciated with the war for independence.
d. Algerian personalities currently active or occupying
official positions in Algiers.

night undertake continuing assignments for us, but this is not an
unusual area of uncertainty with a new agent and one which a proba-
tionary period should dispel. (It should be noted that in one instance,
he volunteered a name as an operational lead -- i.e., as someone whom we
might find it worthwhile to look up. He also provided what is apparently
an accommodation address in Bogota for Chinese mailings.)
Long-Range Usefulness and Initial Targetting. Gibson's long-
range usefulness, of course, would depend not only on his effectiveness
and dependability, but on the opportunities which will emerge and take
shape as a result of his initial activity. As a general proposition, he
can be viewed as an intelligence collection asset targetted at radical
independence movements, pro-Chinese personalities and organizations,
and official personalities in newly emerged countries, primarily in
Africa. Specifically, these targets would include:
PAC and ANC: Gibson claims to have friends in both.
b. FIN and Algerian government and publishing circles.
c.
Afro-Asian Journalists Association, and by extension,
other Afro-Asian groups, such as exist or promised in youth,
labor, women, and so forth.
d. Pro-Chinese European parties, including the Belgian (he
claims to have access to Grippa), the Marseilles faction and the
Swiss activity of Hils Andersson.
e. By extension from these, although at present only a
remote possibility, developing Chinese propaganda and intelli-
gence instrumentalities.
In the short range, a current assignment for us should meet the follow-
ing criteria:
8. lend itself to probationary exploitation;
b. not tie Gibson down indefinitely to one location or
involve him in an identification with one faction, group or
party that would limit his later flexibility;
c. permit him to respond to targets of opportunity as we
may define them, both to have a maximm test of the range of his
capability and access, and to probe for the best long-range use
we can put him to;
d. enable him to build his bona fides and his contacts as
we may direct.

The best likely assignment to fulfill these requirements is that of a
journalist, preferably operating from Europe, capable of credible travel
in Europe, Africa and even Asia, with some associations which will pre-
serve his bona fides with target Afro-Asian grours. Assuming the devel-
opment of adequate cover, he could then spend an initial period this
spring and summer in Algeria to cover the Second Bandung Conference
(29 June) and the World Youth Festival (28 July). (Other international
conferences, including followup AAPSO meetings to the Ghana Congress in
May, an Afro-Asian Journalists Conference or further PAJU meetings c
not be anticipated as targets at present either because of indefinite.
planning or because of unsuitable location. There is little doubt, how-
ever, that additional meetings will take place in Algiers and Africa
bringing together interesting target personalities from Africa and Asia
whom Gibson might attempt to report on.) In addition to his contribu-
tion in coverage of these meetings he might also attempt to develop his
access and contact among the official Algerian community at least with
the value of developing biographical and operational support data.
5. Proposed for Discussion. The following questions seem to pre-
sent themselves for discussion at this time:
a. decision on the continuation of support to Gibson on a
probationary period;
b. determination on targetting for initial probationary and
possible long-range employment;
C. mechanics of establishing a project;
d. timetable for assignments.

8. The second BODIZAST meeting of the summer with 5/1 is tentatively
scheduled for the second week in August, site to be determined. Addreasses will
know that 8/1's wife is expecting their third child a/a 11 August and that 8/1
intends to be in London at that time if at all possible. Although he told
RODĪGAST he would forego a visit to London at that time if it were operationally
Azar, he would find it difficult to justify his absence to his wife unless
he were to have a truly plausible and urgent cover assignment. We must therefore
anticipate in all likelihood that 5/1 will be out of action for most of the
second week of August. In any event, RODIGAST will probably be able to meet
8/1 somewhere in Europe when 3/1 returns to be with his wife and will at that
time hope to be in a position to discuss with 8/1 the best employment of his
talents for the balance of the three-month contract period and to pursue with
his his longer range utilisation as well. Headquarters views, then, are needed
both with respect to the wenke immediately following the 15 July meeting
referred to in the previous paragraph as well as with respect to the post-
August period,
9. Administratively, LCPIPET has so far funded 5/1 to the extent
of $700.00 and has initiated action to have his salary and nonsecountable
operational advance deposited to his Swiss bank account. Thess payments are
being made in advance because of 5/1's initially pressing financial needs.
It is our understanding that the 1 July and 1 August 1965 depoalts of $600.00
to 8/1's Swiss bank account will be affected securely and on time through
ATHAD/1 (see DIR 20944 and DIA 21703). Action was also taken to clarify the
question of 8/1's per diem. He have received his initial accountings for travel,
per diem, and operational expences for the period 8 - 12 June.
10. On the basis of information available to LCPIPTY, 5/1 has received
the following payments from KUÐAÆX since he was first contacted in London by
George H. KATZENBACH in January of this year (we have no record at hand of the
KURAKK funds passed 5/1 by FAIRWAN of KRIESIS);

salary of $500.00 per month and his $100.00 monthly nonaccountable advance for
perational expenses, 5/1 is entitled to the following under the letter of
agreement be signed 3 June 1965:
necessary expenses incurred in connection with such operational
travel as may be directed or authorised by QDYCE.
b) operational expenses in excess of $100.00 monthly nonacosrtable
advance as are specifically authorized by QDYONE.
c) compensation in an amount mutually agreed upon for the relocation
of 8/1 and his family to a new residence if such relocation is considered
desirable by 9/1 and ODYOKE.
d) per diem at the rate of $20.00 per day during periods of
suthorized travel (1.8.1 during absenos from London).

1. Ref forwarded the tapes and a rough transcription of the debriefing
session with Subject, which were held on February 17, 18, 19, 23, 1965.
2. In accordance with Headquarters' instructions, these meetings
were kept on a don't-call-us-we'll-call-you basis - in fact GIBSON was given
no means for calling us. Also in accordance with Headquarters' instructions,
we did not pay GIBSON at a constant rate of over $100 per hour. The first
1 ($300) payment to GIBSON was in fact more than we had originally intended to
give him as a "binder", but in light of the imminence of his trip to Prope
wo advanced him that sum to help him to meet his expenses. This nicely
coincided with our own time table, since the time he was gone - some three
weeks should have provided adequate time for the initial tape to be
reviewed and for requirements to be prepared and pouched to the field.
any rate, the total sum given to GIBSON, for his time and a shot at his
mailing list, was $700.

3. LCHARVEST may well feel that it has been done out of $700 in COA
funda. The information obtained on ChiCom contacts of GIBSON, or on any
ChiComs at all, was slight. GIBSON claims not to have had more than very
little contact with them, and not to know too much about them. Unless there
is hard info to the contrary, we are inclined to believe that GIBSON was
telling pretty much the truth in this respect, as indeed seems to have been
the case almost all of the time. While this is a bit of a disappointment,
in a way, and seems to lessen the immediacy of LCHARVEST interest, it
certainly does not appear to eliminate GIBSON's potential worth.
4. The London Station continues to feel that GIBSON has considerable
potential as a source of positive intelligence on a wide range of targets
targets that appear to be only lightly covered otherwise, although we are
not always able to judge this. A review of this debriefing can only cause
one a certain amount of amazement at GIBSON's encyclopedic knowledge of many,
many groups, personalities and parties of the far left, literally from
America to Zanzibar. We leave it to Headquarters, of course, to evaluate

Plans for the Sale of "Afro-Asian Journalist"
✓ 201-306052,
in Europe
Richard GIBSON, the former editor of the pro-Chinese Communist
publication "Revolution", left London towards the end of January 1965
and returned in the second half of March, having visited Lausanne,
Milan, Rome, Paris and Brussels. During his travels he met Nils
ANDERSSON, who was formerly connected with "Revolution" in Lausanne
and Jacques GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese dissident group of
the Belgian Communist Party. Since his return to the U.K. ha has made
proposals to the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association for these persons
to receive copies of the Association's publication, "Afro-Asian
Journalist". He has also suggested to the Afro-Asian Journalists'
Association that copies of the publication should be sent to the
following-
i

Clichy,
France.

It appears that GIBSON is trying to establish contacts in
Europe with the object of expanding sales of the English and French
editions of "Afro-Asian Journalist".

his material; to the London Station, however, it appears to be not only
rather massive but detailed as well. We do not doubt that he will be
caught out from time to time on facts, and perhaps interpretations as well.
But the totality of his information and the whole performance was without
notes
-
is astonishing.
-
5. Several points should be noted. First of all, a conscious effort
was made to show GIBSON that his comments on the American scene were not
being made a matter of record. (I took notes during our talk, and always
stopped making notes when such a topic came up.) This is, as KULPA noted in
OELW #1903 of 12 February 1965, an area of sensitivity with GIBSON. The only
times that GIBSON really became emotional were when he talked about the
American soene, his involvement, and the involvement of his close associates.
And he kept reverting to the topio, and his involvement in it, throughout
our conversations. We did not share KULPA's impression that GIBSON'в
dissatisfaction with the state of racial relations in America makes him
generally anti-American. He does say that he would not like to be living
in America for the coming year; but in the context of one who does not wish
to be caught up in a period of growing violence, which GIBSON appears not to
believe to be the solution to the problem. He states: "I can understand
how they feel that way, I can recognize the problems, but I sure don't know
what the solution to the problem is." His judgments on Negroes in the front
of the racial struggle (Walter Bowe, Malcolm X, etc.) reflect not only ar
intimacy with the problem and a genuine concern, but also a generally
reasonable and real understanding of many of the forces at work. GIBSON
tends to condemn individuals
he spares no sympathy for the FBI, under-
standably but he does not appear to condemn the United States as a whole,
nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the same time, he
makes no phoney protestations, either.
--
-
6. Regarding Cuba, GIBSON showed a similar emotional involvement (he
acknowledges "my pro-Castro bias") but, withal, manages to give a more
balances portrayal of the situation than many rabidly anti-Castro
commentatore. (Cuba, and Cuban matters, were also similarly low-keyed by
me during our talks.)
7. Where GIBSON really comes into his own, and really astonishes with
the breadth of his personal information and understanding, (and largely, it
appears, without the same personal involvement and bias) is in African
affairs (especially in left-wing fields), European Trotskyists and
Communists and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international
front organizations. Similarly he appears to be informed on certain ChiCom
efforts at subversion and propaganda in Latin America.
-
8. Rather as if reading our thoughts, GIBSON offered to recruit him-
Belf. He didn't get too specific, and neither did we. But he did make it
quite clear that he would be willing to collect information for us, knowing
only that we were ODYCKE, probably suspecting that we were K9BARK, and
probably equally doubting (because he knows the difference ( that we were
ODENVY. His motivations can be compiled from his own words. He has for
some time been unable to find a suitable job here in London, He has economic
pressures working on him now exacerbated by the fact that his wife has
caused her brother to withdraw some of the support that he had been
providing. Venal? Opportunistic? Or someone who has a wife and two kids
to support, and no job for the past eight months? GIBSON acknowledges that
he has become somewhat bored with the "pro-biology" of chasing petty
ideological differences, the kind that make factions of six members or less.
At the same time, he acknowledges that he has to have a job, and that his
access to and knowledge of these persons and groups are marketable
commodities. His preference, he says, would be to have a nice quiet
journalistic or public relations job here, but his efforts to find such a
job have been fruitless. How, obviously, can one of his background and
talents better employ them than as a collector and reporter of information?
He says that he would like public relations or press work for the UN, perhaps,
or an ODYCKE agency, but he is certain that he could never get the requisite
security clearance. Still, obviously, he suspects that an "irregular" arm
of ODYONE, such as we, might be able to work something out.

12. At this stage in KUBARK's relationship with STRBOWY/1 it is
well to note certain factors that must be taken into consideration as we seek
to devise a longer-ters operation centered on his capabilities and potential.
For the sake of brevity, if not precision, we will discuss these factors under
the following being: Tots, Entitation, Bandling & Avidanes,
Security, Termination, and KUBANK Operational Requirements.

13. STEBOWY/1, as has been noted in CEIA 42,750 "really astonishes
with the breadth of his personal information and understanding... [or]
African affairs (especially in left-wing fields), European Trotskyists and
Communists and their general milieu, and Chinese-oriented international front
organizations. Nimilarly, he appears to be informed on certain Chicom efforts at
subversion and propaganda in Latin America." Combined with this knowledge and
understanding is a long list of personal contacts in left-wing revolutionary
airoles and a reputation as an articulate and committed agitator for national
liberation movements.

14. The Ageet exudes an air of self-confidence and presents himself
well and dynamically in interpersonal relationships. He has demonstrated talent
a working journalist, especially as a reportar. While we have limited infor-
ention here upon which to base an evaluation of the accuracy and thoroughness of
his reports, they have tended to be consistent on the whole and reveal the workings
of a mind capable of storing away vast amounts of information and recalling it
with minimal stimulation. 8/1 seems to have good command of the French language
and can get by in Italian and Spanish. He has had considerable experience
in international travel, apparently accommodating wall to various degrees

and tape recorders operationally, and he quickly learned s/w teahniques.
15. Because of his coloring and facial characteristics 8/1 can
pass relatively unnoticed as a North African, Hear Easterner, South Asian,
or American Negro, inter alia. He gives the impression of being able to
strike up casual friendships readily and easily.
1 *
HOTIVATION
16. This is a sticky area open to considerable speculation st
this point, though there are specific actions and statements on the part of
8/1 indicating he has sought some professional relationship with KUBAKK for
several years. He understand, for example, that he tried to establish contact
with CDYOKE while a sturient in Italy in 1951-52, that he appeared to be mont
cooperative when questioned by PESTING Paris in relation to the assassination
of President Kennedy, and that he took a calculated (7) risk by writing in
directly to KUBAK in the sumer of 1962 offering his services. In his contacts
with KUSARKers since January of this year he has given every indication of
being forthcoming and, apparently, sincerely interested in cooperating with us.
One has the impression he was hoping to be recruited, and he certainly didn't
play hard to get.
17. Now that he has signed a letter of agreement, undergon an
LCFISTTER, and been passed a considerable amount of KUBAÍK money hệ may
consider himself already "on the team," though in effect he was told specifically

has intimated to HODIGAST that he would like to parlay his present association
with KUBANK into a long-term career relationship including retirement,
Insurance, etc. He has even alluded to an interest in working for RODIGAST's
ervice” in a "less covert" capacity sometime in the future.

9. How about his ideological motivation? We had hoped for some
more concrete expression than we got, on this score, but what we have
is not too bad. He states that he will not be "intellectually dishonest":
to the point of becoming a "professional anti-Communist," by which he
means a propagandist. At the same time, he agrees that he has no
desire to be a professional revolutionary. Again we note that he is
not blindly or unduly critical of ODYOKE. Granted, he criticizes many
elements of ODYCKE policy and tends to defend some enemies of CDYCKE.
A failure for him to do so would be sufficiently remarkable to make
us totally suspicious of him. Note further his comment that he would
havebeen perfectly willing to talk to us a year ago in Faris in the
same fashion as he has here. This would sound rather suspicious and
difficult to believe, were it not for the fact that he did show him-
self to be candid and cooperative in his Paris interview with a FBSWING
officer.
10. How badly blown is GIBSON, then, if we are thinking of using
him. After all, he has been publicly labelled a "CIA agent.
Could he,
then, work for HUBARK successfully? GIBSON himself is certainly a better
judge of that then the London Station, and we feel that there are only
two indices that can be used to judge the matter. The first and most
immediate is GIESON's own opinion, since he has lived with the problem,
and has tested the idea in practice. He feels that he could still
operate ("Love" is his term) in most of the desirable arees success-
fully, provided he has adequate cover for being where he is and dóing
what he does. The second inder would be for us to test his continuing
access to targets of interest. It should not take too long to make
such a test without putting anything into real jeopardy.
11. Cover for GIBSON, of course, would be a serious problem. He
himself proposes the obvious answers some kind of vaguely left
journalistic tie-up. We should think that such cover could be arranged.
And we propose to disuces a number of possibilities with Headquarters
in due tine.
12. Utilization and lccale are most closely related, of course.
From our vantage point here, it would appear that Algiers would be the
rost desirable home base for GIBSON. He could range out from there into
Purope or the rest of Africa (the two best targets, apparently) and
maintain a regular flow of information on Algerian affairs while "at
"
home. He has spoken several times of the ease with which he is integrated
into the Algerians environment, and he has a fairly well established base
there from which to expand his operations. He has said that he would be
willing to go there, or France, or most any other place where his
children can continue their education in French. And Algiers appears
to be, for the foreseeable future, a worthwhile target in its own right,
as well as the site of a growing number of international front organization
meetings, for which GIBSON would appear to have exceptionally fine
credentials. As he says, he could go elsewhere in Africa, but Algiers
is where he would fit best. We would be inclined to keep him, for the
most part, away from the Cuban milieu (except, perhaps, incidentally) to
avoid straining his reportorial objectivity. In the African, European,
and international front areas, we suspect that careful checking would
ensure such objectivity.
13. His utilization could best be considered on a straight
information-collecting basis. To use him as a propaganda tool would be
not only repugnant to him but destructive of his utility as well.
Presumably he could be permitted to continue to write, not only for
his overt emplyers (in a straight news fashion), but perhaps occasionally
for leftist periodicals of his own choosing, in order to maintain his
own cover. (This is, admittedly, seeing rather far into the future.)
We do feel, however, that GIBSON could be an admirable and highly valuable
collector of positive information on that whole spectrum of the left with
which he is already so familiar.

ABSTRACT
B-CROFILM
1. Transmitted herewith are the tapes of the 17, 18, 19 and
23 February sessions with GIBSON. Also transmitted is a copy of the
Station-prepared transcript of the tapes. The quality of the transcription
varies: the first session is mostly summarized, the subsequent ones are
almost verbatim. Roberta L. HORRELL did the transcripts, and I
subsequently reviewed them, filling in comments, names, etc., that HORRELL
had missed.
2.
As rough as these transcripts are, a careful review of them
is fairly revealing about GIBSON, and about his knowledge of the topics
discussed. Further comment from this end will be contained in an
operational dispatch. Right now we are anxious to get the present material
This is about as far as
into Headquarters' hands for further processing.

14. GIBSON and security, to this point:
to this point: GIBSON has met only
myself, under alias, and under the impression that I was here temporarily.
This idea was apparently made to stick, throughout our conversations.
We would propose that, if GIBSON be recruited in fact, he be handled in
alias and at a good, safe distance - more than arm's length. Until
oufficient operational testing had been carried out, we would suggest
that he not have a "resident case officer" anywhere i.e., neither
here nor in Algiers. Control of GIBSON is partly exercised by the
documents we have received from him (receipts, memo of understanding)
plus the voluminous taped comments. These, while not worthy of a court,
are sufficient to do him considerable professional and personal damage
note particularly that his wife, according to him, would not approve of
any of our contacts, and this appears to be quite meaningful to him.
Financial control would be a continuing factor. And, perhaps to an
unusually high degree, we feel that GIBSON would feel considerable
gratitude to whoever (i.e., KUBARK) rescued him from his present and
difficult position, "forgiving all", and providing him with a measure of
respectability (at least in his own eyes) that he has henceforth been
unable to achieve and maintain. In sum, we feel that a reasonably
strong combination of control factors exist, and can be continued for
as long as GIBSON would be properly handled.
15. We should also like to comment on the reliability of GIBSON's
comments in the course of our meetings to date. We have found him to
be thoroughly consistent in his comments and attitudes throughout.
We found no indication of deliberate deception or serious attempts to
mislead. He may have provided some erroneous materials, or he may have
erroneously interpreted some events; but his comments and attitudes
remained sufficiently consistent to lead us to believe that he was
being reasonably honest all the way. He played down some items, no
doubt, and played up others. In the course of a debriefing such as this
was there seemed little or no point in pushing hard at such points
besides, his knowledge of the areas covered so far outdistanced mine
that I could not have attempted to probe or pin him down on specifics.
(Note also his tendency to make corrections in the debriefing questionnaire,
as when the wrong name would appear for a political group in Saitserland.)
-
16. GIBSON's present status is that he is out of work, in debt, and
without any prospects of reasonable employment in the near future. He
is somewhat occupied with an article he is writing for Encounter; this
will probably keep him from taking another job for the next few weeks.
Beyond that, nothing is definite. If we would like to give him a try,
then, some move should be made to formalize matters with him before he
accepts some job that will put him out of the market.
17. Recognizing that there are risks involved, it nevertheless seems
most undesirable to pass up what has the earmarks of being a highly
useful asset. We request, therefore, that Headquarters review and consider
the entirety of our knowledge of GIBSON to this point, and give us a
reading on his potential worth, as viewed by LCHARVEST, AF Division,
KUDESK/ICG and other interested parties. If, for reasons of which
Headquarters is aware, and we are not, GIBSON is considered unacceptable
as a KUTUBE asset, let us know. If, on the other hand,
If, on the other hand, there appears to
.
be a market for his talents and capabilities, we should move rather
rapidly to pre-empt him. His present flexibility is not likely to last
for long, and any plan to use him should take this into account. As
WR/BC is aware, we are not in a position to put this into the form of a
London Station project. This should not be the reason for neglecting
what appears to be such a potentially rewarding asset for KUBARK, however.
18. We would appreciate a reply within a couple of weeks of Read-
quarters' receipt of this dispatch.

You don't know exactly what does he want. When he started this magazine,

In his early talks with the London Station and again in his talks with BODIGAST
and TIFFANY the Agent has indicated some degree of disenchantment with the
organizations and personalities, if not the ideology, of the left-wing factions
with thich he had been so intimately involved. He has never goan far as
to renounce his birthright and citizenship, nor does is consider himself
disloyal after several years of professional anti-PEPADS activity. He
intimates that he would someday like to return home, though he doubts he
would be allowed to live down his past and start a new career in PAPAUME.
19. On the basiŋ of information available to us us could not
that SHEETY/1 is or ever was an ideologically emitted Marxist-Leninist.
might say that he has murtured over the years a smouldering prejudice
against the "in" group, both domestically and internationally. He has been
"out" most all of his life, and he has aboun a strong attachment to the
causes of the downtrodden Cabana, the colonially oppressed Africans, the
organizationally subdued "young Turks" of orthodox commmist and other leftist
movements, etc. There is no question that in his sympathy for such causes he
overstepped the bounds of reason and good sense, but it is doubtful that he
actually committed any treasonable offense. One has the feeling that 5/1
really sought to hadge his bets on the revolutionaries by putting out feelers
to KEBARK.
20. There is a strong case for the argument that hard cash plays
a significant role in motivating 5/1 to cooperate with KUMARK at this point
in time. All reports emphasise that he was not just broke, but deeply in
debt, when he began talking to London Station. Subsequently he has been
receiving what amounts to a salary at a rate combat in excess of average
for a European journalish, let alone a professional small-time revalutionary.
Since he has had no valid cover story for mything other than the first
advance(a) from (SCOFERA, we cannot be sure that he has lat his wife, his in-
lews, or his immediate circle of associates know the extent of his newly-
orgaired afflimnce. He is quits capable of thinking big operationally and
hang bìmtly stated that it takes money to "move" in Algiers and that "poverty
is no virtus in the Third World' ".
21. But 8/1 does not appear to be an out and out mercenary.
There must be other factors than money alons that would lead him to coeparate
with KUBAIK. It could well be that he is resting philosophically to am
'outlook on life that let him down despite years of devoted cultivation. In
the long debriefings he rarely, if ever, mentioned anyone who he felt had
really accomplished anything as a professional left-wing revolutionary. There
are indications that he regards his activities over recent years as somewhat
unrewarding, though there is little indication that he didn't enjoy math of
what he did or that he doesn't consider the cause of the national liberation
novements & just and honorable cause. He may, simply, have reappraised the
results of some years of revolutionary activity with a somewhat Jaundiced
eye and decided it was time for a change.
22. Certainly 8/1 builds a convincing case about the reasons
for his break with WEH C, but it must also be noted that ideology is not
among them. If anything, it would seen in was reacting to a breach of contract
and perhaps wounded pride. The not result seemed to be a well of resentmans
against ons individual, which resentment fermented into spite and determination
to get even, If this assumption is granted, then the letter he had published
in ZHBARTH and the manuscript he submitted to DENESIS are both explainable
explain such. It was his involvement with these publications that triggered
HURARX's operational interest in him, and we initiated contact at a period
when he was, perhaps, basking in (what he probably considered) the success
of his attack on LIKH A.
23. Looked at from stå another angle, sД's future prospects in
Jammry of this year (both in his professional and his personal life) were
anything but bright for he was jobless, in debt, to some extent cast off by
revolutionary movement, apparently felt homeless (es far as having am thing
to which he could return in PEPRIME), and (from what scraps of information m
piece together) was not experiencing a mutually agreeable marital life.
(He asserts he was unfaithful and that his wife know it. We have learned from
KATZEKIMCH's talks with the SUMMERS that she was unfaithful in her turn,

very upset when he heard that Verges was in Paris. He didn't like being
connected with somebody who had stolen money.
I called Verges and said
he better get in touch with Andersson himself, better see him soon, because
he would keep putting him off. The fact was that Andersson and I went to
Paris. That's when we saw Verges. Verges platated him, said there was
no truth in the charges. In fact, the charges were reduced. Harbi himself
came to London. (The amount) went down, from 300 million
from Go million
to 50 million
to 200 million
and the whole thing was dropped.
Buzerin, the business manager, was extremely indignant about the talk about
misappropriation of funds and demanded an audit of the books. They found
6 million francs surplus. That was even more disturbing to them down there.

Habbi is supposed to have said "this isn't swindling; this is an affair of

Algerians never made any attempt to get in touch with us. None whatsoever.
There was a letter to Anderson from Chalion, who remained with the
Algerians. There was an attempted phone call from them down there- probably
Chalion or someone with the magazine- which Andersson refused to accept.
So we really were never before the choice. In other words, he proposed
(the work); we were doing what he proposed. He was going to continue and
the Algerians had no coherent story about the money and what was going
on. At that time they weren't interested in the English edition. Later,

to the Algerians. She produced this one issue. Then that flopped. She had
been asked by Verges to go with me to Lausanne to be the joint editor
of the edition in English. She refused because she wanted to stay in

silent partner abroad. Obviously he wasn't going along with that. This was
the summer of 63. At the time of the break with Algiers, she was working
as our correspondent here; (she) was extremely upset. She was holding
£1000 of Verges' money. She didn't know which way to go. Harbi came here
and talked to her. She whole thing fell through. Finally she chose the
Algerians and then they dumped her. And she was forced to repay the
money to Verges that she owed.

Verges wanted to move to Paris. He had little justification for a move

this job just to "get out of a hole" for three months and explained that
isaan't really in a hole. He claimed that his debts to his brother-in-lm
ere not a pressing mtter at all. (However, during his LCFLUTTER examination
are told that the cres in which he reacted most strongly was that concerning
personal obligations, especially financial. We were probing to find out if
was
as indeed under some obligation, financial or otherwise, to certain of
his revolutionary associates of the past two and a half years, and what
ensued was an outpouring of all the small and not so small debts he owed
virtually everyone he knew. Foremost among them was the debt of some
▲ 1,500 to his brother-in-law. whether or not he feels pressed to repay is
not as inportant as the fact that there seen to be times when it weighs
hoagily on his mind.)
&
25. Miving 8/1 the last word, the following report from RODIGAST
his 14 June conversation with the Agant should be given careful considerations
"It was clear that he was telling me, without spelling it out in words, that he
had made up his mind to cooperate with us because, or partly because, he had
decided he wanted to be on our side. He even used expressions like 'our side'.
I had the feeling that he did not want to sy outright that he was changing
his political orientation for fear that we would not believe him, but that in
feet he might very well be doing s0} I think there was something geamine
in his protestation that he wasn't with us 'only for the money'.
HANDLING & GUIDANCE:
26. The least that can be said of 3/1 in summarising his relationship
with his KUBARK contacts so far is that he is not docile and passive. He
appears to be a salf-starter with a sense of what is necessary to get an
oparation off the ground. From his account of his work for MEN C it would
appear that he can honestly claim a great deal of credit for putting the
English edition into buaimss.
27. To date 5/1 bas expressed no reluctance to undertake his
current mission nor to consider other missions for KUBARK which might work
hardship on him of place his person or reputation in Jeopardy. His
responsiveness, in fact, encourages us to believe that he will accept
sosignments which permit his to move easily in those revolutionary left
circles which are natural to him and which eœprise, in effect, his natural
target. He has, of course, made a case for working out of Paris, Home, or
Geneva rather than Algiers or Djakarta, but this was prior to his entering
into a formal relationship with ODYCHK.
28. RODIJAST feels that he has been able to establish a good
degree of working rapport with 8/1 and perhaps even some degree of personal
rapport. They have had some half-dozen meetings so far, including three
working mesions in Paris. RODIGAST has stressed to him the vital importance
of good security habits, not the least of which involves such personal
behavior as will keep him out of compromising situations (in respect to his
work for KURZBANK).
29. 3/1 has been on time for all his meetings with RODIGAST
as complied well with instructions; he submitted without hesitation
the LCVLIYAKA and agreed to work with 3/W (accepting the risks involved
disposal of the working materials). 5/1 has not failed to remind RODIGAST
the probable cost of his upkeep and operational activities while in
Algiers and has been assured that RODIGAST "fought for the $20.00 per die

right on up the line." Heedless to say, BIEROWY/1 seemed moat happy to know
that RODIGAST was concerned for his welfare.
30, RODIGAST feels that he can renage S/l's self-assertion and
dynamism, and LCPIPIT points to RODIGAST's record of handling "difficult"
agents. RODIGAST's experience is reassuring in this connection, and we have
no reservations about RODIJAST's ability to keep STEBOWY/1 motivated in the
conths ahead.
N.
3. A last word on the matter of handling: turn-over, So far
8/1 has dealt with KATZRIACH, TIFFANY, and ROUIDAST and has been forthcoming
with all. There is no indication at this early stage that he has placed his
relationship with KURBANK on a person-to-person plans nor are we sure he
should be encouraged to do so. As representatives of ODYONE the three
persons mentioned above have apparently earned £/1's trust, and anyons
introduced to him by one of them would probably be accepted with the same
degree of confidence should the introchaction of another case officer become
KBC9ssary. In effect, then, we foresee no handling problem with 8/1 as far
as a change in case officers might be concerned. He would point out,
though, that 3/1 has been handled sympathetically and without hostility to
date and that thoes who have dealt with him would strongly advise firm in-
telligent direction and against a provocative or heavy-hauled approach to
such a complex and self-centered personality.
SECURITY:
22. 8/1's very beakground is enough to pose all the security
problems one would wait to contend with in any operation. At the same
time it is that very background that makes him valuable to KUBARK. Therefore
we can discount many logical apprehensions about his personal loyalty and
motivation (discussed previously) and proceed to questions of operational
security.
KUBANK
3. First of all, 8/1 has been denounosd as a EIBARK agent since
the mid-1950's when, to the best of our knowledge, he man't actively
involved in revolutionary activities. He traces this original donunciation
to an incident in which he resorted to some rather unscrupulous practices
(forgery and fales denunciation) to get an erstwhile friend and CFUSA member
(with whose wife he had become involved) discredited in France. (See
Attachment to OKLA 43,272). The upshot was that 5/1 was considered by many
who knew him in Paris to be a KURBARK agent who had informed on his communist
"friend" to the French police. From that time to the present the KUBANK tag
hes´ stuck in certain circles, though STEROSTY/1 feels those who really know
him, and those important revolutionaries and communists whom he knows and
who are his potential targets as a KUBANK agent, have largely discounted
possibility that this could be so. There is no denying the fact, housVOT,
that this demumciation is a handicap. It has been used fairly effectively
by his last employer, IZEN A, to burn him in a number of places where he was
probably previously unknown. Certainly the publication of the denunciation
in IIKN C did not raise his stature in some quarters. LOHD 7620 indicates
8/1's enemies have little desire to let sleeping dogs lie.
34. Furthermore, HIEN A goers at this moment to hold as great
grudge against 5/1 as 5/1 holds against him, and DBEN A may still have
tter connections in the national liberation movement than 3/1. This is
pecially so in view of the 19-20 June 1965 downfall of the Ben Fella
gine in Algeria. IDEN A was not a Ben Bella man, and his fortunes declined
sharply in inverse proportion to the rise of Ben Fella's. LEN A's closest
link to Algaria's power elite has long been Rabah Bitat, according to S/1.
In the papers of 22 June we read that, in a "startling development," form
Vice-President Mohammed Ritat flew into Algiers from exile in France and
said he was ready to "assume his responsibilities." We presume that IDEN
will seek to move quickly to derive personal advantage from this sudden change
in Algeria. As if operating in the Algerian security climate were not
hazardous enough, 8/1 may well have to contend with a vendetta mounted by
HIEN A.

with him, to which she was supposed to have retorted: "Why should someone
from PBPRIME be interested in you, and, moreover, why should you be interested
in working for anything or anyone from PBPROVE?" S/1 told RODIGAST that the
fa
backstopping effort initiated by LOND 8004 did not fully dispel her skepticism.
8/1's reaction to the FLUTTER examination on the question of "what his wife
thinks" suggests that the matter is not laid to rest.

that would communiss him in his present situation. ho do not know the

aircumstances. His relationship with his wife, therefore, must be watched
with some care to insure that it does not comprise an undue hasard or that
she does not become vulnerable in some way to forces inimical to his effective-
ness in his work for EJNAR.
3. Aside from speculation about possible repercussions in this
arsa of their marital relationship, there remains the question of cover for
some $3,100 passed 8/1 by KUBANK in the past six months. His wife has been
in the journalism business long enough to know that virtually unemployed

8/1 says that latter "came rushing around" to see his. S/l'a report
on this contact was passed to the Paris Station 17 June by LCPIPIT. In the
report is 5/1's assessment that IIKN E would probably be willing to talk
to RODIGAST's "service." We shall discuss this case further with Paris
Station, but in the meantime it should be noted for the record that as long
■ 8/1 is said by many to be a KUMARK agent, it would not be unreasonable
to assume that FIRN E might connect an approach by an QDYCKE representative
with his recent conversations with S/1. Therefore, the possibility of a
flap here should not be ignored.
40. As far as 8/1's contacts with KUBAN, he knows no one by
true nine and his case officer will contime to use an alias in all future
contacts. At the same time, there is the ever-present danger that he may

Strekkoff is Alexander Strelkoff.

through Sinet. He is Sinet's man, and Sinet passes on work to him.
They sort of pass around girls to each other and that sort of thing.
He does, neverkheless, count for a certain amount in the magazine. He did
count, because he was considered-reasonably disinterested. That is,
he wasn't concerned very much about money. He lives very poorly, with

RECEPT/KAPOK

i
TRISHNATICH:
41. question of termination is not academic at this time, for
explicit in the letter of agreement which 3/1 signed is his termination on
1 September 1965 unless specific conditions are not. It is doubtful that
KUBAAK will indeed terminate 8/1 on that date unless such action is made
imperative for reasons of security or of gross malfeasance on his part.
42. In the event of the termination of 8/1 we faresse at this
no great cause for concern about possible repercussions against KEBARK
personel or installations. In addition to the use of alisses, RODIJAST's
meetings with his will be in third countries, and 3/1 has not been passed
classified information. He does keep in his possession materials for the
use of S/W System #64. He received training in the use of these materials
(and underwent his LCFLUTTER) & in the apartment of two LCPIPIT contrect
personnal. This apartment, an LCPIPIT safehouse, was used only once previously
for a clandestine meeting, and it will not be used again for at least two
months.
43. Should it prove necsemary to terminate 5/1 the greatest
denger which we can anticipate at this time grows out of his considerable
skill as a writer and the possibility that this skill might be used to
attack KJBHK ar QOYOVCE in some way, perhaps from the forus of the national
liberation Hoventat propaganda machinery which he has now foresaken.
knowledge of our operations and personnel has been kept to a minimm).
the danger of his pen speaking with great force or effectiveness is,
believe, not great and a problem which, though we must anticipate it,
believe to be remote.
BANK ONGRATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
44. All concerned would agree that a KUBARK agent who is
His
Hance
unable to service KÜBANK operational requirements would not be worth his
keep. At the same time, it would be presumptious to expect that in a situation
where the agunt is being handled at arm's length and under such disadvantages
in time and distance as in S/l's case, KUBARK's operational requirements
could be regularly and, if necessary, speedily masured against the agent's
capabilities and specific requirements levied on the agant.
45. So far in KEBACK's relationship with 8/1 we have outlined
a general target area for hin, levied the requirement that he prove to
KUBAAX he can effectively penetrate that target area and operate in place,
and levied susidiary KUTER requirements for him to service as a by-product
of his basic operational task. What we have assigned, in effect, is a short
tern operational mission upon which longer tern operations might be based.
46. There is evidence in the reams of "testimony" KUBARK has
tan from 8/1 that he is a ma who likes to operate, act, produce. There is
also evidence that be, like any other E, consciously seeks approval and
m
recognition of his work. The question to be posed is: Ras KUBAR at this
tims, or will it have on 1 September 1965, an assignment for 5/1 in which h
find satisfaction in producing a marketable product and find that approval
and recognition which he requires? We must be more specific with his the
to says
"Go out to Djakarta and see what you can dig up. We'll meet you
again in
in two months for discussions.” Rather, it would be well at this
stage to review with the various area divisions those geographio areas in
which 5/1's talents could be fully exploited (Chile with PUSES?, Venezuela
an m
FALN penetration?, Djakarta as an AAJA staffer?, Ghana as &. BÅÅ writer?,
Tanzania as a Government Radio editor?, etc., etc.) and to have a definite
assignment for 3/1 in hand at the moment we negotiate the extension of his
contract.

47. Certainly the sudéan change of leadership in Algeria es
expected to affect the national liberation movement and personalities in

section on ssourity, it is reasonable to assume that 8/1 will be in a less

would go over to the Western side. One day or the other he would jump.

its socialist bias and would like to see more centralization, more fon an
Egyptian model. In other words, they would like to see much more control

1. Attached are selected extracts from BAIRN reports. BAIRN
is a very sensitive SXOTH operation, and the items should be treated
accordingly.
2. Marc SCHLEIFFER (misspelled in BAIRN) is of interest. Pablo
is Pable FERNANDEZ, Cultural Attache at the Cuban Embassy in London.
Other items should be self-explanatory. On page 3 of the attachment,
"integration", where underlined, should read "segregation."
3. As with these items, London will try to bring to Head-
quarters (and other addressees') attention STEBONY-related items that
we notice. On the other hand, we do not require to be info'ed on all
STEBONY traffic in the future. We would like to see copies of all of
his intelligence reporting, whether for passage to the SMOOTHERS or not.
On that topic, we would like to recommend that a liberal policy be
followed in determining what of his stuff to pass to liaison here. Te
will be glad to review his reporting for passage, if there is doubt about
whether to pass it. We would also like to see any materials relating to
him that may have a bearing on London Station operations, relating
principally to the U.K., or relating to any of our liaison services here,
of course.

She occasionally told me about people in the ANC who might do something
for the magazine. But most of the people she told me abut were members
of the South African Communist Party. That party has taken a pro-Moscow
stand and most of its people don't want to do anything for Revolution,

He supposedly has written an article for Presence Africaine which is
violently counter-revolutionary.
He claims there is no revolution.
His position, is relatively bizarre.
•
It's not terribly justified.
But what I think is, that here is a case of Black Nationalism in the States
being transported to Cuba. What he claims is that the only Cuban revolution
that remains to be made that would be valid would be a black revolution.
and that really the population of Cuba is overwhelmingly black, or of African
descent, and that this has been a plot that has gone on for generations
even now fith Fidel Castro, particularly Dorticos, he claims, the white
leadership has been able to perpetuate itself regardless of the political
thing. This is his theme. He is interesting but extremely wild and emotional.
I think it's a case where the intoxication of Harlem never went off. Anyway
he might be worth talking to.
The Congress for Cultural Freedom people were going to try to get in
touch with him but they weren't any too convinced that his thesis was
correct. I don't think so. He claims of course that I am completely blinded
by my pro-Castro sympathies. He claimed that Williams was very unhappy for
racial reasons in Cuba. I thought that Williams was simply unhappy, He
couldn't speak Spanish. He was under pressurex from the American Communists
and Soveit Communists that didn't like him, the old Cuban Communists,
which was one of the reasons for his whole hearted turn towards Peking.
That was the only way out. And he wanted to come back to the States.

wouldn't see him at the State Department. He insisted on taking a hotel
suite, rather than do that. Certainly it wasn't an official visit but
a lot of people have gone to Washington xxx. Then it was a question
of whether the Cubans wanted money or not. The Cubans claimed,
that they asked for $3,000,000 on short term credit, just a stop-gap
and that this was turned down cold. until they made some guarantees
about American property. From that point on I think that their attitude
towards the United States was oné expecting, looking for the
the worse.
They were able to work out a few arrangements with xxfex American companies

they are not very happy with the Russians. They have managed though to

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation Malcolm X - Carlos Moore and
Sandy Bethune. (Afro-American Unity Group in Paris)
1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment is a Xerox copy of a
photostat of a transcript of a telephone conversation between Carlos
Moore (and his friend sandy Bethune) and the late Malcolm X, which
took place 8 or 9 February 1963. SUGAR obtained this transcript
on 4 June frosn the editor of the West Indian Gazette, (fnu) Manchanda.
SUGAR believes that Manchanda got the photostat from the Ghana High
Commission office in London. He further believes that the Afro-
American unity group in Paris (among whom there is only one member
with U. 5. citizenship: the American Negro photographer, John Taylor)
probably supplied the transcript to the Ghana officials as a means of
building their credentials as a bona fide revolutionary organization,
perhaps one entitled to receive financial support.
2. SUGAR gave the current (June 1965) address of Jamaican/Cuban
Carlos Moore as: c/o Pedro Filipe, 168 Rue Grenelle, Paris 7e, France.
SUGAR said that Filipe is a Cuban national.

It seems a little bit less. One of the problems is that of Cuban
immigration. There isn't in Cuba, to the best of my knowledge, a broad
anti-Americanism. Always in even in Fidel's speeches, he makes a distinction
between the American government and the American people. Than There is

ABSTRACT
°
1. Transmitted herewith is one copy of the cards that
constitute the mailing list for Revolution. These were borrowed
from Richard GIBSON and copied in the station. GIBSON's wife,
who compiled the cards and was responsible for distribution of
Revolution (and to whom, therefore, they more properly belong)
is not aware that GIBSON has "loaned" the cards out. They
were returned to GIBSON's flat the same day he brought them in
for copying.
2. We have not made any attempt to count them. There are
several thousand. A few comments will be in order about some of
the marks and notations that appear on the cards.
3. One general category is "Promotional".
-
The first
bunch of sheets about twenty, it appears - are in this category.
They are marked "Promotional" or "FR". These were sent out gratis
either to induce publicity, or to encourage new subscribers, or
to make friends happy. (Presumably, Robert WILLIAMS and several
others are in this category).
Those
4. Thereafter, the cards run in categories of one sort
or another, with given countries generally lumped together.
where the address was obviously stapled onto a card are some of
those that were taken from Frene GINWALA's Spearhead mailing list.
Some are marked "ex-Spearhead"; which means that the name came from
the Spearhead list, and the person subsequently subscribed on his
own, after a little promotional treatment.
5. The coded symbols, unfortunately, GIBSON could not
explain, since this was his wife's territory, rather than his own.
The first set of letters obviously refers to the country (e.g., UK/).
Other numbers and letters are not clear. The name that appears
apart from the name of the subscriber usually indicates who arranged
the subscription (this may be an agent, or something like a gift
subscription). For instance, S. V. LEE is Sheldon LEE, who handles

1. On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol S. KULPA, who had
contact with GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made
the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach. KULPA
felt that the GIBSON that he was hearing on the tape had indeed
changed rather radically since the last time KULPA had any contact
with him or the Revolution. KULPA remembers GIBSON as anti-white
and probably (because of this racial orientation) anti-U.S. KULPA
is therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's motivations and advises
that extreme precaution be taken in the handling of GIBSON.
2.
KULPA's view of Gibson's motivations:
KULPA has strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation
on the part of GIBSON. He recognizes the obvious monetary
motivation and feels that this probably plays a large part
in the man's being willing to talk to ODYOKE.
Another very
possible motivation is GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES.
Parenthetically, KULPA added that in Algiers and probably in
Paris, GIBSON was really nothing more than a name that VERGES
wanted on the masthead. GIBSON's primary duties as "editor"
were probably in the area of translation. In light of this
KULPA feels that perhaps some legitimate information of value
can be obtained in the area of the Revolution. Again, paren-
thetically, it might be noted that KULPA felt that GIBSON
was not as "idedistic" as his wife. Where GIBSON might adhere
to the aspects of Marxism-Leninism that called for revolutionary
change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world
in which the black man had to endure a certain amount of
discrimination), he is not a strict doctrinaire in any of
his beliefs. On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that
GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by birth--
not British) is idealistic in the sense that she feels her
brand of leftism must be internally and idealogically
consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing
for Encounter and why she probably would get upset if she
knew exactly what type of game her husband was currently
playing with ODYOKE.)

2. We have not yet had time to review the tape of your first
session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to
get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February.
The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable know-
ledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out
his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear
that, if given the opportunity, Subject will take the bit in his
teeth and as much money as he can in his hot little hands and be
off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that the
debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis.
would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of
Agreement contract for Subject's signature before getting started,
making sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKE's obligations
and promises are limited to the terms specifically enumerated in the
document. We think that any meaningful debriefing will take 3 - 5
days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have
* information of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of
Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long range operational
relationship with Subject. While we look at the debriefing as
basically a one-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up
questions and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later
contact. Therefore, the communication 'channel to Subject should be
left open on a "don't call us, we'll call you” basis.

the clandestine publication of a major pro-Chinese Spanish Communist
group called the Partido Comunista Revolucionario. In view of recent
reports that the MCR group may merge with one or more of the other
dissident Spanish Communist groups and that a joint organ will be
published, MOP may soon cease (or may already have ceased) publication.
What role ANDERSSON may play in new publication efforts of the pro-
Chinese Spanish dissidents is not known.
The clandestine leadership of the Partido Comunista Revolucionario
has been located in Lausanne, Switzerland, with some representation also
in Faris, but this group has apparently been receiving Chinese financial
assistance through the GRIPPA party in Belgium. Another mo-Chinese
Spanish group in Switzerland, the (posicion Revolucionario Comunista
located in Geneva, has been publishing La Chisna. The Chisca group
has reportedly been receiving funds from the Chinese Embassy in Bern.
Still another pro-Chinese Spanish group, the Agrupacion Comunista
Proletario, has been publishing Proletario, apparently from Paris but
with some representation also reported in Belgium. While the group
has apparently had some contact with GRIFFA in Felgium, the Paris-based
group at one time at least appeared to be sponsored or aided by VERGES.
CRIFFA has played an active role in trying to bring the different
Spanish dissident groups to a merger.)
The relationship between GRIPPA and ANDERSSON, GRIPPA and VERGES,
and VERGES and ANDERSSON is anything but clear. Some part of the
confusion may result from GRIPPA's driving efforts to function as the
director of Chinese political operations in Europe, and to try to bring
the activities of others under his control.
a. GRIPPA was once reported to have said he had "lost
confidence" in Revolution. Azong his reported reasons was a
belief that VERGES wanted to be designated absolute leader in
Europe for the "revolutionary movement." Somewhat later GRIPFA
was reported as saying that the Chinese were no longer subsidizing
Revolution and that it was now being backed by Paris editor
Francois MASPERO.
b. GRIFFA or his aides also appear to have been responsible
for stories circulating among some pro-Chinese European dissidents
that ANDERSSC had been written off by the Chinese as a "Trotskyite."
GRIFPA has also been quoted as saying that the printing of MER
would be transferred from Lausanne to Belgium and to GRIFPA's oum
publishing facility. (This is not known to have taken place.)
c. There have been reports, unexplained, that there is bad
blood between VERGES and AKDERSSON.

3. In line with the need to put the debriefing on a businesslike
(rather than a "flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start
by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the
time of his first entry into leftist political movements to the
present day. (This can be presented to Subject as a basis for us
to formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal
"confession" on his part.) In addition to providing us with a
check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefing
conducted on KUBARK's terms, not Subject's. It is important that
it be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want facts,
not
speculation, commentary and analysis.
-
4. Please charge payments to Subject for the debriefing to
Acct. Nr. 5137 1468 (Hqs. LCHARVEST OOA). Three hundred dollars
for the initial 2 hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.
We were thinking in terms of $700 for five days debriefing with a
bonus for a copy of the Revolution mailing list.

Hils ANDERSSON, Swedish-born resident of Switzerland, heads a
printing and publishing establishment ("Editions la Cite") in Lausanne,
said to have been set up in 1957 for the printing and distributing of
Chinese literature. (This ties in with other information that the firm
vas established in Switzerland during the Algerian var in order to
publish printed matter banned in France.) Since 1963 the firm had been
responsible for the English-language edition of Revolution, but in 1964
the printing of the English-language edition was transferred to Paris
where Revolution's main office is located. Swiss authorities had ordered
ANDERSSON to cease publication of Revolution.
Revolution has had a complicated history. It is descended from
African Revolution which first appeared in early 1963) in Algeria. Its
editor, Jacques VERGES, is a former member of the French CP who broke
with that party over the Algerian question. After YERGES, who briefly
headed African Revolution, had a falling out with Algerian officials
later in 1963, and left that country, he began a new publication in
Switzerland using the facilities of the already established ANBERSSCH
firm. His new publication was called Revolution, sometimes known as
Revolution isia, Latin America, Africa. (The Algerians continue to
þublish African Revolution, which has no known connection with Revolution.)
Initially both the English and French editions of Revolution were handled
by ANDERSSON's firm, but the publishing operations of the French edition
vere very soon moved to Paris. Later the crinting, too, of the French
edition was moved to Paris and only the English edition continued to be
printed in Switzerland. VERGES and the main offices ware located in Paris.
Currently ANDERSSON is reported to publish Octobre, which is
described as the organ of an organization in Switzerland called the
"Centre Lenine." Both Octobre and the Centre Lenine are said to be con-
trolled by ANDERSSON, but very little information is available about either.
The Centre has been described as a prepaganda arm of the Chinese Communists.
There is some indication that they also have some connection with pro-
Chinese dissident elements of the Spanish CP.
ANDERSSON's firm has also printed Mundo Obrero Revolucionario (MOR),
Although the English edition was crinted in Switzerland, its editorial
office was also in Paris, headed by Richard GIBSON, Szerican negro. In
late May and early June 1964 - when it was already apparent that Suiss
authorities were going to close down the printing of Revolution in that
country _ GIBSON and Alexandre STRELICFF went to The Netherlands seeking
a firm there to print and distribute the English-language edition. It is
not known why this effort was made instead of transferring the printing
directly to Paris as was ultimately done.

Talked to Cy Goodrich this morning about STERONY. He feels that he is on the
level with us, that he is legitimately disenchanted with the far left, that he
sees himself as a loyal American, that YATZENBACH was incorrect in saping that
STEBONY would find it morally repugnant to act as a political action agent but
would willingly serve as an FI collection asset (which doesn't make a whole lot
of sense.) STESCNY was not in the least reluctant to take the LOFLITTER, passed
it apparently clean. The cover is admittedly a bit linsey, but is supplemented
_by_a connection with Tunisian L'iction for which he will do some layout-work and-
ST
writing. Cy believes that he understands perhaps better than he did the need
for cover and attribution of income. Contract provides for $500 a month plus
$100 non-accountable ops expenses plus $10 a day while in Algiers, plus $20
a day while in travel status, 1 June through 31 August, renewable for a two
year priod if mutually desirable and satisfactory, with 30 day termination
clause. We have told JH JAGUAR” of our recruitment of STEBCNY Cy does not
believe that they are in direct touch with him, but that they are in contact
with friends of his, particularly one PHARCHANY? or some such name. I asked
Cy what STEBONY had been asked to do for us in Algiers, and he replied " to work
himself into a position of access to get information on factions and all
developments in the conferences which have not been publicized." I asked if he
had been given any requirements which dealt with strictly Algerian matters and
he said No, that Rodigast had been told that we would send further requirements
for the meeting tentatively scheduled with STEBCNY in Rome or Tangier around
18 June.
-
I talked to Bob Wiley, who will draw up a list of requirements to send HODIGAST:
Cy Goodrich and I agreed that I would open ops-files on STEBONY, even though
we have no project yet, and he will give me the contents of his soft file to
include in it. He is also having the 20 file tidied up by RI and will have it

ABSTRACT
RESONATE CECROFILM
1. Transmitted herewith are copies of JAGUAR's latest report on Richard
Thomas GIBSON, which they compiled for us on being informed of our current
operational interest in him. We expect that further information will be
forthcoming since, as previously noted, they have instituted additional
coverage of GIBSON's activities.
2. JAGUAR refer us to their previous reporting on GIBSON, which has
been contained in their reports on Revolution. These include CEL-36, 105 (29
August 1963); OELA-40,542(15 April 1964); CALA-41,545 (10 September 1964);
OBL-39,251(24 September 1964); CELA-4:,788 (20 Cctober 1964).
3. JAGUAR also point out that the paper contains information received
from a number of secret sources, and they request that we not give it any
distribution beyond KUBARK without consulting them, unless, of course, we
have the information from other sources. JAGUAR have made a copy available
to ODENVY London.
4. JAGUAR also informed us orally that the persons they suspect to have
played a most prominent role in the 1963 charges of GIBSON's CIA affiliation
the two persons referred to in para 3 of their paper - were Rosalynd AINSLIE
and Patricia McGOWAN. JAGUAR gave us this information informally and off the
record. It is interesting to note that, in Ref, GIBSON agreed that AIFSLIB
was one but made no mention of MOGOWAN.
5. GIBSCH spoke of the affair of JAGUAR's para 3 (a) at some length,
giving a rather different interpretation, however. Paras 3 (b), (c), and (d)
are rather more speculative.
6. JAGUAR also told us, informally, that some of their information on
The
GIBSON, as contained herein, derives from some of his correspondence.
implication is not that JAGUAR has been reading GIBSON's mail, but that, by
intercepts or penetrations, they have been reading the mail of some of the

STORET
Richard Thomas GIBSON
Born: Los Angeles on 13.5.34
Address: 30, Stockleigh Hall,
Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8.
GIBSON has been connected with the pro-Chinese Communist publication
"Revolution" and its predecessor, "African Revolution", at least since
April, 1963. He made available the following information about himself as
part of a publicity campaign planned for "African Revolution" in the first
half of 1963:-
2.
1951-52:
1955-58:
1958:
1959-60:
worked in Rome for the Mediterranean News
Bureau of the "Christian Science Monitor";
editor with the English language service of
"Agence France Presse" in Paris;
arrested by the French authorities because of
his work for the Algerian National Liberation
Front;
returned to the U.S.A. and employed by the
C.B.S. News in New York until dismissed because
of his pro-Cuban activities;
awarded a C.B.S. fellowship in African Studies
at Columbia University;
1960-September, 1962: Executive Secretary of the "Fair Play for Cuba"
Committee in the U.S.A.
In 1963, GIBSON lived in Lausanne, where "African Revolution" and
subsequently the English edition of "Revolution" were printed, but he paid
frequent visits to "Revolution's" Paris office until the end of the year
when "Revolution" was banned in Switzerland and he was refused permission to
continue to live there. He then settled in Paris where, according to one
report, he and his wife lived in "quite a luxurious flat". It would, however,
be wrong to infer from this that GIBSON's means enabled him to enjoy high
living standards, as another source subsequently reported that he had not
paid any rent for the flat from May to October, 1964
30 As far back as August, 1963, there were rumours in Communist circles in
London that GIBSON was an American agent and that he had provided United
States Intelligence with the names of certain unidentified United States
Information
negroes in accordance with a brief received from the Americans.
from a well-placed source suggests that these rumours may have originated
from the jealous reactions of two persons, connected with "Revolution", whose
aspirations with the publication were cut short when GIBSON became Editor
of the English edition. However, by mid-1964, VERGES, the Editorial Director
of "Revolution", was claiming that complaints about GIBS...'s activities had
been received not only from London, but also from Cuba, American negroes in
New York and a relative of GIESON's who was working for the magazine "Spark"
in Ghana. As a result, GIBSON was dismissed from the editorial staff of
"Revolution". Charges made against him include the following-

denouncing, in 1958, an unidentified negro, possibly a
Communist, who was expelled from France;
informing the publication's contacts in China that
"Revolution" was disintegrating;
providing "Newsweek" and the "New York Herald Tribune"
with information in an attempt to discredit "Revolution";
connections with the C.I.A.
Although GIBSON has denied the charges made against him, he realises that
they have stuck and that it will be some years before he will be acceptable
to any left wing organisation.

Having failed to find employment in Paris after leaving "Revolution"
in July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdom on 7th October and was
joined later by his British wife, Joy Marjorie, and his two children. He
hoped to find work in London, but at the end of November, he was still
without a job and dependent on his wife's family, who were paying the rent
of his flat at 30, Stockleigh Hall, Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8. It
is now known whether GIBSON has been able to find employment.
5. Nothing is known at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United
Kingdom. Although during the time he worked for "Revolution" he was in
touch with members of the pro-Chinese Communist splinter group in the
United Kingdom - the Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity -
it is not known whether he has resumed contact. It has been reported that
he still keeps in touch with the coloured South African journalist, Lionel
NORRISON, who is employed by the Chinese-backed Afro-Asian Journalists'
Association (A.A.J.A.) in Djakarta.
Comment:
Para. 5:
"Afro-Asian Journalist", no. 4, dated
July, 1964, and published by the A.A.J.A.,
contains an article "Two Revolutionary
Journals" by NORRISON, the journals being
"Revolution" and "Spark".

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM

ACCOM
PLISHED
1. Attached is the tape of the interview with GIBSON, recorded in an
Embassy office, using a Uher 4000 Report - 5 recorder, recording at a speed
of 15/16 feet per minute. The interviewer used the alias of Earl Wilson.
Gibson arrived at 1745 and departed at about 2030.
2. We are not attempting to summarize or analyze GIBSON's comments in
this dispatch. The tape provides a much more revealing picture than our
subjective comments could. ▲ for notes, however, appear to be in order.
3. Speaking of his departure, GIBSON said he planned to leave London
on 24 or 25 January. As of noon 24 January, at least, he was still in London
because I saw him walking on St. John's Wood High Street. (A potential
problem exists heres GIBSON and I live within a few blocks of one another
and not infrequently ride the same bus line. This problem can only be met
when it manifests itself.) JAGUAR, incidentally, has alerted its immigration
contacts (prior to our meeting with GIBSCN) and requested that his name be
put on a watch list. They said that they would inform us if they learn that
he has left the country. We have not yet heard that he has left.)
4. GIBSON was given money amounting to $300. Under the circumstances
of his plans, as he expressed them, it seemed reasonable to do so, to ensure,
at least partially, that he would come back to talk more. He was more than
willing to take the money and raised the initial suggestion of $200 to $300
or $400. His obvious shift in his line regarding dollars (as opposed to
pounds) is further indicative of his willingness to get what he could.
5. The considerable number of names mentioned by GIBSON makes the
transoription of the notes a sizable chore, and in order to lessen this
burden a listing has been compiled of almost all of the names, in the order
in which they appear in the tape, with the exception of VERGES and the Free
Play for Cuba Committes, CBS and a few others. The names appear only one
time each on the list, although many of them crop up repeatedly in the tape.

1. Por the Information of CO2, Brussels: ALTESK and EUSOLP are jointly
engaged in the operational exploitation of the peculiar talents and contacts
of a newly-acquired asset. STERONY/1 (Iden B) STERONY/1 has had a rather
turbulent career as a leftist revolutionary agitator and propagandist over
the past several years during which time he came to know (and te knoim by)
mmber of significant personalities in the pro-Chinese factions of several
Buropean Comamist Parties. Among these personalities is iden A. STEBONY/1
has been denounced within these same circles as & KUBARK agent for some time,
theaigh until January of this year FUBARE vas not in contact with him It
wna only early Jume of this year that re notually signed a letter of agree
ment with an "ODYOR Service". Currently STEBONY/1 is in Algeria seeking
to re-establish himself in revolutionary circles as a prelude to a long-
teru penetration operation (at KUBARX's behest) targeted against the revolu
tionary cadres of Africa. Asia and Latin America which are apparently being
given increasingly direct support by Peking.
2. One of STABONY/1's bona fides in revolutionary circles is his
acquaintance with Iden A who has told him that. personally, he does not
ažare the doubts spread about STEBCHY/1 because, as Iden A parts it.
STBHY/l'a primary accuser not caly charges he is a KUBA50 agent but also
Iden A agent, which Iden A of course knew not to be the case Fiowever,
STYDMY/1 is actually in the process of seeking to ingratiate himself with
Iden à end of winning his confidence to such an extent that their personal
relationship might serve as STEBOWY/1's credentials for some time to come
At present the relationship shows signs of being off to a good start.
STEGONY/1 visited Iden A in Brussels on y June 1965 with the intention of
getting himself accredited as a correspondent of Iden A's newspaper, Iden C.
Idan A told him that, in fact. Iden was sending Iden to Algiers to cover

A few of the phrases that do not appear too clearly on the tape are included
on the list. Occasionally the names are written phonetically, indicated by
(ph.).
6. GIBSON's offer of a photograph of VERGES was not accepted, on the
assumption that KUBARK already has a photo. If this is not the case, let
us know, and we will include that in our requirements for a subsequent meeting.

of 12 January 1965.)
8. The reference to the Cultural Attache of the Cuban Embassy corroborates
(rather, is corroborated by) the material referred to in para 4 of LOND 5337
(22 December 1965). We are not fully aware of the Cuban's political orientation,
however,
9. In reviewing the tape, it will become apparent that the arrangements
with GIBSON were left fairly flexible for the future. It would appear, from
his responses, that a longer range relationship with him could, in fact, be
established if, after thorough review of his materials, that seems necessary
or desirable.
10. We will expect, in addition to the requirements that have been
promised, that Headquarters will advise us on their desire to arrange for the
one-shot approach previously suggested by Headquarters, or a different ar-
rangement. We are unable to assess the validity or worth of all the comments
he made. Our impression, however, is that he is reasonably knowledgeable of
a number of fields of interest to us. We also suspect that in some areas his
knowledge is quite superficial. His access to various areas of potential
interest may be partially proved by his trip around Europe and should be a
useful indication of how we may be interested in playing him. The possibility
of his being a provocation has not been overlooked, of course, and we welcome
Headquarters' comments on this score as well.
11. We would also appreciate further comments on various personalities,
with whom we are not familiar - "Anderson" is the most obvious in this category.
12. Headquarters is requested to provide us with a transcription of this
tape, as well as the promised requirements, prior to 15 February. ODENVY
should also be provided with as much of the material as is of interest to them,
and a copy of that material should be given to us to pass to the ODENVY office
here. We are also obliged to pass to JAGUAR such elements of this material as
is of legitimate concern to them. In this case, we would suggest that this be
interpreted rather liberally and Headquarters-prepared copy be forwarded along
with the other items listed above. (Note that JAGUAR has been quite cooperative
while we have been approaching this case, and their recent run-down on GIBSON is
being pouched almost simultaneously with this dispatch.)

REFERENCE:
NOTE:
PARI 8052
The following round-up and commentary on Iden A had been drafted
before PALP 3017 of 6 January 1965 and later traffic presented the
case in a somewhat different light. He forward the following anyway,
as some of the background and suggestions still seem pertinent.
Several questions raised below have now been resolved, notably the alleg-
ation of an Iden A/KUBARK link (explained by the ODEVY letter of 1
December 1964, not available when the following was written). Copies
of recent PALP correspondence on Iden A, passed to us on 13 January
1965, are attached as Attachment 3, USC.
1. Upon receiving the memorandum cited in the reference, we requested
Jurther details from U.MOUD, stressing our interest in the report that CPUSA
nembers had given IDEN C documents which showed IDEA belonged to "the services
of KUBARK". D/5986 of 30 December 1964, UNBOUND's answer to our query, merely
reiterates that the UNBOUND source, a good one, based the report on a "commRIÍ—
cation of documents" by American Communists to DIN C, which supposedly
established that IDEN A belonged to KUBARK; UNBOUND states that the source is
not in a position to identify the persons in question. UNBOUND's reply suggests
the information might have come from an audio operation; we might mention here
that IDER A has appeared occasionally on UNPAY, but never in an informative
way. A mail intercept might also be the source of UNBOUND's report, or it
may have come from a third service (conceivably JAGUAR or SOTH).
2.
Our continuing preoccupation with the IDEN A question is three-fold:
(a) his expulsion from IDEM B (and thus from acceptance by pro-Peiping groups)
opens the door for his possible recruitment; (b) we would like to determine
whether his ouster was engineered by personal enemies or whether he actually
did work for an intelligence service, and which one; (c) as Peiping regards
the USA as its primary target, the Chinese can be expected to continue prop-
aganda attacks designed to create IDEN D tension and inflame the Afro/Asians

against the U.S.A. While domestic effects of such propaganda are properly
handled by ODEVY, the manipulation of IDER Ds to further Chinese propaganda
abroad becomes KUBANK's concern.
3. ZUBARK's recruitment of IDE: A, or establishment of controlled access
to him, could be extremely useful in countering attempts to undermine the USA
with tin his simés a TRIÍ á pizsumably still has a reasonably up-to-date idea
of IDEN B plans in this regard, and he must know the names and locations of
many persons involved. The most effective approach to IDER A would probably
be through an offer of money (his history indicates venality, and at present he
appears to be in financial difficulties), and by stressing his chance to get
even with IDEN C. The purity of IDEN A's Communism is open to question and
should not impede recruitment; a more formidable obstacle to a successful
operation is his possible connection with a foreign intelligence service.
This could be a Restern service but might also be the Soviets, for whom he
would serve the dual purpose of causing trouble for the USA and at the save
time reporting on the Chinese propaganda machine; it is a matter of record
that the Soviets view IDE: 3 seriously. Whatever the basis for a BARA
approach to IDM A, it would require careful security planning, taking
cognizance of his instability and his known attitude toward CDYOKE as an IDEI D.
4. "Revolution" has featured articles by three American Negroes, Richard
GIBSON, Robert Franklyn WILLIAMS, and Malcolm X, all obviously intended to
prejudice readers against the USA on ground of racial injustice. All three
men are or have been involved with foreign Communists: GIBSCH and WILLIAMS
with the Chinese and the Cubans, notably, and Malcolm Ä with the Chinese and
various African Communists (actual or crypto). The "New York Herald Tribune"
of 4 January 1965 reported Malcolm's statement that he hopes to "internationalize"
the American Negro problem, and that he claims to have influenced severai
African governments to make representations in the U.H. against the USA's
treatment of its Negroes. This may be a foretaste of Chinese plans for foreim
exploitation of this issue; Malcolm was interviewed by "Revolution" in Cairo,
which has since proved its enthusiastic anti-Americanism.
5. OFP-14693 reports that Philip BART, a pro-Soviet official of the CPUSA,
stated in December 1964 that the CPUSA has positive proof that four members of
their Chinese faction are being paid by the Chinese Commists. (It is perhaps
relevant to wote here that the advent of "Revolution" was hailed by letters to
the Editor from American leftists, including the FPCC; according to OFP-37875,
Vincent T. LEE of "All Worlds Publications" in New York City takes subscriptions
for Revolution"). It is hard to say where IDEA enters into the clouded
picture of American Communist partisanship in the Sino/Soviet rift, but in
view of his shifting allegiances he may have divulged to pro-Soviet CPUSĂ
members, or to the Soviets themselves, information on Chinese subversion in
the USA. The October 1964 issue of "Hammer & Steel Newsletter" is cited by
the Radio Free Europe research bulletin of November 1964 in the latter's review
of pro-Chinese factions among Western Commmist Parties; E research describes
"Hammer & Steel" as a monthly produced in Boston by a small American faction.
(Portions of the RFE research bulletin with its citations from "Hammer & Steel"
are attached as Attachment 1). The marked paragraph from "Hammer & Steel" hits
at the idea of white nations' inherent superiority; this is consistent with
China's claim of a bond among the colored peoples of the world, which permits
such effective anti-Soviet propaganda as the cover of "Revolution" for May 1964,
which shows KHRUSHCHEV saying, "We, the whites...".
6. IDEN C's denunciation of IDEN A may have been at least partially
caused by suspicion he was trying to gain control of IDEN E; it will be
recalled that very shortly before his ouster, IDEN A was in Holland negotiating
for that type of printing equipment (MAGU 6137 and OHA 28818). He is now
living in London; he has presumably been obliged to find work there (unless
he actually is on an intelligence payroll), and he may have landed with some
leftist publishing outfit or even with the CPUK, which is sufficiently divided
to afford room for his current views, whatever they may be. In addition to
IDEN A's potential for reporting on Chinese propaganda efforts, his uses as a
penetration of British or other European Communist publishing circles are obvious

UNBOUND reported that American Communists had allegedly given
IDEN C documents showing IDEN A worked for KUBANK. One explanation of this
allegation may lie in IDEN A's visit to the American Embassy, Paris, in late
1963, at the request of Mr. John G. COSSETT, then Acting Consul General.
GOSSETT was interested in any information ne might have on possible connections
between IDEN F, with which IDEN A had been connected, and President Kennedy's
assassination. (à copy of GOSSETT's Memorandum of Conversation is attached
under separate cover as Attachment 2; his appraisals of IDEA and his
reservations concerning his motives are interesting). IDEN A and GOSSETT
had a far-ranging talk, including what may have been a tentative feeler by
IDEN À for ODYOKE employment. It seems likely that IDEN À would have reported
an American Embassy inquiry to his friends in IDEX F, and he may even have
mentioned the possibility of future "work" for ODYOKE, which could have led

course speculation, but IDEN A's flexible loyalties and liking for money are
surely known to his colleagues, and, if he had already aroused antagonism
among them, the Embassy visit would serve as a peg for sincere or expedient
denunciation.

in OELA 39346, which states she "appears to be" IDEN A's wife. According to
OEL 39251 of September
ODENVY Paris, however, IDEN A is married to IDEN J.
1964 reported that WEN A and his wife (unnamed) had successfully sued IDES B
for salary arrears; the fact that the wife was also employed recalls the

One of the most violent reactions came from the heart-
land of capitalism, from the small American faction which pre-
duces the monthly Hammer & Steel Newsletter in Boston. The
October issue of the mimeographed bulletin vengefully gives a
list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell -- each one a vin-
dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush-
chev but basic Soviet policies such as "the distortion of
peaceful coexistence.” Points 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illus-
trations:
1.

2. "His German policy Khrushchev sought to ingratiate
himself with West Germany. He was obviously ready
to sell out the German Democratic Republic...
3. The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social-
ist countries and the Communist Parties. The pro-
posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference
of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve
U.S. imperialist aggression against the national lib-
eration struggles. For example, Asian supporters of
Khrushchev could have gathered in a telephone booth.
8. The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev
had maintained that nuclear power was the exclusive
responsibility of revisionists and imperialists
of white nations. Khrushchev's great power chauvin-
ism was blown sky high in Sinkiang Province.
Although there is no evidence that the politically insig-
nificant Hammer & Steel group enjoys any direct support from
the Chinese (as the Russians alleged in their "Open Letter"
of July 14, 1963), it has always offered its allegiance to
This is expressed again in
Peking in the most extreme form.
the claim that "Khrushchev's failure to recognize the contra-
diction between the oppressed peoples and imperialism as the
focal contradiction of our time resulted in blindness concern-
ing the leading role of the Chinese Party."8 This is a claim
that the Chinese themselves would not want to make, expecially
at this juncture.

26th May, Cont.
16.40 hours: Mrs. Sarah GIBSON (ph), of the Press Department,
Tunisian. Embassy, calls Cuban Embassy, explains to Marge that
she wants Pablo to send, as previously discussed, some copies
of "Revolucion Pueblo y Cultura" and "Lunes de Revolucion",
either just on temporary loan, or if some copies can be spared,
for retention by the Tunisian Embassy. The Press Secretary in
the Tunisian Exbassy is on the point of leaving to go back to
TUNIS (going on 25th May) and before doing so, he very much
wants to have a look at those papers. Marge promises to
arrange this matter with Pablo, for delivery of copies to the
Press Department, Tunisian Embassy, 29 Prince's Gate. Sarah
GIBSON asks for delivery today if possible, if not, the
following morning.
16.50 hours: Pablo calls Mrs GIBSON at XII 4133 on Christian
name terms, asks how her husband, Dick, and the children are,
confirms that he will let her have some copies of "Quega" (ph)
given to him by a Cuban in LONDON, also "Pueblo y Cultura",
but has no copies of "Revolucion". Confirms he will come to
Sarah's house on Saturday afternoon (29th May) with Maruja and
the children i? it is fine, but be will come anyhow, as be
wants to have a talk with Sarah. The GIBSON's home number is
PRI 8776. Sarah remarks that the Tunisian Press Secretary is
being sent back to Tunisia to take charge of a newspaper,
and
he has been most impressed by the Cuban layout in their publi-
cations. He needs the copies to give him ideas for his om
work, and Sarah wants the influence to be Cuban.

ABSTRACT
MICROFIL
Ref: LOND 8101
1. Following is the full text of the JAGUAR letter, a part of
which was transmitted under ref:
"We have received the following two items of intelligence
about S/1:
1. Some time in May this year, S/1 said that he would
be going to Tunisia on 15th June to work on the staff of the
paper "L'Action."
2. After his quarrel with Jacques VERGES in 1964, S/1
received £200 as "personal financial assistance" from Jacques
GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese Communist faction in
Belgium. Hils ANDERSSON also gave him financial help.
Our sources were not able to say when the financial assistance
was given to S/1 but presumably that from GRIPPA was made
available some time between July and November last year.
H
2. S/1 reported to Station in May that he had had an offer of
a job on L'Action, but there was no intention of his accepting it.
3. London has some doubts about whether S/1 in fact received this
much money from GRIPPA. We suspect that he has told people this to enhance
his stature as a "Chinese agent"; we still wonder, though, what funds he
may have been covering this way, since we had not contacted him as of the
time in question. Perhaps, as a result of ref, LCFIPIT may shed some
light on this point.

CONTACT
;
1. IF SUBJECT HAS BEEN USED OR CONTACTED BEFORE, INDICATE ACTIVITY IN WHICH HE HAS ENGAGED AND THE TYPE OF INFOR
MATION HE HAS FUNNISHED.
In December 1963 Subj. was interviewed by a consulate officer in Paris for
information on Lee Harvey Oswald, who reportedly had some contact with the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. Subj. was completely co-operative and the interviewer
suggested follow-up, but the contact was dropped.
2. INDICATE HOW AND FROM NOW SUBJECT OBTAINS INFORMATION.
Subj. elicits information from his broad circle of friends and acquaintances
in the Afro-Asian/liberation movement areas.
3. INDICATE WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD SUBJECT AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF INFORMATION HE FURNISHES,
Nothing
?
DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED Ft OR CE TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
Subject will operate under free lance journalist cover to develop contacts
in the target milieu of Afro-Asian "Anti-imperialist" activity and solicit informa-
tion from them on their activity, plans and views. It is possible that such
contacts may lead to a possibility of employment or association with some organ-
ization in this field, but whether or not he will be instructed to accept will
depend on the specific nature of the job and similar factors which cannot be
anticipated now.
DETAIL SUBJECT'S PROPOSED PP.PM TYPE USE OR DUTIES.
No PM duties or use is anticipated. No systematic CA exploitation is
anticipated given the risk of compromise. Selective CA exploitation within his cover
situation - i.e. as a provacateur or means to surface anti-Soviet material
from a "National Liberation" standpoint - will be continually possible.

ABSTRACT
12:020FILM
Transmitted herewith are copies (one for KUDESK, one for LCPIFIT)
of the processed material resulting from the initial series of debriefings
of STEBONY/1. Again London Station is indebted to Roberta L. ECRRELL for
her superb work in preparing this excellent study.
2. We have made most of this zaterial available to JAGUAR. The
•sections headed "Interest of Foreign Communist and Leftist Groups in the
American Negro Froblen, "The Robert Williams Cace," "Black Kationalism,"
and "The American Negro" were not passed to JAGUAR.
3. No are retaining one copy of the entire study, which we are
making available for review by ODEVY/London, who have expressed interest
in this material. We trust that ODEVY Headquarters will be appropriately
advised of the contents of these papers.
4. We see no reason for Lordon Station to retain this copy in the
files, and propose to destroy it unless Headquarters asks us to send it on to
some other addressee. Similarly, we plan to destroy our copy of the rougă
transcript of the debriefing (previously forwarded under OELA 42,706, 9 March
1965) unless Headquarters would like us to send it on. In either case, let us
know of your wishes regarding these items by, say, 15 July. In the absence
of any instructions by that time, we will destroy them.

5. EVALUATE SUBJECT'S CHARACTER. RELIABILITY AND SECURITY, CITING EVIDENCE WHERE POSSIBLE.
Subject is a rather cynical intellectual. He has a keen sense of what is in his
best interest, however, and there is xxx every reason to believe that he considere a
reliable and secure performance for KUBARK to be in his best interest. He showed
a good sense of security in communications during his recruitment period. LCFLUTTER
examination 13 June 1965 revealed no deception by Subject.
EXPLAIN ANY SITUATION OR INDISCRETION IN WHICH SUBJECT MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WHICH MUST BE EVALUATED FROM
CE/OPERATIONAL SECURITY VIEWPOINT.
While working for AFP in Paris (1958) Subject forged the signature of a personal
enemy, Ollie Harrington, to a letter to the editor calculated to get Harrington in
trouble with French authorities. Subject ahsamed of this action.
SECTION XII

sexual affairs, but in a discreet manner.

"According to a secret and reliable source, STEBONY/1 has stated
that he is working for the Belgian newspaper 'La Voix du Peuple'.
He will be leaving London shortly for the Continent and will later
be going to Algiers. He has told his friends that his job with

1. In the course of an informal discussion on 8 June with the JAGUAR
officer most familiar with the history of STEBONY/1 (and our relationship
with him), the JAGUAR officer commented that he was frankly surprised at
the volume of sexual activity of the African Communists and far-leftists.
His first reference was to types such as Jeanne PYNCR, but he broadened
the comment to include Rosalynde AINSLIE and others, and of course there
were the recipients of these girls' affections as well Africans (usually
black) such as Kenyatta and Babu.
-
2. The JAGUAR officer then added that S/1's wife was also known to
have shared her favors with other black men than S/1 - to such an extent,
at any rate, that her promiscuity had come to JAGUAR's notice. (I mentioned
that this must be some new news, sinos we had not heard of it before, but
he indicated that this was old news, and apparently not of the type to be
considered "derogatory.") The JAGUAR officer want on to say that S/1 him--
Belf has put in a certain amount of time in the beds of other white girls,
and perhaps this is how he knows of the promiscuous propensities of some
of them.
3. While S/1 has not particularly affected prudery in our talks, neither
has he professed himself to be a great and universal lover.

able to provide a great deal of information despite his having
been pushed aside from active and direct participation in recent
months.
Based on the foregoing, the best ploy for getting at Subject might
be a telephone call to his place of work with the caller using a gover
pretext for meeting him alone and deferring all detailed questions to such
a meeting on the grounds of not vanting to discuss these over the telephone.
If this gets Subject out, then COVERDALE could apologize for the minor
deception while explaining that it was required by reason of his not wanting
to cause Subject embarasament or injury in the course of contacting him.
Good hunting.
3. It may be possible for STEBCNY/1 to contact Subject during his visit
to Paris 11 - 17 June. If COVERDALE would like to get a more current
reading on Subject, please get in touch with Eufus F. KODICAST, who will be
meeting 5/1 on 12 June.

Dear Colleague,
We have received the various copies of REVOLUTION, which we
heartily thark you for.
Your letter was ver encouraging, and we have noted the contents.
We share your ideals, and are thoroughly convinced that our struggle
against the forces of reaction will still further advance, and
triumph.
We will bear in mind your request for articles etc., and will
do all in our efforts to help.
REVOLUTION plays an important part in our revolutionary
struggle against inperialism and colonialism in all its forms and
manifestations, and as such we would like to help in the further
distribution of REVOLUTION. We are widely distributing it in Indo-
nesia, and hope to do the same in South East Asia as well. It addition,
because of the foreign exchange problem, we will rather give you
names of other interested persons outside Indonesia to whom you can
send sample copies. Or we could do that if you so desire. Please
let us know! A little note to the effect that we will distribute
and wherever possible in South East collect articles for you, in
REVOLUTION will be welcomed and facilitate matters.
We are printing initially 6.000 English copies of the 'the
Afro-Asian Journalist', and hope to have an extra 4.000 in French
ready soon.
We will dispatch 50 copies of the Afro-Asian Journalist' to
you, under seperate muber immediately -(one we will send airmail).
If you would like more please do not hesitate to contact us.
Can you also send us some more French copies of REVOLUTION,
if possible, as well as some posters.
Dear Colleague, our struggle is gairing momentum and the
forces of reaction manifested in colonialism and imperialism in
all its forms and manifestations are on the retreat. Our very close
co-operation will further help in destroying colorialism and im-
perialism, which is the curse of all makind.

4. Turnover to Rodigast. After getting S/1's unhesitating agreement
to an LCFLUTTER examination and his signature on a Secrecy Agreement
on 2 June, Tiffany introduced him to Rodigast, under the alias
"Paul Weller" on the morning of 3 June. It was explained that Rodigast
would serve as S/1 point of contact in the future. S/1 and Rodigast
hit it off well from the outset, the latter's knowledge of Paris and
Tangiers-based American beatniks and other intellectuals serving him
has laid
well in the rapport-building process. Rodigast fübolag on firm
meeting arrangements for Paris and has discussed arrangements for
meeting 5/1 at least twice during the summer outside Algiers. Final
agreement on a mid July meeting will be made in Paris to conform to a normal
pattern by S/1 and
Ex argangenents which S/1 succeeds in developing in Lausanne and
Paris. In the process of discussing comunications Rodigast is also
imparting instruction in goed security practices on the part of S/1.
Rodigast will instruct S/1 in the use of SW in Paris. Hopefully,
Rodigast will be able to spend a day or two with S/1 in Paris, even
though we want S/1 to get to Algiers as soon as possible.

5. Financial Arrangements. After discussing all possible alternatives,
it was decided that the most secure arrangement would be to give S/1
an advance of the equivalent of $200 for his-travel London-Brussels-
Lausanne- Paris and per diem and his an advance of the equivalent of
$600 for his June salary plus non-accountable expenses. These advances
were made and signed for on 3 June. One waxen important reason for
the large cash advance was the fact that S/1 iXzEmmntiɣ was completely
ix=
broke, and he had to pake some funds available to his wife to meet
expenses and pay off a 65 pound Sterling debt to his brother-in-law before
leaving on his trip. (5/1 will explain the funds as the last of the
advances and payments for articles by Encounter and other publications.)
For essentially the same reason (poverty) we agreed to make S/1's July.
and August salary payments in advance (to be paid into his Swiss bank
account on the first of each month). We recognize that this procedure is

cover arrangement in the U.S. Around 28 May he received word
from New York of a flat turn-down on his offer to serve as
correspondent for Monthly Review. Maro-Schieiffer, who w128
on-the-spot-get this job, and MR's chief editor Leo Hubermann
plans to attend 2nd Bandung himself. Locally, however, S/1
was able to line up the following sponsors (though none is
in a position to pay much for his services they collectively
provide him with sufficient reason for being in Algiers; he
will let on that his travel costs were advanced him by his
wealthy brother-in-law):
2. Cinnamon, a sort of British Ebony scheduled to
bring out its first issue on 20 June.
b. West Indian Gazette, described in earlier corres-
pondence, will provide S/1 with a letter of accreditation.
C. Institute of Race Relations. This politically
neutral, academic outfit publishes a monthly newsletter.
Connected with Chatham House, the Institute's secretary
Sheilla Paterson is a good friend of S/1. She has asked
him to do a paper back book for the Institute on Africa.
Again, though they could pay little for this effort it
constitutes a highly respectable piece of cover. .
During the last two months, S/1 has explained his income
to his wife as coming from advances, expense money and articles
for Encounter. This has not pleased her, as she dislikes
both the Congress for Cultural Freedom and Laskey, but has
at least satisfied her curiosity. To explain Katzenbach's
telephone calls to his home (K. identified himself to S/l's
wife xxx as "Mr. Wilson") S/1 had to improvise a purely
notional affiliation with an American feature story syndica-
tion service called "Metropolitan Features". This will help
explain some of his inome to his wife, but will not be used
with others.
2. The above skeletal dover will hopefully be reinforced in
Algiers where S/1 will scour around for bits and pieces of work
for his many contacts there. His visits to Grippa and Andersson
on his way to Algiers will also help to fill out his ostensible
sources of income, though S/1 has agreed not to overplay this
angle. In other words, he will not pretend that these two have
given him any funds, but if others want to make the assumption,
so much the better.
3. On 1 and 2 June, Tiffany expounded at some length on the
importance of 5/1 trying to get an Opposition (Soviet, Cuban,
Algerian or Chicom) sponsor for any further cover, such as
the researching of a book or establishment of an Afro-Asian
news service for U.S. leftist periodicals and/or individuals.
While we could easily set him up in this enterprize, we the not
want to for the simple reason that this would at best only
provide him with a superficial sort of access. What we want
him to strive for is Opposition sponsorship that will lead him
into one of the nerve centers of the national liberation
movement in Algiers or Djakarta. (5/1 ruled out Cairo on the
grounds that his wife is Jewish) S/1 accepted this reasoning
and agreed to go for a position that holds out the prospect of
long-range penetration in depth.

:
somewhat irregular, but we went ahead with it principally on the grounds
that this was necessary to head off the security and morale problems
posed by an irate wife.
6. In the course of his initial talk with S/1, Rodigast pursued the
atter of the allegations made at various times in the past to the
effect that S/1 is or was a "CIA agent" or "FBI agent". S/1 explained
the situation as follows:
a. S/1 was a schoolmate of William Gardner Smith, and
with Smith's encouragement came to Paris and worked with Smith on
the English desk of Agence France Presee. S/1 took over the left bank
Ollie
apartment of Ollie Harrington, American Negro cartoonist, and CPUSA
member. 5/1 had a falling-out with Harrington over the apartment (rent),
and in what he describes as a moment of weakness he sought revenge
by forging a letter with Harrington's signature which indicated support
for the FLN (Algeriah nationalists); at that time the French were
extremely sensitive to the subject, of course, and S/1's act was designed
to hurt Harrington, and perhaps his friends as well. S/1 was found out,
and questioned by the French police; his break with William Gardner
Smith and that crowd dates from this moment. S/1 had been forced to
write an apology to Earrington, confessing to the forgery.
b. S/1 believes that Jacques Vergès obtained the
letter of apology (to Harrington) from Smith or from Ellen Wright
(an American, white, widow of the Negro novelist Richard Wright; she
continues to reside in Paris as a literary agent handling books of
writers connected with Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir; S/1 says that
she is a friend of Harrington). As for Harrington, S/1 believes he
is now in Ghana or in East Germany; in East Germany he has American
friends: a Negro singer Aubrey Pankey and his white wife Kay; she
is an editor of the East German publishing house Seven Seas (which
prints books in English), and is close to Shirley Graham Dubois.
c. The CPUSA knew of the Harrington forgery and

according to S/1 told the Cubans about it, since the CPUSA hoped to
discredit 5/1 and put their own people in teach with the Cubans. S/1.
told the Cubans a tall tale which he hopes they believed (among those
he spoke to was Roa): he said that during the French drive against the
FLI¡ various people were writing letters in support of the Algerians and
signing prominent names to then, and that the Harrington forgery was
carried out in this spirit.
d. The hostility to S/1 from Ainslee and lacGowan
had as its origin their anger that Vergès had given S/1 a job that
should have gone to an Englishman (or woman); they felt that Africa
was a problem of the British CP; and so they spread the story about S/1.
e. Rodigast recalled that William Gardner Smith had
once written a letter to the Paris Herald Tribune denying that a
pro-Castro letter which appeared several days earlier signed WG Smith
had been sent by him. At the time (perhaps 18 months ago) Smith told
Rodigast, who questioned him on the matter, "Oh, that's an old story."
Without indicating that he knew Smith, Rodigast raised the question
of Smith's Herald Tribune letter to S/1, who said he had never seen it
or heard of it before.
f. Rodigast gave 5/1 the recent clipping from Le Monde
which indicated that Patricia MacGowan's husband or lover Carlos Lansa
had been arrested by the Algerians in connection with the investigation
of the Delgado killing. Rodigast warned S/1 that we did not know whether
a charge would be made, or indeed whether Lansa had already been released
along with others arrested at the same time. Nevertheless S/1 thought
the clipping would be useful to show to those not terribly familiar
with the details, but who might be favorably influenced by a report
showing that the people who denounced S/1 as a "CIA agent" had also
sent Delgado to his death.
7. Questioned on his residence status vis a vis French and Swiss
authorities, S/1 said:
a. He feels he can come and go to Switzerland without
f

problems. When Revolution was closed down by the Swiss, 5/1 was called
in and notified that he had three months to leave the country because
of the undesirable nature of his activities; the Swiss told Nils
Anderssen informally that should S/1 change to a "desirable" activity
he would be allowed to stay. Following his departure on what S/1
considered very polite terms (i.e., the three-month notice period),
S/1 traveled regularly to Switzerland (once a month, on Revolution
business), although he tries to arrive by means which expose him to
minimal border checks (train rather than plane, and Trans Europe Express
best of all) and while in Switzerland lives with friends rather than
in a hotel to avoid having to fill out police cards. (S/1 was notified
of his expulsion in September 1963 and left in December before the
deadline. His most recent trips were in January-February 1965.)
.b. S/1 was never arrested by the French, merely
interrogated on the Harrington forgery charge. He has resided in
Paris since that time. During the early stages of S/1's suit against
Verges for payment of back wages, Verges' attorney said in open court
that S/1 had bean in France illegally (as he had no carte de sejour;
he could not obtain one since Vergès never agreed to a work contract
which would be required at the time of application for a carte de sejour).
(In connection with the Vergès suit: S/1's French lawyer Pierre
Schwarzenberg, has not pressed the charges; het is a Communist and
f
an old friend of Vergès, and told S/1 he believed he could obtain a
settlement through persuasion. S/1 has already paid Schwarzenberg's
fee (the money was obtained from S/1's brother-in-law), and does not.
know whether he can whip up Schwarzenberg's enthusiasm. Should S/1
win a judgement for the some $5000 owed to him, he could force Vergès'
bankruptcy (there is a printer in the same legal position who has
not insisted on payment because he is reluctant to bring on bankruptcy).
S/1 says that it is possible that if he engaged a first-class non-Communist
attorney in France (who would have to be paid in advance) he might achieve
☐

this goal, but it is not certain that he could get the original fee
back from Schwarzenberg.
8. For future contacts, Redigast gave S/1 "an alias I am using:
James Sunderland, c/o American Express, 11 rue Scribe, Paris 9, the
"c/o American Express" being optional. Rodigast will also look into
the possibility of emergency contact via want ads placed in Alger
Republicain or Le Peuple (the latter is preferred by 5/1), which Rodigast
believes will be purchased and read daily by LCPIPIT during the summer
“anyway-- they arrive in Paris a day or two after publication. S/1
could advertise for a stenographer able to take perfect English shorthand,
for example.

1. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965,
we asked JAGUAR to lay on such coverage as they could manage. After some
weeks has passed, and JAGUAR had not moved in this direction, we repeated
our request, pointing out that STEBCNY/1 would soon be leaving. Short-
handed and hampered by certain restrictions, JAGUAR moved in to do what
they could, and their coverage was due to start almost at the same time
as TIFFANY was to begin his meetings with S/1. We contacted JAGUAR and
told them to lay off (much to our chagrin) for the time being. This they
did, but then, without our being advised, they resumed their coverage.
We don't know exactly how long they actually had him in their sights,
but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he was
watched on 5, 6 and 7 June. ▲ JAGUAR officer advised us informally
that S/1 "seemed to be out of town" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had
mentioned that he might take 8/1 to the country for a day, but we don't
know whether in fact he did so.)
2. Here is JAGUAR's notes
-
"As explained in conversation on the 8th June, 1965, we
have received a report on S/1's movements during the period 5th.
7th June, 1965. Nothing of interest was learnt about his movements
on the 6th and 7th June, but you may be interested in the following
information relating to the 5th June: -
"S/1 left his home at 11.25 and travelled by taxi to
the Haymarket where he entered the American Express offices.
He obtained a ticket for an air passage to Brussels and
a train journey to Basle, thence to Lausanne and Paris where
he was due to arrive on the 10th June. He paid £20-29-18
for his ticket. He left the American Express at 12.30 and
subsequently returned home at 13.20 hours.
"He left home again at 14.05 and went to the Clarendon
Court Hotel in Haida Vale. He came out of the building
after five minutes and wandered around for twenty minutes
before returning to the hotel. He stayed there until 18.45
when he left alone and returned home.
3. The JAGUAR officer also told me that S/1's contact at the Clarendon
Court Hotel was not identified by the surveillant, who in fact did not
know which room S/1 had visited. The contact, of course, was TIFFANY,
registered as GUSTKE.

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
JAGUAR had made the following available to us, in response to our
request for information on a continuing basis relating to STEBONY/1:
"In mid-May STEBONY/1 was still trying to arrange a visit to
Algiers this summer - on the strength of help he has received
from 'some comrades'.
"Robert WILLIAMS in Havana has given STEBONY/1 the impression
that he may visit Algiers as a member of a Cuban delegation.
Also, STEBONY/1 understands that William WCHTHY, who has been in
Hanoi, will be going to Algiers. STEBONY/1 expects to meet a
number of his friends there and his main reason for wishing to
make this trip is to discuss his problems, past and present,
with these friends and other interested parties. He hopes to
clear up doubts and uncertainties and, in this context, he has
commented that one of the reasons for much of the hostility shown
to him has been the reluctance of others to involve themselves
in the differences which arose between himself and Jacques VERGES
because the latter was clearly more influential and more important
than STEBONY/1.
"STEBONY/1 had heard that VERGES was still insisting that
STEBONY/1 was a KUBARK agent and that Nils ANDERSON and Jacques
GRIPPA were 'ODYCKE double agents'. GRIPPA, who is leader of the
pro-Chinese Communist group in Belgium, is planning to bring up-
to-date his book 'Marxism-Leninism or Revisionism', published two
years ago, by adding a new chapter. STEBONY/1 is looking into the
possibility of its publication in the UK or PBPRIME and, in this
context, he considers 'Monthly Review' to be the only possible
medium although Leo HUBERMAN, one of the publication's editors,
is not enthusiastic about the idea."

ABSTRACT
MICROFILM
London Station was able to make only a single copy of the list,
and, due to its bulk and the length of time required to copy it, we
have not retained a copy. We doubt that the entire list, which runs to
several thousand names (mostly in the U.S.) would be useful to Paris
Station, but Headquarters may be able to supply an extract of names to
suit your need or the whole thin
thing. if you
with.

debriefings, briefings, an LCFLUTTER examination, and training in preparation

LCFIPET felt that 5/1: had absorbed sufficiently the guidance given him,

ABSTRACT
1. During a recent meeting, STEBONY/1 called my attention to the
book Political Africa, by honald SEGAL, published London 1961 by Stevens
and Sons, Ltd. STEBONY/1 used the book to look up a brief bio squib on,
as it happened, Patrick Duncan. He commented that the book, although out
of date and far from objective (one of the collaborators was Rosalynde
AINSLIE), was extremely useful to him.
2. I subsequently got a copy of the book, and find it useful. Hone-
theless, it is far out of date. It would appear that there is a great need
for an up-dated version, more comprehensive and more objective. STEBONY/1
might be the ideal person to work up such a book (he could even put some of
his wife'r talents to work, in such a project), and, in turn, such a
project could augment nicely his cover for, say, a year.
3. For Headquarters consideration then, the following suggestions
Contact Praɔger (who published Political Africa in the U.S.) or another
appropriate firm, and lay on a commission to compile such a compendium of
facts, figures and faces on the African scene. Have them in turn commission
STEBONY/1 to do the job, and provide him with enough of an advance to help
cover his needs for a period of a year, say, starting after STEBONY/1's
summer in Algiers. (Alternatively, of course, STEBONY/1 could be instructed
to come to Praeger with such a proposal, which we could encourage Praeger
to accept.) This could run concurrently with STEBONY/1's news-letter, if it
materializes, and without any apparent conflict. It could also afford him
additional cover for travel and interviews, as well as funds. And a useful
reference tool could result.
4. This is just a suggestion, but we'd like to know what you think of it.

Personally, 8/1 appeared to understand and to follow good security
practices by and large, but he was concerned that his wife now suspected his
of being up to something" of which she did not approve. In short, his overail
long-term security sppeared meniert closest to LoDE, „vertheless, he appeared
highly confident that previous denunciations to which he had been subjected
would not "stick" and that he could rapidly reestablish himself among revolutionary
circles.
His relationship to KUBANK over the longer period has apparently
of considerable interest to him, to the extent that he stated he would be
interested in some sort of career status with KUBARK (with retirement benefits)
and perhaps one day a "less covert" position. At this time in our relationship
with 5/1, however, LCPIFTT is concerned primarily with what to do with hin
on 1 September 1965. In fact, in view of the 19-20 June developments in Algiers
and the possible postponement of most of the activities 8/1 was to cover in
efforts to reestablish himself as a legitimate propagandist for national liber-
ation movements, USA may find it not only feasible, but necessary, to revise
8/l's initial KURBARK mission.
In the days and weeks to come we will be reporting 8/1's progress as
he relates his accomplishments and problems through s/d communications and in
moetings with RODIGAST. We shall be submitting recommendations on 3/1's longer
term utility to KUBAIX as we have more information upon which to make some
Judgments. We know that addressses will be subjecting the STEFSCHY operation
to constant evaluation and salysis throughout the sumer, and we will appreciate
continued and coordinated guidance on how best to exploit the unique potential
represented by this asset.
I. ECPIPIR SUPPORT FOR THE STREONY OPERATION
1. On 3 June 1965 STAROWY/1 signed a letter of agreement with
COTONE in Landon, in effect a contract with KUBANK. Upon signing the letter
of agreement and agreeing to undergo an LCFLUTTER examination, 5/1 ms introduced
to Rafus P. RODIGAST, a KIMFXLF Career Agent based in Paris who had been designated
8/1's outside ease officer. RODIJAST is known to 8/1 under the alias "Paul
Meller." RODIGAST net at length with 5/1 on 3, 5, and 6 June and made arrange-
ments for 2/1 to meet him in Paris 12 June and undergo further training, briefing,
and sscurity processing prior to embarking on a trial assignment of some 10 wee
2. On 12 June 1965 8/1 made contact with RODIGAST in Paris in
cordance with instructions and was taken immediately to a safehouse for
debriefing on his 8-11 June trip in West Europe and for training in the use
of s/d system #64. RODI:EST's Contact Report on this meting and his report of
debriefing are included in Attachment 3 (USC.). 5/1 was passed $200.00
12 mm travel arrangements for his trip to Earth Afrion. (See also PALP 4057).
3. On 13 June 3/1 again met RODIGAST in accordance with instructions
and was taken to his LAVLUTIER exsmination at an LCPIPIT safehouse. The results
of this examination were forwarded in PALP 4056. In short, the outcome of the
tion was maidered satisfactory for the proecsed operational use of sɅ.
