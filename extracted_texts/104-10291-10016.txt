your description an
let the matter drop
On 24 June we received a phone call from a local agent of
the FBI who had received the same information that you had passed on
to us and was trying to run it down. We again deafed any knowledge of
such an organization. However, as the matter was rohashed among the
DFO staff we recalled that a few months ago, shortly after the CIA
expose first appeared in the New York Times, we received in the mall
brochure from The Wackenhut Corporation, 262 Havana, Denver, Colorado1545.51
This organization was described as a private investigative service
with capabilities beyond that of the average private investigator in
that they are staffed with men and women formerly employed by the FBI
Secret Service and DIA. We also holieve that under the list of
services they offered vas some type of electronic surveillance. Since
this type of organization is of no interest to us wa discarded the
brochure and forgot about it until your inquiry prompted us to recall
it
We passed the above information on to the local Bureau office,
stressing thất this was indeed a long shot, that our memory of the
contents of the brochure is vagué at best
bent, that we have no reason to
believe that the Wackenhut Corporation is anything other than what it
advertises itself to he and that this is our best recollection but even
at that we are not absolutely sure it was the Wackenhut Corporation, that
was mentioned in the brochure.

With this memorandum we merely wish to go on record with you an
having passed the above information to the local FBI office in the form
stated.

Possible Identification and Surveillance REFERENCES

Service
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT
This report has been prepared by the DOMESTIC CONTACT SERVICE, DDI. The operational information contained
herein may not be disclosed to personnel outside of the CLANDESTINE SERVICE, CIA, without the prior permission
of the Domestic Contact Service.
SOURCE US citizen, a former intelligence officer who is employed
with a firm that conducts business on a worldwide scale.
A representative of a US company with contracts in Algeria
in early March 1974 held a personal conversation on business
matters with a high level Algerian Foreign Ministry Official
(other wise unidentified) in Algiers. The Algerian mentioned.
that his government has become increasingly concerned with
the expanding presence in Algeria of US citizens, who are
in the country as a result of the growing number of US
business contracts. Almost in passing, the Algerian noted
that his government is suspicious that many of the Americans
might be US intelligence agents. In fact, he claimed that
Algerian security authorities "already have identified six
CIA Agents", and that these individuals "are under close
surveillance". The US businessman did not want to appear
too inquisitive, and so he did not probe for any further
information on this matter. He is not able to provide the
names of the individuals who are under suspicion.

The mafority of the business community, both big and small businesses,
is not in complete harmony with the government of President Carlos Lleras.
Most business executives confirm that under the previous Conservative
Party administration there was a stimulation of interest in foreign
investment, a factor which is causing the current administration Immense
problems due to restrictive legislation on the percentage of capital
which may be removed from the country. It to the consensus of the business
Community that this low will be changed within the next eight months, as
a result of prescure by the business community upon the government.
"
At the present time there is much discontent among owners privato
business firms as well as among the employeco about a proposed new law
Current legislation requires that employers place in a fund à certain
percentage of employees earnings, which will be returned to the employee
upon retirement or termination of employment. Under thin arrangement the
employer may make use of the money for investments or development of the
firm or industry. The reason for the discontent is that the government
is attempting to pass a low requiring all business firms and industries
to pay, on a monthly basis to the government, the money received from
the employees. Severance or retirement pay of an employee will then become
c. responereflity of the government. The busincas community is adamantly
against this legislation because it will restrict much of business operation.
Employees are equally against the legislation because they feel once the
government collects the money it will be appropriated for other purposes
and never returned to the people.
The government has stated that the money collected: will be used for develop-
ment of low and middle class housing, and rents collected from these develop-
ments will be placed in a fund for the payment of severance and retirement
benefits.

President Otto Arosemena Gomez. The efforts of the present government
to encourage foreigh business investment is considered to be the biggest
plus on the side of the current administration. Evidence of the efforts
riade by the government and the success achieved is demonstrated by
joint venture of two major oil companies, Texaco and Gulf, in drilling
for new oil deposits. Agreements were reached between the government and
the of companies for prospective drilling in an area northeast of Quito,
roximately 30 minutes by helicopter. The "irst four holes resulted in
sour oil producing wells. This strike is considered the richest since
the Venezuelan strike. The government ic precently being flooded with

his political machine. He would like very much to continue as President.
The desire of Arosemena to continue as President takes on more meaning
when consideration is given to the possibility that Jose Maria Velasco
Ibarra hay again be elected President. The business contanity does not
look favorably on this possibility but moss businessmen are quick to
concede, that Velasco has the inside track at this site.
