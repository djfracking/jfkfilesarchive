and was cooperative. He denied membership in the CP
but admitted membership in 14 Communist front organizations.
His file contains information reflecting alledged CP
membership.
SAM JAFFE, subject of instant airtel, is acquainted
with two known Soviet agents in the person of BARKOVSKY and
KRESTYANOV, one potential Soviet defector in the person of
BOGOSLOVSKI, and two other Soviets who are among the more
active Soviets in the NYC area. All possible coverage
of these Soviets is desirable.
Should JAFFE fail to respect the Bureau's
confidence, he would jeopardize his own career and
certainly his contacts at the UN. This is pointed out
as it is believed that this puts the Bureau in a better
position to control JAFFE than would be true in the case of
the average individual.
•
It is not believed that JAFFE can be used in
connection with the at this time because

of his reluctance to do anything other than furnish
information to the Bureau. However, it is believed that
JAFFE can be used as an informant or source of information

This. Office realizes that JAFFE's uncle presents
one very serious drawback to his use as an informant.

During interview JAFFE saïd that he would be
willing to furnish information to the Bureau concerning
his contacts with the Soviets. However, he said that he
would have to be sure that his identity would be protected
at all times. He said he did not want to become another
BORIS MORROS or HERBERT PHILBRICK as it would ruin his career
as a news reporter if he did so. He was told, that the Bureau
would respect his confidence, but that he in turn would
have to respect the Bureau's confidence at all times.
JAFFE mentioned that at one time
Afro-American News Reporter, mentioned that the State
Department had asked him if he possessed any information
'indicating that JAFFE was a Communist. JAFFE mentioned
this by way of inquiry of interviewing agents to ascertain
if they knew of any such allegation. Interviewing agents
then asked JAFFE if he had ever been a member of the CP,
and he said that he had not been a member of the CP or any
Communist inspired organization nor has he ever sympathized
with the CP. He said that his uncle, with whom he has a
close association, is the actor SAMUEL CHARLES JAFFE who
was active on behalf of Russian War Relief and sympathized
with what proved to be Communist inspired organizations.
JAFFE said that he does not believe that his uncle was
a member of the CP however, and that his uncle did testify
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

JAFFE talked quite freely and at length about
his association with Soviet Nationals. He said that in
his capacity as a news reporter for the Columbia Broadcasting
System, it was necessary for him to have as many contacts
as possible in order to keep abreast of newsworthy incidents.
and information. He said that he has been very successful
in cultivating the Soviets and other foreigners at the UN
as news sources. He first met VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI and
NIKOLAI KALININ at a press, party at the Soviet Mission to
the UN. He has gotten to know these Soviets very well,
and in fact he has visited their homes and they have
visited his home. He said that he sees these two Soviets
very frequently and is particularly close to BOGOSLOVSKI,
whom he describes as being very much unlike other Soviets.
JAFFE said that BOGOSLOVSKI is very outspoken and in fact
gave him a 24 hour "Weat" on the decision of NIKITA KHRUSCHEV
to accept an invitation to a Soviet conference under UN
auspices. He said that the Soviets are useful in giving
him the decision on what is going to happen. When the
Mideast problem was before the UN, KALININ told JAFFE
that it would resolve itself but that he should keep
his eye on China.
In addition to BOGOSLOVSKI and KALININ, JAFFE
is acquainted with the following Soviets:

Informant's Potential for Advancement
Informant possesses good potential for advancement
in the Soviet and Satellite field. He is aggressive and very
capable of injecting himself into circles in which he has not
been acquainted in the past on the basis of his occupation
as a news reporter. To date, his anquaintance among Soviet
and Satellite Nationals has been widening continuously.
k
j. Stability and Reliability
"
Informant's association with Soviet Nationals has
been verified by sources of all types. The information he
has furnished concerning Soviet Nationals has on many oc-
casions been substantiated by information obtained from
other sources. To date, information furnished by informant
has been accurate and he has proved reliable in his dealings
with this office.
on
Informant has not shown any sign of instability.
He has, however, experienced marital difficulties during
the past 8 months, which have caused him great concern.
8/11/59, informant advised that his marital difficulties
have about been resolved and his wife will obtain a divorce
in the immediate future. Informant and his wife have reached
an agreement in connection with their divorce.
f
ko
Indoctrination Against Disclosure
Informant is most security conscious and has
repeatedly stated that if it became known that he was
furnishing information to the Bureau on a confidential
basis his career as a news reporter would be jeopardized.
Informant has been repeatedly advised of the necessity
for maintaining the fact that he is furnishing information
to the Bureau on a confidential basis in strictest confi-
dence in the interest of the Bureau as well as himself.

immediately initiate appropriate investigation to
determine his personal history, reliability, stability,
and integrity. All leads set out by your office in
this matter should be given a three-week deadline.
Your investigation should clearly establish whether Jaffe
is the type of person who can be successfully operated
by the Bureçu. If your investigation is favorable,
the results thereof and of your preliminary interview
with Jaffe should be furnished to the Bureau with a
request for Dureau authority to interview Joffe and
develop him as an informant or double agent.

NOTE: Jaffe is an employee of the Columbia Broadcasting
System News Department, NYC. During the past several
years he has had frequent contact with Soviet officials
in the U. S., apparently in a legitimate capacity as a
reporter and writer. We have interviewed him in the
past concerning some of these contacts, and he has been
completely cooperative. On 7-23-58, he contacted NYO
and indicated he was taking two Soviets attached to the
UN Delegation to dinner. By letter 8-19-58, NYO requested
Bureau authority to conduct" "sounding out" interview with
Jaffe to determine whether he might have potential for
development as a selected contact whom we can place in
touch with the Soviets for intelligence purposes. NYO
indicated that appropriate precautions would be observed
during this interview, inasmuch as Jaffe is employed by Wi
a news media,

On 3/5/57, Special Agents of the FBI observed
the activities of a certain individual in the offices
of the Ceylon Delegation where the afore-mentioned code
was known to be kept, and subsequently observed this
individual with GRUSHA. Approximately one hour later,
after this individual had again been observed with
GRUSHA, he was observed returning a red covered book
to the offices of the Ceylon Delegation.
A review of the New York Office Indices
(c)
reflects numerous references to the name SAMUEL JAFFE;
however, based on the information from
it
would appear that the subject is identical with the
JAFFE named by . This identification is based
upon the following facts obtained from the previous
investigation of the subject.
(c)

L
'
According to 2, JAFFE, on numerous
Occasions during 1955 and 1956, had been in contact
with individuals at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C. in regard to visa matters pertaining to his contemplated
travel to the USSR.
In April, 1954, according to
JAFFE was in contact with the Soviet United Nations
Delegation in New York City. At this time, it was
determined that he was employed as a culture researcher
for "Life" Magazine in New York City, and had contacted
the Soviet United Nations Delegation in connection
with some work he was doing on a story for this
magazine. Subsequently, it was determined from
inquiry at the offices of "Life" Magazine, that
JAFFE was born on 6/19/28.
(5)
Passport records of the Department of State,
reviewed on 7/27/55, (as set forth in WFO letter of 8/25/55),
reflect that JAFFE, in a supplemental statement dated
6/22/55 in connection with his passport, indicated
that he wished to have his passport amended to allow
him to travel in Communist China as a professional
American journalist. It was indicated further, that
he had excellent reason to believe that the Red Chinese
Government would allow him to enter their country as
a journalist in view of the fact that during the
Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he
obtained an interview with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI.

200 East End Avenue, New York City, advised SA JOHN
F. MABEY that the subject, who is presently an employee
of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City,
presently resides in an apartment at this address with
his wife and small child.
In view of the information which is set forth
in the subject's investigative file reflecting numerous
past contacts on his part with various Soviets attached
to both the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and
the Soviet United Nations Delegation, New York City,
and the fact that the subject has a history of employment
in the capacity of a news correspondent, the New York
Office feels that no contact should be initiated at
this time with the subject concerning his association
with GRUSHA. In addition, it is to be noted that
following a contact by the subject with KONSTANTIN G.
FEDOSEEV, Counselor, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.,
on 7/9/54, a representative of "Time" and "Life"
Magazines contacted the Bureau, alleging that he believed
JAFFE had been under surveillance by the FBI.
The New York Office feels that subject's'
contact of GRUSHA possibly can be logically explained
as a normal contact in view of the subject's employment,
and it is felt that an interview with JAFFE would
· possibly result in embarrassment to the Bureau should
the subject take exception to the Bureau's interest
in his activities.

Jaffe was interviewed at his request by agents of
this Bureau on January 3, 1956, at his home 301 Fletcher
Drive, Atherton, California. He identified himself as a
correspondent currently representing the North American
Newspaper Alliance. He stated he was formerly employed by
"Time" and "Life" and in connection with this latter en-
ployment, had been assigned to writing and research on the
articles published in "Life" magazine dealing with the various
religions of the world. Jaffe stated that in connection with
this assignment be made the acquaintance of Fedoseev (Konstantin
G. Fedoseev), Counselor, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.
Jaffe said he had contacted Fedoseev initially in his efforts
to obtain a visa to enable him to enter China. He commented
this had been a mistake to approach the Soviets in this
regard inasmuch as they could not or at least did not, do
anything to aid in the issuance of the visa. (c)
Jaffe advised he had been attempting to obtain a
visa to enter the Soviet Union to write a series of articles
on conditions existing there and in his efforts to obtain
this visa he had again contacted Fedoseev. After considerable
delay, he was advised that a visa would be issued for a period
not to exceed two weeks. Jaffe said he contacted Fedoseey
in the hope that he could obtain a visa for a longer period
of time, but Fedoseev advised Jaffe the issuance of such e
visa would not follow, but that he could possibly obtain an
extension on the two weeks' visa. Jaffe stated he challenged
the statement of Fedoseev that his visa would be extended
and since he could receive assurance of a visa for a period
not to exceed two weeks, he had decided against making the
trip to the Soviet Union and he returned to his home in
Atherton from Washington, D. C., and New York.
( )
Jaffe
Jaffe commented that in discussing his desire for a
visa with Fedoseev, the latter had indicated that should
Jaffe write objectively concerning the Soviet Union he,
Fedoseev, felt certain Jaffe's visa would be extended.
said he challenged this remark by Fedoseev and indicated to
the latter he felt Fedoseev's remarks were equivalent to
blackmail and that in order for him to get an extension on
his visa it would be necessary for him to slant bis erticles
in favor of the Soviet Union. Fedoseev denied this intent
and stated only that they desired the articles to be written
objectively.

Jaffe stated that during his conversation with

born in the Soviet Union. Fedoseev seemed to be impressed
by the above statement and inquired as to whether Jaffe's

any relatives currently residing in the Soviet Union.

Jaffe stated that during his conversation with
Fedoseev, he had remarked that his, Jaffe's, father was born
in the Soviet Union. Fedoseev seemed to be impressed by the
above statement and inquired as to whether Jaffe's father
was still a citizen of the Soviet Union, Jaffe informed
Fedoseev his father was an American citizen and Fedoseev was
apparently very disturbed concerning this and on several
occasions inquired as to whether Jaffe had any relatives
currently residing in the Soviet Union. Jaffe stated Fedoseeu
was visibly disturbed when advised Jaffe had no relatives in
the Soviet Union..
Files of this Bureau contain no information in
addition to the above pertinent to your inquiry. It is noted
that Jaffe has traveled extensively abroad and the Passport
Division of the Department of State would probably have.

He stated he was formerly employed by "Fine" and "Life" and
in connection with this latter employment, had been assigned
to writing and research on the articles published in "Life
magazine dealing with the various religions of the world.
Jaffe stated that in connection with this assignment he made the
acquaintance of Fedoseev (Konstantin G. Fedoseev), Counselor,
Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C. Jaffe said he had contacted
Fedoseev initially in his efforts to obtain a visa to enable
him to enter China. He commented this had been a mistake to
approach the Soviets in this regard inasmuch as they could
not, or at least did not,do anything to aid in the issuance of
the visa.
(c)
Jaffe advised he had been attempting to obtain a visa
to enter the Soviet Union to write a series of articles on
conditions existing there and in his efforts to obtain this viso
he had again contacted Fedoseev. After considerable delay, he
was advised that a visa would be issued for a period not to
exceed two weeks. Jaffe said he contacted Fedoseev in the hope
that he could obtain a visa for a longer period of time, but
Fedoseev advised Jaffe the issuance of such a visa would not
follow, but that he could possibly obtain an extension on the
two-weeks' visa. Jaffe stated he challenged the statement of
Fedoseev that his viso would be extended and since he could
receive assurance of a visa for a period not to exceed two weeks,
he had decided against making the trip to the Soviet Union and
he returned to his home in Atherton from Washington, De C.,and
New York.
D
Jaffe commented that in discussing his desire for a
viea with Fedoseevs the latter had indicated that should Jaffe
write objectively concerning the Soviet Union he Fedoseev,
felt certain Jaffe's visa would be extended. Jaffe said he
challenged this remark by Fedoseeu and indicated to the latter
he felt Fedoseev's remarks were equivalent to blackmail and that
in order for him to get an extension on his visa it would be
necessary for him to slant his articles in favor of the Soviet
Union. Fedoseev denied this intent and stated only that they
desired the articles to be written objectively.

SIGILL
JAFFE asks that his passport be amended allowing him to travel
in Communist China as a professional American journalist and he understands
that he will personally assume all the risks in such an undertaking.
If this request is not within the power of the Department of State to
approve, he desires to know if the Department of State would have any
objection if he deposited his passport with the nearest Embassy and
entered Communist China, assuming all risks, as a private citizen.
His purpose in visiting Communist China would be in the
capacity of a professional journalist for the "Nation" magazine of
America and other American publications to write on what is taking place
in Red China today. He would also seek an interview with Red China's
leader MAO TSE-TUNG and other Communist officials. He would try to
interview the eleven American fliers held by the Reds and the Americans
who have deflected to the side of the Reds. He would deport himself
in the best interests of the U. S. and would provide information to
his Government upon his return.
(c)
(c)
He has excellent reasons to believe that the Red Chinese
government would allow him to enter their country as a journalist. During
the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he obtained an interview
with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI through the good offices of Prime
Minister U NU of Burma. He filed a full report of this interview with the
American Embassy at Rangoon, Burma on 5/20/55 and previously he had
´informed the American Consul at Singapore of certain statements CHOU-EN-LAI
made to him during the interview. The Red Chinese know that Prime Minister
U NU thinks well of him.
He was also told by one KANG MAO-CHAO, Counselor for Cultural
Affairs at the Red Chinese Embassy in New Delhi that he stood an excellent
chance of being admitted to his country, as "My Premier was impressed by
the way your story was handled." KANG MAO-CHAO added that also in his
favor was the fact that CHOU-EN-LAI knew him as well as do others in his
government. His request for admittance to Red China is presently being
considered by the authorities at Peking.
JAFFE concluded his statement by relating that he hopes that
in making a decision the Department will realize that it would be in the
best interests of our Government and our people that an American journalist
be permitted to visit Red China to report firsthand on the state of
affairs there.

USSR, and MIKHAIL N. SMIRNOVSKY' as a First Secretary, Embassy of the
USSR.
On 7/13/53, one SAM JAFFY (phonetic),
asked E. P.✓ PODGORNAYA for N. P. SAVCHENKO or anyone else with whom he
could talk about a visa. PODGORNAYA advised JAFFY that no one was in the
office as it was lunch time. JAFFY related he would call again after
the lunch hour.

D.C.
-On 12/30/53, FEDOSEEV contacted SAM JAFFE in New York regarding..
the letter he had sent to Ambassador ZARUBIN on November 24th. FEDOSEEV
said per JAFFE's request ZARUBIN had sent this letter on to Moscow but
to date no reply had been received, and further in line with JAFFE's
letter of December 28th, FEDOSEEV would advise him when anything is
received. JAFFE went on to indicate that he is coming to Washington
tomorrow and that he is going to visit at the Legation of Yemen since
the King of Yemen has granted him permission to visit Yemen to do the
Islamic phase of the religious story. JAFFE mentioned that he is doing a
series of articles and stories on the various religions. FEDOSEEV will
.contact JAFFE when anything is received from Moscow.
On 1/20/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life" magazine, asked SMIRNOVSKY
whether the Embassy had heard anything from Moscow about the thing he had
spoken to him and Ambassador ZARUBIN about. SMIRNOVSKY said they had
not. JAFFE pointed out that they wanted to do a completely fair job
on all five religions, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, and
Taoism, and they could not do justice to the last three without actually
going to China. SMIRNOVSKY was very friendly and said he would try to
see that the people in Moscow were reminded again.
On 2/5/54, SAM JAFFEY (phonetic); asked SMIRNOVSKY if he
received the letters and was told he had. JAFFEY asked if any action
would be taken. SMIRNOVSKY replied that the Ambassador was not here to
act upon it and as a result the matter will be decided upon in Moscow.
JAFFE said he heard reports and has read in the newspapers that there
are Chinese advisors in Berlin at the present time. SMIRNOVSKY replied

that he had read this also. JAFFE expressed considerable concern about
receiving action on his proposal and then asked if SMIRNOVSKY knew of
any place in the U. S. where one could buy Russian vodka and SMIRNOVSKY
said he did not.
On 2/18/54 SAM JAFFEY (phonetic), told SMIRNOVSKY that he
planned to be in Washington next Thursday and wondered if SMIRNOVSKY
would have lunch with him. SMIRNOVSKY said he would and suggested that
he call him when he gets in town. JAFFEY said he is working on a story
regarding the Indian caste system; that he already has the Hindu story
laid out covering about 40 pages; that at a conference yesterday it was
decided that photos would have to be taken in China, ie, pictures of
temples but still they have not received an answer from the Peking
government. JAFFEY wondered if Ambassador ZARUBIN could be of further
help in this matter if a wire were sent to him in Germany. SMIRNOVSKY
said it would be all right to send the wire. They agreed to discuss
this further Thursday.
On 2/26/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life," tried to reach Ambassador ZARUBIN
finally spoke instead with FEDOSEEV, with whom he went over again "Life's"
project for photographic essays of religions of the world and their
desire to get into China. FEDOSEEV promised that he and the Ambassador
would do all they could, but that they just had not heard as yet. JAFFE
emphasized that all he wants is a definite answer even if it is no.
On 3/22/54, SAM JAFFE , asked whether
FEDOSEEV had heard any word from the Peoples Republic of China regarding
his request. JAFFE pointed out that the Chinese will be holding a big
Confucius ceremony in April and he would like to cover it to get material
for his story. JAFFE went into great detail explaining the importance
for covering the ceremony in China proper since it is the birth place of
Confucius. He said they would probably cover it in Korea and on Formosa.
FEDOSEEV agreed to talk the request over again with the Ambassador and
call JAFFE when something comes in.
On 4/9/54, SAM JAFFE
DX tried to reach
FEDOSEEV, was told that he was out to lunch now and to call back at
2 o'clock. JAFFE said that he wanted to know something about the "Red
Star" magazine (Red Army magazine), and was told FEDOSEEV would help on
this matter.
On 4/9/54 SAM JAFFE again attempted to reach FEDOSEEV and was
told by SMIRNOVSKY that he was not in the Embassy. JAFFE said this
call did not pertain to the Chinese proposal but to a drawing published
in the end of the March issue of the "Red Star" of the "H Bomb."t

in London, a First Secretary, Mr. DENCHINSKY (ph), who also talked to JAFFE
about the visa and promised to help. Just before JAFFE left London for
the U. S., he received word from DENCHINSKY that the matter was being
considered at the highest level, and word of the results would be given to
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, or directly to the magazine in New York.
JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV to help him. FEDOSEEV asked if JAFFE planned on
being in Washington, D. C., soon. JAFFE said he hoped to be here next week.
It was arranged that he will call FEDOSEEV the day before coming down to
arrange to get together and FEDOSEEV will try to find out about the visa
in the meantime. JAFFE and FEDOSEEV recalled that they had had dinner
together some time ago.
WFO indices also reflect the following:
WFO agents on physical surveillance observed the following:
On 7/9/54 at 8:37 pm FEDOSEEV and his wife, NONNA N. FEDOSEEVA,
in the company of JAFFE and his wife departed the FEDOSEEV residence,
Chastleton Hotel, 1701 16th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., and walked
to the Colony Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Street, N. W., which they entered
at 8:58 pm. They departed the restaurant at 11:18 pm and walked to the
vicinity of the FEDOSEEV residence where the couples separated. JAFFE
and his wife then entered a taxicab and thereafter engaged in strenuous
efforts to detect or lose the physical surveillance.
The Bureau advised NY and WFO by letter dated 7/19/54 that on
the following day, 7/10/54, a representative of "Time" and "Life"
magazines contacted the Bureau alleging that he believed JAFFE had been
under surveillance by the FBI on the previous night. A representative
of "Time" and "Life" magazines stated that JAFFE has an assignment to
write a story on contemporary religions and plans to go to Red China for
the purpose of studying Buddhism. JAFFE was in contact with FEDOSEEV
and other Soviets to obtain their co-operation in travel clearance.
With the above letter, the Bureau sent to WFO for its

SMIRNOVSKY said he had not received that issue as yet but to contact Mr.

he had contacted TARASOV regarding this matter and that TARASOV was
checking on it. JAFFE said he would then recontact TARASOV.
On 6/28/54 SAM JAFFE (phonetic), told FEDOSEEV that he was
calling to say hello. He was in Washington up at the "Life" office for
two weeks and he wondered if FEDOSEEV would like to have dinner with him

telephone number REpublic 7-6050 - and said he would call JAFFE in a
couple of days. FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when it would be convenient for
him. JAFFE said he would be free any time.

On 7/2/54 SAM JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV if it would be all right
if they postponed their dinner because he was just notified that

no one answered at the room.
On 7/6/54 SAM JAFFE informed FEDOSEEV that he had expected
to call him yesterday but that the President had decided to stay
another day. JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV when they could meet and gave him a
choice of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. JAFFE suggested that they
meet (did not say where) at 7 o'clock and FEDOSEEV said he would call
him back at his office either today or tomorrow to make it definite.
FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when he would be leaving Washington and JAFFE said
he thought it would be on Saturday.
On 7/12/54 SAM JAFFE told FEDOSEEV that he had just talked to
Mr. HUNT about getting a picture of the ZARUBINS either today or tomorrow
in the big room of the Embassy. FEDOSEEV promised to check with the
Ambassador and call JAFFE back either today or tomorrow.
On 8/19/55 SAM JAFFE, Nation magazine, calling from New York,

in regard to a physical surveillance conducted on him on 7/9/54, it is not
believed desirable to continue inquiries in regard to him for the purpose
of considering his development as a source of information in regard to
Soviet activities. The Bureau concluded that no further investigation
should be conducted regarding JAFFE unless additional information comes
to WFO or NY's attention that JAFFE may be engaged in activities inimical
to the security of the U. S., at which time the Bureau should be
appropriately advised.

In Mr. Nichols' memo to Hr. Folson dated July 13, 194, it
is reported that James R. Shepley of "Time" and "Life" magazines in
Washington, called on July 10, 1954, stating that he believed the
FBI had a surveillance on Sam Jaffe, a writer for "Time" and "Life"
who has the assignment of writing a story on contemporary religions.
Shepley stated that Jaffe plans to visit Red China to study Buddhism.
Jaffe and his wife on July 9, 1954, had dinner with Konstantin
Fedoseev of the Soviet Embassy and the latter's wife. Shepley stated
the purpose of this meeting was to get Fedoseev's cooperation in travel
clearance. The Director commented, "I want facts re this situation." (C)))
#TO has submitted a menorandum of explanation from the Agence.
engaged in the surveillance referred to above. This meno states that
at 8:37 3.te on the night of July 9, 1954, surveilling agents observed
Fedoseevs, acco panied by an unidentified couple leave the Fedoseev's
residence and walk to a nearby restaurant. During this period the .
four persons under surveillance did not appear to be surveillance
conscious. Agents did not enter the restaurant as they thought this
would be indiscreet. The Fedoseeus and the unidentified couple left
the restaurant at 11:15 p.n. and were immediately observed to
scrutinize passing traffic and other pedestrians in the area. In
view theraf, the surveillance was maintained from a discreet distance.
After walking in a roundabout way to the residence of the Fedoseevs
at loth and R Sts., N., the unidentified couple took a taxi.
The
taxi followed a circuitous route to the Lauflower Hotel, during which
time the unidentified couple constantly peered through the rear and
side windows at passing automobiles and pedestrians. After leaving
the taxi at the Mayflower Hotel at 12:26 a.m., the unidentified
couple subsequently identified as Sam Jaffe and his wife, of "Time"
and "Life"magazines, engaged in a series of maneuvers designed to
determine if then were under surveillance. This included several ehtrandes)

OBSERVATIONS:
2
(U)
E
Fedoseev ts a Counselor at the Soviet Embassy and his wife
is in charge of the Press Department which has replaced the defunct
Soviet Information Bulletin. Both are important figures at the Soviet
Embassy and are suspected of Soviet intelligence activities. The
importance of identifying unknown individuals who have personal contact
with officials of Soviet establishments and in particular with persons.
like Fedoseev and his wife is an important and necessary part of our
coverage of Soviet activities. It becomes even more important to
identify such persons when they act in a suspicious manner or attempt
to detect a possible surveillance.
RECOMMENDATION:
1. As it appears that the surveillance was conducted discreetly
under difficult circumstances and no specific fact has been developed
indicating that the surveillance was in fact compromised, the statement
of the "Time" and "Life" magazines representative would appear to re-
flect only Jaffe's suspicions that he was under surveillance.

they have been told by the Russians they probably would be
surveilled as a result of their contact with the Russians.
(C)
The remarks made to the taxi driver, as reported
by him, plus the activities of this group, reflect a definite
effort on their part to determine whether they werė actually
under surveillance. The admission by the taxi driver that he
did not detect any surveillance seemed to indicate that it was
handled properly and with discretion. This would appear to be
borne out further by the fact that when Mr. JAFFEE and his wife
entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked out of the Mayflower
Hotel onto the street and were obviously not aware of the fact
that Bureau Agents had them under surveillance in the lobby of
the hotel.
The surveillance of Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE was discon-
tinued at 12:42 A.M., when it was learned from the cab driver
that they possibly were "newspaper people", but thereafter in-
quiries were made in the hotel to determine the identity of the
JAFFEES.
In view of the difficult circumstances under which
this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that it ·
was handled indiscreetly and, therefore, no administrative
action is recommended.

at one time or another in the surveillance on foot and three different
automobiles were used at various times. Surveillance agents and
automobiles were interchanged frequently and according to the agents,
no situation aross indicating that their surveillance had been in
fact detected. SAG Laughlin of the 20 tolked to the agents who
conducted it and a tates that during the period after the surveillance was
Initiated at 8:37 p.m. when the four individuals went from the
Chastelton Hotel to the Colony Restaurant none of them indicated
any awareness of surveillance or any consciousness of being surveilled;
however, when the party left the restaurant at 11:18 p.m. they were
noted to be on the lookout for surveillance and the agents proceeded
with appropriate discretion. SAC Laughlin states that it would
appear that something may have been said while the party was in the
restaurant about being followed by the FBI which could account for the
sudden accreness of the possible surveillance. It has been the experience
of Uro from persons interviewed that they have been told by the Russiana
they probably would be surveilled as a result of being in contact with
the Bussicna.

interviewed some twenty minutes after he left the Jaffes at the Mayflower
Hotel station that after picking up the couple at 16th and B Sts., No Vo
Shey told him they were "newspaper people," had spent the evening with
□ "couple of Russians" and they probably would be followed. The
cab driver was instructed to try to "lose them. The cab driver e tated
that the Jaffes were attempting to obtain license numbers but he did
not think they were successful. He stated that he, himself, had not
been able to detect any surveillance. SAC Laughlin further points out
that on one occasion when Jaffe and his wife entered the Mayflower
Hotel they looked back out of the entrance on to the street and were
not aware of the fact that the surveilling agents had preceded them
into the hotel lobby by a side entrance and were in the lobby at the
time the Jaffes were looking outside for the surveillance. #FO

describing the surveillance maintained by them on FEDOSEEVA,

I have talked to the Agents who handled this sur-
veillance which was being conducted in accordance with in-

The purpose of these surveillances is to determine whether the

espionage activities and to identify any contacts which may be

stituted approximately twenty minutes, no activities wha te ver

scrutinizing passing persons and traffic. The Agents noticed
this awareness immediately and proceeded with appropriate

(c)
At 8:37 P.M., SAS DONALD A. GRUENTZEL and ROBERT G. McGEARY
observed Mr. and Mrs. FEDOSEEV and an unknown young couple, subsequently
identified as SAM JAFFEE and wife, leave the Chastleton Hotel, lóth and
R Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. They walked directly to the Colony
Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Place, N. W., by way of 16th Street, N Street
and 17th Street, N. W. They were observed to enter this restaurant at
8:58 P.M. No attempt was made to keep the party under observation within
the restaurant, because it was felt that this could not be done discreetly.
At 11:18 P.M., SAS JOSEPH E. SCULLY, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL
and ROBERT G. McGEARY observed the party leaving the Colony Restaurant.
These Agents, who were on foot, observed the group walk west on DeSales
Place, N. W., north on Connecticut Avenue to N Street, N. W. They
observed that FEDOSEEV and JAFFEE walked together very slowly and appeared
to be in deep conversation. It was also noted that FEDOSEEVA and Mrs.
JAFFEE were walking together about 10 feet behind their husbands and
were also conversing. The Agents noticed that the party on departing
the Colony Restaurant appeared to be scrutinizing passing traffic and
other pedestrians in the area. Consequently, the Agents maintained a
discreet distance from the group.
On reaching Connecticut Avenue, SA JOHN H. KENOYER took over
the surveillance on foot and observed the party continuing to walk north
on Connecticut Avenue, around Dupont Circle, N. W., at which time SA
DONALD A. GRUENTZEL rejoined the surveillance on foot. The two Agents
observed the party walk northeast on New Hampshire Avenue, N. W., to
16th Street, N. W., and then south on the west side of 16th Street,
N. W., to R Street, N. W. While walking from Dupont Circle to this
point, the Agents noticed that the party carefully observed other
(c)
pedestrians and passing automobiles. At no time did a Bureau automobile (c)
pass the party or come within its sight. The cars were utilized solely

for maintaining contact with the Agents who were on foot.
Agents GRUENTZEL and KENOYER observed the party standing
on the corner of 16th and R Streets, N. W., conversing for about three
minutes. At 12:04 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed entering
Skyking Taxi Cab #60. At this time, the Agents on foot brought up
a surveillance car occupied by SAS SCULLY and ACHENBACH. These Agents
observed the taxi proceeding south on 16th Street to M Street, N. W.
At this point, SA MCGEARY, in another Bureau car, took over the
surveillance and observed the cab proceeding west on M Street to 17th
Street, N. W., then south on 17th Street, N. W., to I Street, N. W.,
at which point SA KEVIN F. FLANAGAN, in another Bureau car, took over
the surveillance. SA FLANAGAN observed the taxi proceeding west on
I Street and south on 17th Street to E Street, N. W. At this point,
the first surveillance car took over the surveillance and observed
the taxi proceeding east on E Street, N. W., then circle through the
Ellipse back to 17th Street, N. W. At this point, SA MCGEARY, in a
Bureau car, rejoined the surveillance, and the Agents in both cars
observed the taxi cab proceeding north on 17th Street, N. W., and
Connecticut Avenue to the Mayflower Hotel. The Agents noticed that
from the time Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE entered the taxi cab until they
alighted at the Mayflower Hotel, they frequently looked through the
rear window of the taxi cab. The cab varied its speed noticeably
throughout the ride.

At 12:26 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by SAs
ACHENBACH, FLANAGAN and KENOYER leaving the taxi in front of the hotel.
They looked up and down the street and then walked south on Connecticut
Avenue, almost to L Street, N. W., whereupon they turned around and
started back toward the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and KENOYER
entered the hotel through the DeSales Street entrance and seated
themselves in the lobby. Agent FLANAGAN entered the hotel through
the Connecticut Street entrance and proceeded to the desk. About three
minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by these Agents
entering the hotel through the Connecticut Avenue entrance. Immediately
after entering the hotel, Mr. JAFFEE and his wife were observed
standing in the entrance-way and looking up and down Connecticut Avenue.
They then proceeded to the center of the lobby where they separated.
Agents KENOYER and ACHENBACH observed Mr. JAFFEE walk toward the 17th
Street end of the lobby and out of sight. All three Agents observed
Mrs. JAFFEE walk to the hotel desk, at which SA FLANAGAN was filling
out a reservation form under an alias. After completing the form, SA
FLANAGAN walked out of the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and
KENOYER observed Mrs. JAFFEE purchase a package of cigaretts at the desk.
She was then rejoined by her husband, and both Agents observed the couple ☑

..
lobby, the Agents noticed that the JAFFEES were very observant of
persons in the lobby. In view of the late hour, few people were in
the lobby,
At 12:32 A.M., SA GRUENTZEL observed Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE
come out of the Connecticut Avenue exit of the hotel and, after looking
up and down Connecticut Avenue, walk south on Connecticut Avenue to
L Street, N. W. At this time, SA ACHENBACH joined the foot surveillance
of Agent GRUENTZEL. They observed the JAFFEES crossing Connecticut
Avenue at L Street and disappear from view going west on L Street.
Approximately two minutes later, SA ACHENBACH observed Mr. and Mrs.
JAFFEE in a doorway located on the L Street side of a business establish-
ment at the intersection of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W.
He observed that they were looking intently through the plate glass
windows of the store in the direction of the Mayflower Hotel. At this
point, Agent ACHENBACH, who was standing on a streetcar platform at the
corner of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W., boarded a south-
bound streetcar. Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were next observed by SAS SCULLY
and GRUENTZEL running across L Street to the south side and walking
west on L Street to 18th Street. After reaching 18th Street, they re-
crossed to the north side of L Street and returned to the Mayflower
Hotel via L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W. They entered the
Mayflower Hotel at 12:42 A.M. Surveillance was discontinued at this
time upon receipt of information from SA MCGEARY to the effect that
Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were possibly "newspaper people."
After Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE alighted from the taxi cab in
front of the Mayflower Hotel, SA MCGEARY located and interviewed the
' cab driver, ROBERT S. DAVIS, at 17th and M Streets, N. W. DAVIS
informed SA MCGEARY that immediately after picking up the couple at
16th & R Streets, N. W., they informed him that they were "newspaper
people" and that they had spent the evening with a "couple of Russians"
and that they probably would be followed. The cab driver stated
further that he asked the couple if he should try to "lose them."
Mrs. JAFFEE replied, "Yes, if you can." DAVIS also advised SA MCGEARY
that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were attempting to obtain license numbers,
but that he did not think they were successful. He stated that he
himself had not been able to detect any surveillance.
•
After Mrs. JAFFEE had purchased the cigaretts in the hotel
and had departed with her husband, SA KENOYER asked the night manager
at the hotel desk whether he was acquainted with the couple and whether
they were registered at the hotel. The night manager replied that he
did not know.

Approximately 20 minutes after the couple had entered
the hotel for the second time, SA FLANAGAN, under suitable pretext,
interviewed the elevator operator, who advised that a couple
answering the description of Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE had gotten off
the elevator at the eighth floor.
B
Z
as
Upon receipt of the information from SA MCGEARY,
obtained from the cab driver, that the couple were possibly associated
with the Press, SA KENOYER contacted the appropriate supervisor and
was instructed to discontinue the surveillance in view of the
possibility that the unknown couple were associated with the Press.
It was noted in the early stages of the surveillance that
the individuals involved were extremely surveillance conscious and
the Agents made every attempt to be very discreet. As set forth in
detail above, the automobiles and Agents involved were rotated as
much as possible to avoid detection by the persons under surveillance.
Even though it was apparent to the Agents that the parties under
surveillance were apparently looking for a tail, it was not felt
desirable to discontinue the surveillance until the couple were
identified. The importance of identifying unknown individuals who
have personal contact with officials of the Soviet establishments
has been impressed on the Field by the Bureau as a necessary part of
the Soviet Intensification Program.
On July 10, 1954, SA KENOYER ascertained that the files
of this office reflect that SAM JAFFEE of Life magazine on July 6,
1954, discussed with KONSTANTIN G. FEDOSEEV the prospect of having
dinner together. No definite plans were made for this dinner. The
files also reflected that JAFFEE was residing in Room 877 of the
Mayflower Hotel, which is the same floor to which the unknown couple
proceeded on the night of July 9, 1954.. This information was not
available to the Agents conducting the surveillance on July 9, 1954.

Subject has been having marital difficulties and has been
living apart from his wife since 1/30/59. On 7/7/59 subject advised
that his wife had retained an attorney and desired to obtain a divorce
as soon as possible. Subject has also retained an attorney. Subject's
wife refused to agree to a property settlement and on 6/30/59 threatened
to tell the Soviets that subject is working with the FBI. Subject has
indicated that he is concerned about this in view of the adverse effect
it might have on his news career. Subject has been security conscious
(c)
and in his news gathering capacity has had numerous official contacts
with the FBI. Subject stated that his wife has knowledge of his contacts
with the Bureau and with the Soviets. She does not know that subject
has been furnishing information to the Bureau. Subject believes his
wife may be making idle threats or may be making this statement in
order to harm subject."
Subject is not involved in any intelligence operation.
He
does furnish good information concerning plans and thinking of top .
Soviet personnel at the United Nations. The New York Office has
recommended that we continue contact with subject and not take steps
to contact subject's wife, subject having indicated that he does not
feel that his wife will carry out her threats. It is pointed out that (c)
subject has good official reasons to contact both the Soviets and the
Bureau, and in view of his desire for security in connection with his
reporting career, it appears we can safely continue contact with him.

Reference my memorandum of 9-12-74 concerning contacts.
between Inspector Bowers and Don Donahue, Special Assistant to Senator
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), regarding the information and photographs Donahue
had obtained from Michael Canfield which Canfield believes are pertinent to
captioned matter.
Late on 9-12-74 Donahue advised Bowers he had learned from
Sam A. Jaffe, free-lance writer in Washington who has been involved with
Canfield concerning this matter, that Canfield apparently has made a deal with
Stern Magazine, a German publication described as the Life Magazine of Germany,
for its use of the photographs Canfield has collected and the information
concerning them. This magazine allegedly has arranged for a Swiss photographic
expert to examine the pictures in an effort to determine if the three "bums" shown
in the photographs might be identical to E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and
Thomas Arthur Vallee.
(a)
Supervisor John Ruhl of Washington Field Office advised Bowers
on the night of 9-12-74 that he had received a call from Jaffe who was seeking an
FBI evaluation of Canfield's reliability and the information Canfield had regarding
the Kennedy assassination. Jaffe told Ruhl he had given Canfield $300 as an
advance toward a possible story which he might write regarding the photographs
and information Canfield has developed. Ruhl furnished Jaffe no information. He
is submitting a communication to the Bureau on 9-13-74 furnishing full details of
his conversation with Jaffe. Ruhl also advised that Canfield had contacted him on
9-12-74 and promised to furnish him a set of the photographs he has obtained in
accordance with a promise he had made to Ruhl some time ago.NOT RECORDED

the information furnished by Donahue, and the originals of the photographs and notes
were returned to him on 9-13-74 by Bowers. Donahue had told Canfield he was

Donahue intends to tell Canfield that his contact does not believe the "bums" are
identical with Hunt and Sturgis and that he does not want to become involved in this
matter since he feels it is a situation which should be handled by the FBI.

Sam Jaffé
A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised a Special Agent (SA) of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), that the July
15, 1972 issue of "UPI Log", the house organ of
United Press International, reflected that "Sam Jaffe
Special UPI Correspondent has been granted a visa to
visit China. He will arrive in early August and will
file for the news wires, news pictures, and audio".
for the
The source advised that Jaffe is not on the
regular UPI staff, but has done free-lance work
UPI, such as covering the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
with a tape recorder. It was the source's opinion that
· the visa from Mainland China was not arranged for Jaffe
by the UPI as they would have sent somebody of more
consequence, if they had been able to get a visa. The
source also noted that during the UNGA, Jaffe
-
leaned to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations for
"behind the scene" type news rather than trying to be
friendly with the new Chinese delegation.
who
The source described Jaffe as a former Moscow
correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System,
is, or has had, numerous close contacts with Soviet nationals.
Source stated that Jaffe later worked as a correspondent
for the American Broadcasting Company in Southeast Asia
and also did free-lance work for UPI in New York.

On 2/25/71, JAFFE advised that NICHOLAS DANILOFF, a
United Press International correspondent is acquainted with
YAROCHEVSKIY and other Soviet correspondents in Washington,
D. C. JAFFE stated that DANILOFF speaks Russian fluently and
has dedicated himself to becoming an authority on Soviet
Union affairs. JAFFE recalled that some time ago DANILOFF
attempted to interest JAFFE in their pooling expenses and
arranging social affairs for Soviet nationals here. Purpose
of this was to give them an entre to the Soviets for background
information which might serve their correspondent careers.
JAFFE was not interested.
JAFFE stated that on the night of 2/25/71, DANILOFF
telephoned him and stated that he had turned down an offer to
become the head of the UPI office in Moscow. DANILOFF stated
the conditions were not right. JAFFE took this to mean that
the salary offered for the position was not enough.
Enclosed LHM has been classified "Confidential" as
it discloses investigative interest in a representative of a

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE
(On May 14, 1969, Jaffe advised that recently he had
had the Yarochevskiys to his residence for lunch. Present
also were an American correspondent and the latter's wife.).
On February 25, 1971, Jaffe stated he has had no
further contacts with Yarochevskaya, and has seen Yarochevskiy
only once since he had them to his residence for lunch in May
of 1969. Jaffe said he had seen Yarochevskiy in attendance at
an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, D. C., in
1969, date unrecalled. Yarochevskiy was walking alone and
carrying a camera, and it was not until he was right on top of
the Soviet did Jaffe realize his identity. They exchanged only
greetings. Yarochevskiy told Jaffe that they must get together
sometime.
Jaffe stated he had never known Yarochevskiy prior
to their meeting at the Hungarian Embassy reception on April 17,
1969. He had known Yarochevskaya previously, but only as one
of a number of individuals whose services as translators,
chauffeurs or house maids were made available to foreign cor-
respondents assigned to Moscow by a Soviet government agency
which Jaffe knew as "UPDK". It is Jaffe's impression now, that
Yarochevskaya had been assigned by "UPDK', as a translator, to
Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish national and a correspondent
for a Swedish newspaper, probably in 1965.
Jaffe recalled that both he and Bruger (phonetic) left
Moscow in 1965. Jaffe now has the impression that Yarochevskaya
was not married when he knew her in 1965. Jaffe did not know
her socially. He did not know her by her maiden name.
He recog-
nized her at the Hungarian Embassy reception in 1969 but only
after Yarochevskaya had refreshed his memory by recalling Moscow.
Jaffe said he believes that the "UPDK" was controlled
by the KGB (Ministry of State Security); however, all of the
persons employed by "UPDK" were not necessarily connected with
Soviet intelligence. Jaffe stated he has no information that
Yarochevskaya is, or was, connected with Soviet intelligence.

D. C. (WDC) on April 17, 1969. Yarochevskaya had looked
familiar to Jaffe. Yarochevskaya recognized Jaffe as having
formerly been a correspondent in Moscow, Union of Soviet Social-
ist Republics (USSR), and indicated that she had been one of
the translators for the Reuters News Agency in Moscow working
for John Miller, and that later she had been a translator for
Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish newspaper correspondent and
a friend of Jaffe.)
(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe indicated that Yarochevskiy
was attending the Foreign Language Institute in Moscow while
Yarochevskaya was working for Reuters. Later,
Later, YAROCHEVSKIY
attended Mc Gill University in Canada, and his wife had flown
from Moscow to meet her husband in Canada and they then traveled

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe offered his opinion that Yarochevskaya may be
connected with Soviet intelligence. He stated his opinion is
influenced by the fact that in her 1965 employment as a trans-
lator in Moscow, Yarochevskaya had the opportunity of becoming.
acquainted with foreign correspondents assigned to Moscow. His
opinion is influenced also by Yarochevskaya's subsequent
marriage to a personable and younger Soviet who received an
assignment to the United States as a Tass correspondent. Jaffe
stated Yarochevskaya is the only Soviet national whom he knows
who was employed by "UPDK" as a translator for foreign corres-
pondents, who later came to the United States.
Jaffe stated that when he served in Moscow he and
other foreign correspondents often heard references to a "Black
Tass". The rumors were that the Tass News Agency abroad per-
formed two functions. One was to gather news for dissemination
to the Soviet people through Soviet newspapers and periodicals.
The other, "Black Tass", was a form of intelligence gathering,
the results of which were never made known to the Soviet people
but were furnished directly to the KGB in Moscow for transmittal
to Kremlin officials. Jaffe stated that an example of the "Black
Tass" operation would be a Tass correspondent in Washington, D.C.
feeling out his contacts to ascertain what the thinking of gov-
ernment officials might be in regard to some phase of the United
States' foreign policy. Jaffe said that "Black Tass" would not
necessarily relate to espionage.
Jaffe stated the only contact he has had in recent
months with Soviet nationals occurred approximately in the end
of January, 1971, exact date unrecalled. Jaffe had just stepped
away from making a telephone call in the lobby of the Statler
Hilton Hotel, 16th and K Streets, N. W., Washington, D. C.,
when Oleg M. Sokolov, a First Secretary, Soviet Embassy, walked
into view. Sokolov greeted him warmly and asked Jaffe where he
had been keeping himself and why no one had seen him. Jaffe
replied that he has been in the Washington, D. C. area but that

Sokolov stated that that was not his (Sokolov's) fault and
added tbat there "are two people who like you, Bubnov and

must get together.
Jaffe stated Sokolov was referring to Igor D.
Bubnov, a Counselor, Soviet Embassy.
Jaffe stated that he does not intend to initiate
any contacts with the Soviets.

On June 30, 1959, informant met his wife to discuss
the matter of a settlement. During this discussion,
informant's wife threatened to ruin informant at CBS (his
employer), tell his children that he married her for her
money when they grow up and to tell the Russians that he is
working with the FBI. Informant said that he considered
these to be idle threats on the part of his wife%3B however,
he was very concerned about the effect his wife's threats
would have on his career as a news reporter if she carried
them out. Informant pointed out that he is very anxious
to travel to Russia and China and possibly represent CBS in
one of these countries at some future time. He said that
he would never be permitted to travel to these countries if
his wife ever said anything to the Russians about his talking
to the FBI.
Informant has always been most security conscious
about the possibility of it becoming known that he was
furnishing information to the Bureau, However, as a news

On January 14, 1971, at 10:30 a.m. Jaffe met with
HA THANH LAM, Director of Information, NLF, Paris, France;
however, due to a language barrier further discussions were
arranged for 4:30 p.m. that day when each could obtain the
services of a translator.

At 4:30 p.m. Jaffe returned to the offices of HA

Jaffe emphasized to HA THANH LAM the great concern
of the people of the United States for the U.S. prisoners of
war in North Vietnamese prison camps and the necessity of
allowing an unbiased group, including himself, of U.S. citizens
to visit all the prisoners in all the camps and not just a
so-called "representative number who may have been brainwashed."

understand English, and was attempting to have them
admitted to the UN grounds based on his own UN accreditation.
as a correspondent. He was unable to do this and had to

since at least 10/30/57, when he and a CBS camera crew
made a feature film in the NYO. Informant said that his
wife has been aware of the fact that he has been in
contact with the Bureau and that he has been in contact
with the Russians. However, she does not know that he
has been furnishing information to the Bureau about the
ans
on a continuing basis. Informant agreed that
she may have assumed that he is doing this or that her
threat to tell the Soviets that he is talking to the FBI
indicated she would do this even if it were not true, in
order to harm informant.
(c)
The voluntary aspect of informant's cooperation
was called to informant's attention, as well as the fact that
his cooperation must be on a strictly confidential basis at
all times. Informant acknowledges that this had been
repeatedly called to his attention. He was then asked
if he wanted to continue to furnish information to the
Bureau. Informant said that he has great respect for the
Bureau and he feels duty bound to continue to furnish
information to the Bureau about the Soviets. However, he
reiterated a statement he has made in the past to the effect
that he could not do anything other than furnish information.
(c)
Informant was told to bear in mind that he has
had open contacts with this office and if he ever has
occasion to explain his contacts with the Bureau, to do so
on the basis of his news reporting activities. It was also
suggested to informant that he refrain from bringing up the
threats made by his wife in conversation with her, particularly
the threat about telling the Russians he is talking to the
FBI.

he may be a KGB agent.

necessarily indicate that Shveitser also is a KGB agent. He
said it would appear more logical for a KGB agent to avoid

In Jaffe's opinion, Bruk has always been a "name-
dropper and during his conversation with Jaffe, Bruk mentioned
seeing or hearing from several American millionaire friends
of his. Bruk indicated he had contacted, apparently tele-
phonically, Armand Hammer, head of Occidental Petroleum
Corporation, in Los Angeles. He claimed to be in touch with
Charles Stewart Mott, philanthropist and former General
Motors Corporation executive; with industralist Cyrus Eaton,
and with a Vice President of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company,
name not recalled, who lives in a plush apartment on 5th
Avenue in New York City.
Following the party, Jaffe invited Bruk and Shveytser
to dinner and visited Bruk and Shveytser in the hotel room
they shared at the Harvick Hotel on 6th Avenue in New York
Gity. While there, Shveytser said the girl from whom Bruk
expected a telephone call had not phoned. Bruk replied he
was very anxious to hear from the girl, mentioning to Jaffe
that he would like to have intimate relations with her, but
he did not mention her name.
Jaffe recalled that in Moscow Bruk had the reputa-
tion of being a "girl chaser."
'girl chaser." During his current trip to
the United States, Bruk showed Jaffe a photograph of his wife,
Helen, and their daughter; and did not mention he had divorced
Helen and remarried. Jaffe indicated he previously heard
from members of the "Young Presidents of America" who visited
the Soviet Union that Bruk had divorced his first wife and
remarried, and had introduced members of the American group
to his new wife.

This office recommends that contact be
continued with informant as he has furnished valuable
information and is himself very security conscious and
désirous of furnishing information to the Bureau.
Consideration has been given to contacting informant's
wife, however, this would only serve to confirm what she
appears to have assumed and might possibly add impetus
to the situation existing between informant and his wife.
Should informant's wife carry out any or all of her threats,
informant understands that his cooperation has been
voluntary and will continue to be voluntary. Informant is
of the opinion that his wife will not carry out her threats.
This office will follow this matter closely and keep U
the Bureau advised.

with KGB (Soviet Committee for State Security). It was
obvious to Jaffe that Shveytser was very much upset by Bruk's
statement. Jaffe told Bruk his statement was ridiculous per
se adding that Shveytser was a very scholarly individual who
rarely had contacts with foreigners. Bruk replied facetiously
that this was the type of person KGB used; however; Jaffe got
the impression Bruk was not sincere in his comments about
Shveytser.
Jaffe said he inquired of Bruk concerning several
of his Soviet contacts and the latter replied: "I don't see..
them any more." Shveytser asked Bruk why he still was
friendly with him (Shveytser) when he had failed to retain
many of his other friends. Bruker replied: "Well, you
don't goad me and don't ride all over me." Shveytser replied:
"I have let you have it on occasion when you are wrong."
Jaffe added that although Bruk is a sharp individual,
Shveytser is on a much higher intellectual plane, and expressed
the opinion that Bruk probably did not fully comprehend many
of Shveytser's comments.
Jaffe stated he has always been convinced that Bruk
was a member of or "very close" to KGB and claims to have
frequently warned his American associates to be careful of
their contacts with Bruk since he was "always probing and pick-
ing your brains and reporting back" to KGB.
Jaffe learned from Bruk that Lyudmila Alekseyevna
Gvishiani, daughter of Soviet leader Alexey Kosygin, would
not depart the United States with the captioned group but
would remain in the United States to do research. Jaffe
understood she was a historian. He added that unlike some
members of captioned group, who reside in hotels during
their tour, Lyudmila Gvishiani lives at the Soviet Mission
to the United Nations (SMUN) in New York City. Jaffe learned

a
Jaffe told Bruk he could not believe Vinogradov could possibly
say anything like that. According to Jaffe, Bruk, who claims
he is Jewish, is "always trying to convince American Jews
there is no anti-Semitism in Russia." During the party, Bruk
gave a long-winded speech and later Jaffe "sounded off" in a
speech "and implied that he (Bruk) was the Soviet Union's
House Jew." Jaffe indicated this incensed Bruk.
Jaffe noted that the Soviets are quite obvious in
their efforts to convince foreigners they are not anti-Semitic.
He was told by some of the "Young Presidents of America" who
recently toured the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)
that the Soviets say to it that Bruk escorted them and that
their driver and their guides were Jewish. The Soviets did
not encourage the group, all of whom were of Jewish origin,
to visit any synagogues in the Soviet Union.
In an effort to convince Jaffe that the Soviets are
not anti -Semitic, Bruk asked Jeffe if he was aware that the
wife of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhney was Jewish. When
Jaffe answered in the negative, Bruk insisted that not only
is she Jewish but that "she has a heavy Jewish accent."
Bruk indicated he is now head of the English Sec-
tion of APN and obtained this position through his friend,
Boris (Sergeyevich) Burkov, former head of APN. Bruk added
that Burkov subsequently was demoted; however, this has not
affected his own career in APN and he conveyed the impression
his job is very secure. Brak stated he has thirteen people
working under him, all of whom he had "handpicked." Bruk
commented that Georgiy Bolshakov is no longer working for APN,
having been discharged because of heavy drinking.

On September 24, 1970, Jaffe telephonically advised
he attended the party given on September 18, 1970, at the
Harmony Club in New York City by members of the "Young Prasi-
dents of America" in honor of some members of captioned group.
Jaffe indicated about ten couples attended the party and the
only Soviets who attended were Mikhail Ilich Bruk, Aleksandr
Davidovich Shveytser, and a young Soviet, about 27-28 years
of ege, whose name he could not recall, but tho is the
Novosti Press Agency (APM) representative in New York.
Jaffe indicated that almost immediately be "got
off on the wrong foot" with Bruk when he asked Bruk about
his old friend, Yuriy Nikolaevich Vinogradov. Jaffe described
Vinogradov as his closest Soviet friend and said that while
employed at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations,
Vinogradov "was running around with girls and Russia pulled
him back;" however, he is still connected with the Soviet
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Bruk replied "he and I don't
see each other any more - we are not friends. When asked
why, Bruk responded: "He called my cousin a dirty Jew."

Bruk esked Jaffe about his current activities and
Jaffe indicated he was doing some free-lance writing and
giving lectures. In response to Bruk's questions, Jaffe said
his lectures are arranged by American Program Bureau, whose
main office is located in Boston, Massachusetts, and he nor-
mally receives o lecture fee of $750 less expenses but some-
times get $750 plus expenses per lecture. When asked if he
lectures on the USA, Jaffe told Bruk very few people are now
interested in this topic and he generally lectures about
Southeast Asia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Bruk appeared to be
greatly impressed by the amount of Jaffe's lecture fees and
he asked Jaffa: "Could you
"Could you arrange (speaking) tours for me?"
When the letter hesitated, Bruk indicated he felt sure that
even though he is a Communist, United States authorities
would permit him to visit the United States for a lecture
COUr. Jaffe suggested that Bruk contact the American Program
Bureau of Boston and Colsen Lee of New York City, pointing
out that they are managers in this field. Bruk appeared
genuinely interested in lecturing in the United States and
Jeffe commented he would not be at all surprised to see him
appearing as a guest lectures at United States universities.
Bruk indicated he had visited the United States last year,
and expected to come again, possibly next year, when he expects
to make an inspection tour of all Novosti bureaus abroad.
In discussing Aleksandr Shveytser, Jaffe indicated
he first met Shveytser a number of years ago in Helsinki
when Jaffe interviewed the Soviet poet Yevgeniy Yevtushenko
with the assistance of Shveytser during the Youth Festival in
Helsinki. Source described Shveytser as head of the English
Department at the Foreign Language Institute; a "very nice
guy," very humble and reserved in his conduct. Bruk, by
contrast, he considers a vain, boastful, "name-dropping" indi-
vidual whom he finds quite distasteful. While the three were
eating dinner, Bruk commented that Shveytser was connected

After his return from the USSR, Jeff Jaffe told
source that during a portion of the tour of the "Young
Presidents of America" in the USSR, they were escorted by
Mikhail Bruk. Source was told that "at one point in an
elevator in the Ukraine," Bruk mentioned source's name to
Jeff Jaffe and asked if source was a relative or friend of
his. When Jeff Jaffe informed Bruk that they were close friends,
but not related, Bruk asked Jeff Jaffe if he would mind
taking a letter or note to source. Jeff Jaffe indicated he
would be glad to do so, however, they parted that day
and he did not see Bruk again for a couple of weeks. Just
prior to his departure from the USSR, Jeff Jaffe met Bruk
again and reminded Bruk of the letter to source, pointing
out that he would be leaving the USSR very shortly, however,
Jeff Jaffe got the impression he "was talking to a dummy.'
Bruk gave absolutely no indication that he recalled ever
requesting him to deliver a letter or note to source.
Source stated that when Jeff Jaffe called him
September 14, 1970, and extended him the invitation to
attend the party for Bruk at the Harmony Club, which source
referred to as a very exclusive Jewish club, source inquired
if Bruk was aware that source might attend the party. Source
was told Bruk should not be aware of this. Source indicated
he would be in New York City on business Wednesday,
September 16, 1970, and might stay over to attend the party
that Friday. He indicated his wife would not be able to
attend because she has to remain home with their children.
Source indicated he has observed no indication
that Bruk has attempted to contact him during Bruk's current
visit to the United States; however, source noted that he
and his wife were out of town the previous weekend and would
not be aware if Bruk attempted to call him during that period.
In answer to a specific question, source indicated
he does not know whether or not KGB would have been aware
that he was a close friend of Jeff Jaffe prior to the
latter's trip to the USSR. Source stated it is possible
during his assignment in Moscow as ABC correspondent that
he could have mentioned Jeff Jaffe to Mikhail Bruk. He
said it also is possible that Bruk asked Jeff Jaffe about
him merely because both have the same surname.

currently visiting the United States with a Soviet group
which includes the daughter of Soviet Premier Kosygin.
Source stated he received a call the night of
September 14, 1970, from a very close friend, Jeff Jaffe,
President of Ward Candy Company, extending an invitation
for source and wife to attend the party. Source said Jeff
Jaffe is not a relative of source, however, source's father
at one time represented the Ward Candy Company. Jeff Jaffe
is one of a group of American millionaires referred to as
"Young Presidents of America, #
which recently visited the
USSR. Before making the trip, source told Jeff Jaffe he
might be contacted in the USSR by some of source's former
Soviet acquaintances, including Mikhail Bruk. Source
informed Jeff Jaffe that Bruk has acted as an interpreter
for Americans in Moscow, and has attended a number of
Pugwash Conferences as an interpreter, and source indicated
he suspected Bruk was connected with the Soviet Committee

RE:
SECRET
During an interview on July 25, 1969, by
Special Agents of the FBI, WF T-1, a former officer of
the KGB whose bona fides has not been established, but
who has furnished reliable information in the past,
identified Mikhail Ilich Bruk as an employee of the
International Department of the Soviet Ministry of Health
and a KGB agent "of one of apparatus of one of regions ·
of Moscow. Although not an agent of the Second Chief
Directorate (SCD), KGB, Bruk knew several doctors stationed
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and Bruk was used by officers
of the First (American Embassy) Section, First Department,
SCD, in their operations against American doctors stationed
at the U.S Embassy in Moscow.
WF T-2, another government agency which conducts
intelligence investigations, advised that WF T-1 furnished
the following handwritten comments concerning his knowledge
of the KGB operation against Samuel Adason Jaffe:
"Sam Jaffee, an American correspondent, arrived
in Moscow in 1961. The Chief of the 1st Section, 1st.
Department (Vladislav Mikhaylovich Kovshuk, settled a
question with 10th (Correspondents) Department, 2nd Chief
Directory (Directorate), that the 1st Department would be
working against Jaffee. I remember that he acquainted with
a ballet dancer from Finland who was finishing her studies
in Moscow and he was even thinking about his marriage with
her. At that time we were thinking about a recruitment of
this girl and I through (Johann) Preisfreund (identified
by WF T-1 as a Finnish businessman and a KGB agent) became
acquainted with her. As I found out there was not a sense
(useless) as she was going to return to Finland or to
Sweden..
"In 1962-1963 I found out from Kovshuk. (and
Gennadiy Ivanovich) Gryaznov (identified by WF T-1, as an
officer of the 1st Section, 1st Department, SCD, KGB) that
a senior case officer of the 1st Section, 1st Department,
Kus_kov, Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich was working with Sam
Jaffee. I don't know (if) he was an agent or an operative.
contact. I am not sure but it seems to me that he was
approached on the basis (of being) connected with women.

RE:
SECRET
"In March 1962 I have seen Sam Jaffee in Geneva.
He with other correspondents visited a pair of times
the Soviet representative there. He knew. several. Russian
diplomats and among them Suslov, Vladimir (Vladimir Pavlovich
Suslov; identified by WF T-1 as a Soviet diplomat and KGB
operative contact)."
During interviews of Samuel Adason Jaffe by
Special Agents of the FBI during March and April 1969,
he identified from photographs of numerous Soviets who had
been mentioned by WF T-1 as KGB agents, operative contacts
or officers, the following as his Soviet contacts -
Mikhail Bruk, Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov, Vladislav
Mikhaylovich Kovshuk and Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov
(known to Jaffe as "Slava"). Jaffe denied ever knowingly
being a KGB agent although he stated "Slava" might have
thought that he (Jaffe) was "Slava's" agent. Jaffe stated
he never told "Slava" or any other Soviet connected with
Soviet Intelligence anything other than his own observations
and opinions and denied furnishing any information from any
government documents. Jaffe indicated that after the
defection of WF T-1 was reported in newspapers, "Slava"
told Jaffe he had worked with him ("Slava") and knew several
of his contacts, including Jaffe. "Slava" then told Jaffe
"If you are ever asked anything about me, deny any knowledge
of me." Jaffe emphatically denied "Slava" ever made any
árrangements to get in touch with Jaffe after Jaffe left
the USSR and Jaffe denied ever having contact with "Slava"
after his departure from the USSR.

Informant was interviewed on 5/12/59 at which time
he advised that it is fairly certain that he and his wife
will be divorced and all possibilities of a reconciliation
have been exhausted. Informant presumes that his wife will
obtain the divorce in Reno, Nevada on a date as yet un-
determined. Informant does not anticipate any scandal in
connection with the divorce nor does he anticipate any
publicity unless it results from the inability of he and
his wife to resolve the problem of custody of their children.
During this interview, the informant advised that
he is still desirous of travelling to Red China as a news
reporter and toward this end he has written to the Chinese
Legation in London and forwarded three copies of "Face of Red
China", a pamphlet prepared by CBS concerning a television
presentation of the same name. In reply, he received a letter C
from the Third Secretary of the Chinese Legation, who advised
him that he was forwarding two copies of "Face of Red China" to
Peking and he was reapplying for a visa for the informant.
This Bureau will be kept advised of developments

NY T-l advised that Sam Jaffe, former American
Broadcasting Company (ABC) news correspondent in Hong Kong,
was present at the United Nations on September 9, 1969.
Source learned that Jaffe is no longer employed by ABC
and is presently seeking a new journalistic affiliation.
▼
Source indicated that Jaffe is interested in some
type of news agency being established in Europe by Simon
Malley.
Simon Malley, who has also been known as
Simon Menache (true name), Selim Malek and
Selim Menache, was born May 25, 1923, at
Cairo, Egypt. He is a United States citizen.
During November, 1962, NY T-2, another
government agency which conducts security
and personnel type investigations, advised
NY T-3 advised during January, 1963, that
Malley was possibly identical with a paid
source of a known Yugoslav intelligence
agent. Malley has been an accredited news
correspondent at United Nations Headquarters,
New York, representing a number of African
and Arab news media. In 1967 Malley published
a series of articles in the United States
concerning travel to China, and in particular
about the results of an interview with Chinese
Communist Premier CHOU En-lai.
Jaffe was heard to comment that he has been interested

Why fouch
The informant was interviewed on April 28,
1959, at which time he advised that he completed reading
the article concerning the FBI in the October 18, 1958
issue of "The Nation". The informant said that he was
very unimpressed with the content of the article and
was, of course, well aware of the fact that it contained
a mass of untrue information.
However, the informant said that he was not
personally acquainted with FRED J. COOK, the author,
and could not possibly be aware of the motive COOK might
have had for writing the article. The informant did
express the opinion that COOK must have thought that an
article subh as this would benefit him financially
although he does not know this to be true.
However, the informant said that the article
is indicative of the thinking of CAREY MC, WILLIAMS,
Editor of "The Nation", and "The Nation's" Publisher,
GEORGE G. KERSTEIN. The informant expressed the belief
that MC WILLIAMS and KERSTEIN would publish any article
which attacked the Bureau, the House on Un-American
Activities Committee, and almost any other government
organization.
"Ney
This office has considered obtaining a signed
statement of cooperation from the informant. It is not
believed that it would be advisable to obtain such a
signed statement from the informant, inasmuch as the
informant is a news reporter employed by the Columbia,

LIN also stated that Jaffe should include in his
letter the fact that he would be willing to leave his United
States Passport in Hong Kong and when Jaffe indicated to LIN
that he did not think that would be necessary, LIN stated
that maybe "they would not want you to come into China with

According to Jaffe, LIN is a very brilliant
individual well-versed in Soviet-Chinese relations and in
United States relations with China and the Soviet Union.
LIN appeared to be more concerned with Sino-Soviet relations
than with the United States. LIN commented that Cyrus Eaton
is very much interested in bringing China and the United
States together and stated that Eaton had sent him an article
from a Cleveland newspaper on anti-China hysteria whipping
up in the United States. - S-
In commenting on the recent newspaper accounts of
the speech of LIN Piao, Vice Primier, Communist China, LIN
stated that he thought it was premature to make any judgment
on the speech in its entirety; however, LIN ranked MAO Tse-tung,
CHOU En-lai, and LIN Piao almost equally. LIN stated that
he did not for a minute think that they believe the United
States or the Soviet Union would launch an atomic attack.
They do believe the Soviet Union is a serious threat but
they do not think either the United States or the Soviet
Union plan to launch a premature attack on them. In talking
about moderates, LIN stated that CHOU En-lai is not a
moderate%3B he is a tactician. LIN stated that MAO probably
is the only man who really understands the Chinese people
and believed MAO felt he had to start the Cultural Revolution
because there were people in China who were doing things for
their own self interest and MAO had to take action, including
the unleashing of the Red Guard to prevent this. LIN indicated
that he felt MAO has been successful. LIN stated that the
Soviet Union is much like the United States but MAO knew

The NYO agrees with WFO's conclusion that former
was an agent of the KGB during his service as
an ABC Television correspondent in Moscow from 1961 - 1965.
While he may not have considered himself as such, there is
no doubt the KGB regarded him as their agent. His contacts
with Soviet nationals since leaving Moscow in October, 1965,
are of such nature that it is not possible to conclude whe-
ther or not he continues to serve KGB interests. As noted
by WFO, the call he received recently from BORIS SEDOV of
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C., indicating SEDOV's
desire to show him a photograph is suspicious and could well
represent a KGB attempt to re-establish the former agent re-
lationship with him.

Ih
WFO's impression of former
as an aggres-
sive type, a fast talker and a smooth operator is an accurate
description and constitutes his basic qualifications for his
professional capacity, that of a television reporter-corres-
pondent. His former affinity for Russian matters led him
into numerous contacts with Soviet nationals here in the
United States and resulted in his being posted to Moscow in
1961. Following his expulsion from the Soviet Union and his
subsequent posting to Hong Kong, former turned his
attention toward the Red Chinese. He undoubtedly views rela-
tions with Red China as the future primary concern of the
United States and wants to be "in on the ground floor", so to
speak. While this desire, in and of itself, does not reflect -S-

On April 29, 1969, a confidential source, who

he had been informed of the following information by
Samuel Jaffe, identified below:
-
·S
Samuel Adason Jaffe, American Broadcasting Company
correspondent, recently learned of Dr. Paul Lin, a professor
at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, Subsequently, Jaffe
obtained additional information concerning LIN from a long-

Dickinson University, New Jersey, and from VAN LUNG, one
of the owners of the Yenching Palace Restaurant, 3524
Connecticut Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C., with whom
Jaffe dined in April, 1969. .-5-
On April 8, 1969, Jaffe telephonically contacted
LIN advising Lin that he had recently seen a New York Times
article dealing with the restoration of Canada-China
diplomatic relations and in which LIN's name appeared.
Jaffe informed LIN that he had been in Hong Kong for about
four years and was desirous of interviewing LIN. Additionally,
Jaffe informed LIN that he had interviewed CHOU En-lai in
1955 and was one of about 18 journalists invited to visit
the China Mainland in 1956. Jaffe also advised LIN that he
knew one SZETO KUNG of the New China News Agency in Hong -S -

LIN advised Jaffe to contact him later at which
time he would have a definite answer as to a possible
interview.-5-
On April 18, 1969, Jaffe recontacted LIN telephonically
at which time LIN indicated a reluctance to grant an interview
with Jaffe, feeling that granting such an interview would
leave the door open to interviews by many other journalists.
LIN, however, indicated a'desire to talk with Jaffe and after
exchanging telephone numbers and addresses a luncheon
engagement was set for April 28, 1969, at the faculty lounge
at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.
5-
On April 28, 1969, Jaffe flew to Montreal and met
LIN for lunch as previously arranged. Jaffe expressed to LIN
his strong desire to visit the China Mainland as a correspondent
and suggested that it might be possible that the Chinese
Government would permit foreign journalists to enter the
China Mainland in connection with the October celebrations.
LIN expressed the opinion that the October celebrations
would make no difference in the Government's policy concerning
the admittance of journalists. LIN suggested that Jaffe
write a letter by the first of June, 1969, to the Chinese
Government indicating that he desired to enter the China
Mainland as a private citizen, stating that he had interviewed
CHOU En-lai in 1955 as an American journalist and that if
he is permitted to enter China, he would like to continue
to pursue his career as a journalist. -S.
*
LIN indicated that the best way to establish contact
would be through the Chinese Embassy in Paris; however, when
Jaffe indicated that he knew no one there and the possibility
existed that the letter would not be forwarded to the proper
channels LIN stated he would "Be going East in early summer"
and he would be willing to see to it that the letter would
be properly dispatched. LIN also suggested that Jaffe's
letter be sent to him for perusal prior to its dispatch as
he possibly could be of assistance in wording the letter
correctly. LIN emphasized that Jaffe should indicate in his
letter that he was writing as a private citizen; however, he
should not try to hide that fact at he is a journalist
and state in the letter that he had previously been a journalist
for "The Nation" and that he would like to write and produce
films about China. 5-

that if these people were allowed to gain a foothold that
China would revert to the days of CHIANG Kai-shek when
there was unlimited corruption and he felt this had to be
settled once and for all, LIN stated that MAO, CHOU, and
LIN Piao were unanimous and there was no disagreement among
them. -5-
LIN stated to Jaffe that he would not set; foot
in the United States until the Vietnam war was ended; however,
later when LIN asked Jaffe if he was aware of the fact that
he (LIN) had been in Hong Kong in January, 1969, and Jaffe
replied in the affirmative, LIN stated "I am sorry, I am
not being completely honest. You know that I was in Seattle."
LIN then explained that en route from Hong Kong to Canada
he decided to return through Seattle to Canada against the
advice of his friends in Hong Kong who indicated that there
might be trouble. LIN stated that he was detained at the
airport (Seattle) for two hours, was interrogated, and all
personal effects were gone through. LIN stated he was sure
everything was photographed and he was furious. LIN stated
that he subsequently contacted an attorney, "the number one
professor of law at Harvard University," who was also incensed
over the incident.
5.
LIN inquired of Jaffe if he knew other news
correspondents, such as Harrison Salisbury, Doak Barnett,
or Frank Trader. LIN indicated that he knew Salisbury well.
and stated that he was sure Salisbury would speak well of
him (LIN). LIN also discussed Mortin Schafer, Canadian
correspondent, who entered China as a tourist and who
apparently concealed a camera in a cigarette lighter to take
photographs in China. Jaffe indicated that that was
unfortunate as it has made it more difficult for foreign
journalists to obtain permission to enter China.
on correspondent Milton Nash, LIN stated that he thought
Nash was "bright and understanding.'

In commenting
LIN was shown a United States newspaper article
concerning China and LIN expressed a desire to have a copy
of that article. Jaffe promised to send him a copy of the
article.

Jaffe also indicated he recently met a newly arrived
"Tass" correspondent whom he described as "sort of Ivy League,
and his wife, whom he described as a "very attractive blond
girl who remembered me from Moscow." Jaffe initially did not
remember her but later recalled she was a translator for Reuters
News Agency in Moscow and later worked for a Swedish correspondent
in Moscow who is a friend of Jaffe. Jaffe remarked this couple

On April 29, 1969, Jaffe telephoned an agent of the
WFO, FBI and on the same date voluntarily appeared at the WFO
for interview.
Farewell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev
C
Jaffe advised he attended a farewell party for Bogachev
at the Aviation Club. According to Jaffe, Bogachev appeared to be
"very cold" and "a little stiff" in his contact with Jaffe. Jaffe
asked him what he intended to do and he replied: "I might go back
to 'Tass."" Jaffe indicated the Soviets gave Bogachev an
"atmosphere weather gauge" as a farewell gift.
Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov
"
Jaffe said Sedov has not yet returned his calls. Jaffe

Contact with Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko
U
Jaffe stated he attended the Hungarian Independence
Day reception. He arrived late and spent considerable time
talking to Captain Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko, Naval
Attache assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.
Vashchenko indicated he did not think the dispute between
Russia and China will mean anything. He does not see any real
trouble now between the two countries. According to Jaffe,
Vashchenko did not "spout" the "Soviet line." Jaffe said this
was the first time he was able to get a Soviet military man
to talk to him for any length of time.
(Vashchenko has been reported as connected
with GRU.)

Jaffe said Inna "is more outgoing than the others
(Soviets)." Both Boris and Inna speak good English. Jaffe
indicated that Boris was going to the Foreign Language Institute
in Moscow while Inna was working for Reuters News Agency. He
said John Miller, Inna's boss, knew Boris. Jaffe stated Boris
followed up his studies at the Foreign Language Institute by
attending McGill University. He said Inna flew from Moscow to
meet Boris in Canada and they then flew to the United States.
C
Jaffe said Boris, while studying at McGill University,
met a Chinese professor at McGill University whom Jaffe interviewed
at McGill University on April 28, 1969. According to Jaffe, this
Chinese professor is closely connected with, if not a part of,
the Chinese Communist Government.
Jaffe said he learned from Inna that Yuri Nikolaevich
Vinogradov, affcontact of Jaffe in Moscow and in the United States, C
is now divorced.

Press Officer indicated Sedov had been in New York but was now
back in Washington, D.C. The Press Officer told Jaffe he would
tell Sedov to get in touch with Jaffe. According to Jaffe, the
Press Officer, whose name he cannot recall, displayed great
interest in Jaffe and "practically begged" Jaffe to invite him
to his home. The Soviet stated: "You haven't forgotten? You said
you would have me over. You are a great fellow. You will have me
over?" Jaffe said he replied in the affirmative. According to
Jaffe, the Soviet "made very sure I knew he was Jewish, which was
very obvious." Jaffe associates the Soviet's name with the Russian
word for "potato."
Boris Valentinovich Yarochevskiy, "Tass" Correspondent,
and his wife, Inna Grigoryevna Yarochevskaya
Jaffe said he attended a Hungarian reception April 17,
1969 which also was attended by several Soviet journalists. The
Soviets spent considerable time during the reception, which was
held just after the United States "spy" plane was shot down by
the North Koreans, in conversation with Bob McCloskey of the
United States Department of State.
C
Jaffe continued: "I met this young guy - the newest
arrival from 'Tass' - Boris (last name unknown) (LNU) and Inna
(his wife)." Jaffe.described Boris as "very, very Ivy League"
and "quite bright." Inna, who looked familiar to Jaffe, came.
over to Jaffe and stated: "Sam, how are you? You don't remember
me? No? You are still a legend in Moscow. There is still talk
about you.
" Inna then indicated that she was one of the translators
for Reuters News Agency in Moscow, working for John Miller. Her
last job was translator for Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish
newspaper correspondent in Moscow and a friend of Jaffe.
Jaffe stated Boris apparently studied at McGill University
in Canada and Inna apparently joined her husband in Canada just
prior to his assignment in Washington, D.C. Inna indicated she and
Boris have only been in Washington, D.C. about one or one and one-half
months.

Jaffe said he mentioned to Petrovskiy that Inna had
told him Yuri Vinogradov is now divorced. Although Petrovskiy
did not acknowledge that he was aware of this, he stated he
was not surprised since he knew he had separated from his wife.
Yuri Vinogradov is now in the "World Organization Department"
of the Soviet Foreign Ministry as "an assistant to an assistant."
Jaffe got the impression that Vinogradov's job is not important.:
S
Petrovskiy mentioned that Viktor Mikhailovich Sukhodrev
and his wife also are now divorced. Jaffe said she had been in
"show business." Jaffe continued: "Viktor decided he wanted a
diplomatic career. He is working in the Foreign Ministry, but
whenever they need a translator, they grab him." Petrovskiy
indicated Sukhodrev is not happy with his new job because he
likes to travel and "be a big shot." While working at the
Foreign Ministry, Sukhodrev occasionally is used as an
interpreter in important cases.
Petrovskiy indicated that Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov
is now "what you would call policy planner for United States
affairs at the Foreign Ministry. He has the title of Ambassador.
He has a very important job now."
(Suslov has been identified by WF T-2, a former
KGB officer whose bona fides has not been
established but who has furnished reliable
information in the past, as a Soviet diplomat
who is an operative contact of KGB.)
Jaffe said he learned from Petrovskiy that Yuri

Nikolaevich Chernyakov, Press Officer, Soviet Embassy, Washington,
D.C., might be recalled. He also learned that Mikhail Nikolaevich
Smirnovskiy, who used to be Chief of the American Department of
the Soviet Foreign Ministry "is ill" and has been replaced as
Ambassador to England. Jaffe got the impression it was a
"political illness."
Jaffe said Mira Petrovskaya is now working for the
Aeroflot Section of Intourist in New York because "she decided
she would keep herself busy."

Soviets with whom he had had contact either in the United States
or in Russia. When making these identifications on March 21, 1969,

Jaffe continued: "Petrovskiy was concerned because
'The Washington Post' is on a deliberate kick to defame him."
Jaffe indicated Petrovskiy has been accused of being responsible
for the Soviet Union using the United Nations (UN) for its own
advantage. Jaffe stated: "He (Petrovskiy) admits he made a
mistake. He thought because it was made public and was given to
a group, he was able to publish it, and this has caused
embarrassment for the UN." Petrovskiy told Jaffe that "Robert
Esterbrook has had two articles sort of attacking me. I admit
I made a mistake. I was wrong. I told the Secretary General
(of the UN) this. I didn't know you had a group through which
this should be cleared. Why should this man continue to attack
me? Two articles in 'The Washington Post' and one in the 'Los
Angeles Times.'" Jaffe said Petrovskiy indicated the Secretary
General of the UN was upset over the incident and Petrovskiy
wonders if he should try to "pull the book back" (from publication),
if it is still possible to do so.
J
Jaffe advised that the next day he visited the UN and
talked to Petrovskiy and (ENU)"Loginov," who is (Soviet) Press
Officer here (Washington, D.C.) and used to be Press Officer in
Moscow. We had a conversation. He said he would be in Washington
this week and would look me up. Loginov started to discuss the
Chinese. I said I would like to go there. He said he had been in
China and speaks Mandarin. He said he was very skeptical about one
point in (United States President) Nixon's press conference, why
The brought up Czechoslovakia in the press conference. 'Do you
(Jaffe) think it was a slam at us (Soviets)?' He seemed to read
a lot of stuff into it."
(Vadim Petrovich Loginov was in the United States
October 27, 1959-November 25, 1959 as a group leader
and member of a Soviet delegation of students. He
was again in the United States September 4,1967-
November 29,1967 as a temporary trainee at the
Soviet Embassy. He returned to the United States
February 12, 1968 as First Secretary, Political
Division, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.)

Identification of Soviet Nationals Employed in the
Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, Moscow
i
Jaffe was shown photographs of several Soviet nationals
and he identified Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin, Boris Dmitrievich
Pyadyshev, and Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko as employees of the
Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, with whom he had
contact while in Moscow. He was shown a photograph of Fedor
Yakovlevich Semenov, but he did not recognize this individual
and stated he was not identical with the Fedor Semenov he knew
in Moscow as the Number Three Man in the Press Department of
the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
C
Jaffe was asked if he observed any indication that
any of these individuals were connected with Soviet Intelligence.
Jaffe replied in the negative%3B however, he stated Boris Fyadyshev
"is a very strange guy. A young man. Vladimir (Petrovskiy) told
me he had risen to Number Two man (in the Press Department)."
Jaffe recalled that on one occasion when he was accompanying.
N. K. Khrushchev on a trip, he invited Zamyatin to have a drink.
Although Zamyatin ordinarily did not drink with Jaffe, he
accepted his invitation on this occasion. Zamyatin indicated
he was very tired of his position in the Press Department and
planned to retire and write under a pseudonym. According to.
Jaffe, Mira Petrovskaya said she went to school with Pyadyshev.
Jaffe said he found Pyadyshev to be a very bright, but very cold
individual. Jaffe stated: "I have always felt that Mira
Petrovskaya was connected with KGB;" however, she has never made
any intelligence approach to Jaffe.
Jaffe then mentioned a Soviet national named Yuri
Bekov (phonetic) and stated: "There is no question that he was
KGB. (He was connected with) Press Department. He could do more
things. than the Press Department, but he was supposed to be an
arm of the Press Department on trips. He knew all the overt
KGB men."
(Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been reported
as connected with the Soviet Committee of
Information.)

Jaffe indicated he did not recognize the name's of

and Mikhail Sagatelyan. He remarked that many of these individuals
have rather common Russian names. He made the following additional
remarks concerning individuals depicted in these photographs.
He said he is sure he met Evgeniy Gromakovskiy; however,
this name is not familiar to him and he may have known him as
Granovskiy. He continued: "I think I knew him, possibly at 'Tass.
I don't think (I knew him) in Moscow." Jaffe stated he did not
have close contact with this individual.
In regard to Vadim Biryukov, Jaffe stated: "I always
thought that Vadim might have been with KGB. He got 'Life' into
fantastic places. Then he worked for' APN Novosti.' Now I under
stand he is no longer with 'APN.' He was really close to Ed
Stevens.'

When shown a photograph of Vladimir Krivoshey aka
Krivitskiy, Jaffe stated: "He looks like a Russian. He looks
familiar." Jaffe indicated he was sure whether or not he had
7
contact with this individual and he does not recognize him by
name.
In regard to Vyacheslav Kevorkov aka Chitashvili,
Jaffe indicated he definitely knew this individual, but not
under the name Kevorkov. He may have known him as Chitashvili,
and recalled he was using the "cover of the secretary of the
Union of Journalists."
In commenting on Yuriy Fedorov, Jaffe described him
as "an evil S.O.B. Apparently an expert on China. 'Slava'
(Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov aka Mislyuk, Kiselov, Kislov)
said 'Fedorov is very upset with you (Jaffe), feels you don't
like him. You never have him up to your home. You have other
journalists (there).' I said I didn't like him. He said 'you
should see him.' 1. just didn't. He just dropped out of sight."

Jaffe indicated he recognized the individual depicted
in the photograph of Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev as an individual
with whom he had contact; however, this name is not familiar to
him. He then stated he recalled an individual named Timofeyev
(phonetic) who accompanied Khrushchev on a trip to the United
States. Jaffe referred to this individual as a "mystery man"
who was very close to Khrushchev. Jaffe indicated that this.
Timofeyev was not the individual depicted in the photograph of
Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev.
(On March 21, 1969 Jaffe identified a photograph
of Timur Timofeevich Timofeev as a correspondent
who "at one time stood very high in Soviet hierarchy"
and "came here on Khrushchev trip." Jaffe was told
'he stood very high with Khrushchev and then some-
thing happened.")

Jaffe was questioned specifically about Yevgeniy
Nikolayevich Aleshin. He stated the name is not familiar to
}
him but he recognizes the face and possibly he met him in the L
United States rather than in Moscow. He said he cannot recall
that Aleshin gave any indication he was connected with KGB.
Jaffe again identified Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich
Kuskov as the Soviet national connected with KGB known to him
first as "Slava" and later as Vyacheslav Kiselov. He did not
associate the name Kuskov with "Slava".

Jaffe was questioned concerning previous comments he
made that photographs of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Gavrilenko
resemble "Slava's" KGB superior. Jaffe stated: "I can't say it
(photographs of Gavrilenko) was 'Slava!s' boss. He was less Russian
looking. I definitely have seen this guy (Gavrilenko) but the
` name doesn't ring a bell."
When shown a photograph of Viktor Nikolaevich Titov,
Jaffe commented: "This could be 'Slava's' boss." Jaffe said
"Slava's" boss was a "fellow like this (Titov), younger than
!Slava. (I was) never introduced by name. All he ('Slava') said
was, 'this is my boss.' He ('Slava's' boss) said he can speak a
little English. 'Slava' said, 'Better let me translate.' All we
did was go over the accident report. At the end he said, 'I am
aware of the case.' Then they spoke in Russian. (Slava' asked)
'What do you think now that you have met Sam?' (The other Soviet
replied) 'I would think there isn't anything to worry about.
"Slava" then indicated to Jaffe that if his boss said there was
nothing to worry about, Jaffe could forget about the incident.
Later "Slava" tore the accident report up in Jaffe's presence.

United States Correspondents Currently in Moscow
Jaffe stated he recently received a letter requesting
his advice from Irving Chapman who has been the American Broad-
casting Company (ABC) correspondent in Moscow for only about
three months. Jaffe said Ken Bernstein, who has been the National
Broadcasting Company (NBC) correspondent in Moscow for three
years, got an exclusive concerning the Chinese-Soviet border
clash. Jaffe stated: "The pressure is on 'Irv' (Irving Chapman),"
who has been told, "if you can't do the job, you might as well"
get out."
1
In his letter, Chapman said, "I don't know how he
got the film. I guess he got it through APN Novosti." Chapman
reached the conclusion NBC apparently obtained the exclusive
through Viktor Louis. Chapman stated: "I don't know how much
NBC gives him, but he is riding around in a Porsche (automobile)."
Jaffe then stated: "'Slava' was interesting, a Stalinist. Louis
is a capitalist. I had very little to do with him. I was at his
apartment once and I heard about his house." Jaffe indicated that
because of his wife's curiosity, he and his wife visited the
house of Viktor Louis, which he described as very "plush."
Jaffe said Chapman "asked me for my contacts and
how he can defeat NBC." Chapman's letter stated: "I met many
of your friends. They send best regards and inquire about you."
Chapman mentioned three individuals, Vetler Prog (phonetic),
who is connected with the State Committee on Radio and Television
of the Soviet Foreign Ministry; Mikhail Bruk, and Viktor Louis.
The letter stated: "They all indicate there has been no corres-
pondent with ABC (in Russia) since Sam Jaffe left. They don't
think much of Watkins (Jaffe's successor as ABC correspondent
in Russia)." According to Jaffe, Chapman's letter indicated that
Jaffe's Soviet contacts suggested that "if Jaffe was there he
would have such an exclusive." Chapman asked: "Can you help me
out and tell me what you can do with Louis?" Chapman's letter
concluded: "If a KGB agent like Viktor Louis is good enough for
S. Jaffe, he certainly is good enough for I. Chapman."
Jaffe said his advice to Chapman was: "Play one against
the other, as well as with Viktor Louis, through the Embassy."

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe said it was

through a telephone call to Lyudmila at APN. Prior to contacting
Lyudmila, Jaffe had not been able to confirm the story.

Jaffe explained that he advised Chapman to clear all his contacts
through the American Embassy, Moscow.
Jaffe indicated he was surprised when he learned
recently that Viktor Louis had travelled to Taiwan and had
written an article praising the Taiwan government.
Jaffe concluded: "Ken Bernstein should get out of
there (Russia). He is a bachelor. I know he is shacking with
Russian girls. I saw him in Hong Kong and asked, 'Are you going

Moscow Journalists Suspected by Jaffe of Being
Connected With KGB
Jaffe was asked if he considered Edmund Stevens to
be connected with KGB. He replied: "How can you stay in that
country that long and get the things that he got without having
some connection with KGB? How can he have this beautiful house?
Then, when it is torn down (because of a roadbuilding project),
he winds up in an ex-embassy!" In commenting on the Soviet wife
of Stevens, Jaffe stated, "She is weird. How does she get Soviet
art out of the country?" Jaffe stated Stevens appears to have
dropped out of the newspaper field. Jaffe said he was once a
syndicated writer, but "not any more. He had a deal in caviar
and vodka, selling vodka and caviar to the Kremlin." Jaffe
described his daughter, Anastasia, as a "nut" and said he understands
she is now married.
Jaffe emphatically expressed the opinion that Stevens,
Viktor Louis and Henry Shapiro are connected with KGB. He described
""more Russian than the Russians.'
Shapiro as "an evil little man,
Jaffe stated: "He should get out and teach. He is no writer."

In discussing Viktor Louis, Jaffe stated he "never
had any doubts that he (Louis) was with KGB." In discussing
Louis, Jaffe indicated that all important "exclusives" in Moscow
pertained to security matters and not to "leaks" from the Soviet
Foreign Ministry concerning political matters; therefore, KGB
must have been responsible for the "exclusives." Jaffe indicated
that Louis was the recipient of many such "exclusives." Jaffe
also indicated that Louis appears to live far better than other
correspondents from foreign countries and is permitted to
travel extensively abroad, including countries such as the
United States and Taiwan. Jaffe indicated that these factors
convince him that Louis is connected with KGB.
C.
Jaffe concluded: "That is what they (KGB) do. They set
this man up. If you want information," then contact a man such C
as Viktor Louis.
Jaffe's Future Plans
Jaffe stated: "I like to keep contact with these people
(Soviet and Chinese nationals) because it will pay off in the
long run." Jaffe indicated he expects to attend the May Day
celebration at the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. He also indicated
he was still actively trying to obtain an assignment as a newspaper
correspondent in Mainland China but has done nothing more concerning
his desire to obtain a similar assignment in Cuba.
In discussing his desire to go to Mainland China, Jaffe
indicated that he had interviewed Chou En Lai in 1955 and was one
of 18 foreign correspondents selected to visit China in 1956. In
the Fall of 1965 he went from Moscow to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, fol-
lowing his ouster from the Soviet Union, and conveyed to Chinese
newsmen in Belgrade his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in
Mainland China. While in Hong Kong he made the same desire known
to Szeto Kung of the Chinese News Agency. Finally, on April 28,
1969 he indicated to a Chinese professor at McGill University in
Canada his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in China and the
professor agreed to forward a letter from Jaffe indicating

of whom have been identified by informants as being connected
with KGB or GRU. Characterizations of these Soviets have been
included in the LHM; however, no attribution to sources was
included in order to protect those sources who have not been
surfaced. Although sources such as
and and
_, who furnished information regarding Soviet>
Intelligence Service connections of some of JAFFE's contacts,
have been surfaced, other sources such as

have furnished information regarding many of
JAFFE's contacts. To attribute characterizations by C
(5)
of being connected with KGB of numerous Soviets and characteriza-
tions by
of being connected with GRU of many other
Soviet contacts of JAFFE, would clearly suggest that the FBI
those establishments in the United States.
As indicated in reWFOlet 2/28/69 requesting Bureau
authority for interview of subject, approved by Bulet 3/12/69,
JAFFE was invited to WFO and showed no reluctance to do so.
Since he was on general assignment, he called his office at
the beginning of each of the first two interviews to give the
telephone number at which he could be located. He was contacted
by his office during the first interview. On the third interview,
he had what he called a "Bellboy" signalling device which he
said would receive a signal from his office after which he
would call. He indicated he used this device to avoid the .
office giving out the FBI telephone number to anyone, including
Russians, who might call him.
JAFFE gave the appearance of being a very aggressive,
fast-talking, smooth operator. Prior to each interview, he had
been drinking, but was not intoxicated.
U
The first two interviews were handled as planned, by
asking him to recount his experiences and contacts with Russians
in the USSR and Hong Kong, including his experiences with "Slava".
He expressed no hesitancy in talking about his contacts, but
constantly spoke in generalities, tending to "playdown" his
relations with "Slava". He furnished more detail after specific

or leading questions were put to him. For example, the disclosures
he made to
were confirmed in interview only after leading
questions.
During the interview on 3/27/69, JAFFE was advised
that interviewing agents were concerned regarding a number of
aspects of his relationship with the Soviets and the FBI. For
example, it was noted he had now disclosed considerable additional
information about his relationship with "Slava", more than
previously; that because of his past relationship with Agents
of the NYO, the FBI had a right to expect that he would make
immediate full disclosures of such relationship and his failure
to do so raised questions about the relationship, whether he
has been recontacted by KGB since he left Russia, etc. It also
was pointed out that his expulsion from Russia after he had
been ordered to Hong Kong and his replacement named, seemed -
somewhat suspicious, particularly since he had been warned that
a defector knew of his relationship with "Slava"%3B that this
defector had in fact reported this relationship and alleged
that he had been an agent of and furnished information to "Slava".
He was urged to now furnish complete information regarding his
relationship with the KGB and to "square the record" with the
FBI.
C
G
JAFFE did not lose his composure at any time during
the interviews, but, as indicated in the LHM, when pressed on
3/27/69 on his relationship with KGB and his failure to make
complete disclosure to FBI, he offered the lame excuse, his
fear of "Slava", but conceded this was a poor excuse for not
reporting the relationship after his return to the United States.
JAFFE was emphatically told that the FBI had not had
any contact with the American Broadcast Company (ABC) with
regard to him and had not in any way labelled him as a security.
risk to any other person or agency. He replied that someone
had done so and indicated he was aware that some ABC officials
are very close to CIA.

JAFFE seemed very concerned that ABC did not give
him the diplomatic "beat" or the State Department "beat" which
he seemed to consider his right. It appears he will continue
contacts with the Soviet Bloc people as a means of trying to
get such assignments. To preclude his use of cooperation with
the FBI as a means to this end, he was very emphatically told
that the decision for such continued contacts was strictly his
decision and the FBI would not ask him to do so.
6
It also is apparent that JAFFE is intensely interested
in getting an assignment to China or Cuba. He denied that he
had any KGB instructions to do so, but this, of course, is a
definite possibility. It is not possible to accurately assess
this possibility at this time, and it also is not possible to
conclude whether he is or is not still in contact with KGB
and acting as an agent. He emphatically denied any intelligence
contact since he left Moscow; however, the call which he said
he received; from BORIS SEDOV desiring to show him a photograph
seems unusual and is possibly contrived.
JAFFE is in current contact with Chinese nationals,
which he is reporting to
who appears to be
very friendly with JAFFE and, of course, is interested in
getting him into China.

Since the interview of 3/27/69, JAFFE has
telephonically furnished some general information regarding
his current contacts with Soviet and Satellite nationals and
his unsuccessful efforts to recontact SEDOV.
Based on the interviews, WFO believes that we should
continue to accept information volunteered by JAFFE regarding
his contacts with Soviets, Satellites, and Chinese; however,
it is believed no effort should be made at this time to direct
his activities or to give him assignments, particularly since
the possibility exists he would attempt to use any such
relationship to support his attempts to get certain assignments
from ABC, or otherwise advance his career. WFO will follow
this policy, USCI
Lab
In the event JAFFE later reports that he has been
recontacted by KGB to work in the United States, this matter S
will be re-evaluated and appropriate recommendations made.
WFO will keep this file in a Pending status for a
limited time to follow JAFFE's relationship with SEDOV and
to see if this develops into a KGB follow-up. If it does not,
the case will be closed.

i. Informant's Potential for Advancement
☐
(c)
Informant is in a good position to continually (c)
meet additional Soviet and satellite personnel, thereby
increasing his value to the Bureau.
j. Stability and Reliability
Information furnished by informant has been found
to be reliable. Much of this information has been substantiated
by other live sources who have, on occasion, furnished the
same information as informant, or who have furnished information
with respect to informant's contacts with individuals about
whom he has subsequently furnished information. Information
furnished by the informant with respect to movement of certain
individuals have proved reliable, based upon known activities
of these individuals.'
Informant has shown no signs of instability,
however, informant does have personal problems involving
marital difficulties which have caused him great concern of
late. He has been separated from his wife since 1/30/59,
and in spite of his desire to effect a reconciliation, his
wife is not interested in this. No legal action has been
started by informant or his wife, at this time, however, a
divorce will probably be sought by informant's wife in the not
too distant future.
k.
Indoctrination Against Disclosure
The informant has been repeatedly reminded of
the necessity for keeping his relationship with the Bureau
in strictest confidence. Informant in turn has repeatedly
expressed utmost concern about the possibility that it
might become known that he was furnishing information to the
Bureau. Informant has said that if this became known, it
would jeopardize his career as a news reporter.

Samuel Adason Jaffe, born June 19, 1929, San
.
Francisco, California, advised agents of the New York Office,
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in July, 1958, that he
was taking two Soviet employees of the Soviet Mission to the
United Nations (SMUN) to dinner. At that time Jaffe was a
Columbia Broadcast System (CBS) News Correspondent at the
United Nations (UN). Jaffe subsequently furnished voluminous
information concerning his contacts with Soviet nationals to
the FBI from 1958 until November, 1961 when he assumed the
position of American Broadcast Company (ABC) Television Cor-
respondent in Moscow.

Jaffe was aware that upon his arrival in Moscow
late in 1961, he was kept under surveillance for four solid
weeks. Kislov called this to Jaffe's attention and told Jaffe
that he had aggravated some Soviets who were surveilling him
because of his activities. Kislov then went on to discuss
the fact that the Soviets had exposed several United States
Embassy officials as intelligence agents recently. Kislov
told Jaffe that these were strictly retaliatory measures taken
by the Soviets because of Soviet nationals associated with
the United Nations who had been exposed in the United States.
Kislov also asked Jaffe to bring him a miniphone 6
recording machine from the United States.
1
Jaffe said that during his stay in Moscow he has
never experienced anything which would indicate that the
Soviets were attempting to compromise him with the exception
of the one incident related herein.
.C
Jaffè made one observation stemming from his visit
in Moscow to the effect that the younger generation Soviet is
more free thinking and independent than his elders. The younger
generation Soviets, in Jaffe's opinion, do not have the unbending
fear of the Soviet regime which has been characteristic of the
Soviet people in the past.
•
Yuri Vladimirovich Fedorov
was in the United States
from January 20, 1962 until
May 1, 1962, with the visit
of the Soviet Children's
Art Exhibit to the United
States. He is a Senior
Editor of the periodical "East
and Latin America" of the
Novosti Press Agency.
Jaffe was able to identify a photograph of Fedorov
as the individual known to him in Russia.
The Novosti Press Agency
was newly established in
Russia in February, 1961.

After Jaffe dropped the Soviet male at his.
home, he proceeded to drive toward Galina's home. At
Galina's instruction, he made a turn in, an area of Moscow
which was unfamiliar to him. After making this turn he
hit a deep hole and blew out several tires on the Chevrolet
automobile which he was driving. Jaffe said that he sent
Galina to obtain police assistance and, after she left, he
: noticed four male individuals driving by in an old Pobeda
automobile. Shortly thereafter several truck drivers came
by and assisted Jaffe, Fortunately, he had several spare
tires in his automobile. At about 3:15 a.m., the police came
by but showed no interest in Jaffe and apparently made no
report of his situation. Jaffe then returned to his apart-
ment.
Some time after Jaffe returned to his apartment,
he received a telephone call from Galina. Galina told Jaffe
that she had to see him immediately. She said that she was
near the American Embassy in Moscow and Jaffe arranged to
meet her in the vicinity of the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow:-
I
When Jaffe met Galina he found that she had
apparently been physically abused as she bore scars and
marks on her arms and face. Galina told Jaffe that after
she left him she went to telephone for assistance. As she
was leaving the telephone from which she made the call to the
'police, she was accosted by two men. She immediately resisted
efforts of these men to detain her and as she ran from them
she was accosted by another man who knocked her to the ground.
She told Jaffe that she was then taken to a police station
where she was questioned at length about her association with
Jaffe. The individuals questioning her wanted to know how long
she had been seeing Jaffe, where she had been with Jaffe and
they were particularly interested in her travels with Jaffe
during the last several days. They wanted to know if Jaffe
was in love with her.
"
Galina told Jaffe that they wanted her to sign
a statement to the effect that she would not see Jaffe again.
These individuals also wanted to know what, if anything, Jaffe
had given her by way of gifts.
Galina told Jaffe that at approximately 6:00 a.m.
another individual came in and questioned her about, the same
matters but did so in a very polite and refined manner. This
was in contrast to the manner in which she had been questioned
immediately subsequent to her arrival at the police station.
Galina told Jaffe that she was quite upset and a doctor was also
called to administer a sedative to her.

suggested that information which Jaffe obtained concerning
a dispute in the Kremlin. came from someone in the American
Embassy in Moscow. Jaffe denied that his source was in
the American Embassy in Moscow but refused to tell Kislov
the identity of his source.

Kislov then proceeded to give Jaffe a ✓ complete
run down of everything he had done in Russia. He named females
Jaffe had dated and told Jaffe all about his association with
Galina. He went on to tell Jaffe that Galina was formerly a
designer in a factory in Moscow but that she would be given a
trial and be banned from Moscow.
When Jaffe asked Kislov about the story being
prepared for "Komsomolskaya Pravda", Kislov told Jaffe that
he liked him. He said that he might be able to kill the story
while at the same time he looked at his watch. He then said
that he would see what he could do, expressing the opinion that
he could probably kill the story. Before Jaffe left Kislov's
company, Kislov said that he would like to see Jaffe again and
Jaffe agreed to see him although no definite arrangements were
made.
: On the following morning Kislov called Jaffe and
told Jaffe that he had succeeded in killing the story. He
asked Jaffe to have lunch with him and a date was made. At
lunch Kislov told Jaffe that he had been in the United States.
He then told Jaffe that it was necessary to watch Western cor-.
respondents in Moscow as the Soviets know that American citizens
pay a great deal of attention to material written in newspapers.
He said it was necessary for the Soviets to be careful what they
permit Western correspondents to write and say. He said the
Soviets would like to know Western reaction to Soviet moves par-
ticularly Soviet moves in situations like the Cuban crisis.
Kislov then went on to tell Jaffe that he was lucky
to be in Moscow and it was only because of his superiors that he
was granted a visa. He told Jaffe that Jaffe killed his chances
for obtaining a Soviet visa of his own accord because of his
conduct during the trial of Francis Gary Powers on espionage
charges in Moscow in 1960. At this time Kislov said that the
Soviets concluded that Jaffe was employed by the Central Intel-
ligence Agency (CIA) and had been assigned to keep track of
'Powers' wife, Barbara, since he spent so much time in her company.

Jaffe's Contacts with FBI While Assigned to Moscow
Jaffe furnished the following information to
agents of the New York Office of the FBI on January 7, 1963.
us
Russia
Jaffe stated he was acquainted with_Yuri_
Vladimirovich Fedorov while in Moscow. Jaffe said Fedorov
was with the Novosti Press Agency in Moscow.
While Jaffe was in Moscow, in 1962, he became
acquainted with a number of Soviet citizens both male and
female. He said that he was dating one Soviet female by the
name of Galina in the Fall of 1962. He became acquainted
with her through other Soviet females with whom he was ac-
quainted; however, he was unable to furnish her last name.
Galina told Jaffe that she had been dating foreigners in the
past and, because of this, had been called into KGB Headquarters
and warned against continuing her association with foreigners.
During the Cuban crisis, in the Fall of 1962,
Fedorov told Jaffe confidentially that there was a bitter
dispute among the Soviet hierarchy in the Kremlin concerning
the manner in which the Soviets should deal with the Cuban
crisis. Fedorov told Jaffe that Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev was able to muster enough support for his position
and eventually won out over those in the Soviet hierarchy who
proposed a tough uncompromising attitude.
Ik

Jaffe advised that he used the information furnished
to him by Yuri V. Fedorov concerning the dispute in the Kremlin
over the Cuban crisis in a broadcast over the ABC network.
RUSSION us
Jaffe recalled that the aforementioned information
came to him from Fedorov on a Friday late in October, 1962. On
the following day, a Saturday, Jaffe attended a social function
at the home of Stanley Weyman, Life Magazine correspondent in
Moscow. He brought his friend, Galina, with him and remained
at Weyman's house until some time after midnight. When he de-
parted from Weyman's house, he took Galina and a Soviet male
_ with him.
The Soviet male, whose name he could not remember,
was also a guest at Weyman's house and Jaffe offered to drive
him home. This Soviet male was associated with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, according to Jaffe.

Before being released by the police, Galina was.
told by the police not to see Jaffe again. She said that
they told her that Jaffe's name and her name would appear
in "Izvestia".
After hearing Galina's story, Jaffe called
Fedorov and relayed the story of Galina's experiences to
Fedorov. Fedorov told Jaffe that he would be right over to
see him.
According to Jaffe, Fedorov immediately came

to see him at his apartment. Upon his arrival Fedorov acted
as though he were shocked by the whole story which Jaffe
✓ told to him. Fedorov told Jaffe that this was a very serious
matter and that an article was then being written concerning
Jaffe's association with Galina. He said that Jaffe would be
depicted as an American who had led a Soviet female astray.
This would serve as a Esson to Soviet citizens, particularly
females, to refrain from associating with American citizens.
Fedorov also told Jaffe that this article would appear in
"Komsomolskaya Pravda". Fedorov said that he did not know
what he could possibly do for Jaffe but suggested that a friend
of his, who is a Deputy Editor with "Komsomolskaya Pravda",
might be able to help. Fedorov suggested that there might still
be time to stop the story. In Jaffe's presence Fedorov made a
telephone call allegedly to his friend the Deputy Editor. After
the call was made Fedorov told Jaffe that it would be okay for
them to see his friend at 6:00 p.m. that night.

Jaffe met Fedorov at a restaurant in Moscow at
6:00 p.m. that evening in accordance with arrangements previously
made. Fedorov's friend, the Deputy Editor, was to meet them
there but prior to Fedorov's friend's arrival, Fedorov told
Jaffe that his friend was not actually Deputy Editor of "Komsomol-
skaya Pravda". He told Jaffe that his friend was an old war
buddy who just happened to be in the KGB.
Russia
When Fedorov's friend arrived he was introduced
to Jaffe as Vyacheslav/Kislov. Jaffe came to know this individual
as "Slava". Kislov said to Jaffe "I guess you know who I am".
He then went on to tell Jaffe that he was with the KGB. He said
that he and his colleagues were not too pleased with Jaffe's cou-
duct. He asked Jaffe who his source in the Kremlin was and then

during the week of December 30, 1962. Jaffe was with Dave
* Miller," New York Herald Tribune" Moscow correspondent, at that
time. Jaffe said that he and Miller spent about an hour with
/ Bogachev and Turkatenko discussing life in Moscow.
Jaffe left the U.S. on January 13, 1963 for East
Berlin, where he was to cover the visit of Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev to that city. He then would return to Moscow
with Khrushchev and complete his assignment there.
During interview of January 7, 1963, Jaffe asked
if there was any way that he could possibly communicate infor-
mation to interviewing agents. He explained that he does not
expect to come into possession of any earth shattering or
startling information, but he does believe that it would be
possible for him to learn of information which would be of in-
⠀ terest to the FBI from time to time. He had specific reference
to advance notice which he might receive of information which
might later become public knowledge through news media.. Jaffe
was discouraged from attempting to communicate with FBI agents
in any manner whatsoever from Moscow.
Jaffe said that he is not favorably impressed with
State Department representatives in Moscow, at least the ones
with whom he deals. He said that the people with whom he deals
give him the impression of being naive in the field of security
and intelligence work, and therefore, he has no desire whatso-
ever to furnish information to them. Jaffe had particular re-
ference to the security officers in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
with whom he has dealt.

Jaffe said that he does know one individual by the
name of Sam Wise at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in whom he has
the utmost confidence.

Jaffe advised agents of the New York Office of

to Moscow he has become very friendly with Yuri M. Vinogradov,
who is presently assigned to the United Nations Secretariat.
He advised that Vinogradov's wife is a top rated television
star in Moscow on children's programs. On Monday, January 18,
1965, Jaffe had lunch with Vinogradov and his wife and James
Hagerty, an official of the ABC. Conversation during this lunch

Kuskov was meeting with Jaffe and had obtained some informa-
tion from him. WF T-2 indicated that Kuskov obtained an agree-.
ment with the 10th Department that the 1st Department would
work against Jaffe in order to have an agent who could move
in American Embassy circles in Moscow. WF T-2 said he
thought Kovshuk had contact with Jaffe, probably posing as
a diplomat and using the name Komarov. The informant does
not know whether or not Gryaznov knew Jaffe.

Sokolov by Sam Jaffe. He said he is
planning a trip to Russia in March,
1964, with a Negro writer. They plan to
do an article on Negros who have resided
in Russia for 20 to 30 years. They are
interested in facilities for Negros in

Jaffe advised that since former Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev was deposed there has been a very noticeable
effort to change the image of the KGB in the Soviet Union
through television programs, newspaper and magazine stories and
the like. These television programs and newspaper and magazine
stories resemble television programs, newspaper and magazine
stories which might be read or seen in the U.S. and be classed
as detective stories. They are designed to create a favorable
impression upon the Soviet populace concerning the KGB as well
as solicit the cooperation of the Soviet populace in combatting
subversion on the part of foreign visitors as well as combat-
ting crime. The Soviet populace is urged to report suspicious
activity in both of these fields to the KGB. KGB personnel are
depicted as competent, efficient, and friendly officials with
whom the Soviet populace can readily do business.
• RUSSIA
Jaffe has also noticed that Vladimir/Semichastnyy,
KGB_Chief and member of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party, has taken a more prominent place among Soviet officials
at public functions than he formerly did and he can also be
seen at diplomatic affairs circulating more freely than he would
formerly circulate under the Khrushchev regime.

IV. Allegations of WF T-3 Concerning Jaffe
S
WF T-3 advised that the American correspondent,
Sam Jaffe, was approached by the KGB in Moscow but does not
know the details concerning this approach. WF T-3 stated
he did not know if the KGB had been successful in recruiting
Jaffe but believed the attempt failed. He reported that Yevgeniy
N. Aleshin commented that when Jaffe was in Moscow he personally
controlled all of Jaffe's actions and knew all the details con-
cerning Jaffe's activities. Aleshin also commented that he re-
garded Sam Jaffe as a hoax.
WF T-2 identified Aleshin by name and photo-
graph and advised that until 1952 he was
involved in Communist Party
and
Komsomol
work; from 1952 - 1960 served in the 1st
Department, SCD, KGB; and since 1960 1961
was Chief of 10th Department, SCD, KGB.
While in the 1st Department he served in
the 2nd and 3rd Sections; at one time was chief
of the section dealing with Russians suspected
of having connections with United States
Intelligence, and from about 1959 1960 was
Deputy Chief of the 1st Department.

a group of Congressmen who signed a treaty connected with limi-
tations of nuclear explosions in the air and the other involved
a "group of big businessmen" sponsored by "Time" magazine. WF
T-2 said he recalls the businessmen group was sponsored by
"Time" "because one of the managers of this 'Time' was coming,
and a group of correspondents was accompanying them from I
think London, from Paris, maybe from Bonn." WF T-2 indicated
that both groups met with Khrushchev and Jaffe reported to
Kuskov "their opinions, their attitude. WF T-2 is of the
opinion that Jaffe furnished his information orally to Kuskov
who then prepared written reports. When questioned concerning
the type of information Jaffe furnished, WF T-2 stated: "Oh,
it's general - their opinion on something. Nothing important.
Nothing from the point of intelligence - counterintelligence,
in the meaning that he had given something only about special
person, no, no, nothing. In general - their opinion and their
attitude.

WF T-2 was advised that Jaffe was expelled from
Russia in the Fall of 1965 because of a critical story prepared
by ABC but not by Jaffe. WF T-2 then commented: "I think my
personal opinion that he couldn't be expelled. It could be

a cover for Jaffe.
WF T-2 was not aware of Jaffe covering the Francis
Gary Powers trial and he was not aware of any "exclusives" fur-
nished to Jaffe by the KGB. WF T-2 was not aware of any KGB
officers from the 1st Department, with the exception of Kuskov
and possibly Kovshuk who met Jaffe. WF T-2 stated: "I think
maybe Kovshuk in 1962, beginning in 1963, could visit - meet
him, but at the same time I doubt, because Kovshuk was playing
the part of diplomat of Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He knew
him in face, and I think Jaffe knew him (Kovshuk) in face as
Komarov."
WF T-2 was asked if he had ever heard that Jaffe
was in contact with KGB officers in the United States prior to
Jaffe's Moscow assignment. WF T-2 answered in the negative and

Jaffe's Contacts with FBI Subsequent to
Expulsion From Moscow, October, 1965
.

Russia
On December 2, 1965, Jaffe advised agents of
the New York Office of the FBI that he was notified of his
expulsion from Russia in October, 1965, by Leonid Zanyatin,
number one man in the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry. During his stay in Moscow he had contact with
Zamyatin and Boris Padyshev, number two man in the Press
Department; Fedor) Semenov, number three man in the Press
Department; Fedor/Fedorenko, number four man in the Press
Department; and Anatoli Kachev, number five man in the Press
Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. All of these
people were friendly to Jaffe and somewhat apologetic con-
cerning the fact that he was being expelled from the Soviet
Union. This was particularly true of Kachev, who told Jaffe
that he hoped to be able to see him in New York City sometime
in the future.
Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been
reported as connected with the
Soviet Committee of Information (KI).
Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin has been
reported as connected with the
Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).
C.
According to Jaffe, Kachev also told him not to
be concerned about his expulsion and that, if there were any-
thing the Soviets could do for Jaffe, OlegyKalugin (was in
in/a
Washington, D.C. Jaffe said he is acquainted with Kalugin and
knew Kalugin when he was the number three man in the Press Depart-
ment of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, after Kalugin's return to
Russia from his previous assignment in New York City and prior
to his present assignment at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C. Prior to his present assignment in Washington, D.C.,
Kalugin transferred from the Press Department of the Soviet
Foreign Ministry to Radio Moscow in the American Department.
Jaffe said Kalugin is very Americanized in his outlook and
Jaffe knows Kalugin to be a very talkative individual.

he was in Washington, D.C., in connection with a breakfast
with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, but that Rusk's assistant,
George Ball, was substituting for him. Jaffe indicated he
would return to New York and then to California. Jaffe
suggested that he and Kalugin have lunch together, and
asked Kalugin how the prospects looked for ABC to again get
representation in Russia. Kalugin suggested that they
discuss the matter at lunch.

was in receipt of two copies of a book entitled "America's
Unelected Rulers of the Council of Foreign Relations", written
by Phoebe Greene (Courtney of New Orleans, Lousiana. According
to "Jaffe, this book lists a number of people who are members
of the Council on Foreign Relations who have subversive back-
grounds. Jaffe is one of the individuals listed in this book.
According to Jaffe, another section accuses Jaffe of being a
member of the American League for Peace and Democracy. Jaffe
indicated he is quite incensed over the information contained
in this book concerning him and he connected the information
in the book with his recent recall from Hong Kong by ABC. Jaffe
said he has never been a member of the American League for Peace.
and Democracy; however, he has been a member for many years of
the Council on Foreign Relations. Jaffe said he understands
that Courtney and her husband reside in New Orleans and are
considered to be erratic individuals in the area of anti-Communist
activity.

_ At the request of a Special Agent, Jaffe
voluntarily appeared for interviews at the Washington
Field Office of the FBI on March 20, 21, and 27, 1969.
March 20, 1969
U
At the inception of the interview on March 20,
1969, Jaffe was advised that it was realized he had been, in
contact with FBI Agents in New York since 1958, and had
furnished information concerning his contacts with Soviet
nationals. He was advised that interviewing agents were
interested in his contacts with Soviet nationals in Russia
and in the United States, and since he had not been fully
debriered concerning his tours of duty in Moscow and Hong Kong,
interviewing agents desired to obtain his comments concerning
these assignments including his comments concerning his relation-
ship with "Slava" in Moscow, which he previously reported to
the FBI in 1963. His comments concerning contacts with Soviets
since his return from Hong Kong were also solicited.

Association with KGB Contact "Slava"

Jaffe continued:

Jaffe was requested to recount the circumstances
under, which he met "Slava." He stated he met "Slava" through
Yurixedorov, an employee of Novosti Press Agency (APN).
Initially Jaffe was led to believe "Slava" also was connected
with APN, but later he learned "Slava" was connected with KGB.
"What specifically he ('Slava')
did, I don't know, but he was contacting foreigners. He was
interested in what went on at American Embassy briefings. I
would string him along. I would meet him usually at a restau-
rant.
He was a real hawk, a real Stalinist Khrushchev was
wrong, China was right
Whenever
real old-guard Stalinist.
there was anything of any importance regarding Soviet-American
relations he would ask, 'what did they say at the briefings?'"

Jaffe indicated he told "Slava" he did not learn
anything important at the briefings. Jaffe continued: "This
was basically the relationship. The only thing he asked me
for was 'What is the thinking at the Embassy? What did the
Ambassador have to say at the briefing?' I got the impression
he had other sources because he would say, 'This isn't what I
understand.'"
In answer to a specific question, Jaffe said he
would see "Slava" on the average of once every two or two and
one half weeks. He continued: "I have met his wife. She was
formerly KGB." Jaffe indicated he learned from "Slava" that
his wife had been with KGB and was retired.
Jaffe indicated he subsequently met "Slava's"
boss following an automobile accident in which he hit a
pedestrian in Moscow.,_ He had had a couple of drinks, and was
driving an employee to the airport when a Russian male sud-
denly appeared "weaving in front of my car. I hit the guy. I
thought he was dead. I got out of the car.

He was unconscious.
Jaffe indicated the police appeared as did a "Mobile Lab" and a
crowd of people. Jaffe gave a statement and was told everything
was all right; however, it was necessary for him to go to the

Jaffe's "Exclusive" Regarding Khrushchev Ouster
Jaffe continued: "Khrushchey was ousted after
this. 'Slava' called me and said: 'A friend of yours is
out - somebody that likes you and you like, " Jaffe continued:
"I said, why are you telling me this. He said I thought you
should be the first one to know."
Jaffe said he was afraid to release this story
without verification, fearing it might be some sort of pro-
vocation, He attempted to verify the story thought American
Embassy personnel. "They said we know something is going on;"
however, Jaffe got the impression they were not aware of the
actual story. Jaffe then contacted a girl who worked for APN
named Lyudmila (last name unknown) and asked if she was aware
that an important story was breaking. She asked "Does it have.
anything to do with Khrushchey?" Jaffe stated only then did
she confirm the story. Jaffe also stated that Victor Louis, a
_ correspondent for the "London Evening News", also had the
"exclusive" on the Khrushchev ouster. (WF T-2 has identified
Vitaliy Yevgenievich/Luy, aka Vitaliy Yevgeniyevich Louis,
Victor E. Louis, a correspondent, married to an English girl,
as an agent of the Directorate of Moscow, KGB).

believe there was no problem, until an assistant traffic
chief of police appeared. "This man spotted me" and he was
required to take a sobriety test. Jaffe stated he passed
the test although there was a trace of alcohol in his system,
Jaffe was permitted to leave, but later was required to return
to the police station and "they said it was decided to press
charges."

Jaffe said he reported the matter to the
American Embassy and received conflicting advice. "Some

Jaffe continued: "At this point 'Slava' found
out about it. He came to see me and said it was very, very
serious." A little later, Jaffe and his wife had prepared to
leave on vacation but at the last minute he was told he could
not obtain an exit visa until the automobile accident had been
cleared up.
Jaffe then got a call from "Slava" who "Said he
would like me to meet a guy. This man - I think I could
identify very young, very tough, aggressive guy, good looking,
in 30's. 'Slava' said it was his chief and he just wanted to
meet me. Initially the conversation was quite general, with
"Slava's" boss, who spoke very good English, asking Jaffe his
thoughts about the Soviet Union. Toward the end of the meeting,
"Slava" mentioned Jaffe's automobile accident problem, and asked
"what do you think we can do about it?" Then the two Soviets
conversed in Russian, after which Jaffe was told "don't worry.'

Later, at the advice of Kamenev, Jaffe's translator,
Jaffe visited the injured Soviet at a hospital, and "brought
him some booze," Jaffe continued: "They found out about this
and the police were furious," insinuating that Jaffe was trying
to influence the victim. A month passed, and still Jaffe did
not receive an exit visa. Then "Slava" called and requested a
meeting. They met in a park in Moscow. "Slava" showed Jaffe
a piece of paper concerning the police charges, and tore it up
in Jaffe's presence. Jaffe asked "Slava" what "Slava" wanted
from him and "Slava" replied: "Forget about it. The case is
.closed. You have to make a financial settlement." Thereafter,
Jaffe met the victim's wife, paid her 100 or 200 rubles, and
she signed a statement releasing Jaffe from all other claims.

Expulsion of Jaffe from Soviet Union
Jaffe advised that after receiving the
"exclusive" from "Slava" concerning the Khrushchev ouster,
he continued to meet with "Slava" "on and off" until
Jaffe was expelled from the Soviet Union in October, 1965.
In explaining the expulsion, Jaffe said that without
advising him, John Scali of the American Broadcasting
Company (ABC) wrote a story which Jaffe thinks was a "trial
baloon" intimating that Leonid Brezhnev and Aleksei Kosygin
were about to be ousted. Jaffe got a call from ABC in New
York asking what he thought about Scali's story. Jaffe stated
he did not believe the story was true and he asked "Slava" for
his opinion. "Slava" indicated that although he would like
to see it happen, he did not believe it would occur "because
they were too new" as Soviet Heads of State. Jaffe continued:
"The next morning, Henry Shapiro called me, asking why I had
written such a story." Jaffe denied knowing anything about it
He explained that it was later that he learned that the story
had been written by John Scali. (WF T-2 has identified Shapiro
and his wife, Lyudmila Nikolayevna Shapiro, as KGB agents.)
IN
At the time Scali's story broke, Jaffe and his
wife were in the process of packing in preparation for their
departure from Russia for Hong Kong and Jaffe's ABC successor
in Moscow already had been named. The first indication Jaffe
received of his expulsion was a call from ABC in New York asking
what Jaffe had done to cause the Soviets to recall the visa for
Jaffe's sucessor. Jaffe said he replied: "Did you ever think
* could be John Scali's story?"
S
J
Later Jaffe was called into the Soviet Foreign
Office and told he had to leave the Soviet Union in ten days
and that the ABC office in Moscow was being closed. Jaffe
said he inquired: "Are you holding this (story) against me?"
Jaffe was told that the Soviets were not, and that "we know
exactly what you said about us for four years." Jaffe indicated
this was the first indication he had that the Soviets had tech-
nical coverage on him. Jaffe said he did not want to leave the
Soviet Union under these conditions. He said the Soviets told
him, "We are not holding this against you but it has to be.'
Jaffe was told not to worry about the deadline for his departure
and that he could get additional time. Jaffe also was told he
would be able to return to Russia. He continued: "After that,
everything went smoothly. They only opened one box at the Customs
Office. No problems at all. I don't recall that I saw Slava
again" (after his expulsion was announced).

:
Jaffe was asked how he was placed in contact
with "Slava". He replied he was introduced to "Slava" by
Yuri Fedorov. He continued: "I was dating a Russian girl
and this girl got herself in trouble," Jaffe then stated:
"She came to me and said that they had found out she was
seeing an American and they were going to put this in the
Soviet press. Fedorov said they will print your name and it
will be very embarrassing." Jaffe said Fedorov then said,
•
"
"I think I know someone who can help you." Jaffe indicated
that Fedorov placed him in contact with "Slava", and "there
was no article. It was his way of meeting me. Jaffe said
he never saw the girl after that, and understood she was
sent to Siberia.
In discussing his association with "Slava",
Jaffe stated: "At one point when he was at my house he told
me that he thought I was in CIA. Apparently he knew every-
thing. When I first got to Russia I was tailed day and night
for two months - two guys and a girl. 'Slava' said when I
came over with Barbara Powers (wife of U-2 pilot Francis Gary
Powers) and was so close to her, they thought I was with CIA
and was her advisor."
Jaffe stated he first met "Slava" at a restaurant
in Moscow and it was not for six or seven months from then that
"Slava" first visited Jaffe's residence.

On March 20, 1969, Jaffe advised that yesterday
(March 19, 1969) he received a call from Boris N. Sedov,
Soviet Embassy Press Department, whom Jaffe has seen a few
times recently. Jaffe stated: "Sedov said 'I was thumbing
through our photograph files and found a picture of you taken
in Red Square. You were interviewing a Russian♪" Jaffe said
Sedov indicated he thought Jaffe might want the photograph and
an offer was made that they get together for lunch soon. In
response to inquiry, Jaffe stated Sedov's comments "sounded
funny to me."
(Sedov has been reported to have been a KGB officer.)

with Kemper.

Jaffe has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most
hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about
Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be
surprised if the old man doesn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the
security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids,
Iowa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real
"corn ball."
He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about
7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take a walk and, apparently, caught his
bodyguards flatfooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out
the doors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.
Jaffe is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their correspondents
after the television show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working
✓ith people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back
and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and that
he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy
and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy
on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see
what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev,
Jaffe said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be
beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the
country and the people, may hesitate before "pushing the button."

In response to inquiries, Jaffe stated "Slava"
was especially interested in important current events such.
as "the Cuban crisis - things like that what our (U.S.)
reactions would be. !! Jaff also stated: "He would ask me
about some guy" at the American Embassy, such as Dick Gabey
and Manuel Oliver." Jaffe indicated that his responses would-
be that he did not get close to these people or he only had a
drink with them but did not learn anything significant. Jaffe
continued: "He ('Slava) would say 'They talk to some of the
correspondents.' I would say 'I never have any occasion, because
with radio (ABC) you don't go into depth."1
: Jaffe also stated:
"He was also very much interested
in the Time, Incorporated group that came over there (Russia).
What do they say. What do they talk about. Jaffe stated: "I
said they are looking into expanding trade.' Jaffe was asked to
list any business or political groups visitng Russia in which
"Slava" expressed an interest. Jaffe mentioned the Time, Incor-
porated businessmen group, the Rockefeller visit and a Business
International Group.
Jaffe was asked why KGB would have considered him
a good contact or recruited agent. He replied "I don't know
why they would consider me a good contact or recruited agent,
because there was nothing I could furnish them." He continued:
"I could see why they thought I was so interesting. I figure
they wanted something in the future,"

Jaffe said "Slava" would ask him if he was aware
of or expected to be with a particular group and Jaffe would
answer in the affirmative or would indicate he might cover such
a group; however, he would tell "Slava", "I have no entree to
these people." Jafe continued: "He consulted me about several
people over there. My answer always was, 'I know the guy. I
had a drink with him but I didn't get close.' I said, 'I have
no real reason. " " Jaffe indicated that he merely furnished
"Slava" his opinions concerning matters of interest to "Slava,"
Jaffe concluded that "Slava" made no arrangements to recontact
him after his expulsion from the Soviet Union, He stated: "I
never saw this man since." Jaffe stated he saw two Soviet engineers
aboard a Soviet ship in Hong Kong and had them to lunch at his
residence; however, he initiated these contacts himself.

Jaffe's Dating of Foreign Nationals in Russia.
.
Jaffe was asked if he dated any other Soviet
girls. He replied he dated about three Russian girls. He
continued: "The first two or three months that I moved into
an apartment at about 2:00 a.m., there was a knock on the
door and I opened it and here was a very attractive blond,
looking for some Arab. She was loaded. She said, 'please
let me use your John.' The next thing I knew she had the
bathroom door locked. When I got the door open, she was
undressed. I got her dressed and sat up with her all night."
Jaffe then stated that he realized the girl
through whom KGB arranged for him to meet "Slava" was "a set-
up." He continued: "I knew Fedorov before. There is no
question he is with KGB and an APN representative.
Jaffe said he was "never intimate in a place
where they (KGB) could photograph. I had a small apartment
and looked everywhere for cameras."

said he thinks this girl was connected with KGB. He said she
was allegedly a student at Moscow University and went out with
foreigners. Jaffe concluded: "After I met Slava', he told
me to stay away from her and I did.".
Jaffe was asked if he dated any other foreign
nationals. He stated: "I dated a Finnish girl who was
studying ballet at the Bolshoi Theater - the primo ballerina
of the Helsinki Ballet Company," who was of Russian origin.
Jaffe continued: "I took out the Second Secretary of the

Jaffe stated he did not suspect that any of the

a while was a beatnik type." He continued: "My wife, before

tried to set her up but she pulled out because she was working

Jaffe's "Exclusive" Regarding
Professor Frederick Barghoorn
7
•
Jaffe advised that another "exclusive" he
obained while in Moscow was information about the release
of Professor Frederick Barghoorn. Jaffe obtained this
"exclusive" from Mikhail "Mike" Bruk, "a guy who never i
pumped me.' He said Bruk was an employee of APN, an
"extremely interesting man, a fine linguist" who normally
covers scientific matters. Jaffe stated it is his opinion
that the release of Barghoorn was the culmination of a
fight between Khrushchev and the KGB and his opinion was
confirmed by statements made to him by Yuri Vinogradov that
Khrushchev initially was not aware that Barghoorn was being
detained and after he learned of it he insisted, over the
objections of KGS, that he be released.
M
Jaffe said he learned beforehand of the expected
release of Barghoorn while attending a Soviet-American
Friendship meeting with Bruk and Vinogradov. He continued:
"Mike (Bruk) took me out in the hall. He said he (Barghoorn)
will be released. He will leave here tomorrow for London."
Jaffe said the release occurred on a Saturday and no British
European Airways (BEA) flight is scheduled from Moscow on
Saturday; however, the BEA plane was detained and did not
depart until Saturday, with Barghoorn. 'Jaffe said that before
releasing the story, he tried to verify it with the American
Embassy, but was unable to do so.

Attitude of Vyacheslav Kiselov, aka

Jaffe said he and "Slava" discussed the way
the Soviet Union was changing and "Slava" admitted changes
were occuring and that "this was bad." Jaffe tried to
convince "Slava" that many of these changes were desirable;
however, "Kiselov couldn't see this at all (saying) 'We have
to bring it about through Marxism Leninism.' I disagreed.
Even China will come around. Even you (Russia) are coming
around. He ("Slava") refused to accept this.

correspondent Ian Stewart visited the "S.S. Bikal", a Soviet
cruise ship plying between Hong Kong and Siberia. Jaffe in-
dicated that one unusual incident occurred on the ship. Jaffe
asked if the ship had any dolux cabins and was escorted by a
Soviet female guide to the cabin. The door was locked.
knocked and upon receiving no answer, unlocked the door. They
saw two Russian caucasians talking to a Chinese national.
Chinese national immediately turned his head away from the
Americans and kept it turned away thoughout their stay in the
cabin. The Russians appeared upset and one asked "What are
you doing here?" The girl explained that the Americans were
touring the ship and tried to show them the cabin hurriedly.
It was obvious to Jaffe that she wanted to get out of the
cabin as soon as possible; however, Jaffe inquired about and
insisted upon being shown the cabin's toilet. Jaffe concluded:
"As we were leaving, I turned around and said in Russian, 'Thank
you very much."" Jaffe indicated the fact that he could speak
Russian obviously shocked the Russian nationals.
Jaffe stated he developed an association with two
Russians on the ship who "had been trying to get into Hong Kong
xor some time. I think they were engineers." Jaffe said he
invited them to his residence where they had lunch with Ken
Bernstein, of National Broadcasting Company and another in-
dividual whose name Jaffe cannot recall. One of the Soviet
engineers was quite open in his concern about the Soviet occupa-
tion of Czechoslovakia. Jaffe also learned that Hong Kong was
dang 100 million dollars of business repairing Soviet tankers,
freighters and cruise ships. Jaffe said the Soviet engineers
were very anxious to obtain visas for their wives and children
to enter Hong Kong.

Jaffe also advised he had contacts with CIA and
British Intelligence in Hong Kong, as a result of his contacts
with a Red Chinese national, Szetor Kung, the news editor of the
Chinese News Agency. After being introduced to Szet by an
individual who works for Reuters, Jaffe told Szeto about his
assignment in Russia. An association between Jaffe and Szeto
ensued. Jaffe indicated to Sze that he was very anxious to go
to Red China. Jaffe indicated that in 1955, he was granted an
interview by Chou En Lai.

Szeto
After his initial contacts with Szeto, Jaffe'
observed him several times, "but he never recognized me or
my camera man." Subsequently Jaffe called Szeto and asked
him if he could get Jaffe some Mao banners. Szeto indicated
they were difficult to obtain, but he would try. They later
met at a restaurant and Szeto gave him some Mao banners.
asked Jaffe his attitude toward the Hong Kong crisis and how
the British had reacted and whether or not their hostility
had tapered off. Jaffe stated: "I said I was pretty sore
about the British newspaper man being held in China." Szeto
replied that the British were holding one of their (China's)´
men.
Jaffe stated Set invited him to lunch several
days later and indicated that things were getting better in
China; however, "we still have trouble in Canton, but we
think everything is toning down. The Red Guards are going
back to school. They also talked about developing better
relations with the United States in the future and Szeto in-
dicated that a Communist Party Congress would be held this
year in China.
"

When Jaffe was packing to return to the United
States, he contacted Szeto and Szeto suggested that they get
together. Jaffe indicated he would like to introduce his
wife to Szeto. This was agreeable and Seto took them to dinner
on the eve of the Chinese Anniversary. Szeto brought up the
subject of keeping in touch with Jaffe, indicating that he did
not desire to contact him through ABC. It was decided that
after Jaffe got settled in the United States, he would write
Szeto at the Chinese News Agency office in Hong Kong and furnish
his mailing address. Jaffe again indicated to Szeto his strong
desire to get assigned to China. Jaffe said he had cleared
this "with the Agency (CIA)" prior to his conversation with
Szeto. Jaffe stated his CIA contact in Hong Kong "at one point
showed me a report on him (Szeto). He told about taking groups
of people to China. He had been abroad but never to this
country (United States). He obviously was a liaison man with
the Foreign press. I think it was a surprise to CIA and the
State Department that he (Szeto) would see us (the Jaffes)."

Jaffe stated all his contacts with the Soviets
have been cordial. The only time he felt out of place and
embarrassed in connection with his Soviet contacts was when
he attended the Soviet Air Forces Day celebration at the
Soviet Embassy. He explained that John Lynch of ABC had been
invited but said he could not make it and gave Jaffe his
ticket. Jaffe continued: "When they (the Soviets) saw me
there they seemed surprised and asked: 'What are you doing
here?' One of the guys said he had seen my piece on Russian
trawlers. Kalugin did most of the taking. Asked what I was
doing. I said I was John Lynch's replacement. Later Lynch
and his wife showed up with a sister-in-law."
Jaffe said the Soviets asked what he was doing
with ABC. He replied; he had expected to cover the State
Department but he is on general assignment to get the feel
of the country since he has been away for so long.

Jaffe said on the night of the Soviet Air Forces
Day celebration, he also met a member of the Soviet Press
Department who expressed great interest in Jaffe and in-
dicated a desire to get together again. However, he has had
no additional contact with this individual..

JAFFE was interviewed on 2/12/59, by SAS JOHN F. MABEY
and EDWARD F. GAMBER. During this interview, JAFFE advised
that as of 1/30/59, he moved out of the apartment which
he and his family shared. He said that this move
was made at the request of his wife, who told him that she
no longer feels any affection for him. JAFFE stated that
his wife is emotionally immature and that his marital
difficulties do not stem from any other romantic
interest on the part of his wife or himself. JAFFE
sincerely hopes that he can effect a reconciliation and he
exhibits very sincere concern for the welfare of
his children.
According to JAFFE, his wife intends to obtain
a divorce, the grounds for which will probably be
incompatibility. He has not as yet sought legal counsel
and will not do so until such time as his wife makes
some overt move. He is still very hopeful of effecting
a reconciliation.
This matter will be closely followed and the
Bureau will be kept advised.

Jaffe's Employees in Moscow
Jaffe advised that in 1965 prior to his
expulsion he had a Soviet cameraman and a translator.
The cameraman had left several months before the ABC
office was clered closed, and he was replaced by Yuri
Boridorov (phonetic), who stayed until Jaffe's expulsion
and actually closed the ABC office. The translator, Aleksandr
"Sasha" Nezmanov (phonetic), "was good and would stick his
neck out, but he was mixed up with some girl. This was the
excuse he gave." "Sasha" told Jaffe he had. "gotten himself in
trouble with a circus girl and this was about to cause a
scene." "Sasha, " who broke down and cried when he related the
story to Jaffe, said he made the girl pregnant and she had
threatened to come down to his office and complain. Jaffe
said he asked "Slava" about this, and his only comment was
"they weren't very good" employees. Jaffe said the translator's
replacement was a "great big goon type who knew nothing," and
Jaffe fired him.

Jaffe stated he left Russia about a month after
the Scali story broke. He continued: "I had already reported
the denial based on what I saw and believed, but ABC didn't
use them radio did but
radio did but TV didn't." Jaffe stated the Soviets
were aware of the ABC radio denial but they asked Jaffe why
the denial did not appear on television, stating "the impact
was created on TV." According to Jaffe, this is why Henry
Shapiro, UPI correspondent, called and complained. Then Reuter'
called. Jaffe said he replied: "No, gentlemen, I have knocked
the story down." Jaffe again commented that it was only when
the Soviets indicated they were aware of his criticism of the
story "that I knew I had been bugged. They knew everything I
said."

Activities with "Slava"
Jaffe was asked if he could recall any United
States groups visiting Russia in which "Slava" expressed an
interest. Jaffe mentioned the Time-Life Group and the
Business International Group. He was asked if "Slava"
expressed an interest in any group connected with the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. He answered in the affirmative and stated,
"They expressed interest in what people were saying. I said,
'everybody was happy to see it.""
"I went
Jaffe continued:
up with Vice President (Hubert) Humphrey and we went to Gorki
Park and interviewed Russians.' As Humphrey talked to the
Russians, Jaffe recorded the interviews on his tape recorder.
A translator from the American Embassy accompanied Humphrey
and Jaffe.
Jaffe then stated: "I was never asked in advance
to get anything; always after the fact." Jaffe was asked if
"Slava" ever made inquiries concerning American groups prior
to their arrival in Russia. He replied: "A couple of times
he would say, 'a group is coming in. Do you think you will be
covering it?' I was never asked specifically to do anything.
•
Jaffe was asked if "Slava" ever asked anything
about being contacted by the FBI. He answered in the affirma-
tive and indicated that this occurred two or three months
after he met "Slava". Jaffe said he told "Slava" that FBI
agents indicated they were aware that. he "bumped into these
guys" and "sees a lot of Russians" and they requested him to
furnish information about his Russian contacts. Jaffe said he
deliberately lied to "Slava", telling him "I told these people
(FBI), 'Sorry, I am a news man. These are my sources.
Jaffe
said he did not know whether or not "Slava" believed him; how-
ever, he never questioned Jaffe's comments.

Jaffe was asked if he was ever warned that United

He replied in the affirmative, stating, "He called me for lunch
and told me that a guy defected from Geneva who worked with him
('Slava') and knew of several of his contacts and I was one of
them." "Slava" then told Jaffe, "If you are ever asked anything
about me, deny any knowledge of me."

Activities on Behalf of Naval Intelligence
Jaffe stated that on one occasion he attempted
to perform a task for Naval Intelligence. He received per-
mission to travel in the North Sea aboard a Soviet Ice
Breaker "Lenin" and prior to starting this assignment, he
was briefed by Naval Attaches at the American Embassy, Moscow,
on their interests including any observations he might make
of Soviet atomic submarines. Accompanying Jaffe on the trip
was Dieter. Steiner, another foreign correspondent in Moscow.
Jaffe did not observe any atomic submarines and every time the
ship neared a Soviet naval base, the guests were told the
Captain desired to brief them below deck in his cabin. By
the time the briefings were over, the ship had passed the
naval bases. On one occasion, Jaffe, while en route to the
Captain's cabin, realized he had left his photographic equip-
ment on deck. He returned to get it and was approached by
Soviet Naval Officers who reminded him he was expected to be
receiving a briefing in the Captain's cabin; however, he was
not reprimanded and was treated well throughout the cruise.
While in Riga, Jaffe and Steiner observed a
group of buoys in a large channel which were spaced uniform
distances apart. Jaffe and Dieter finally relized that by
photographing these buoys, the size of various Soviet ships
passing through the channel could be ascertained, and they
attempted to take photographs, but wae told this was _ not
permitted. They protested and the next morning the Cultural
Committee agreed to let them photograph the area. When they
arrived at the channel they discovered that all the buoys had
been removed. Jaffe said he is convinced the Soviets worked
throughout the night removing the buoys.

Jaffe later indicated that "Slava" warned
him of the defector shortly after Jaffe read the story
in the press that a Soviet national disappeared in Switzer-
land. Jaffe continued: "He (Slava') was actually concerned
because the man had a lot of valuable information, He said
he worked with 'Slava' for a while and then he was in another
department - higher position. He knew him ('Slava') personal-
ly. And he said he couldn't understand why the man would do
anything like defecting. He said, 'Don't say anything about
knowing me to anyone. He was very, very worried." Jaffe
said he learned at about the time he was leaving Russia that
"Slava" was "being demoted and was going into another area.
He wasn't happy. I think he felt he had more to offer."
When again requested to relate the circumstances
of his introduction to "Slava", Jaffe stated he was dating a
Soviet girl. He said he did not believe the Soviets have any
compromising photographs of their activities%; however, the
girl told him she had been called up before the review board
of the factory where she worked and embarrassed because of her
association with an American. She told Jaffe, that the whole
story would appear in "Izvestia" or some other Soviet news-
paper. Jaffe continued: "At this point Fedorov befriended
I:. He said, 'I hear by the grapevine you are in a little
hot water. I acknowledged this but said I didn't think there
was anything wrong with seeing a Soviet girl. He said it could
be very serious, your name could be written in 'Izvestia'".
Jaffe indicated Fedorov got "very melodramatic." He continued:
"I was scared of the automobile accident (in which he hit a
pedestrian ). But I wasn't scared about this. Jaffe then
related again that Fedorov introduced "Slava" to him as an
individual who could keep his name out of the newspapers.
"
It was pointed out to Jaffe that he first men-
tioned "Slava" to the FBI in January, 1963, and he was asked
if he could recall the information he furnished at that time
regarding attendance at a party and flat tires. He then re-
lated that he had attended a party with a girl friend and had
a few drinks. At about 1:00 a.m., he was driving in an area
not familiar to him and noticed he was being "tailed.' Then
he observed a "detour left" sim. He turned left as directed,
subsequently he noticed the surveilling car continue on the
road he had left. He then abruptly fell into a big hole and
all four tires were flattened by the severe fall. The girl

Jaffe's Difficulties with ABC and CIA
Jaffe indicated he believed his recall by ABC
from Hong Kong was caused by or influenced by an agency or
agencies of the United States Government. He indicated he
was told by a British Intelligence contact in Hong Kong that
he was recalled because he refused to cooperate with CIA in
Hong Kong. Jaffe said he recently mentioned this to a CIA
○ contact in Washington, D.C., and was told the British Intel-
ligence representative" had no right to tell you this."
Jaffe stated he also was told by other contacts that British
Intelligence was investigating him and desired to know as
much as possible about him; however, British Intelligence
had not initiated the inquiry, but was obtaining the informa-
tion for another organization.

Jaffe also indicated he was concerned that a
recent publication had falsely reported that he was a member
of a left wing organization. Jaffe then stated: "I would
like to get this thing cleaned up I feel that I have been
pulled back here."
some
Jaffe was advised that the FBI had absolutely
nothing to do with his return to the United States from Hong
Kong and did not have any contact with ABC with regard to him.
He was also told that it is difficult to understand why he had
not previously advised the FBI of some of the information con-
cerning his activities in Russia which he has now related.
Jaffe said he felt that he had told the FBI enough but admit-
ted he had not furnished complete information concerning his
activities in Russia, including the warning by "Slava" concerning
the KGB defector. He admitted the FBI had a right to expect
him to do so. He continued: "I was afraid of this guy. I
was damn interested and curious he was an intense man
one who gave me more information than I gave him. I was afraid
I might meet with an automobile accident." Jaffe said he did
not tell the FBI "everything because with that "guy . I was
scared. I am not on their side in any way. There are a lot of
things wrong with it, but I love it (the United States) I
try to be middle of the road I have been in Vietnam I am
not a Soviet spy and not a Communist. I was frightened. This
man was a very threatening man. This man could have killed..
He felt that strong about the old country - Stalin - I think
he was as vicious as Semichastnyy and Shelepin (former Chair-
men of the KGB) - I went up (and talked) to them. Semichastnyy
said, 'Yes, I know you. What do you want?'" Jaffe explained
this occured at a reception.

volunteered to go for help; stating: "let me make a telephone
call. I think I can find one. I can speak the language
better than you.' After about 30 minutes had passed and the
girl had not returned Jaffe got a cab and returned home at
about 3:00 a.m. He continued: I got a call about five or
six (am) from the girl. She had been picked up and taken
to the police station near the American Embassy, which was not
in this district (where the automobile was disabled). She
said,!I must see you right away.' She came to my apartment.
She had bruises on her and had been crying. Her eyes were
swollen. She told me she had been interrogated by the KGB."
Jaffe said the girl said she was in very serious trouble and
was accused of seeing other foreigners. She had insisted to
Jaffe that the only other foreigner with whom she associated
was a Negro, the Senegalese Ambassador to Russia. Jaffe said
he gave her breakfast and then she went home. He continued:
"The next time I saw her, she said she would be called up by
her factory" and reprimanded.

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe stated:
"I think my expulsion (from Russia) came as much as a surprise
to him ('Slava') as to me. I didn't see him after the expulsion
_order came in. Jaffe again stated: "Slava' knew I was
leaving. He knew I was going to Hong Kong.'
"
Jaffe again indicated he was already preparing
to leave Moscow for Hong Kong when the expulsion order came
in. He stated he and his wife were tired of being in Moscow.
He said ABC wanted him to remain in Russia but Jaffe did not.
While in Paris on a trip, he threatened to quit if he could
not leave Moscow. Jaffe stated: "My business wanted me to
stay but I didn't. I dih't want to be another Henry Shapiro.

I didn't want to let my kid get educated there." In explaining
why he wanted to leave Russia, Jaffe stated: "There were goons
around all the time a lot of pressure and guys string you
along."

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe stated:
'Slava' in no way, shape or form said 'I would be in touch
with you again. ↑ 11
Jaffe insisted that since his departure
from the Soviet Union he has had no contacts with Soviets
except at his own initiative with the exception of the recent
contact by Boris Sedov.

Jaffe stated that "Slava" might have thought
that he (Jaffe) was "Slava's" agent. He continued: "Little
things came out of 'Slava', but I never knew exactly what he.
did. I do know I would tell him what I would think, which is
not a secret." Jaffe, indicated he never told "Slava" or any
other Soviet connected with Soviet Intelligence anything other
than his own observations and opinions and denied furnishing:
any information from any Government documents. He also
emphatically denied that KGB had made any arrangements for
meeting him after he left Moscow or that thee had been any
Such meetings since he left Moscow. He said nobody had fol-
lowed up "Slava's" contacts with him.

In response to a specific question, Jaffe stated
he did not think "Slava" had anything to do with his expulsion
from Russia. He continued: "My guess is John Scali, who is
very close to CIA" was responsible for the expulsion. Jaffe
continued: "John wanted to set me up with CIA. They (CIA)
would do things in indirect ways." Jaffe then related an in-
cident in which Scali invited several ABC employees to a
party, including an individual introduced to Jaffe as an employee
of the Department of Commerce, who expressed very much interest
in Jae's assignment to Russia. Jaffe later verified that this
individual was connected with CIA and he feels it would have
been better if the individual had been completely open with him.
Jaffe then stated: "I still believe CIA sent me
to Moscow on the (Francis Gary) Powers trial. Prior to the
trial, he was approached by a CIA representative in California
who indicated he was aware Jaffe would be sent to Moscow by
Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Jaffe stated he (Jaffe)
&
was not aware of it at that time. Jaffe said he subsequently
was told by another CIA representative whom he met while attending
meetings of the Council on Foreign Relations that he had been
picked to go to Moscow with Barbara Powers and help Marvin Kalb,
CBS correspondent, cover the trial. On the eve of his departure,
a CIA representative who claimed he was a psychiatrist gave Jaffe
background material on spy trials and said "they were very much
interested in determining if Powers is brainwashed.
" Jaffe
related that Barbara Powers developed a friendship with him
and constantly sought his company and advice and expressed a
strong dislike for CIA personnel accompanying them. Jaffe, at
the insistance of Mrs. Powers, wrote a letter to the President
of the Soviet Union appealing for clemency for Powers. Jaffe
continued: "There was nothing physical between us. We went
down town (in Moscow) and went to the KGB building (at the
request of Mrs. Powers, who insisted on seeing the building).
This was the first time she cried. Then we went back. The
next morning was the trial. The next thing I know I am sitting
down in the VIP section. They wrote that I was a member of the
family. The game (with CIA) has been going on for a long time."

a brother-in-law of the sound man, "said we had to get out
(of Vietnam). I telephoned the Bureau Chief in Saigon and
7 said my month is up and we want to go back (to Hong Kong)."
Jaffe received a cable from headquarters stating "Tell Jaffe
to hold fast. Jaffe then sent cables reminding ABC of the
oral agreement or understanding concerning the duration of
assignments in Vietnam, and he ultimately received a cable
stating: "Tell Jaffe if he can't do job, quit." Jaffe said
he later learned that the agreement that correspondents
- would serve only a month at a time in Vietnam had been cancel

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE
Jaffe's Attitude Concerning Subsequent
Contacts with Boris Sedov
Jaffe indicated he was concerned about what
effect subsequent contacts with Boris Sedov might have on
his career with ABC, particularly if Sedov's contacts might
lead to another KGB approach. Jaffe was told that he alone
could made a decision concerning his future contacts with
Soviet nationals; that the FBI would not request that he
continue these contacts; but the FBI would be interested in
any information concerning contacts with anyone which Jaffe
· feels represents an attempt by foreign intelligence to cul-
F.
tivate him.

In response to a specific question, Jaffe
stated: ''Slava' never said anything about the trial
except to say they (KGB) thought I was with CIA. Later
he said they knew I was not."
J

Jaffe again indicated that he felt some United
States Government agency was responsible for his recall from.
Hong Kong and that it had some connection with an "intelligence"
allegation. He also indicated dislike for his present assign-
ment with ABC in Washington, D.C., stating that although he
had hoped to cover the "diplomatic beat" or the State Depart-
ment, he is merely on general assignment, sitting around
waiting for miscellaneous stories to break.
Jaffe also stated: "I was a bit afraid of
'Slava'. I was waiting for them (KGB) to contact me in
Hong Kong. I thought it would have come there." Jaffe also
stated: "You (FBI) have a right, after our relationship" to
inquire about Jaffe's activities and "I have a right to an
answer in all honesty" concerning the reason for the recall
from Hong Kong.
"
U
Jaffe stated that when he returned from Hong
Kong he asked the head of ABC for an explanation of his re-
call and was told he had not produced and had refused to
return to Vietnam. Jaffe denied both accusations. Jaffe then
went to his immediate superior and was told he was recalled
· because of a cable he sent from Saigon. Jaffe asked to be
shown the cable, but his request was refused. The discussion
between Jaffe and his immediate superior became very heated,
with the superior loudly accusing Jaffe of being a liar and
Jaffe suggesting that the superior was mentally ill for
shouting at him and refusing to show him the cable. Jaffe
stated he had seriously considered leaving ABC%; however, during
the last week of March, 1969, he signed another contract with
ABC. Jaffe said he is quite satisfied with the salary involved,
but dislikes very much being on general assignment. He again
indicated he is trying to obtain an assignment to Red China
and also is attempting to obtain an assignment to Cuba.
In explaining his difficulties with ABC in Viet*
nam, Jaffe stated that ABC correspondents in Hong Kong are
rotated on assignments to Vietnam and Korea and it was under-
stood that the assignments in Vietnam would never exceed one
month's duration. While Jaffe was in Vietnam on an assignment,
his sound man, a Chinese boy, was wounded, and the cameraman,

JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and
EDWARD F. GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE's identity should be
| protected.) As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and
cooperative.
"
During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked
if he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58
issue of "The Nation. The introduction of this topic
into the interview was very casual and the exact date of
the issue in which the article appeared was not actually
· mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article
nor had he heard about the article. Interviewing Agents then
told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort
to "smear" the Bureau. The Agents commented that the Bureau
always welcomes constructive criticism, and upon receipt of
same, has always taken expeditious stops to make any
warranted changes in its operations. However, the article
appearing in "The Nation" contained no constructive criticism
and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based on
untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes.
JAFFE said that he would like very much to read
this article and asked who the author was. When the
name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE,
but when JAFFE was told that COOK wrote for the "New York
World Telegram and Sun," he expressed amazement. Interviewing
Agents expressed idle. interest in knowing whatever provoked
the writing and publication of such an article and this
evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILLIAMS,
editor of "The Nation," was undoubtedly the moving factes
behind such an article appearing in "The Nation. He
said that CAREY MC WILLIAMS is violently anti-Bureau,
was anti-"McCarthy", is anti-House Un-American Activities

Subject has been assigned as Washington correspondent
for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) since the Fall of 1968.
From 1958 until 1961, he voluntarily furnished information to the
New York Office concerning his contacts with Soviet officials in
that city. In November, 1961, he was transferred to Moscow by ARC
and while on vacation trip to the United States during January,
1963, he reported to the New York Office what appeared to be
recruitment effort of him by SIS. Insufficient time was available
for complete debriefing of him and in 1965 he was expelled by Soviets
with subsequent transfer to Hong Kong by ABC. -C-

was recruited by SIS about 1962 but he did not know if Jaffe was
considered an agent or just an operative contact. During November,
1968, subject indicated he would like to have contacts with Bureau
in Washington, D. C., in same manner as he had previously been in
New York; however, contacts were not initiated since it was desired
to reinterview
in order to clarify his previous comments

Jaffe. Although he is not regular contact of Crime Records, Division,

3) Since/JAFFE's arrival in Washington, D.C.
in the Fall of 1965, he has been observed in contact with
Soviet officials assigned to Washington, D.C. In addition,
on 11/14/68, he approached some WFO Agents who were con-
ducting a surveillance on satellite personnel and indicated
that he would like to have contact with the FBI in Washing-
ton, D.C. in the same manner as he had previously had con-
tact in New York. He indicated that he was in contact with
Soviets in Washington, D.C. and would report on them. WFO
did not initiate contact with him at that time because it
was desired to obtain from New York the complete details
of New York's relations with him, and it was also desired
to interview concerning him. As indicated above,
the New York material has now been reviewed and
was interviewed concerning JAFFE by WFO Agents on 2/11/69. -S-
It is considered entirely possible that JAFFE,
while in Moscow, furnished only innocuous information to
his KGB contact and did not consider that he was a re-
cruited agent or source of KGB. He should be given an
opportunity to describe his activities in Moscow. Based
upon review of information pertaining to him, it appears
that he could be a good source against Soviets in Washing-
ton, D.C., provided he is candid concerning his activities
in Moscow and is not, in fact, a recruited agent continuing
to report to KGB. It is believed that an interview with
him is necessary to assess this potential. -C-
4) As indicated in NYairtel, JAFFE appears to
be concerned regarding derogatory information which has
appeared in a book written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY. He
has related these allegations to his recall from Hong Kong
by his employer and is concerned regarding the allegation

MC WILLIAMS is a fanatical and extreme liberal
JAFFE hastoned to explain during this conversation
that he was never a staff employee of "The Nation"
but that he was employed by "The Nation" on a temporary
basis. He said that he has not had any contact with "The Nation"
or its employees or officials since he left his temporary¨
employment with this publication. However, when JAFFE
went to work at the Columbia Broadcasting System, where he
is now employed as a news reporter, he gave CAREY MC WILLIAMS
as a reference.
In a further discussion of "The Nation", JAFFE
said that "The Nation" was at one time published by FREIDA‍
KIRSHWAY, but that she now acts in an advisory capacity
to this publication. She sold the publication to an
individual named KERSTEIN, according to JAFFE, and
JAFFE believes that this individual is associated with
the Federated Department Stores in Boston, Mass.
It is JAFFE's belief that this man's resources provide
the sole source of financial backing for "The Nation.

advised that
this individual (SAM JAFFE) was recruited by the KGB
about 1962. He said when JAFFE arrived in 1961, the First
Department of the Second Chief Directorate (SCD), which
operated against the American Embassy, and the Tenth De-
partment of SCD, which operated against foreign corre-
spondents, consulted and it was decided that the First
Department would operate against JAFFE for the purpose of
recruiting an American agent moving in American Embassy
circles. ✓ ✓ said that in 1962 or 1963, VYACHESLAV
ALEKSANDROVICH KUSKOV was working with JAFFE, but
did not know if JAFFE was considered as an agent or just
an operative contact. He did know that KUSKOV was meeting
JAFFE and obtained information from him.

called also that JAFFE was used by KGB in connection with
trips of two groups of Americans to the USSR, where they
met with Premier KHRUSHCHEV. The Seventh Department of
SCD, which was working against tourists (of which
the Tenth Department, and the First
Department were all planning work against these groups.
KGB desired to operate agents against them to find out
what was said by them after meeting with KHRUSHCHEV. He
recalled that KUSKOV had been requested to utilize JAFFE
in this connection and furnished information which he had
received from JAFFE. said one group was a group
of businessmen which met with KHRUSHCHEV on 11/6/62 or
possibly 1963, and another group contained some Congress-
men who came to the USSR in connection with the signing of
some treaty pertaining to atomic energy. -5-

of disloyalty. It would appear that this may be a
propitious time to interview JAFFE in an effort to com-
pletely debrief him concerning his contacts with Soviets
during his tour in Moscow and in Hong Kong, as well as
concerning his recent contacts with Soviets in Washington,
D.C. -C-
"
If the Bureau approves interview with JAFFE,
it is contemplated that he will be advised that WFO Agents
desire to renew contacts with him previously initiated by
New York Agents. He will be invited to the Washington
Field Office to discuss in some detail his tour of duty
in Moscow and his contacts with Soviets since his return
to this country. It will be pointed out that WFO desires
to display to him a large number of photographs of Soviets
in this country and in Russia to obtain his comments. If
JAFFE agrees, he will first be requested to describe in
detail his activities in Moscow and in particular, his
contacts with the KGB subsequent to those reported in
January, 1963. He will also be asked if he had any con-
tacts with Soviets while in Hong Kong and if so, to de-
scribe them. Thereafter, he will be requested to describe
´in detail his contacts with Soviets since his return to
this country. During the course of the interview, he will
be shown photographs of KGB officers assigned to the Second
Chief Directorate in Moscow, as well as photographs of
Soviets currently assigned to Washington, D.C. Also during
the course of the interview, it is contemplated that he will
be informed that a Soviet defector has advised that he
furnished information to KGB officer KUSKOV, and he will be
requested to specify what information he furnished. In
particular, he will be questioned concerning the two groups
of Americans who visited with KHRUSHCHEV, concerning which
he made reports to KGB. Every effort will be made to
obtain accurate information from JAFFE as a means of
assessing his potential. If it appears that he is not
candid, it is believed that no further consideration should
be given to utilizing him as an active source, but infor-
mation volunteered by him should be accepted. Also if he

On the evening of 2/5/69,

SA EDWARD F. GAMBER immediately. In SA GAMBER's absence,
he asked that SA GAMBER telephonically contact him as soon
as possible at telephone #657-9774 in Chevy Chase, Md. --
_telephone call was returned.
His purpose in calling was to advise the Bureau that his
employer, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), was in
receipt of 2 copies of a new book entitled "America's
Unelected Rulers of the Council on Foreign Relations"
which was written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY of New Orleans,
La. According to informant, this book lists a number of
people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations
who have subversive backgrounds. The informant is one of the
individuals listed in this book. According to informant,
another section of this book accuses him of being a member
of the American League for Peace and Democracy. The
informant is quite incensed over the information contained in
this book concerning himself and connected the information
contained in this book with his recent recall from Hong Kong
by ABC. He further advised that he has consulted an attorney
about this matter and intends to seek the advice of US
Government officials with whom he is acquainted in WDC. -U-

Infermant advised that he has never been a
member of the American League for Peace and Democracy
although he has been a member for many years of the Council
on Foreign Redations. Informant went on to state that he
wanted to be certain that this would be a matter of record
in Bureau Headquarters as well as the fact that there is not
one word of truth concerning him in the book. Informant
stated that he understands that COURTNEY and her husband
reside in New Orleans, La, and are considered to be erratic
individuals in the area of anti-Communist activity. --
NYO indices contain no information concerning
COURTNEY.
Informant was told to handle any matters of
interest which he wished to call to the attention of the
Bureau through the WFO and to refrain from calling the
NYO in the future unless he was present in NYC. Informant
'then said that he has been in contact with BORIS G. STRELNIKOV,
Pravda correspondent, in WDC, and he could not understand
why he has not been contacted by Bureau agents as he would
like to be of assistance to the Bureau at the present time
as he has been in the past. -
It is the opinion of the NYO that the American
Broadcasting Company has not been entirely satisfied with
informant's work and he was probably recalled from Hong Kong
for this reason. The informant, in turn, has concluded
that his recall was due to some allegation of disloyalty
in view of a comment made to him in Hong Kong by a British
official. The aforementioned book and its contents have
served to confirm in informant's mind that the reason
for his recall from Hong Kong, in fact, stemmed from an
allegation of disloyalty. V.
The above information is being furnished to the
Bureau and WFO for information and the NYO does not contemplate
taking any further action in this matter. -{)-

In order to better assess information provided
by the subject to interviewing agents in New York on 9/13/68,
Legat made certain discreet inquiries of close contacts who
were acquainted with the subject during his stay in Hong Kong.
the United States Information
Service in Hong Kong, related that he was certain that the only
reason for the subject's departure from Hong Kong was that ABC
was cutting back and felt that there was not sufficient
coverage to be afforded this area by them to warrant keeping
a man based here. ☑✓ stated that he took ABC's lack
of providing a replacement for the subject as further evidence
that it was only for business reasons that he was transferredl
from Hong Kong. --

All of the above information came forth as

why ABC had recalled him from Hong Kong. It was not
possible to explore in depth the associations and activities
of

to the short duration of the interview. However, this
former informant expressed a continued willingness. to
cooperate with the Bureau to furnish information on a

in WDC and that he would be going there during the latter.
part of that week. He also advised that while previously
in WDC during the week of 9/9/68, he telephonically contacted
OLEG KALUGIN (KGB employee) and VLADIMIR BOGACHEV (GRU
employee), both of whom are Soviets of interest to WFO.
* Depending upon the location at which
is eventually assigned, it is believed that he should be
further interviewed for the purpose of obtaining information
of interest to the Bureau developed by him during the course
of his assignment in Hong Kong, as well as for the purpose
of evaluating his informant potential on a current basis.
The Bureau and WFO will be advised when informant's new
assignment becomes known. However, should WFO become aware
of informant's presence in WDC and they desire to establish
contact with him, this should be done UACB.

this informant intended to travel to the West Coast of

did return to NYC but was involved in participation on
the American Broadcasting Corp.'s year end news show,
which involved travel on the part of informant in a group

that he was in Washington, D.C. over the weekend of
1/15-16/66 and presumably he is now enroute to his new

Russia's Changing,
Says ABC Newsman
By Rick Friedman
4433
A short while back, Sam Jaffe,
American Broadcasting Con
pany correspondent, was ex-
pelled from Moscow.
A short while from now, hệll
be reporting for ABC out of
Hong Kong with hopes of getting
into Red China.
But for the moment, he's in
the United States between as-
signments, looking back on his
past four years in the Soviet
Union.
Newsman Jaffe made news
this past Fall when he was asked
to leave Russia because John
Scali, ABC diplomatic corre-
spondent in Washington, had
reported an imminent shake-up
m the Russian hierarchy. Rus-
ia responded by sending Jaffe
Home and by cancelling a visa
for George Watson, who was to
replace him.
Sam had already been sched-
uled to leave Moscow on Dec. 1
for a vacation in the United
States before his Hong Kong
assignment.
ABC had both a Russian
translator and a Russian cam-
eraman working in the Moscow
bureau. The network was told it
could keep both of them on the
payroll and keep their rented
apartment in the city.
"They didn't kick out the net-
Work," Sam explained. "They
asked me to leave; they wouldn't
let George Watson in. But they
gave ABC the impression we
might be allowed to put a news
correspondent back in Moscow
in anywhere from three to six
months."
File
√
Changes for Better
Looking back over the past
four years, Sam Jaffe said Mos-
cow changed in that time. "May-
be not as quickly as we'd like
it to," he added. "But for the
better.
"Today, the people know more
about the outside world than"
they did four years ago. The
Soviets are no longer jamming
the Voice of America or the
Russian-language beamings of
the British Broadcasting Com-
pany. But Radio Liberty is still
being jammed.
"There was nothing in the
newspaper about my expulsion.
But the customs officer at the
airport knew all about it. He
heard the news on the Voice of
· Americal
"More and more, the Soviet
citizens, particularly the stu-
dents you make friends with,
tell you what's going on.
with,
"You see more criticism of the
Soviet Union. Young people
write in to the newspaper com-
plaining about the lack of con-
sumer goods and their letters
are printed. The press itself gets
critical of aspects of the govern-
ment."
Sam said that there was no
'direct censorship of printed ma-
terial written by foreign corre-
spondents. But permission was
still needed for shooting tele-
vision film. And undeveloped
photographs couldn't leave the
country. "They make you de-
velop them there and they
screen them," Sam said.
He added that Russia was let-
ting more and more foreign
cameramen in to work for the
networks.

'
Also, that the Soviet news-
men are befriending American
newsmen. "Many of our tips
come from them," Sam went on.
"In some cases, of course, the
tips are deliberately planted by
the government itself.
"We didn't feel any tightening
of restrictions because of the
Viet Nam crisis even though
we got the official propaganda
line about the United States
being the aggressor in Asia."
Sam said the Soviets were
pretty good about letting for-
eign newsmen travel around the
country. But the new leaders
didn't travel as much as the
ousted premier, Nikita Khru-
shchev, and generated less copy.
Knew Nikita
Sam spoke wistfully of the
days when he covered Khru-
shchev, whom the ABC corre-
spondent got to know well.
On one occasion, Khrushchev
ingled him out at an Austrian
Embassy reception in Moscow.
'The Russian leader called Jaffe
yout of a crowd of diplomats and
raised his glass in a toast to the
newsman. Noticing that Jaffe's
glass was empty, Khrushchev
filled it from his own, raised
his glass again and said: "My
best wishes to you."
It was Jaffe who later scored
a world newsbeat on the ouster
of Khrushchev, communicating
the news by a cryptic Moscow-
to-New York telephone call to
ABC.
L
Brezhnev and Kosygin, the
new leaders, play it close to the
vest," Sam said. "After Khru-
shchev's fall, Moscow was a lot,
Muller for us
*
“Khrushɛhev was good copy.
He talked off the top of his
head. But Brezhnov and Kosygin
are more sophisticated and they
don't talk much. So it takes more
time to get stories on what the
government is up to."
Knows Far East
The 36-year-old Jaffe is lock-
ing forward to his new assign-
ment in the Far East, an area
he knows well.
As a 15-year-old Merchant
seaman during World War II,
he sailed the South Pacific.
After the war, he spent four
*months roaming Japan.
Back in the United States,
Sam studied Far Eastern Af-
fairs at the University of Cali-
fornia in Berkeley, then worked
a year in San Francisco as
reporter-rewrite man for Inter-
national News Service. While
there, he was dramatized on
television's "The Big Story" fŵr
solving a murder.
When the Korean War broke
out, Sam went into the Marings
as a combat correspondent.
Following Korea, he became a
staffer for Life magazine and
* researched the religions of Asia
for a series called "The World's
Great Religions."
Sam made another swing
through Asia in 1955 for the
Nation magazine, covering the
Asian-African Conference in
Indonesia. It was there he got
an exclusive interview with Chou
En-Lai, the first given a western
correspondent since the Chinese
Revolution.
Later, Jaffe was one of 18
1 newsmen invited to visit Com
munist China. The trip was
called off because of, opposition
to it from the U.S. government.
1 I'd still like to get into Red
China," Sam said. "When I
interviewed Chou, the Chinese
were worried I would editorial-
ize. I used a question-and-an-
swer format and they were sur-
prised and pleased that I didn't
editorialize.

"They asked me what they
· could do for me. I answered that
I wanted to go to Red China.)
They told me to wait because;
they weren't ready yet."
Sam Jaffe joined ABC int
September, 1961, and was ap-
pointed Moscow correspondent
in November of that year.
Previous to ABC, he spent
six years with the Columbia
Broadcasting Company, cover-
ing such stories as the Moscow
trial of Francis Gary Powers,
the U-2 pilot; the first attempted
coup d'etat of Nasser; and the
kidnapping of the Weinberger
baby in New York.
In June, 1963, Sam married
Elizabeth Jeune Georgeson of
New Zealand in Moscow's
Palace of Marriages. A daugh-
tar, Deborah, was born in Mos
cow in March, 1965.

On January 16, 1966, a confidential source, who has
furnished reliable information in the past, learned that Sam
Jaffe of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was in con-
tact with Oleg D. Kalugin. According to the source, Jaffe
related that he spent the weekend in Washington, D. C., having
come down from New York City for a breakfast engagement with
Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Jaffe said that Rusk was away
and he was, therefore, represented by Under Secretary of State
George Ball. --
Jaffe advised Kalugin that he would return to New
York City on January 17, 1906, but that he would return to
Washington, D. C., on either Wednesday, January 19, 1966, or
Thursday, January 20, 1966, indicating he would pass through
on his way to California. Kalugin suggested they get together
for lunch at that time, and Jaffe said he would let Kalugin
know when he is available. -C-
The source advised that Jaffe inquired as to the
chances of ABC getting back there, which the source inter-
preted as referring to the Soviets issuing a visa to an ABC
correspondent, and Kalugin replied that they would discuss it
at the luncheon engagement. -C-
The November, 1965, issue of the "Diplomatic List,
published by the United States Department of State (USDS),
lists Oleg D. Kalugin as a Second Secretary (Press), Embassy

was interviewed
by SAS JUELL R. NESS and EDWARD F. GAMBER. This interview
was of comparatively short duration and throughout the
interview, this former informant received numerous phone
calls from officials of the American Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) and individuals in the newspaper, TV
and radio industries. The interview was not satisfactory
in terms of obtaining any detailed information of specific
interest to the Bureau concerning Soviet nationals.
An
appointment was made with this former informant for the
evening of 11/26/65, and informant was unable to keep
this appointment due to demands made upon his time by
ABC officials. He has been in the US for approximately
3 weeks and on 12/4/65, he is leaving for the West Coast
of the US, expecting to return to NYC on or about 12/20/65.

This former informant did talk at some length
concerning his expulsion from the Soviet Union. He pointed
out that he advised officials of ABC in NYC on a number of
occasions that ABC's Washington Diplomatic Correspondent
JOHN SCALI was in error when he predicted a shake-up of
the Soviet leadership as a result of a power struggle in the
Kremlin. He said that when he received notice of his expulsion

Interview with informant was of less than one
hour duration and it is certain that informant would be

permitted. Informant was very cooperative and it can be
expected that his cooperation will be forthcoming in the
future when he returns to the US..
Informant left the US on 1/20/65, to return
to Moscow where he will spend one more year as the correspondent
for the American Broadcasting Corporation. It can be

SCALI advised that GEORGE WATSON, an ABC News
Correspondent, was scheduled to begin an assignment in Moscow,
USSR, 11/1/05. Bo said that in connection with this forth-
coming assignment, WATSON had some contact with the Soviet
Embassy and had met 3OBRAKOV a couple of times. He said that
BOBRAKOV indicated to WATSON that he was interested in meeting
some other member of the ABC Staff, and, in particular, was
interested in meeting SCALI. Consequently, SCALI, WATSON, and
BOBRAKOV met for lunch at Paul Young's Restaurant, Washington,
C., ou 9/21/05. SCALI said that for the first ten minutes
or go BOBIAKOV directed bis conversation to WAISON, whom be
had met before and who was scheduled to go to Boscow. ~c-
Thereafter, BOBRAKOV engaged in conversation with
SCALI. SCALI said, that aside from the points mentioned in
the enclosed LIM concerning MILF and the danger of Germany's
obtaining nuclear weapons, BORRAIOV seemed merely to bo
scouting him or sizing him up during the lunch. SCALI could
not detect any effort on BOIRAKOV's part to seek any particular
type of information. SCALI said he pointed out to BOBBAKOV
the unusual situation in which the United States and the
Soviet Union find themselves on the same side at the U. N,
Security Council, endeavoring to koep the peace. SCALI
pointed out to BODRAKOV that this seems to him to be a rather
historic moment. SCALI thought BOBRAKOV might pursue this
matter further and enter into a discussion of Red China, but
he did not do so. -C-
In their discussion of BOBRAKOV's wife's paintings
SCALI suggested to BODHAKOV that his wife might stage a show
of her own in which she would exhibit those paintings by a
Soviet artist painting in the U. S. BOBRAZOV replied that
his wife might do so and suggested that possibly SCALI should
see some of his wife's paintings. SCALE told BOBRAMOV be
would be very happy to see them. fa
In discussing BOBRAZOV's lack of humor, SCALI men-
tioned that at PAUL YOUNG's, where they wore having lunch,
there are bulletins of stock market quocations on each table,
and SCALI made a jocular remirk to BORDAKOV to the effect
that this had been arranged in BOBRAKOV's honor. DOBRAKOV

buy some stock in Soviet industries, but only in those indus-
tries in which the profit motive is now being introduced.
BOBRAKOV, according to SCALI, immediately responded that
there has always been a use of the profit motivo in the Soviet
Union, and proceeded to engage in serious conversation on this
point. - -
SCALI mentioned that when he happened to see BOBRAKOV
again on the evening of 9/21/65, at the celebration at the

In connection with the above, it is noted that the
9/20/65 issue of "Newswock" on page 90 contained on article
captioned "Covering the USSR" which described difficulties
encountered by American television crevs making films in the
Soviet Union, The article stated in part that the situation

The August, 1965, "Diplomatic List" lists Yuri I.
Bobrakov as a Second Secretary, Soviet Embassy, Washington,
D. C.
•
A Confidential Source advised on September 22,
1965, that on the preceding day, he had met with Bobrakov
and engaged in conversation with him. Source stated that
Bobrakov seemed mainly to be. interested in getting across
the idea that the proposed Multilateral Force. (MLF) is a
bad idea and is a stumbling block which is holding up agree-
ment at Geneva on disarmament. He said further that Bobrakov
expressed considerable concern over the danger of Germany's
obtaining nuclear weapons. The Source said he pointed out
to Bobrakov the unusual situation in which the United States
and the Soviet Union currently found themselves on the same
side at the United Nations Security Council, endeavoring to
keep the peace.
Bobrakov, however, had no comment on this point.
Bobrakov told the Source that his wife is an
artist, who now has about twenty of her own paintings, most
of which she has done while in the United States.
In the opinion of the Source, Bobrakov is not very
☐ suave or adept at conversation and may be somewhat uncomfort-
able in dealing with Americans. Source also gained the im-
pression that Bobrakov's sense of humor is almost nonexistent.
Source stated that Bobrakov attended a reception at
the Embassy of Czechoslovakia on the evening of September 21,
1965.

JAFFE's acquaintance with VLADIMIR B.
BARKOVSKY is of such a nature that it might possibly
result in a double agent operation. BARKOVSKY has
made inquiry of JAFFE concerning individuals, groups
and business firms on the West Coast of the United
States who were interested in seeing trade restrictions
placed on trade with Red China eased. JAFFE furnished
some information concerning this to BARKOVSKY, and the
extent to which BARKOVSKY's inquiries along this line will

to put in writing his impressions and analysis of the
political scene in the US, and told JAFFE that he
would pay him for doing this. JAFFE refused the offer.

when news releases were made by the Bureau. He was
advised that an inquiry which he might make through
this office in connection with his employment should
be made through normal channels, and not through
agents to whom he is furnishing information. JAFFE
fully understands that he is not to be the recipient
of any personal consideration in matters of public
interest being investigated by the Bureau. Further-
more, he fully understands the necessity for this,
and at no time has indicated that he expected to be
the recipient of any personal favors.
Inasmuch as JAFFE is being contacted on a
rather regular basis, and has been found to be most
cooperative, this office desires to take steps to
develop him as a PST. It is noted that some steps
along this line have already been taken in order to
capitalize on existing situations, as well as JAFFE's
very favorable attitude concerning these situations.
Bureau permission is requested for this
office to develop JAFFE as a PSI.

If the Bureau so desires, this office believes
that the subject of "The Nation" could be discreetly
and tactfully brought up in the course of a conversation
with JAFFE. This may then be discussed in a
conversational vein serving the purpose of exploring
JAFFE's present knowledge of the staff of "The Nation".
This subject will not be brought up with JAFFE in
'the absence of Bureau permission.
Th
Every opportunity has been taken to acquaint.
`JAFFE with the fact that his relationship with the
Bureau must be held in strictest confidence at all
times. JAFFE has made known the fact on repeated
occasions that information which he furnishes to the
Bureau must be handled in strictest confidence, since if
it became known that he were furnishing information to
the Bureau, his position as a news reporter would be
jeopardized. JAFFE has been told to use the facilities
of a public pay station when telephonically contacting
this office, and that he should not have any personal
contact at the NYO. However, these latter instructions
were qualified to the extent that if in his position
as a news reporter it is necessary for him to contact
'this office concerning matters other than those on
which he is furnishing information to this office, he
must of course feel free to do so. JAFFE has been told
he is not to consider himself to be an employee of the
Bureau and that his cooperation with the Bureau is to
be on a voluntary basis at all times. The Bureau's
labor policy was explained to JAFFE inasmuch as he
is a member of a labor union.

JAFFE has been told that under no circumstances
would the fact that he is cooperating with the Bureau
in furnishing information to the Bureau, place him
in the position of receiving preferential treatment

this subject up with JAFFE, recommendations regarding
contact with JAFFE on this subject should be submitted
to the Bureau upon completion of the remaining lead in
the background investigation of subject. Bulet 12/2/58,
sets forth information with respect to JAFFE's former
association with "The Nation", and states that the
letter is not intended to create/impression that this
office should bring up the question of "The Nation"
in its discussion with him.
Lonely W70
beth-15-59
The WFO has not as yet advised this office
of the results of its check of CIA files for
information concerning JAFFE. Accordingly, this office
has not submitted any recommendation regarding contact
with JAFFE concerning "The Nation". However, in course
of contacts with JAFFE, he has stated that in his
employment with the CBS, he is prohibited from writing
articles for any newspaper or magazine, or doing work
for any other organization without the express
permission of CBS. Therefore, it does not appear that
JAFFE is presently affiliated with "The Nation" in any
respect.
It is obvious through conversations which
interviewing agents have had with JAFFE that he has the
utmost respect for the Bureau, and is extremely
interested in the Bureau's work. He has had contacts
with Bureau personnel on matters related to his .
position as a news reporter with CBS, and he has
spoken of these contacts in a manner reflecting the
utmost respect for the personnel with whom he has had
contact. He shows a sincere appreciation for the
confidential nature of the Bureau's work, and speaks
of the very professional manner in which he has found
Bureau agents conducting themselves as compared to
representatives of other law enforcement agencies with
whom he is in contact.

An informant, who is in a position to
furnish reliable information, advised that subject and his
wife visited his home on the evening of December 31, 1958,
arriving at approximately 8:30 p.m., and departing at
approximately 11:45 p.m. In addition to the
subject and his wife, Nikolai S. Kalinin was also
present. Subject brought informant and his wife a
pictorial book on Russia.
During the evening, Barkovsky told
informant that Deputy Soviet Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan
may visit San Francisco, California, and he wanted
the informant to suggest several groups before whom
Mikoyan might speak in California. Informant told subject
that the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco had among
its members all of the foremost citizens in the San
Francisco community, and he would suggest, if possible,
Mikoyan speak before this club, as well as the
San Francisco Press Club.
Informant also took the opportunity
to tell subject that in a recent conversation with his
father on the telephone, he asked his father about the
identity of business concerns on the West Coast of the
United States desirous of doing business with Red China¿
It is noted that while informant was
in subject's company on December 5, 1958, he asked
informant for information concerning business concerns
on the West Coast of the United States desirous of doing
business with Red China.

that somebody from Washington, D.C. would accompany
Mikoyan for the purpose of inspecting this property,
inasmuch as the Soviets did not get an opportunity to visit
San Francisco too often. Subject mentioned to informant
that he traveled through San Francisco on his way
from Japan to Russia during World War II.
During lunch, subject asked informant
about the information he had obtained concerning
business concerns on the WestCoast of the United States
desirous of doing business with Red China.
C
Informant verbally repeated what he had
told the subject on the evening of December 31, 1958,
mentioning that there were over 700 organizations in the
San Francisco area who favored trade with China. At
subject's request, informant wrote on a piece of paper, the
names of individuals who have spoken in favor of trade
with Red China.
C
The names which he wrote on the paper were
those of James P. Wilson, Manager of the World Trade Department
of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce; George E. Talmage,
Vice President of Pacific Transport Line and States
Lines; John S. Bolles, Head of the Chamber of Commerce's
Industry Committee and Malcolm W. Boyd, Assistant
Publisher of the "Pacific Shipper".
In addition, informant told subject
that "The Dispatcher", official organ of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union endorsed a
policy favorable to trade with Red China.

Red China would help the United States by increasing
trade hän the United States and Russia, as the Russians

The informant told subject that his father
furnished him the names of several individuals who have
spoken in favor of trade with Red China.
Most of the conversation at informant'
home on the evening of December 31, 1958, was of a
social nature, however, subject showed a definite
interest in the information which informant gave to him
about business concerns interested in trade with Red
China, and accordingly, informant arranged to have
lunch with subject on January 5, 1959.
On January 5, 1959, informant did have
lunch with subject, and subject again brought up the
matter of Mikoyan's visit to San Frandsco, and
asked informant for some background information
on the clubs which he mentioned. Informant told subject
that he conversed with his father on the telephone,
over the weekend, and his father agreed that Mikoyan
would do well to speak before the Commonwealth Club
and the San Francisco Press Club.
Subject asked informant about the Union
League Club in San Francisco, and informant told
him that this club merged with the San Francisco Press
Club, although not all members of this club are members
of the Press.
He told subject that the Union League Club
was one of the best clubs in San Francisco, and that it and

made no further request of informant for information
concerning business concerns desirous of doing business
with Red China.
During lunch, subject also asked informant
what the reaction in the United States has been to the
visit of Mikoyan. Informant told subject that it is too
early to tell, as we do not even know why Mikoyan is here.
He told subject that there was too much of a mystery
surrounding Mikoyan's visit and subject then asked informant
if there was not any reaction at all. Informant told
Barkovsky that there was none of which he was aware.
The records of the United States Department
of State reflect that Vladimir Borisovich Barkovsky,
a Soviet National, is Counselor to the Soviet Mission to
the United Nations.
The records of the United States Department
of State reflect that Nikolai Sergeevich Kalinin, a Soviet
National, is a translator assigned to the United Nations
Secretariat.

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,
CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in
New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly, (4)
the Director could not comply with this request:
Jaffe then wanted to know if it would be possible to
lin
interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but
that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad
national picture.
Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.
Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

ReBulet 11/21/58 which authorized your
continued contacts with subject pending completion
of background investigation. As indicated in relet
the Bureau does not desire that you initiate conversation
with Jaffe concerning the "Nation" and this letter contains
additional information of significance in the event a
discussion concerning the "Nation" should rise during
contact of subject by agents of your office.
(U)
A review of "Readers' Guide To Periodical
Literature" shows that subject wrote five articles which
were published in the "Nation" between 12/29/51 and 8/6/55.
He has apparently had nothing published in the "Nation"
since 8/6/55. It is noted that in WFO letter 11/20/58
subject indicated by letter dated 2/22/57 that he desired
to travel to foreign countries to gather information for
"news gathering organizations like CBS News, Worldwide Press
Service and the Nation." In view of this statement by
subject it appears that he may still have some contacts with
the staff of the "Nation."
For your information subject's articles in the
"Nation" are as follows:

"U.S. Naval Intelligence figures were cited for March,
1956. Out of 183 non-communist registered vessels' grossing
1,130,560 tons in trade to and from the Chinese Mainland, 59 were
British vessels, 15 Japanese and the rest European, BOYD pointed
out. By October, 1956 the number of ships had grown to 214 a month,
he said. Of these, 43 vessels were British, 24 Japanese and the

"We trade with Russia and the satellites, why not
China?' BOYD asked.
"You cannot ignore the world's most populated country

Another release dated Tuesday, January 7, 1958, stated
"Unless the United States lifts its embargo and recognizes Red
China it will forfeit control of Asia to the Soviets, JIMA
ROBINSON, NBC news correspondent in Tokyo, warned a meeting of
the San Francisco Area World Trade Association of the San Francisco,
Chamber of Commerce today during a luncheon at the Fairmont Hotel,
"While the Chinese have had little love for the West
there is still time to woo them away from the Russians,! he
continued.

"To do this the U.S. State Department must be realistic
and face up to the fact that the Government of Communist China is
a going concern and that China, with 640 million mouths to feed,
has had only Russia to turn to because of the trade embargo,
"It is an illusion to believe that China is seething
with revolt and that an invasion by the Chinese Nationalists would,
bring the Communist regime to its knees.
"Red China's so-called allegiance to Moscow is scaled:
to her dependency on the Russians for food and machinery.
"Breaking the U.S. embargo would counterbalance
Russia's influence greatly.!
U.S. Bureau of Customs, San Francisco, advise the present
embargo prohibits any American vessel to visit Red China ports.
Exporters to Red China must apply for an export license through
the Bureau of Foreign Commerce, Washington, D.C., and any imports
must be approved by Foreign Funds Control Section, Federal Reserve
Bank, New York City. Customs officials have advised that there is
no U.S. trade with Red China at the present time.
There are being enclosed for the NYO four photostats of

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont
RE: SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aka.
105-28333

***
+
Y
Background investigation of Jaffe was instituted as a result of
his interview on 9-12-58. No derogatory information has been developed
and it appears that all of his contacts with the Soviets have been as the
result of his news-gathering assignments. The New York Office, aware of
the additional significance of Jaffe's former association with "The
Nation," since publishing the article entitled "The FBI," in the 10-18-58
issue of this publication, has requested Bureau authority to maintain
contact with Jaffe pending coverage of one remaining lead involving
review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records in order to receive
information concerning the Soviets with whom he is in contact and as a
follow up of our 9-12-58 interview.
OBSERVATIONS:
acci
It is believed that we should allow New York to continue
contacts with Jaffe and and it is possible that this contact, if properly
handled, may develop a source of information of significance concerning
Soviet officials in New York as well as providing a possible source of
information concerning the article and general policy of "The Nation"
through such contacts as Jaffe may still have on the staff of that (C
publication.
RECOMMENDATION:
(c)
If you approve, there is attached a letter to New York
authorizing continued contacts with Jaffe concerning information of
interest to us concerning Soviet officials and instructing New York to
be alert in their contacts with Jaffe to develop any opportunity that
might arise toward obtaining information concerning the general policy
and personalities that Jaffe may have knowledge of who are presently (C
connected with "The Nation.

Re NY let to BU 9/22/58.
On 9/29/58, Miss MARIE DE VLIEGER, Mail and Files
Clerk, Philadelphia District Office, INS, advised SE E.

office of any ABRAM S. JAFFE, born in Russia about 1893,
having received derivitive citizenship through the natural-
ization of his father who entered the United States about
1894 and was naturalized at Philadelphia.
On 9/29/58, SE PORTER checked the naturalization
records of the USDC, EDPa., Philadelphia, for all persons
names JAFFE who were naturalized during the period from 1890
through 1920. 29 petitions for naturalization by persons
named JAFFE were reviewed and none was found in which the
petitioner listed any child named ABRAM born about 1893.
There is no information in the files of the Phila-
delphia Office which is identifiable with SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE
or ABRAM S. JAFFE.

A review of the Cross-Index Street Directory for 1955 shows
that the name of SAM A. JAFFE was listed for the months of
March and April, 1955, as a tenant in Room 224 of the
Foxcroft Building, 68 Post Street. It is also noted that
these same quarters were listed to "The Nation" (magazine),
and that the same telephone number, YU 2-6030, was listed
to each of the above tenants. No listing was located prior
to March or subsequent to April.
On 10/16/58, MR. 112
Foxcroft Building, advised that the records of his office
show that Room 224, 68 Post Street, was listed to 0.D. Keep
and Associates, publishers of the magazine "Fortnight" during
a brief period in 1955. He stated that O.D. Keep and Associates
went bankrupt and that the firm is dissolved. His records did
not show JAFFE as a tenant and he stated that he assumed that
any tenants listed to Room 224 had some sort of rental arrangement
with O.D. Keep and Associates.
In connection with JAFFE's association with "The Nation,
WFO letter 9/12/55 sets forth information that JAFFE on 9/7/55
claimed he was a permanent correspondent of "The Nation" on the
West Coast. New York may wish to further consider this connection
with "The Nation" on the part of JAFFE in evaluating him as a
PSI.
The records of the San Francisco Police Department,
as made available to IC RAYMOND A. LANGLOIS by
✓ on 10/10/58, show that JAFFE was fingerprinted on
7/26/48 as an applicant for a commercial license private
vehicle and was again fingerprinted on 11/30/54 as an appli-
cant for a press pass, Northern California Correspondent,
North American Newspaper Alliance. There was no additional
record of JAFFE in these files.
There was no record of ABRAM S. JAFFE, JOSEPHINE
CLARK WINTER or JOSEPHINE CLARK JAFFE in the indices of the
San Francisco Office. There was no additional information
regarding SAMUEL A. JAFFE that has not previously been made
available to the Bureau and the New York Office.
