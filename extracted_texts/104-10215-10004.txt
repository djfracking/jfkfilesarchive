SAS Memorandum Dated 14 May 1963
1. Referenced memorandum requested the Subject be provided with
military cover while assigned in the Headquarters area for operational
and credi: purposes in the performance of his duties with SAS. It is
understood that your office was reluctant to issue the Subject the
necessary military cover because he was physically located in a DODA
office which was under commercial cover.
2. As indicated verbally on 24 June 1963, SAS will move the
Subject out of the DODS area on 26 June. SAS has also requested suit-
able office or apartment space through the Office of Logistics from
which the Subject will operate in the future. Until this property is
acquired, the Subject will perform his duties from his home. Conse-
quently, it is requested that immediate attention be given to providing
the Subject with the necessary military cover.
