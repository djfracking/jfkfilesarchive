advised that he had furnished some information which the
believed originated with the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) to FERNANDO GUTIERREZ BARRIOS, the Subsecretary of
Government (Gobernacion), the agency which deported subject.
He believed this was done some weeks before subject was de-
tained and deported He did not recall exact circumstances
but thought perhaps Mr. HARRINGTON, who was coordinating C

with DEA at the time, might have asked him to do this.

In subsequent contact, GUTIERREZ BARRIOS said that
this action was taken because subject was illegally in Mexico

criminal nature which might be considered in violation of
Mexican law. At one point (GUTIERREZ BARRIOS explained it b

"On 23 May 1974 we asked (a high-level source

information that they might have on Sam GIANCANA.

Secretariat of Gobernacion, so it was believed that

never received a reply to this request. In July
1974, however, our contact within Gobernacion told (c]

us that the Government of Mexico (GOM) was expelling
GIANCANA from the country, to the United States,
within 24 hours

"In meetings held with our contact on 23 August,
28 September, and 1 October 1974, we brought up the
subject of GIANCANA., The contract said that the
local immigration authorities had been seeking
GIANCANA because he was in the country illegally.
They finally located him in July, arrested him on
the spot, and deported him the following day. The
expulsion was not carried out on the basis of any
specific information supplied by the US Embassy,
were there any indications that he was engaged in
any criminal activity here. Rather it was an
internal GOM decision to expel an unwanted alien
who was living illegally in Mexico

In further explanation 10/2/74(Mr. MARSHALL said he
now believes (Mr. HARRINGTON had asked him merely to determine (CJ
if Gobernacion had any information on the subject since
MARSHALL believed subject may have been designated by the
Tembassy Narcotics Committee as a so-called "joint target.
He stated he did not believe that he had indicated in any
manner to GUTIERREZ BARRIOS that the embassy thought
was involved in narcotics activities in Mexico. He did
mentioned the possibility that because of emphasis being
placed on narcotics by both governments, high Mexican officials
might have reached the decision that subject should be ex-
pelled because of his widely publicized connections with the
"MAFIA.
